Abstract = {The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is an important
   part of the safety net in the United States, paying means-tested
   benefits to children with disabilities, nonelderly adults with
   disabilities, and elderly individuals. In this article, we describe the
   eligibility criteria for the program, how these have changed over time,
   and the impact of these changes on SSI enrollment. We also show that
   over time, SSI has grown to serve a heterogenous population, with an
   array of life experiences and needs. In this context, we discuss
   potential reforms intended to modernize the program and increase its
   ability to achieve its goals. These include a proposal to raise the
   generosity of benefits for elderly SSI recipients, increase the
   incentive to work among nonelderly adult SSI recipients, and harmonize
   disability decision-making across medical examiners and administrative
   law judges.},

Abstract = {This article advances a practice approach to differentiated
   (dis)integration in European security and defence in light of Brexit. We
   propose that understanding how differentiation in the area of security
   and defence is given meaning on the ground requires examining the
   everyday social practices of officials and military professionals.
   Therefore, we focus on the `low politics' of security and defence
   cooperation in Europe. We do so by entering the diplomatic engine room
   in the EU's Political and Security Committee (PSC). We show how
   arguments that Brexit will either be the ultimate death blow to the EU's
   Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) or that it will be the
   catalyst for deeper military cooperation fail to take account of the
   social dynamics and the historical path of security and military
   cooperation in Europe. Future research on differentiation should pay
   particular attention to how such dynamics play out in the everyday
   social negotiation of meaning among practitioners.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Governments are increasingly turning to new modes of governance to
   induce nonstate actors to voluntarily take responsibility for societal
   problems. Using the concept of responsibilization as a theoretical lens,
   this article analyzes changes in road safety governance in Sweden. How,
   why, and to whom has the responsibility for road safety been attributed
   in Swedish policymaking, and how have state authorities engaged in
   processes of responsibilization during its implementation? The results
   show a shift in attribution of responsibility from individual road users
   to a broad set of so-called system designers, based on moral, causal,
   and preventive rationales. Responsibilization both occurs within the
   state apparatus and is imposed by state authorities on nonstate actors
   using soft governance measures. Responsibilization provides a fruitful
   theoretical lens for governance studies by identifying shifts in
   responsibility (including deresponsibilization), explicating
   normative/ethical underpinnings of new governance modes, and helping to
   open the ``black box{''} of the state.},

Title = {A Woman's Place? An Experimental Study on the Interaction of Gender and
   List-Position Cues in a System with Gender Quotas},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {This research note focuses on the interaction of gender and
   list-position cues in preferential-list Proportional Representation (PR)
   systems in Flanders (Belgium). The list of candidates contains a number
   of heuristic cues that influence voters' perceptions of a candidate's
   competence. Flanders's electoral setting, combining a flexible-list PR
   system with far-reaching quota regulations, provides a good case study
   for exploring this interaction. The results, based on an innovative
   survey experiment, highlight that the list position works the same way
   for women and men. Female head-of-list candidates do not enjoy
   additional advantages in terms of perceived competence. Since
   middle-of-list women do not suffer from reduced esteem, these results
   also contradict the concerns voiced by quota opponents that the use of
   electoral gender quotas will generate the perception among voters that
   parties select less-qualified candidates to meet the quota standards.},

Title = {From Containment to Realpolitik and Back Again: A Realist Constructivist
   Analysis of Turkey-EU Relations and the Migration Issue},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},

Abstract = {The EU's reaction to the migration crisis of 2015-16 was to shower the
   Turkish government with gifts to secure their cooperation on the Aegean
   crossing. This led to accusations of realpolitik after Brussels made
   concessions to Turkey despite Ankara's liberal democratic deficit. This
   article examines EU policy before, during and after the migration crisis
   to argue that the situation is more nuanced than this suggests.
   Turkey-EU accession had been in a state of containment for nearly a
   decade before the migration issue. Brussels' reaction to it raised
   questions about the EU's liberal identity but Brussels backtracked
   quickly once the extent of illiberality following the attempted coup
   d'etat emerged. Turkey-EU relations then returned to a pre-migration
   state of containment whereby Turkey remains a candidate but progress
   towards accession depends on their liberal progress. Using realist
   constructivism, it concludes the EU's liberal democratic standards
   remain, but the liberal bar is pliable according to circumstances.},

Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {This article looks at the development of the resilience approach in EU
   foreign policy. Building state and societal resilience in the EU's
   neighbourhood has been identified as one of the key priorities in the EU
   global strategy. Here we critically analyse these developments and seek
   to provide an account of the complex dynamics within which the EU's
   approach to resilience is located. We argue that EU resilience-thinking
   is influenced by three broad dynamics - the neoliberal and Anglo-Saxon
   approaches to resilience in the sphere of global governance; the
   particular normative discourse of the EU as a certain type of global
   actor (the EU as a normative/liberal power); and the multilevel
   character of the EU with its complex institutional structure and path
   dependencies which results in decoupling. As a consequence, the
   `translation' of resilience constitutes an emergent project at the EU
   level, but also brings with it new challenges. The argument will be
   illustrated through a study of the EU global strategy and the Joint
   Communication on resilience in the neighbourhood.},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {514-546},

Abstract = {A large percentage of women receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy
   Families (TANF) - known colloquially as welfare-have experienced
   domestic violence in their lives, with studies reporting that upwards of
   50\% of welfare recipients have been abused at some point. Receiving
   TANF benefits can provide the financial stability that is necessary for
   a woman to leave an abusive relationship, though some TANF provisions,
   such as child support reporting requirements, may also put victims of
   domestic violence at risk. Under TANF, states may adopt the Family
   Violence Option and waive many program requirements, including time
   limits, work requirements, and child support reporting requirements, for
   victims of domestic violence. Given the importance of TANF for those
   trying to leave, or who have left, abusive situations, this article
   asks: Who represents the interests of these women in the states? To
   answer this question, I employ a mixed methods approach, combining a
   quantitative analysis of the diversity of interest groups in the states
   with a case study of Connecticut and New Jersey. I find that feminist
   and domestic violence organizations do not consistently have a
   significant effect on the adoption of policy accommodations for
   survivors, but these groups are speaking out.},

Abstract = {Combining a Critical International Political Economy theoretical
   perspective with Critical Discourse Analysis, the article explores, from
   the late 1980s to present and across the party-system, the
   characteristics of the discursive construction of Europe in Italy as a
   source of legitimation and naturalization of the country's permanent
   fiscal adjustment and economic restructuring. Through an original
   analysis of the official policy documents enacted by Italian
   governments, I show that the resort to Europe and `risanamento'
   (permanent fiscal adjustment) are discursively constructed, by domestic
   political forces, as legitimating strategies to tackle fiscal profligacy
   and restore growth, notwithstanding the fact that in Italy (1) primary
   state budget has been in surplus from the early 1990s, (2) economic
   growth has been mediocre since the 1990s, and (3) social inequalities
   and macroeconomic imbalances have risen sharply, especially after 2008
   crisis due to prolonged austerity measures. Furthermore, in contrast to
   the literature that sees Italian Europeanization as a pathway of
   virtuous economic and political change favoured by supranational
   integration, I argue that the discursive strategies developed by Italian
   political elites to legitimate change in national political economy
   should be broadly conceived, and analysed, as organic to neoliberalism
   and austerity as international hegemonic projects.},

Abstract = {China's response to the global financial crisis and its post-2008
   stimulus package and credit surge marked a critical juncture for its
   state-directed banking system. One result was the subsequent growth of
   the shadow banking sector marked by incremental `informal institutional
   adaptation' and a greater role for markets. We employ historical
   institutionalist (HI) theory to help explain these developments but
   critique its current approach to critical junctures which has a limited,
   temporarily specific and overly static account of institutional change;
   one which overlooks the importance of changes on either side of the
   critical junctures and which is unable to integrate its emphasis on
   critical junctures with alternative theories, such as incremental
   accounts of institutional change. Using the empirical case of the
   evolution in China's post-GFC banking and finance, a revised
   institutional approach is developed which is able to bridge these
   theoretical divides.},

Abstract = {The 1970s marked the beginnings of a transition to a variegated system
   of international monetary governance that featured a mixture of
   multilateral and minilateral forums with both formal and informal
   characteristics. The emergence of two new forums for international
   cooperation - the Group of Five (G5) and Group of Seven (G7) - alongside
   the legacy organizations of the Bretton Woods conference represented a
   novel and unexpected development. With their emphases on minilateralism
   and informality, the two new forums stood in stark contrast to the
   multilateral and formal International Monetary Fund, which had been the
   focal organization in the international monetary system since the 1940s.
   The new forums were not intended to be durable innovations and yet they
   became quickly institutionalized. This article examines the
   contributions of agency-centered, structural, and institutional theories
   to fuller understandings of patterns of institutional innovation in
   international cooperation and, more specifically, to why the transition
   to a variegated international monetary system took place. Based on
   research in official and private archives, it concludes that informal
   minilateralism emerged incrementally through diplomatic practice in
   response to failures within the formal legacy organizations of the
   Bretton Woods system. It further argues that the new forums produced
   unanticipated feedback effects that enhanced support among member
   governments and contributed to the two forums becoming durable features
   of the international monetary system despite senior government officials
   originally having no such intentions.},

Abstract = {Through a close reading of lip-sewing protests by refugees over the past
   two decades, this article develops a theoretical framework for
   understanding lip sewing as a form of protest and political agency. I
   consider various lip-sewing protests by refugees and the strategic use
   of speechlessness and corporeality in these protests to uncover the
   conditions in which contemporary refugees are imbricated. I argue that
   this unusual form of protest, as well as the demands that protesters
   make on states and international institutions through dissensus,
   reflects the existence of a new kind of refugee that has emerged in
   response to the contemporary refugee management system that criminalizes
   displacement.},

Abstract = {Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian energy company, has major export
   markets in the European Union, but these are changing, challenging the
   established trading principles of Russian gas. The EU promotes switching
   to hub-based pricing, whereas Gazprom, despite adapting to some degree,
   has continued to highlight the advantages of long-term contracts. This
   article analyses the reasoning of selected Gazprom actors from an
   institutional-cultural perspective. Apart from conflicts of interest
   between Russia and the EU, it finds deep-seated differences in
   worldviews and perceptions of appropriate behaviour in trade relations.
   Such factors may play a larger role in decision-making than is generally
   acknowledged.},

Abstract = {In this article, we seek to intervene on the global health security
   debate and attendant literatures to argue that the primary focus of
   global health security - that infectious disease is an existential
   security threat to both humans and vital infrastructures - only tells
   one part of the story about the meaning and significance of biological
   danger in the contemporary context. While important, this perspective
   fails to grapple with the ways that our conception of what biology is
   and what it can do have been altered through advances in science and
   technology, particularly through the intermingling of computer science
   and molecular biology. Starting from the premise that biology has been
   informationalized, we argue that biological exchange is not only a
   threat to humans and the institutional structures they create, it is
   also, importantly, a political and economic opportunity for firms and
   core states involved in global health security, and one of the key bases
   for an emergent global political economy of health security. We forward
   the idea of a somatic-security industrial complex to capture this
   dynamic.},

Abstract = {The governments of Hungary and Poland have been accused of sliding
   toward semi-authoritarianism. Systematic analyses of the responses of
   political actors at the EU level to these instances of alleged
   democratic backsliding are scarce, however. This article therefore
   investigates the responses of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
   to the issue of the quality of democracy and the rule of law in Hungary
   and Poland. On the basis of data on parliamentary questions and motions
   for resolutions, we analyse who puts these issues on the European
   Parliament's (EP's) internal agenda and what positions legislators
   subsequently take in votes on resolutions. We find that both ideological
   preferences and strategic interests determine MEPs' responses to
   democratic backsliding. Our findings are important for research on EU
   responses to democratic backsliding in EU member states as well as for
   the literature on party competition in the EP.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes migratory flows and labor outcomes for temporary
   migrants from Mexico who participate in the H-2A visa program in the
   United States and the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program in Canada.
   Using data from the Mexican Migration Project, we analyze the
   determinants of taking a first trip to each country with temporary work
   documents, the financial and labor circumstances that migrants
   experience while working abroad, and the factors that determine the
   likelihood and amount of money sent home to Mexico as remittances or
   held onto and brought home to Mexico as savings. We find that temporary
   agricultural workers migrating to both countries come from rural
   backgrounds, but those working in the United States earn higher wages
   and experience shorter workdays than those in Canada. Nevertheless,
   total annual work hours and earnings are quite similar for both groups
   of migrants. We observe few differences between the two groups in
   remittance amounts sent home, but find that temporary workers in the
   United States return home with more savings than do those working in
   Canada.},

Abstract = {As support for the agenda of women's empowerment has grown, its remit
   has narrowed. From transforming structural inequalities, donors have
   increasingly focused on women's economic empowerment, and within this
   sphere, specific thematic areas dominate aid programming: access to
   finance, markets, skills training, business development services and
   social protection. This trajectory indicates the persistence of the
   `efficiency approach' to gender programming, despite its inadequacies,
   raising questions regarding how knowledge on women's empowerment is
   constructed. This article examines how the World Bank constructs
   knowledge on women's empowerment by evaluating the design and reporting
   of the project, Results-Based Initiatives. It does so in light of the
   latest manifestation of the `Knowledge Bank' agenda, focused on
   producing and disseminating evidence-based `knowledge products', of
   which Results-Based Initiatives is one example. The article demonstrates
   that the claim that empowerment can be achieved through increased
   competition relies on the exclusion of key works when describing the
   relevant literature; the misrepresentation of the project's methodology
   as objective and value-free; and apparent critical reflection on its
   design. It explains the persistence of the `efficiency approach' to
   gender programming as reflecting the Bank's conceptualization of
   development as a purely technocratic endeavor, and highlights how
   feminist advocates can advance alternatives.},

Abstract = {Research on regulation and regulatory processes has traditionally
   focused on two prominent roles: rulemaking and rule-taking. Recently,
   the mediating role of third party actors, regulatory intermediaries, has
   started to be explored - notably in a dedicated special issue of the
   ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The
   present special issue extends this line of research by elaborating the
   distinction between formal and informal modes of regulatory
   intermediation, in the specific context of transnational
   multistakeholder regulation. In this introduction, we identify two key
   dimensions of intermediation (in)formalism: officialization and
   formalization. This allows us to develop a typology of intermediation in
   multistakeholder regulatory processes: formal, interpretive,
   alternative, and emergent. Leveraging examples from the papers in this
   special issue, we discuss how these four types of intermediation coexist
   and evolve over time. Finally, we elaborate on the implications of our
   typology for regulatory processes and outcomes.},

Abstract = {Indonesia's weak labor movement transformed local wage councils from
   institutions of wage restraint into institutions that delivered generous
   wage increases. This article argues that the arrival of direct elections
   created an opportunity for unions to leverage elections to alter the
   balance of power on the wage councils. Activating that leverage required
   increased contentiousness and coordination among unions. As unions
   mobilized around wages, conflict with capital intensified and produced
   disruptive protests that led incumbents to side with workers. Unions
   also developed innovative tactics to sustain momentum in nonelection
   years. As unions turned the wage councils in their favor, employers
   fought back by shifting the scale of the conflict to the national level;
   the result was the recentralization of wage setting and more modest
   increases. In a global context of ever weakening organized labor, the
   Indonesian case shows how weak unions can gain power by mobilizing
   politically at the local level.},

Abstract = {Few democratic countries have lower rates of female political
   representation than Japan, making it an excellent place to seek clues
   for female underrepresentation. We were surprised to find, based on
   three experimental surveys, that Japanese voters do not harbor
   particularly negative attitudes toward female politicians. The problem
   instead appears to be that women are reluctant to run for office because
   of socially mandated family roles. An implication of our study is that
   gender equality in political representation will likely founder in
   countries with electoral systems that require around-the-clock
   constituency service and legislative work, at least until citizens no
   longer have gendered expectations about time-consuming family
   obligations.},

Abstract = {Surveys have found a persistent gender gap in political knowledge, with
   women knowing less about politics than men. This article tests the
   explanations for the gap using surveys collected in Australia between
   2001 and 2016. The results show that the gender gap in knowledge was
   stable between 2001 and 2007, but declined significantly in 2010, and
   returning to trend in 2013 and 2016. The decline in 2010 is largely
   accounted for by the election of Australia's first female prime
   minister, Julia Gillard, which resulted in women displaying greater
   media attentiveness. The results confirm other research suggesting that
   enhanced descriptive representation of women may help to close the
   gender gap in political knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study investigated citizens' ambivalence toward female politicians
   and how valenced information about the politician helps them resolve
   their ambivalence, making them form polarized attitudes toward the
   candidate. Our study's participants felt stronger ambivalence toward a
   female candidate than a male candidate; those feeling stronger
   ambivalence reported more one-sided thoughts about and more extreme
   evaluation of the candidate, but only when the candidate was a woman.
   Citizens were also more easily persuaded by valenced information to
   resolve their ambivalence about the female candidate. On the basis of
   our findings, we discuss the politico-psychological process underlying
   citizens' ambivalence toward female politicians and how it is related
   with the gender-equal democracy.},

Title = {Funding Empowerment: US Foundations and Global Gender Equality},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although U.S. private foundations provide significant and varied kinds
   of support for women and girls globally, we know little about the scope
   of foundation giving or its effects. In what ways, we ask, has
   foundation funding attempted to promote the empowerment of women and
   girls? An important critique has emerged among scholars and
   practitioners that funding practices often undermine women's activism
   and movements. We study the empirical evidence for this critique,
   examining funding trends internationally in the areas of capacity
   building, issue framing, and coalition forming from 2002 to 2013. We
   argue that there are reasons for both optimism and concern. On the one
   hand, we find that the share of funding for organizations and issues
   that have a political advocacy component has held steady in the past
   decade. On the other hand, we find trends in the opposite direction in
   declining shares of funding for general operating costs, leadership

Abstract = {This article examines how processes of aging, generational shifts, and
   changes over historical time periods shape differences in work values in
   the United States. Our analyses of data from the General Social Survey
   and the International Social Survey Program show that changes over
   historical time periods are most consistently responsible for
   differences in work values. In particular, during recent periods,
   Americans tend to place greater importance on jobs that provide
   security, high income, and opportunities for advancement; this is
   consistent with a narrative that these job rewards have become more
   difficult to attain recently and are thus more problematic for workers.
   Some differences in work values are also attributable to aging or life
   course processes, especially the greater importance placed on high
   income during the mid-life years when family responsibilities are
   generally greatest. By contrast, we find few differences in work values
   among members of different generations or cohorts. We also find that
   people from less advantaged social origins and those with greater labor
   market resources are more likely to value economic rewards.},

Abstract = {In recent times, a conception of history education as facilitating
   truth, remembrance and critical thinking has been positioned as useful
   for transitional justice in divided societies, but this analysis has not
   been extended to settler states which are also characterized by
   prolonged division and state-administered violence. To explore this, the
   article draws on examples from Australia where scholars have been
   extending the framework of transitional justice in order to better
   address the structural nature of injustice in settler states. By
   investigating the uses of temporality and historicization in history
   education, it concludes that while disciplinary models might contribute
   to the popular theses of transitional justice by encouraging students to
   emulate the skills of the historian, these models would likely work to
   strengthen rather than challenge the legitimacy of the Australian
   settler state. Therefore, any attempts to align history education with
   reconciliation in Australia will require a rethinking of current
   disciplinary models.},

Abstract = {Are attitudes toward work and perceptions of the benefits of work
   transmitted from parents to youth similarly across a variety of cultural
   contexts? What determines the centrality of work to one's life? How are
   intrinsic work values (intangible rewards such as autonomy, learning
   opportunities, and self-fulfillment) and extrinsic work values (such as
   status, income, and financial safety) shaped; and how do these work
   attitudes have consequences in the political, economic, and well-being
   domains? Are the determinants of work values robust across countries,
   and do the consequences of having certain work values differ by country?
   These research questions guide this issue of The ANNALS. This
   introductory article clarifies key concepts underlying the volume and

Abstract = {In this study, we ask how work values impact different forms of labor
   market participation of young adults across Europe. We define work
   values as individuals' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to work and
   the value of work as the importance or centrality of work in
   individuals' lives. We use data gathered from young adults in eleven
   European countries in the CUPESSE project to investigate the role of the
   two sets of values regarding employment and self-employment. We then
   replicate our analysis on a larger sample using data from the European
   Social Survey (ESS). Our findings suggest a high importance of
   nonpecuniary benefits for self-employment. Analyses based on both
   CUPESSE and ESS datasets clearly showed the high, positive impact that
   independence and creativity have on self-employment. We also show that
   extrinsic values, such as job security, are more important for employees
   than they are for the self-employed. Additionally, we find that the
   value of work in life does not differ between the employed and the
   self-employed. In sum, these findings suggest that values related to
   self-employment are not rooted in a general value of work, as Max Weber
   postulated in his Protestant Work Ethic nearly one hundred years ago, as
   much as in the aim to achieve personal satisfaction.},

Abstract = {This study examines to what extent extrinsic and intrinsic work values
   are associated with nonelectoral political participation, such as
   signing a petition and taking part in a public demonstration. We examine
   whether individualism and economic factors at the country level moderate
   the relation between work values and political participation. Using data
   from two rounds of the European Social Survey covering thirty-one
   countries (N = 55,927), results show that people who are extrinsically
   motivated are less politically active, while people who are
   intrinsically motivated are more politically active. Comparatively low
   national wealth weakens these relations. Findings also reveal that
   people who highly value extrinsic job rewards are even less politically
   active in individualist countries, whereas people who highly value
   intrinsic job aspects are more politically engaged in those countries.
   Overall, this study adds to understanding who is politically active and
   under which conditions.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of an investment chapter in the Comprehensive Economic and
   Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) has encountered significant opposition, especially in
   relation to Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). In this context,
   the EU has proposed several changes to the traditional procedures,
   including the creation of an investment court. The need to reform ISDS
   has long been recognised, but the key question remains: What is required
   for such a dispute settlement mechanism to have legitimate authority?
   Drawing from insights in legal theory and political philosophy, we
   examine what could be adequate criteria for the normative legitimacy of
   ISDS. We argue that ISDS can only be minimally legitimate if there are
   sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure fair access to the
   proceedings and equal consideration of their interest for all those
   affected by investment tribunals' or courts' decisions. Furthermore, we
   emphasize the need to look beyond what potential beneficial and adverse
   consequences of ISDS are, and explain that the appointment of the judges
   by the state parties and the reintroduction of some control of the state
   parties over dispute settlement outcomes are not sufficient to guarantee
   the normative legitimacy of ISDS.},

Abstract = {Our study offers a comparative assessment of the economic,
   sociopolitical and environmental implications of the world's largest
   source of renewable electricity, hydropower. Theorists from many
   disciplines have questioned both the proper role and ostensible benefits
   from the generation of electricity from large-scale hydroelectric dams.
   In this study, we use 30 years of World Bank data from 1985 to 2014 and
   a research design with three mutually exclusive reference classes of
   countries: major hydropower producers, members of OPEC and all other
   countries. This is precisely so our analysis moves away from
   `dam-centric' or single case study approaches to comparative analysis at
   the international scale. We examine and test six separate hypotheses
   related to (a) military conflict, (2) poverty, (3) economic growth, (4)
   public debt, (5) corruption and (6) greenhouse gas emissions. Our
   analysis lends statistical support to the idea that there is such a
   thing as a `hydroelectric resource curse', although effects were not
   always significant and varied from small, medium to large. The possible
   benefits of hydroelectricity-improved energy access, economic
   development and positive spillover effects-are real, but they are all
   too frequently constrained. Planners, investors and researchers may
   therefore need to rethink their underlying assumptions about how they
   evaluate hydropower's risk.},

   Degrowth?},

Abstract = {In the midst of a wave of market expansion, carbon markets have been
   proposed as the best way to address global climate change. While some
   argue that carbon markets represent a modern example of a Polanyian
   counter-movement to the environmental crisis, we adopt a structural
   interpretation of Polanyi to refute this claim. Carbon markets represent
   a further expansion of markets that fails to address the underlying
   contradictions related to the commodification of nature. In addition,
   they increase risks to society and the domination of economic elites.
   While carbon markets further subject social and ecological relations to
   market mechanisms, we examine degrowth as a possible response to climate
   change that prioritises social and environmental goals over economic
   growth. While degrowth continues to be dismissed as impractical or
   impossible, a growing number of scholars, scientists and activists argue
   it is the only way to address global climate change. In contrast to
   carbon markets, we argue degrowth could represent a genuine Polanyian
   counter-movement in response to climate change. In addition, degrowth
   could help all those disenfranchised by market fundamentalism by
   addressing the triple crises related to the commodification of land,
   labour and money.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {232-255},
Abstract = {The trans-pacific partnership (TPP) has been hailed as a bold step in
   trade diplomacy, a gold standard agreement which not only opens markets
   but also boosts labor and environmental protections. Despite its future
   being put in doubt by the US' withdrawal, the TPP continues without it,
   touted as a model' agreement to shape trade politics in the coming
   years. To understand the rise and fall and rise of the TPP, this article
   analyses it through the framework of new constitutionalism': a set of
   judicial and institutional mechanisms that insulate transnational
   capital from democratic accountability, while also opening up new spaces
   for accumulation and co-opting resistance. Within this framework, the
   TPP is understood as an instrument of crisis management, attempting to
   preserve the rights of capital and stimulate accumulation in response to
   the post-2008 crisis, while also seeking to quell the backlash against
   free trade by addressing labor and environmental concerns. It is this
   duality, however, which undermines the success of the agreement. While
   on the one hand the TPP aims to foreclose progressive options for
   governance, at the same time, it opens up spaces from which neoliberal
   hegemony can be contested, empowering a diverse coalition to challenge
   the agreement.},

Abstract = {Which groups in Central and Eastern Europe are more likely to support
   neoliberal ideas? This article uses quantitative evidence from the
   European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Life in Transition
   surveys (2010 and 2016) in order to sketch the contours of public
   support for neoliberalism in the 11 new member states of the European
   Union. First, cross-country differences in economic attitudes are not
   very large. Second, consistent differences can be located within a
   single country. Neoliberal attitudes are more likely among business
   owners and people with a university education. The potential foundations
   for resistance to neoliberalismcan also be located: churchgoers, for
   instance, are much more likely to be sceptical of neoliberalism.},

Title = {Jharia's century- old fire kept ablaze by crime and politics},
Booktitle = {WILD EAST: Criminal Political Economies in South Asia},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {68-91},
Abstract = {In a sequel to Chapter 1 on coal, this chapter addresses the `negative
   externality' of fire, showing how fire has become an essential input to
   the expansion of il/legal coal mining. It focusses on the damaging
   consequences of a century of unplanned, illegally negligent and
   dangerous mining, of sand for stowage stolen and black-marketed by the
   coal mafia in collusion with public corporations, of criminal pollution
   and lately of the surfacing of subterranean fire laying siege to Jharia
   town and its region. While three separate planning organisations are
   responsible for rehabilitation and resettlement, victims of the fiery
   threat to habitats and livelihoods are progressively and illegally
   disenfranchised by procrastinating state agencies. Some have been
   forcibly evicted. The irony that many disenfranchised workers are forced
   by lack of alternatives to scavenge coal illegally is not lost. The
   assemblage of fire includes complicitous trade unions, all political
   parties which benefit through illegal funds, officials in public
   corporations and government departments, the coal-fire mafia, criminal
   protection forces and illegal workforces. The fluidity of the fire
   assemblage stems in part from egregious conflicts of interest: between
   the coal-fire mafia, which accumulates through the destruction of coal;
   between labour contractors for public sector fire-fighting and
   sand-stowing who are also coal mafia; between compromised leaders of
   labour unions and exploitive interests of the coal-fire mafia; between
   national interests in eviction for capital-intensive opencast mining and
   local mafia interests in corralling a desperate labour force atop the
   fire for hazardous coal extraction and pilferage. The politicisation of
   criminal organisations and of labour and the criminal entwining of
   labour politics with party politics combine to make firecrimes an
   exemplary case of intreccio.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the work of Noberto Bobbio, Chantal Mouffe and
   Axel Honneth (the ideas associated with them will run throughout
   succeeding chapters). These thinkers epitomise contemporary democratic
   socialist thinking by challenging ideas within the socialist tradition
   that have tended to emphasise control of the economic means of
   production over cultural and other aspects of power. Each of these
   writers takes a particular stance on democratic socialism's relationship
   with liberalism and the demands made by individual rights and identity
   politics in the twenty-first century. The impact of technology and
   social media on democratic socialist thinking with be discussed as will
   its relationship to other important political theories (such as Hirst's
   version of associationist democracy).},

Abstract = {Effective communication of information is essential to intelligence
   work. This paper identifies the main obstacles to good communication:
   policy-related challenges; cognitive impediments; resource limitations;
   cultural and structural issues within intelligence communities; and
   technical information. To illustrate, it examines four cases when poor
   communication contributed to intelligence shortcomings. Via
   questionnaire and document survey, the study identifies the current
   state of practice in UK intelligence communities. The survey of
   visualization documents currently in use revealed errors against
   established principles of Information Design. Thus, to ensure better
   handling and dissemination of intelligence, there is a distinct need to
   apply Information Design principles.},

Abstract = {This article considers an episode of the television drama-documentary
   series Spyl, broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1980.
   The programme proved controversial owing to its depiction of a physical
   assault during interrogation at an MIS facility, Camp 020, during the
   Second World War. Numerous 020 veterans complained, pointing out that,
   with one exception, such physical violence had never taken place there.
   As their complaints were largely made in private correspondence with the
   BBC, which stood by its programme, the association of wartime British
   intelligence with physical abuse was allowed to go unchallenged in the
   minds of the viewing public.},

Abstract = {In a true experiment conforming to the criteria of a randomized

   significantly more credibility to secret intelligence than to identical
   open-source intelligence. However, this was true only when the
   intelligence estimate constituted a `complex' problem characterized by a
   high degree of uncertainty and not when the estimate constituted a
   `simple' problem characterized by a low degree of uncertainty. Moreover,
   we found that intelligence analysts are significantly more confident in
   their own assessments when they process secret intelligence and more
   uncertain when they process identical open-source intelligence.},

Abstract = {This contribution explores the origins of the mutation of the concept of
   the `social market economy', from its ordoliberal roots, to its
   contemporary broader meaning, by examining to what extent it was
   influenced by the perennial debate between French dirigism and German
   ordoliberalism. After an initial section defining both concepts, the
   contribution proceeds to unearth long-forgotten conflicts between both
   approaches from the 1960s to the 1980s on European planning, on
   industrial policy and on competition policy. A final section delves into
   the Delors synthesis and the EMU compromise.},

Title = {When Migration Policy Isn't about Migration: Considerations for
   Implementation of the Global Compact for Migration},
Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {33},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The fluid use of the terminology associated with ``migration
   governance{''} can obscure its intention and implications. Different
   meanings of core terminology risks allowing troubling policies that are
   not really about migration, understood widely as border crossing, or
   even more broadly as human movement, to be legitimized. UN-level
   coordination with regard to ``migration governance{''} needs to be part
   of addressing this concern. For example, this article advocates
   explicitly engaging with this risk through the implementation of the
   Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. It considers
   this issue from the perspectives of a handful of countries, each of
   which has its own complex relationship to the compact. It argues that in
   each of these apparently very different contexts, policies identified as
   being directed at ``migration control{''} can be found to be directed
   not at controlling migration but at reconfiguring existing and stable
   state societies along ethnic, racial, linguistic, and other lines. The
   development of implementation plans for the Global Compact for Migration
   provides the opportunity to interrogate the purposes of ``migration
   governance{''} and to find mechanisms to address its hidden uses.},

Title = {Just War and Unjust Soldiers: American Public Opinion on the Moral
   Equality of Combatants},
Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-444},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Traditional just war doctrine holds that political leaders are morally
   responsible for the decision to initiate war, while individual soldiers
   should be judged solely by their conduct in war. According to this view,
   soldiers fighting in an unjust war of aggression and soldiers on the
   opposing side seeking to defend their country are morally equal as long
   as each obeys the rules of combat. Revisionist scholars, however,
   maintain that soldiers who fight for an unjust cause bear at least some
   responsibility for advancing an immoral end, even if they otherwise
   fight ethically. This article examines the attitudes of the American
   public regarding the moral equality of combatants. Utilizing an original
   survey experiment, we find that the public's moral reasoning is
   generally more consistent with that of the revisionists than with
   traditional just war theory. Americans in our study judged soldiers who
   participate in unjust wars as less ethical than soldiers in just wars,
   even when their battlefield conduct is identical, and a large proportion
   supported harsh punishments for soldiers simply for participating in
   unjust wars. We also find, however, that much of the American public is
   willing to extend the moral license of just cause significantly further
   than revisionist scholars advocate: half of the Americans in our survey
   were willing to allow an unambiguous war crime-a massacre of innocent
   women and children-to go unpunished when the act was committed by
   soldiers fighting for a just cause. Our findings suggest that
   incorporation of revisionist principles into the laws of war would
   reinforce dangerous moral intuitions encouraging the killing of
   civilians.},

Abstract = {In 2012, medical regulation in the United Kingdom was fundamentally
   changed by the introduction of revalidation - a process by which all
   licensed doctors are required to regularly demonstrate that they are up
   to date and fit to practice in their chosen field and are able to
   provide a good level of care. This paper examines the implications of
   revalidation on the structure, governance, and performance management of
   the medical profession, as well as how it has changed the relationships
   between the regulator, employer organizations, and the profession. We
   conducted semi-structured interviews with clinical and non-clinical
   staff from a range of healthcare organizations. Our research suggests
   that organizations have become intermediaries in the relationship
   between the General Medical Council and doctors, enacting regulatory
   processes on its behalf and extending regulatory surveillance and
   oversight at local level. Doctors' autonomy has been reduced as they
   have become more accountable to and reliant on the organizations that
   employ them.},

Abstract = {A systematic analysis of formerly classified Soviet Politburo documents
   challenges popular misconceptions about the Soviet withdrawal from
   Afghanistan. The archival evidence indicates that, far from being a
   near-complete and chaotic failure, the withdrawal was based on a
   coherent exit strategy that initially achieved its limited objectives.
   Moscow's strategy enabled Soviet-trained Afghan forces to withstand the
   insurgent offensive and allowed the Afghan government to remain in power
   nearly three years after the Soviet combat forces departed. The
   Soviet-installed Afghan government ultimately collapsed not from
   military defeat or bankruptcy but from internal political strife and
   betrayals. Even though Soviet leaders failed to secure long-term gains
   as their strategy ran out of time, their experience provides relevant
   lessons for U.S. strategy formulation in Afghanistan following the
   withdrawal of U.S. combat forces and is an instructive case that can
   inform theories of great-power retraction from foreign intervention in
   general.},

Abstract = {Regulatory governance involves the use of heterogeneous mechanisms to
   extract welfare gains from market-based processes. While often viewed as
   a depoliticization mechanism, here, we explore a distinctly political
   manifestation of regulatory governance. Our study focuses on the
   governance of affordable housing in England, specifically on local
   authorities' use of `Section 106 ` (S106) powers to compel private
   developers to include affordable housing in new developments. We show
   that, following the financial crisis, the governance of affordable
   housing shifted from a partisan to a valence issue. As the crisis
   increased the issue salience of affordable housing, left-wing
   authorities' hitherto higher tendency to intervene was eroded in the
   midst of a broad-based increase in S106 deployment. In addition to
   extending insights into the political economy of regulatory state
   intervention, our findings shed valuable light on the undersupply of
   affordable housing in England.},

Abstract = {Managerialism has become increasingly incorporated into the practices of
   international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in recent decades.
   To date, IPE has largely failed to examine how and why the managerial
   ethic has weaved itself into the fabric of prominent INGOs that have a
   stake in the global economy. The limited IPE literature that has
   addressed such activity has either cast such changes as part of a
   culture of professionalisation or as an outgrowth of neoliberalism. This
   article seeks to question these readings by directly dissecting how
   managerialism operates within a milieu which has been historically
   critical of capitalism. The argument is underpinned by conceptual
   insights from critical management studies, particularly how
   managerialism is associated with instrumental rationality and control.
   In relation to international development policy, the article examines
   the major macro institutional and ideological factors that have
   encouraged the spread of managerialism. To deepen our understanding of
   these trends, the article offers new empirics on the struggle over
   managerialism within Oxfam GB, from a limited imprint in the 1980s to
   increasing normalisation from the early 2000s. The article calls for IPE
   to better unmask the internal politics of INGOs and, in turn, connect
   such evidence to wider structural tendencies.},

   of what is governed by the market, but also in terms of the spaces in
   which the practices of a given market apply. However, there have been
   important challenges to market expansion, particularly on political and
   ethical grounds. This paper analyses how the socio-technical practices
   of market expansion can be affected by political contestation and
   individual moral judgements. This is analysed in the context of two
   markets for biodiversity offsets, in the United States and England. In
   both cases, regulators attempted to devise and standardise calculative
   mechanisms and socio-technical practices that promoted the use and
   expansion of the market. However, these socio-technical market practices
   have struggled to cross and negotiate uneven political and social
   spaces, being subject to moral judgements and political contestation.
   The paper demonstrates how the socio-technical practices of market
   expansion are affected by social entanglements, highlighting how this
   creates limits to the expansion of the market as a form of governance.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the EU interacts with other international
   organizations (IOs) with regard to human rights protection. Although
   studies on relations between IOs, namely inter-organizational relations
   (IOR), have attempted to overcome a state-centric tendency, existing IOR
   approaches are not suitable for analyzing human rights issues due to
   their indifference to law. To overcome this flaw, this article
   introduces the notion of `inter-organizational contestation' to account
   for the human rights implications of EU policies. This concept is
   applied to two contrasting cases: first, the EU's asylum policy, over
   which the EU is contested by other IOs; second, the implementation of
   targeted sanctions, over which the EU contests another IO. The article
   thus highlights the EU's ambivalent profile in human rights protection
   and contributes to the IOR literature.},

Abstract = {In 2017 Twitter released a list of 2,752 accounts believed to be
   connected to state-sponsored Russian operative manipulation of the 2016
   American Election. We investigate the behaviour of these accounts in the
   UK-EU referendum using our own unique longitudinal Twitter dataset. We
   identify Brexit-related content from 419 of these accounts, totalling
   3,485 tweets between 29 August 2015 and 3 October 2017. While these
   accounts were primarily designed to resemble American citizens, accounts
   created in 2016 contained German and Italian locations and terms in user
   profiles, suggesting targeting of wider international electoral
   processes. Brexit was one of many targets, likely indicating coordinated
   repurposing of `troll' activity over time. We analyze behavioural shifts
   in account behaviour in relation to external events, introducing a
   temporal dimension not typical of political Twitter studies. The `troll'
   account behaviour altered radically on UK-EU referendum day, shifting
   from generalized disruptive tweeting to retweeting other troll accounts
   to amplify their effect.},

Abstract = {This article aims to gain a better understanding of EU INTCEN's analytic
   culture and the use of structured analytic techniques by EU analysts; an
   under researched topic in the intelligence studies literature. The
   Intelligence Analysis and Situation Centre of the European Union (EU
   INTCEN) is a directorate of the European Union External Action Service
   (EEAS) that has been characterized as an EU analytic structure similar
   to the State Department's INR. The article reviews relevant literature
   and presents findings based on the analysis of a questionnaire on
   `Intelligence analysis and production in EU INTCEN/SITCEN, that was
   distributed to EU INTCEN intelligence analysts (EEAS officials having
   worked as analysts in EU SITCEN/INTCEN between June 2005 and June 2014),
   and in-depth phone interviews to better understand INTCEN analytical
   process. Analytic projects at EU INTCEN are initiated with Requests for
   Information to which replies can be received. The analysts count as well
   with previous contributions and assessments, open sources, and
   diplomatic reporting. Among other findings, the study reveals that SATs
   are little used in practice in spite of most EU INTCEN analyst has
   received some training on SATs.},

Abstract = {European and national policy-makers have highlighted the role of the
   cohesion policy in smoothing the effects of the crisis during the
   programme period 2007-13. To support these claims, however, specific
   evidence is needed. This article studied the relations between the
   absorption of the EU funds and regional labour markets in Italian
   regions during the Great Recession. By applying different panel data
   models to new data on cohesion policy, three main results were achieved.
   We found that the cohesion policy made a contribution to the resilience
   of Italian regional labour markets. Yet the short-term consequences of
   the cohesion policy on regional economies were conditional on the
   heterogeneous quality of regional institutions. We also found that the
   policy changes introduced in Italy during the crisis increased the
   effectiveness of the cohesion policy. The analysis was controlled for
   endogeneity issues and alternative specifications.},

Abstract = {To what extent do independence-seeking political parties across Europe
   appeal to the European Union (EU)? What accounts for differences in
   these parties' communication levels? In accordance with the literature,
   we expect that such parties would bypass their host states and seek
   support from the EU for their nationalist causes, while the EU itself
   also offers institutional opportunities further enabling parties to
   solicit assistance, even if it does not always deliver what these
   parties want. To explore this argument, we conduct an online search for
   documents and other texts in which secessionist political parties
   directly and indirectly appeal to the EU and analyze them with social
   network tools. The resultant network is characterized by multiple
   parties communicating to the EU but to different degrees. We also find
   that moderate political ideology on the left-right spectrum, constituent
   support, and competition in the secessionist movement positively and
   significantly correlate with higher intensity of online communication.},

Abstract = {The paper provides a critical assessment of disaster risk reduction
   (DRR) and resilience strategies in Cambodia with reference to
   resilience. The paper argues that resilience is a part of and correlated
   to the localised practices of a specific form of neoliberalisation in
   and of Cambodia. As a result, disaster risk strategy is a potential
   means of managed neoliberal state-led intervention capacity in
   sub-regions to pre-empt and manage particular forms of land and social
   conflict. The paper links current state-led resilience policy to the
   Cambodian government's increasing interest in ensuring land for
   infrastructure connectivity as its national development plan in the
   context of regional economic integration.},

Abstract = {This article explores patterns of remittance sending among male and
   female migrants from Mexico to the United States, and patterns in the
   use of remittances among receiving households in Mexico. It also
   identifies variables that determine remittance sending and saving
   behaviors in migrants' most recent U.S. trip. Results reveal gendered
   differences in the investment and consumption strategies adopted by
   families in communities of origin. Despite marked differences in the
   capacity of women to generate remittances and savings compared with men,
   patterns of remittance use by families in communities of origin are not
   substantially distinct, though female migrants are more likely to send
   remittances for investments in human capital than male migrants. In
   addition, remittances and savings sent by male migrants are more likely
   to be used in housing improvements and investments in productive capital
   than those sent by women. These differences do not necessarily reflect
   migrants' preferences, but mirror the sociocultural contexts in which
   decision-making about remittances, savings, and spending take place.},

Abstract = {Works on whistleblowing are overwhelmingly found within disciplines such
   as business ethics, law, and the professions. Despite its undeniable
   political and social effects, it is surprisingly understudied in
   political science and sociology. Recent cases such as those of Chelsea
   Manning, Edward Snowden, Christopher Wylie, and the Panama Papers should
   prompt political scientists and sociologists to engage systematically
   with the phenomenon. This article offers a theoretically driven
   discussion of three complementary questions. (1) What kind of political
   action is whistleblowing? (2) What are its historical, social, and
   political roots? (3) How is the practice shaped by digitalization and
   big data? In relation to the third question, the article argues that
   digitalization amplifies social complexity and challenges democratic
   steering. Building on Niklas Luhmann, Ulrich Beck, and Jeffrey
   Alexander, it lends theoretical weight to the argument that
   whistleblowers are likely to play an increasingly pronounced political
   role as digitalization accelerates.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed the rise, across a wide range of
   countries, of political institutions designed to promote gender equality
   and women's political representation. Existing studies have shown how
   international diffusion processes have contributed to the adoption of
   two kinds of such institutions - gender mainstreaming and gender quotas.
   Mounting evidence suggests that institutional reforms within
   legislatures constitute the latest wave of gendered institutional
   reform. This article identifies and explains trends in the adoption of
   one kind of gender-focused parliamentary institution - women's
   legislative caucuses (WLCs). We use a discrete time duration model to
   assess the effect of several factors on WLC establishment. While there
   is theoretical room to expect diffusion, structural and institutional
   variables to affect the likelihood of caucus adoption, we find the
   strongest empirical support for diffusion and institutional factors. A
   parliament's likelihood of adopting a WLC rises when sub-regional peers
   have created WLCs, when women's international non-governmental
   organizations are active in the country and when the country has
   implemented a gender quota. Understanding the factors that affect the
   adoption of gender-focused parliamentary institutions is critically
   important, we argue, since such bodies provide space to confront
   masculinized institutionalized rules and norms.},

Abstract = {How is it that regardless of the reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty
   to better contain European integration in areas of core state powers,
   `competence creep' can continue? What is the underlying cause? And why
   is it problematic? This article proposes answers to these questions
   through a systematic (re-)conceptualization of the problem of
   `competence creep', arguing that it results from the cross-cutting
   governance that is the legal Leitmotif of European integration as well
   as from `two-level games' of national governments, and that it is
   problematic from the viewpoint of democratic legitimacy. However, it
   argues that the one form of competence creep that is most commonly
   understood as the core problem, and on which most reforms have focused,
   namely indirect legislation in areas of Member State competence, is
   actually the least worrying type of covert integration; negative and
   parallel integration, soft law and co-ordination are all far more
   problematic.},

Abstract = {Research on the impact of gender quotas in open-list proportional
   representation systems has described quotas as ineffective or even
   paradoxical. While some authors argue that gender quotas without a
   placement mandate will be essentially ineffective since most women will
   be nominated to unpromising positions, others suppose that women will be
   disadvantaged by gender quotas because the increase in the number of
   female candidates will decrease the average number of preferential votes
   cast for women. We reexamine the evidence for these claims by analyzing
   the case of Poland. We demonstrate that the gender quota introduced
   there in 2011 increased the number of women placed at promising ballot
   positions and had very little impact on the number of preferential votes
   cast for women. Additionally, using simulations, we show that the quota
   had a positive impact on the number of elected women.},

Abstract = {Engaged care in the family and small organizations can and should be
   leveraged in order to develop extended care, which is a crucial element
   of social and political life. However, care in politics can also be
   dangerous in its partiality and its propensity to control. A critical
   engagement with the writings and activism of Jane Addams and Charlotte
   Perkins Gilman, contemporaries negotiating the relationship between
   women's familial roles and their social and political citizenship,
   reveals the ways in which care can be deployed to strengthen democratic
   commitments as well as the drawbacks of care in politics.},

Abstract = {Feminist peace research is an emerging field of social sciences that is
   transdisciplinary, intersectional, and normative-as well as
   transnational. Although it draws from disciplines such as peace and
   conflict research (in and outside of international relations {[}IR]) as
   well as feminist security studies, it also differs from them in terms of
   research scope and research design. Consequently, it not only provides
   insights on what can be termed spectacular instances of violence or
   peace but also sharpens our analysis of the everydayness of
   reconciliatory measures and the mundaneness of both violence and peace.
   As a feminist endeavor, feminist peace research necessarily asks
   questions about unequal gender relations and power structures within any
   given conflict environment. In this collective discussion piece, a
   diverse group of scholars, who formed part of the recently convened
   Feminist Peace Research Network, explores and further develops the
   parameters of this emergent field through a set of short conversation
   pieces.},

   Following the Fund over its first six years, I ask how different forms
   of gender expertise shape this multimillion-dollar grant programme. I
   find that bureaucratic pressure to prove `measureable' impact and
   navigate the United Nations system led the Fund to replace early
   `feminist funding' expertise with `development expertise'. My account
   underscores that expertise must be understood as dynamic and political,
   changing over time, and taking on new meaning even within a single
   institution.},

Title = {Using Big Data to Demonstrate Indivisibility of Rights and Promote
   Cross-Sectoral Responses to the Sustainable Development Goals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {In this research we explore the meaning of the indivisibility of human
   rights in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We
   draw on Big Data, using integrated administrative data sets and mapping
   of social deprivation in New Zealand, to explore the uptake of a `free'
   health service for children. The data show that people living with
   multiple deprivations are less likely to take advantage of health checks
   for their children than people with fewer deprivations. This suggests
   that in order to improve child health, action is required across various
   social domains to address the multiple hardships that limit people's
   capacity to access health care; simply making a health service more
   available is an inadequate policy response. Viewed as a matter of human
   rights, these findings are a practical demonstration of the
   indivisibility of human rights: the right to health cannot be fulfilled
   when other social rights (information, education, housing, adequate
   standard of living, and nutrition) are unfulfilled. In the context of
   the SDGs and health, achieving SDG 3.8 (universal health care) similarly
   depends on the other SDG targets being met. This leads us to suggest
   that in well resourced settings, Big Data could enhance SDG
   accountability mechanisms by providing a consistent focus across all SDG
   targets on the same group of people in any country: those who are left

Abstract = {This article reflects on whether the erosion of democracy in the
   contemporary United States can be halted. Using the cases and
   conclusions from McCoy and Somer's eleven country collective project, it
   argues that democracy's decline is not inevitable. A case for cautious
   optimism emerges from analyzing the coalitions around democracy's
   disassemblers and democracy's defenders. The actors disassembling
   democracy have activated cleavages and adopted a style of rule that
   exacerbates fault-lines on the Right. The actors defending democracy
   have thus far done what's needed to eventually build the sort of winning
   coalition that has proven successful elsewhere. Creating broad,
   cross-class networks, mobilizing peaceful protest, and drawing on mass
   values that are still supportive of democracy bolster the likelihood of
   successful defense.},

Abstract = {In the following chapter, the necessary historical perspective to the
   examined problem will be presented. If we are to fully comprehend and
   understand the capabilities and space policies adopted by the different
   European actors, it is necessary to get a grasp of the process first
   that led to the current position of the continent in the outer space.
   The analysis below thus deals with two interrelated topics. At first,
   the development of the European integration process in the context of
   the post-Second World War geopolitics will be presented. A description
   of this development is necessary for the comprehension of the political
   and institutional limits and advantages that reflect themselves not only
   in a selection of the direction of the European space policies but of
   the European geopolitics in a broader sense. This establishes a context
   inside which the space development must be understood. As noted
   previously, space geopolitics is a reflection of the terrestrial
   geopolitics, and the position of Europe is no exception. The second
   section of this chapter will deal with the development of the different
   European space initiatives in the context of the development of the
   outer space capabilities on a global scale. The historical analysis will
   be divided into three periods that follow the division made earlier in
   the text-the beginning of the space age until the end of the Apollo
   lunar mission, the post-Apollo development until the end of the Cold
   War, and the 1990s and onward. Every era will be presented from the
   global outlook followed by the specific events that took place inside
   the European space program.},

Abstract = {The chapter charts the impact of the 1980s on the national right-to-life
   movement, beginning with the 1988 election and the myth-making that
   burnished Reagan's legacy. It summarizes the fortunes of the various
   factions within the anti-abortion movement, exploring why some elements
   were on the margins by the end of the decade. It then analyzes how the
   lessons of the 1980s shaped the movement's goals, activism, and lobbying
   in subsequent decades. In 1992, the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental
   right to legal abortion, but the movement did not abandon democratic
   engagement and its political focus. Instead, symbolic approaches gained
   even more significance, as did the state legislatures. The chapter also
   explores the ways that partisan politics has served to perpetuate the
   polarized status of abortion in the contemporary United States, and
   illuminates some of the tensions at the heart of the enduring alliance
   between the Republican Party and the prolife movement.},

Abstract = {Diverse scholars have argued that standards and performance measurements
   are ``instruments of control{''} that have a profound influence on the
   day-to-day lives of individuals and organizations, causing constitutive
   effects. Regulatory bodies increasingly use standards to oversee and
   monitor the regulated. This paper discusses the Dutch Health and Youth
   Care Inspectorate's use of both standards and a performance measurement
   system introduced to monitor how Dutch hospitals investigate and learn
   from serious adverse events. Rather than focusing on how standards
   affect regulated practices and organizations, our study examines how the
   use of these instruments affects the standard maker, that is, the
   Inspectorate. We explore how the Inspectorate's work practices,
   standards, and coupled performance measurement system influence its
   regulatory pedagogy, reviewing practices, and decisionmaking. We
   conclude that standards and performance measurement systems are not by
   definition ``instruments of control{''} as their constitutive effects
   are (under)determined by the relationships in which they are enacted.},

Abstract = {This article considers the relative advantages of alternative enterprise
   forms in finance from the point of view of public accountability. The
   business corporation is compared to the state agency or authority, the
   cooperative, the state corporation, and the charitable nonprofit. These
   forms can be distinguished according to whether they aspire to enhance
   general electoral democracy or stakeholder democracy and whether their
   democratic controls operate directly or indirectly. The article suggests
   that the indirect democratic forms may be more promising than the direct
   ones. It also argues that the project of democratizing finance depends
   on the development of practices of multifactor or ``dialogic{''}
   performance assessment. Such practices must be institutionalized through
   public or private organizations that extend across firms.},

Abstract = {In the 1950s-1970s inward foreign direct investments (IFDI) were widely
   seen as a menace, threatening to undermine national economic
   development. Two decades later such concerns had virtually disappeared.
   Rather than as a problem, IFDI were now portrayed as a solution - even
   symbols of national economic success. To better understand the
   ideational dynamics underlying this remarkable transformation in
   perceptions of IFDI, this research traces the evolution of economic
   discourses in the United Kingdom over the post-war period. Deviating
   from conventional accounts in constructivist IPE, the investigation
   indicates that the rise of first-generation neoliberal discourses in the
   1980s played only a secondary role in these processes. Instead, the
   discursive re-shaping of IFDI was primarily driven by the rise of the
   narrative of national competitiveness in the early 1990s - a discourse
   inspired by managerial rather than neoclassical economic theory.
   Building a framework that prioritizes (multinational) firms over
   national economies, the rise of this second-generation neoliberal
   narrative played a critical role in promoting now taken-for-granted
   imaginaries of the global economy as an economic `race' between
   nations-as-platforms-of-production. The findings highlight the
   ideational underbelly of the rise of the competition state and how it
   re-shaped dominant social representations of IFDI.},

Abstract = {Through a comparison of typical and deviant cases, this study probes and
   refines the augmented power model which argues that the structural power
   of the financial industry fosters its instrumental power in influencing
   regulatory reforms under certain scope conditions. It shows the
   industry's success in influencing policymakers to authorize
   municipalities to use derivatives and thereby to financialize their debt
   management in the US (typical case). The failure of banks to acquire
   such a law in the UK (deviant case) reveals a hitherto little-noticed
   condition under which this power explanation collapses: states' fiscal
   and monetary constitution. We demonstrate that analyzing the operation
   of finance power requires a precise consideration of how states' fiscal
   and monetary constitution structures governments' responses to financial
   industry's regulatory preferences. Moreover, we conclude that
   synthesizing business power research with literature on the mutual
   dependence between states and finance helps to explain patterns of state
   financialization.},

Abstract = {Based upon interviews and ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Kazan
   (Tatarstan, Russia) and ?r?mqi (Xinjiang, China), the article proposes
   an explanatory framework consisting of structural and agential factors
   to address how and why normative and implemented bilingualism may differ
   across ethnically based autonomous regions. It argues that higher
   inter-ethnic integration can boost the capacity of titular elites to
   bargain with the centre, leading to more formal recognition of the
   titular language, even if not immediately augmenting its use in daily
   life; conversely, a more pronounced inter-ethnic divide can serve to
   sustain more vigorous informal use of the titular language, while at the
   same time impeding improvement of its formal status.},

Abstract = {In recent years IPE and EU studies scholars have examined how actors in
   international organisations and EU institutions shape policy ideas. This
   article explores the professional structure of economists affiliated to
   two Brussels-based think tanks, Bruegel and CEPS, who, in the context of
   the Eurozone crisis, sought to contribute to the production of policy
   solutions to douse the flames of the crisis and put forward long term
   recommendations for the EMU?s stability. Through the analysis of more
   than 300 CVs and by drawing on network and sequence analysis, the
   article shows that in their search for solutions, Brussels-based think
   tanks bring together economists from different EU member states, whose
   authority draws on academic qualifications, experience, and seniority.
   They are ?multiple insiders? connected to a wide range of institutions
   and professional networks, who move back and forth between professional
   and organisational networks and serve as bridges between revisionist,
   orthodox, and mixed economic ideas.},

Abstract = {The terms ``decolonization{''} and ``Cold War{''} refer to specific
   processes and periods in the international system, but they do not
   capture the full agency of local actors such as Vietnamese Communists.
   Based on recently available archival materials from Hanoi, this article
   maps those terms onto Vietnamese Communist thinking through four
   specific cases. The declassified materials underscore the North
   Vietnamese leaders' deep commitment to a radical worldview and their
   occasional willingness to challenge Moscow and Beijing for leadership of
   world revolution. The article illuminates the connections (or lack
   thereof) between global, regional, and local politics and offers a more
   nuanced picture of how decolonization in Southeast Asia in the
   1950s-1980s sparked not only a Cold War confrontation but also a
   regional war.},

Abstract = {Global commodity and capital markets have undergone dramatic structural
   changes associated with financialization. But, in spite of this, the
   literature on financialization neglects questions about market
   structure: What happens when exchanges cease to be non-profit
   trade-enabling utilities and instead become for-profit firms? How have
   automation, derivatives, and competition between exchange platforms
   affected transacting in markets? Who mandated the market-structural
   revolution? This article breaks new ground by examining the political
   economy of market-structural financialization through an evaluation of
   the 150-year-old London Metal Exchange (LME). The findings challenge
   theories that present financialization as a deterministic and
   undifferentiated process. The LME, a commodity market once designed by
   merchants to support the global metals trade, has been reinvented for
   the benefit of algorithmic traders and speculators. However, far from
   reflecting teleological market progress or technological determinism,
   the LME's evolving market structure can only be understood through its
   particular historical-institutional heritage and a continuing
   distributional struggle between traditional metal merchants and
   financial institutions. Thinking about financialization through
   fine-grained analyses of market-structural change, and of the ways in
   which financial engineering is driven by ground-level politics, can
   explain why the process of financialization varies even between markets
   that are situated in common national and ideational contexts.},

Abstract = {We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a
   composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world
   along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index
   was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091-1110, 2006) and
   updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index
   distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different
   dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial
   globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use
   time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43
   instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher
   (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091-1110, 2006), we use the new index to
   examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results
   suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic
   growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation
   Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and
   why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as
   South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be
   downloaded from .},

Abstract = {What policies could mobilize business support for progressive and
   durable national climate policy in the United States? I examine the
   climate policy experiences of U.S. states and propose that a national
   clean energy standard combined with carefully allocated public
   investment in clean energy infrastructure and innovation could mobilize
   economic interests in support of decarbonization. Further, I argue that
   the more entrenched clean energy and infrastructure become, the more
   likely it becomes that comprehensive climate policies can be passed in
   the future. This includes performance and deployment mandates beyond the
   electricity industry, including in the transport and building sectors.
   These initial steps may also help to build a winning coalition for
   progressive federal carbon pricing, as opposed to an accommodative
   coalition in support of weak carbon pricing.},

   the localization of financial inclusion in Kenya and Nigeria},

Abstract = {Despite powerful pressures for convergence towards global financial
   norms we do not see uniform outcomes across the globe. Instead, local
   agents seek to adapt foreign agendas to local conditions. While
   scholarship has illustrated the localization of global norms, we still
   lack a systematic understanding of why certain localized norms emerge
   and how we can explain agency in the face of pressures for policy
   convergence. I offer an analysis of the spread of the financial
   inclusion agenda to highlight the role that ambiguity in global
   financial norms and the structural dependence on capital play in
   explaining the emergence of specific localized norms. Using case studies
   of central bank promotion of financial inclusion in Kenya and Nigeria, I
   argue that the ambiguity of the concept of financial inclusion made it
   compatible with the pre-existing beliefs of local central bankers and
   helped them to navigate their socio-political environments to implement
   their preferred vision of financial inclusion. The cases also show that
   while ambiguity enhances agency, the structural dependence on capital
   constrains it. More broadly, the study highlights the constructive role
   ambiguity may play in the spread of financial norms and the agency
   developing countries may exercise in their engagement with global norms.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes China's and India's role as emerging rulemakers in
   one of the most contested fields of international cooperation: labor
   mobility. It shows how both countries have seized the trade venue to
   negotiate labor mobility clauses that go well beyond the original
   preferences of established powers. Whereas India's more vocal claims
   have faced resistance, China's success in concluding far-reaching
   bilateral deals with Western countries is explained with stronger
   domestic regulatory capability and capacity. Maintaining a technocratic
   approach in trade negotiations, supported by the centralization of

   synchronizing external commitments with domestic reforms, China has been
   able to convey its market power into regulatory influence. As a result,
   the global standard for negotiating mobility in trade agreements has
   risen - notwithstanding the enduring stalemate at the multilateral

Abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is
   one of the most advanced global climate governance arrangements and we
   show that it contributes to the buildup of autonomous capacities and
   reliable procedures in areas of rather limited statehood. These
   partially unintended effects can be conceptualized as an increasing
   rational-legal bureaucratization, which has been initiated through both
   external and domestic actors as we illuminate in the case of Indonesia's
   forestry sector in the period from 2007 until 2017. Our finding is that
   a bureaucratization of a new kind is increasingly strengthened in
   Indonesia's forest despite enduring patterns of neopatrimonialism,
   emerging signs of new public management approaches, and the
   strengthening of functional equivalents such as community-based forest
   management. We thus claim that Max Weber's perspective on the prospects
   and problems of rational-legal bureaucratization is still valuable, even
   when travelling to the tropics.},

Abstract = {This article explains how Latin American governments responded to the
   Cuban revolution and how the ``Cuban question{''} played out in the
   inter-American system in the first five years of Fidel Castro's regime,
   from 1959 to 1964, when the Organization of American States imposed
   sanctions against the island. Drawing on recently declassified sources
   from Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and the United States, the
   article complicates U.S.-centric accounts of the inter-American system.
   It also adds to our understanding of how the Cold War was perceived
   within the region. The article makes clear that U.S. policymakers were
   not the only ones who feared Castro's triumph, the prospect of greater
   Soviet intervention, and the Cuban missile crisis. By seeking to
   understand why local states opposed Castro's ascendance and what they
   wanted to do to counter his regime, the account here offers new insight
   into the Cuban revolution's international impact and allows us to
   evaluate U.S. influence in the region during key years of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {This article uses interviews with inhabitants of Crimea to analyse
   individual-level narratives surrounding the annexation of the peninsula
   by Russia and locate these narratives in relation to recent research on
   changes in Ukrainian identity discourse. It investigates how the trauma
   of the 2014 political change affected respondents' identifications and
   led to the reworking of earlier identity narratives as a means of
   re-establishing the subjects' ontological integrity. As a result, three
   narratives (those of supporters of the change, non-supporters and
   ambivalent respondents) were established. The narratives of pro-Russian
   and ambivalent Crimeans were found to be similar, highlighting a sense
   of trauma that the imagined unity between Ukraine and Russia had been
   undermined. The narratives of pro-Ukrainian Crimeans focused on the loss
   of unity within the Crimean community.},

Abstract = {IPE has usefully identified numerous contributors to financial crises.
   Considerably less attention however has been granted to the roles of
   financial infrastructures, considered in this special issue as the
   socio-technical systems enabling basic yet crucial financial functions
   to be carried out, but that tend to be taken for granted and assumed.
   This article argues that vulnerabilities in information flows enabled
   through connections between globally dispersed human actors and
   non-human objects have shaped the types of events triggering crises, how
   such periods of instability unfold, and their eventual resolution.
   Building on insights from actor-network theory, we illustrate how fault
   lines in `long chains' of financial information conditioned three
   financial earthquakes between the 1980s and the present. Our analysis
   bridges insights from accounts that tend to separately emphasize
   material and ideational roots of crises. It also points to the
   importance of supplementing the stress on quantitative indicators with
   efforts to identify and address vulnerabilities in the quality of
   connections between disparate actors and objects that enable or disrupt
   flows of information facilitating global financial markets.},

Abstract = {How many Soviet citizens died because of World War II? A new estimate of
   the Soviet war dead is 42 million. This figure, from Russian historian
   Igor' Ivlev, is at least 15 million more than the 26-27 million
   previously estimated by Russian demographers Andreev, Darskii and
   Khar'kova and widely accepted for a quarter of a century. I consider the
   implications of the two estimates for the Soviet demographic accounts,
   contrast their sources and methods, and conclude that the new figure
   lacks substantial foundations. On existing knowledge, the best estimate
   of Soviet war dead remains 26-27 million.},

Title = {`A new type of great power relationship'? Gramsci, Kautsky and the role

Abstract = {Challenging conflictual Realist and optimistic liberal-internationalist
   arguments about full-scale integration of China into the US-led order,
   this article uses Gramsci's concept of hegemony and Kautsky's concept of
   ultra-imperialism to explore US hegemony's influence in transforming
   China and to characterize the relationship. Original archival research
   shows that China's elites were gradually integrated into the US-led
   order from 1978, with a special role played by elite knowledge networks
   built by the Ford Foundation, particularly in Chinese economic policy
   reform, diffusion of free market thinking, and the development and
   teaching of Economics as a technocratic, policy-oriented academic
   discipline. Ford funded Sino-American elite knowledge networks closely
   connected with Chinese globalizing elites, with and through which
   liberal tendencies penetrated China, adapted to local conditions. We
   argue that these networks played significant yet neglected roles in
   managing change in China, and Sino-US relations during a time of global
   power transitions. This is inexplicable in either Realist or
   Liberal-internationalist terms, but provides the substance of what might
   be a `new type of great power relationship', perhaps explicable in
   Kautskyian `ultraimperialist' terms. Though conflict and turbulence
   remain in the relationship due to changing economic conditions and
   global strategies, this need not result in inter-hegemonic military
   conflict.},

Title = {Understanding technological change in global finance through

   Economy Special Issue `The Changing Technological Infrastructures of
   Global Finance'},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Amid escalating claims about the promises and perils of emergent
   financial technologies (fintech), critical investigation of the extent
   to which specific technological changes in global finance are truly
   `disruptive' is sorely needed. Yet, IPE has engaged little with the
   growing focus on fintech in popular and regulatory debates, as well as
   in Social Studies of Finance (SSF). This article and accompanying
   special issue foreground `infrastructures' as a heuristic for injecting
   nuance into debates on the emergence, limits and implications of
   technological changes in global finance while bringing IPE into
   conversation with perspectives on fintech in cognate literatures.
   Building on insights developed in Science and Technology Studies (STS),
   we argue that tracing the ways in which infrastructures enabling
   financial markets to operate are assembled out of multiple old and new
   socio-technical devices offers productive avenues for addressing key
   questions arising from several entanglements underpinning technological
   change. The findings of contributions to this special issue are linked
   to two key themes in debates on the impacts of technological change:
   financial inclusion and financial stability. Further avenues are
   proposed for examining the infrastructures in which technological change
   occurs in global finance and beyond, while fostering on-going dialogues
   between IPE, STS and SSF.},

   of Social Media as a Platform for Civic Activism in Belarus and Ukraine},

Abstract = {This article analyses activists' attitudes towards using social media
   for civic actions in authoritarian and democratising countries.
   Specifically, it examines whether civic activists in Belarus and Ukraine
   perceive social media as `liberation technology' or as unhelpful and
   overhyped, a `net delusion'. We compare the ways in which civic
   activists use social media for the purpose of spreading information,
   networking and mobilisation. We find that social media is used by them
   for civic activism in order to campaign for civil and political
   liberties in their countries. Civic activists are generally enthusiastic
   about the use of social media, however we highlight challenges arising
   from socio-political conditions as well as negative consequences of
   activists' online engagement.},

   Cases},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine how conflicts over transgender bathroom
   rights have ignited debates concerning the fundamental nature of
   transgender identity. Through an institutional and discursive analysis
   of North Carolina's House Bill 2 or ``bathroom bill,{''} the Title IX
   case in Gloucester County School Board v. G. G., and similar federal
   court cases, I explore how and why forces both on the right and in the
   LGBTQ movement have come to rely on scientific expertise to legitimate
   their conceptions. As conservatives have marshaled evidence to challenge
   notions that transgender identity is innate, LGBTQ and transgender
   organizations as well as the American Civil Liberties Union have crafted
   a ``born this way{''} biopolitical construction of transgender identity.
   I find that at their core, these conflicts are over the meanings of
   gender and sex in relation to transgender identity. Conservatives posit
   sex as biologically rooted and gender as a psychological phenomenon,
   whereas transgender advocates subsume gender identity into the
   definition of sex in arguing that constitutional and federal civil
   rights law must recognize gender identity as a biologically constitutive
   element of sex. I conclude by noting the limits of a liberal
   assimilationist and litigation-centric transgender politics and by
   exploring alternatives to this biopolitical form of transgender
   political identity.},

Title = {When billions meet trillions: impact investing and shadow banking in
   Pakistan},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {This article argues that impact investing is a means to promote shadow
   banking. This is reflected in the rise of impact investing in Pakistan,
   particularly its predilection for inclusive finance. Two contentions are
   made: one, that impact investors fill the void in enterprise finance
   created by regulatory constraints on banks, and two, that impact
   investors accommodate the demand for yield by shepherding global capital
   into poor countries. These contentions augment the finance and
   development literature which critiques the financialized development
   associated with the Finance for Development (FfD) agenda construed by
   global institutions ostensibly for the Millennium Development Goals, or
   MDGs, of 2015 and subsequently the Sustainable Development Goals, or
   SDGs, of 2030. More recently, the narrative of slogans such as Billions
   to Trillions and the World Bank's Maximizing Finance for Development
   agenda, have drawn criticism because they advance shadow banking. The
   case of Pakistan exemplifies the traction gained by impact investing as
   an asset class and the related imperative to measure and evaluate
   outcomes. The resultant focus on base-of-pyramid initiatives such as
   inclusive finance is thus a corollary of the financialization of
   development and the shifts and transformations in development
   initiatives that incorporate private and philanthropic or `patient'
   capital.},

Abstract = {By examining the arguments presented in courts and in print media to
   support and oppose the introduction of conscientious objection for
   healthcare workers in Sweden, this article illustrates the ways in which
   interest groups may take advantage of expanding opportunity structures
   in the wake of internationalization, all the while framing their
   arguments in ways that create resonance with national and nationalist
   discourses. Focusing on the case of a midwife who sued a county for
   refusing to hire her after having learned she would not participate in
   abortions, the article analyzes how both anti- and pro-abortion groups
   frame the issue of conscientious objection as aligned with ``Swedish
   exceptionalism{''} in terms of worker co-determination and adherence to
   international conventions. The article thus strengthens the feminist
   contention that the issue of abortion, regardless of how precisely it is
   framed, tends to mobilize nationalist discourses, but also highlights
   how anti-abortion movements can ``think global, act local.{''}},

Abstract = {With Vladimir Putin having commenced his second term, the issue of the
   constitutional limit of two successive terms for the president has again
   become politically salient in Russia. In this article, two specialists
   of Russian politics investigate public support in 2018 for term limits.
   They address three questions. Why does the issue of term limits matter?
   To whom in Russia does it matter? Is opposition to abolishing terms
   limits likely to be politically divisive? Their findings point in
   general to a shift in the level and character of support for term limits
   since 2012. Opposition to term limits has grown over time, and while in
   2012 support for term limits was drawn from supporters of more
   authoritarian leadership, today it includes engaged democrats with
   negative views of the economic situation. They also find that supporters
   of term limits remain more likely to support political protest.},

Abstract = {A generation of scholars has depicted the premiership of Labor Party
   leader Gough Whitlam as a watershed in Australian foreign policy.
   According to the prevailing consensus, Whitlam carved out a more
   independent and progressive role in international affairs without
   significantly endangering relations with Western-aligned states in East
   and Southeast Asia or with Australia's traditionally closest allies, the
   United States and the United Kingdom. This article takes issue with
   these views and offers a more skeptical assessment of Whitlam's
   diplomacy and questions his handling of Australia's alliance with the
   United States. In doing so, it shows that Whitlam, in his eagerness to
   embrace detente, reject containment, and project an image of an
   allegedly more progressive and independent Australia, in fact
   exacerbated tensions with Richard Nixon's Republican administration and
   caused disquiet among Southeast Asian countries that were aligned with
   or at least friendly toward the West.},

Abstract = {Does parliamentary oversight of governments' decisions in the
   international arena matter? This article finds that it does: governments
   with strong parliamentary oversight behave differently when negotiating
   policies at the EU level compared with governments with less powerful
   parliaments. Where parliaments have formal powers to oversee and
   restrict their government's positions we see a significantly higher use
   of opposing votes and formal policy statements by those governments.
   This behaviour intensifies depending on the governments' standing
   vis-a-vis other political parties at home. When governments are under
   pressure in their national parliaments they are more likely to go on
   record and take a stand against the majority in Brussels. These results
   make it clear that in EU legislative politics, governments not only
   consider their policy priorities and negotiation tactics with their
   European counterparts, but also make use of EU decision records to send
   signals to domestic audiences, including their national parliaments.},

Abstract = {Large-scale assessments still focus on those aspects of students'
   competence that can be evaluated using paper-and-pencil tests (or
   computer-administered versions thereof). Performance tests are
   considered costly due to administration and scoring, and, more
   importantly, they are limited in reliability and validity. In this
   article, we demonstrate how a sociocognitive perspective provides an
   understanding of these issues and how, based on this understanding, an
   argument-based approach to assessment design, interpretation, and use
   can help to develop comprehensive, yet reliable and valid,
   performance-based assessments of student competence. More specifically,
   we describe the development of a computer-administered, simulation-based
   assessment that can reliably and validly assess students' competence to
   plan, perform, and analyze physics experiments at a large scale. Data
   from multiple validation studies support the potential of adopting a
   sociocognitive perspective and assessments based on an argument-based
   approach to design, interpretation, and use. We conclude by discussing
   the potential of simulations and automated scoring methods for reliable
   and valid performance-based assessments of student competence.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the British public perceived UK Prime Minister
   David Cameron's plan to renegotiate his country's relationship with the
   EU. It asks whether attitudes towards renegotiation followed a similar
   pattern to attitudes towards Brexit. It asks: are preferences towards
   renegotiation and Brexit related, and did British citizens perceive them
   as conflicting or complementary? We modelled the similarities and
   differences between these two types of preferences, which allowed us to
   classify the attitudes into four patterns: unconditional europhiles,
   rejectionist eurosceptics, risk-averse eurosceptics and power-seeking
   eurosceptics. Using a large-N cross-sectional survey conducted in the UK
   in April 2015 (n = 3000), our findings suggest that similar utilitarian
   concerns underpinned both types of preferences; but education and
   partisan cues differentiated them. Our findings have implications for
   understanding the result of the UK referendum. They also highlight the
   complex considerations that drive citizens' attitudes towards the EU and
   help us predict the scope of public acceptance of EU reform initiatives
   by other governments.},

Abstract = {Brexit poses a profound challenge to the economic fortunes of the
   financial services sector in the United Kingdom (UK) because it
   threatens to sever access to the single market in the European Union
   (EU). Recognising this, the City of London's largest financial firms and
   main representative bodies supported a Remain vote in the June 2016
   referendum, and subsequently lobbied for a `soft' Brexit policy to
   preserve the City's lucrative passporting rights. Despite this, the
   government led by Theresa May pursued a `hard' Brexit policy which
   threatened to leave the UK outside the single market. How can we explain
   the City's apparent failure to influence the UK's Brexit policy? We
   argue that whilst the UK financial sector wielded formidable latent
   structural power, its capacity to translate this into instrumental
   influence in the policy process was constrained by three factors: the
   political statecraft of Brexit, leading the government to downgrade the
   concerns of the financial industry; the reconfiguration of institutional
   structures, which undermined the City's voice within government; and
   constraints on business organisation, caused by collective action
   problems and heterogeneous preferences. These three factors constitute
   important scope conditions which highlight the contingent power of
   finance in liberal market economies.},

   archival studies, psychology, transitional justice and memory studies to
   provide an analytical basis for interviews with the subjects of the
   digital film archive. Examination of the accidental outcomes of agency
   and cross-community contact from this digitally available film archive
   suggests that a more intentional framework must be developed in order to
   best utilize these platforms as tools for social change in transition.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to map and explain the extent to which national
   legislators constrain discretion contained in European Union directives
   during transposition. To this end, we use standard hypotheses from the
   domestic delegation literature regarding the necessity of policy
   conflict and transaction costs. Our empirical approach is based on a
   focused comparison of the transposition of several provisions of the
   Asylum Reception Conditions Directive in France, Germany, and the
   Netherlands. In order to capture content-specific aspects of discretion
   we employ an innovative measurement tool, the so-called Institutional
   Grammar Tool. The study shows that while all three states formally
   comply with the directive, the level of European Union discretion
   delegated to practical implementers varies considerably across the
   cases. Standard delegation theory cannot fully explain the patterns.
   Instead, existing delegation theories have to be adjusted to the
   transposition context, by accounting for domestic preferences regarding
   the status quo.},

Abstract = {Could international financial capital impose shareholder sovereignty on
   Japan, the ultimate bastion of stakeholder capitalism? As the Japanese
   economy descended from boom to bust in the early 1990s, government and
   industry leaders called for a decisive move toward US-style shareholder
   capitalism, and increasing foreign share ownership exerted strong
   pressure to adapt corporate governance practices to Anglo-American
   norms. In practice, however, the government gave firms more options for
   restructuring but did not make them more beholden to shareholders. Firms
   on their part favored superficial adjustments to prop up share prices
   rather than fundamental changes, because they sought to preserve the
   strengths of their traditional business models. This article explains
   how marketplace developments, domestic political dynamics, and corporate
   strategies combined to produce the distinctive pattern of Japanese
   corporate governance reforms since the 1990s. It concludes with an
   assessment of the consequences of these reforms for managers, workers,
   shareholders, and the general public.},

Abstract = {In 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) government publicly shifted its
   position from being a staunch opponent of the proposed Convention on the
   Rights of Older Persons to expressing a cautious interest in creating
   new international standards on older persons a move welcomed by
   advocates. The significance of the UK's new level of engagement was that
   it was now one of the few states in the European Union (EU) to
   constructively engage in the international process to establish a
   convention, and it contributed to Germany's interest as well as that of
   the EU, without whose endorsement a convention is unlikely to be
   negotiated. This article explores the role of the transnational advocacy
   network (TAN) in contributing to the UK's discursive shift, and
   identifies opportunities to strengthen its influence. Drawing on
   multiple qualitative data sources, the article argues that the TAN
   influenced the government both by applying subtle pressure on members of
   parliament and by framing issues in a way that resonated with the
   identity of the state. This influence was facilitated, however, by
   pressure and persuasion from states at international and regional levels
   of governance. The TAN was further aided thanks to the politically
   charged subject of the treaty: older persons. The article applies the
   theory of the `radical flank effect' to suggest how the TAN might
   further influence the government. This would involve some civil society
   organizations adopting contentious tactics at domestic and international
   levels, which could advance the claims of more moderate organizations,
   and might ultimately contribute to strengthening the government's
   position on the convention.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the development of a form of Russian-speaking
   Belarusian national identity. While Belarus's early post-Soviet
   nationalists relied upon Belarusian as the central pillar of national
   identity, this has been challenged by more `pragmatic' nationalists
   using the `language of the people', namely, Russian. Analysing history
   textbooks and popular history books that represent three key identity
   projects in Belarus, this study sheds light on the specific programmatic
   ideas of a new Russian-speaking Belarusian nationalism. Despite the
   emergence of the geopolitically-motivated Russian World (Russkii Mir)
   concept, some Russian-speaking nationalists have articulated a programme
   that paradoxically draws upon Russian neo-Eurasianist thought, but which
   is simultaneously anti-Russian.},

Abstract = {In this \#MeToo moment, many women of color have called out those in
   power, namely men, who engage in sexual harassment and toxic
   masculinity. Furthermore, scholars, whose personal identities and
   research interests lie at the margins of gender, race, class, and
   sexuality, have drawn increasing attention to issues of gendered and
   racialized biases and harassment in the Academy. During our
   pre-conference session at the 2018 meeting of the American Political
   Science Association, we discussed substantive methods for reckoning with
   these conditions. We worked through the theoretical frameworks of Black
   Feminist and queer scholarship to orient ourselves toward actions that
   center the most marginalized. We identified methods for generating
   transformative solutions to campus and departmental problems facing
   students, faculty, and staff with intersectional identities. In all, the
   workshop proved both effective and generative for all in attendance,
   providing those present with concrete tools to build more equitable
   departments and classrooms.},

Year = {2019},
Pages = {115-139},
Abstract = {Grounded in political economy, this chapter explores the il/legal
   economies of dams by exploring the crime-governance nexus produced by
   dam construction. It considers the politics of hydro-development, of
   political parties, of corporate houses and of local ethnic competition.
   Processes are traced to show the criminalisation of politics as well as
   rampant accumulation from crime and corruption in and around dams and
   infrastructure for hydro-electricity. This evidence not only shows
   extensive inefficiencies in the management of water but also how
   `hydro-criminality' requires the violation of customary `norms of
   violation' in access to watercourses, forests and land, the breaking of
   state law and the manipulation of loopholes and environmental laws.},

Abstract = {The common understanding of the history of European integration
   obfuscates much of the strong bonds between European integration and its
   pre-history in western multilateral co-operation This western
   co-operation centred around the inter-connected policy fields of
   monetary management, trade and social policies during the pre-phase of
   European integration. This contribution reconstructs the trans-Atlantic
   institutional framework, within which a unique multilateralism in
   post-war Western Europe, could emerge. The analysis suggests new
   explanations for the specific design, which characterizes this European
   variant of post-war multilateralism: a regionally oriented `social
   market' pursued through a process of European integration.},

Abstract = {This article examines inter-allied efforts to collect, categorize and
   analyse material gathered from the thousands of German prisoners of war
   (POWs) in their hands during the Second World War. The different
   information gathered from enemy captives was valuable to British,
   Canadian and American intelligence services, helping them to evaluate
   morale of `Hitler's soldiers', to improve the security of their camp
   networks and to understand National Socialism ideology. Often viewed as
   a primarily British-American operation, POW intelligence also involved
   Canadian authorities. This article argues that Canada, far from being a
   secondary actor, had a central role within this transatlantic network.},

   the age of passive asset management},

Abstract = {Since the global financial crisis, there is a massive shift of assets
   towards index funds. Rather than picking stocks, index funds replicate
   stock indices such as the S\&P 500. But where do these indices actually
   come from? This paper analyzes the politico-economic role of index
   providers, a small group of highly profitable firms including MSCI, S\&P
   DJI, and FTSE Russell, and develops a research agenda from an IPE
   perspective. We argue that these index providers have become actors that
   exercise growing private authority as they steer investments through the
   indices they create and maintain. While technical expertise is a
   precondition, their brand is the primary source of index provider
   authority, which is entrenched through network externalities. Rather
   than a purely technical exercise, constructing indices is inherently
   political. Which companies or countries are included into an index or
   excluded (i.e. receive investment in- or outflows) is based on criteria
   defined by index providers, thereby setting standards for corporate
   governance and investor access. Hence, in this new age of passive asset
   management index providers are becoming gatekeepers that exert de facto
   regulatory power and thus may have important effects on corporate
   governance and the economic policies of countries.},

Pages = {335-358},

Abstract = {The conflict between Ukraine and Russia in the Donbas region has led
   both countries to strengthen their respective militaries. The literature
   on militarization emphasizes the subtle and largely unconscious ways in
   which militarization spreads through society. Drawing on ethnographic
   fieldwork conducted between 2015 and 2017, I argue that attention to the
   intersubjective aspects of the process exposes the self-conscious
   working-through of military realities. I make this argument using the
   case study of a restaurant run by demobilized fighters, Cafe Patriot.
   Specifically, I show how the cafe's proprietors aimed to provide an
   anti-depressive atmosphere for fighters, and to provoke critical
   thinking among non-combatant patrons. The cafe challenged theorizing on
   militarization by effacing the separation between military and civilian
   as predicted, but doing so in the interest of reminding people of
   militarization rather than blinding them to it. These findings highlight
   veterans' constructive efforts to re-inhabit a fractured world, and
   contrast with portrayals in critical studies of militarized masculinity.
   In sum, the cafe represented an effort to intervene in the process of
   militarization using, strangely enough, the trappings of militarization.
   At stake is the definition of militarization as an insidious process.},

Abstract = {The rules structuring the global economy frequently emerge from informal
   international regulatory institutions. A set of approaches in
   International Relations and International Political Economy
   conceptualize these institutions as negotiation arenas and deem powerful
   actors to determine rule creation. Others stress the change-inhibiting
   effects of densely institutionalized environments. Yet variation in
   policy outcomes of post-crisis financial regulatory reforms cannot be
   fully explained by either. I argue that conceptualizing institutional
   asset specificity helps explain international policy processes and
   outcomes. The institutional assets of regulatory institutions, their
   rules, prescriptions, and procedures of decision-making, offer divergent
   transaction cost reducing effects. Specific asset institutions possess
   narrow institutional scopes and stringently defined mandates. They
   reduce transaction costs by offering tested approaches and established
   regulatory instruments, while proving unadaptable to policy issues
   falling outside their scope. General asset institutions avoid
   constraints of specialization and can adapt to various purposes. The
   lower asset specificity in turn increases the ambiguity over regulatory
   instruments and the commensurate costs of standard development. I assess
   the argument by analyzing four post-crisis reform initiatives on
   regulating global banks and shadow banking.},

Abstract = {This article develops an analytical framework geared at making sense of
   global governance as patchwork. Our three-step methodology
   operationalizes the concept of ?bricolage? by focusing on the political
   practices and the value struggles that underpin the making of global
   public policies. This framework throws light on the widespread
   contestation over the objectives and solutions that should be pursued
   globally, as well as on the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that
   structure global governance. To demonstrate the relevance of our
   approach, we examine a key initiative drawn from contemporary IPE and
   development politics: the making of the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs). Analyzing the making of the SDGs through our methodology sheds
   light on the bricolage of global public policies in three interconnected
   ways: (1) in showing the social mechanisms of exclusion and inclusion;
   (2) in documenting the variety of views involved and the prevalence of
   conflict; and (3) in identifying practical and normative alternatives
   that get discarded along the way. Overall, the proposed framework helps
   restore the contingency and idiosyncrasies of global policies, while
   also uncovering their common patterns.},

Abstract = {The failure of the international community to adequately respond to
   patterns of discrimination against the ethnic Rohingya minority in
   Myanmar (Burma) eventually led to a genocide. The so-called ``clearance
   operations{''} launched by Myanmar's military in August 2017 tested the
   resilience of the international community's commitment to defending
   human rights and upholding its Responsibility to Protect (R2P)
   populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and
   war crimes. Two years later the UN Security Council has still not
   adopted a single resolution to name the crime committed against the
   Rohingya, or to hold the perpetrators accountable. Nevertheless,
   Rohingya survivors and international civil society have continued to
   campaign for justice under international law, and to advocate for
   targeted sanctions to be imposed on those responsible for atrocities.
   Faced with an inert Security Council, some UN member states have adopted
   inventive diplomatic measures to uphold their responsibility to protect.},

Abstract = {Public policies sometimes generate ``policy feedback effects,{''}
   reshaping public opinion and political participation among beneficiaries
   or the public generally, often with the effects of generating supportive
   constituencies that help to sustain the program. Yet such effects do not
   always occur; in fact, despite that Americans use more social policies
   than ever, antipathy to government runs high-evidence of a seeming
   ``government-citizen disconnect.{''} Policy design and delivery matters
   for policy feedback, as policies that make government's role more
   visible may make more of an impression on beneficiaries; yet political
   polarization and distrust in government can interfere with such effects.
   In addition, those who are most aware of the government's role in social
   provision often participate least in politics, and vice versa. This
   article considers strategies that public officials and other civic and
   political leaders can use to facilitate policy feedback effects.},

Abstract = {The literature on blame avoidance suggests that politicians seek to
   avoid the risk of electoral punishment by means of blame-shifting. Based
   on a quantitative content analysis of public responsibility
   attributions, this article explores public blame-shifting among Greek
   and Spanish parties in austerity governments during the eurozone crisis.
   Arguing that blame avoidance behavior in times of austerity is
   conditioned by party ideology, the findings suggest that incumbent
   left-wing parties are more inclined to shift the blame whereas
   conservative parties also claim credit. The article then explores how
   the European character of the crisis influenced the patterns of
   blame-shifting. The results show firstly, that external blame-shifting
   rose significantly in times of incumbency, when foreign actors appeared
   to be ideal scapegoats; secondly, external blame-shifting in the crisis
   was slightly more common among left-wing parties. The article
   contributes to assessing the role of party ideology for blame-shifting
   and it helps to understand blame-shifting in European policy fields.},

Title = {Authority, politicization, and alternative justifications: endogenous
   legitimation dynamics in global economic governance1},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Recent mobilization against core tenets of the liberal international
   order suggests that international institutions lack sufficient societal
   legitimacy. We argue that these contestations are part of a legitimation
   dynamic that is endogenous to the political authority of international
   institutions. We specify a mechanism in which international authority
   increases the likelihood for the public politicization of international
   institutions. This undermines legitimacy in the short run, but also
   allows broadening the justificatory basis of global governance:
   Politicization allows civil society organizations (CSOs) to transmit
   alternative legitimation standards to global elite discourses. We trace
   this sequence for four key institutions of global economic governance -
   the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, and the NAFTA - combining data on
   authority and protest counts with markers for CSOs and legitimation
   narratives in more than 120,000 articles in international elite
   newspapers during 1992-2012. The uncovered patterns are consistent with
   a perspective that understands legitimation dynamics as an endogenous

   legitimation narratives did not lastingly resonate in the global

Abstract = {Many have claimed that in the dependent market economies of Central and
   Eastern Europe industrial policy has been reduced to incentives to
   foreign investors - a feature accentuated by their loss of policy space
   through integration into the European single market. In this paper, we
   offer an alternative view by arguing that the European Union (EU) has in
   fact made it possible for its members to recover a degree of policy
   space lost to economic and regulatory integration. The EU does this
   through transnational industrial policy, which is the combination of its
   competition and cohesion policies. The former limits cross-country
   competition for capital; the latter provides additional resources to
   support a more inclusive industrial policy benefiting small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs). However, effective utilization of transnational
   industrial policy depends on domestic state capacities. We demonstrate
   this by comparing the distribution of EU funds to automotive firms in
   Poland and Romania. In Poland, efforts to create institutions that
   promote SMEs have resulted in a more balanced distribution of EU
   resources, while in Romania a weak and unstable institutional
   environment led to their greater concentration, thereby reducing
   European funds to another source of rents for the most powerful firms.},

Abstract = {Belying the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) reputation as a
   bastion of neo-liberal policy orthodoxy, this article analyses important
   yet contingent transformations in IMF fiscal policy thinking which
   constituted a key intervention in international austerity debates.
   Applying only to advanced economies, and in the specific post-crash
   conditions, the Fund came to champion fiscal policy as a more potent and
   effective counter-cyclical tool. Analysis focuses on alterations to
   modeling assumptions and analytical techniques, beginning before the
   crash but accelerating after it, which intellectually bolstered this
   view. It finds the Fund's rediscovery of some older (Keynesian)
   assumptions was both longer in germination and more enduring than some
   have recognized. It also charts the reconciliation of this contingent
   Keynesianism to `congenital' IMF concerns for fiscal sustainability. It
   highlights the variety of economic insights, often with vastly differing
   policy implications, found within the Fund, and indeed within mainstream
   macroeconomics. It builds on work questioning the stability,
   consistency, and coherence of economic ideas suggested by the paradigm
   framework, and identifies limitations of a paradigm lens for
   understanding incremental IMF ideational change. It contributes to
   politics of economic ideas scholarship in highlighting the importance of
   economic method and modeling assumptions as sites of contestation within
   gradual but meaningful ideational change.},

Abstract = {This article examines Mexico-U.S. migration from a transnational
   perspective, explaining the implications of cross-border ties for the
   nation-state. It builds on 30 years of original research in Mexico and
   the United States, and contributions of the Mexican Migration Project
   and other research that show that conventional understandings of the
   nation-state have become inadequate. Focusing on relations between
   migrants and the Mexican government as well as their struggles for
   inclusion in the United States, it demonstrates how each nation-state is
   transformed as migrants maintain attachments and participate
   simultaneously in countries of origin and destination. It advances
   scholarship on this topic by specifying how, in each case, the
   connections among territory, state, and nation are changing in distinct
   ways. In the case of Mexico, the state framework is extended beyond
   geographical borders to encompass extraterritorial citizens within the
   nation. In the United States, a disjuncture between state and nation is
   emerging within the bounds of the national territory.},

Abstract = {Industrial policy has been on the agenda of British policy elites since
   the 2008 financial crisis, particularly since Theresa May became Prime
   Minister in 2016. This has been seen as a challenge to pre-crisis norms
   of economic governance associated with neoliberalism. This article
   explores key aspects of industrial policy development in post-crisis
   Britain - new forms of vertical support for industry, local government
   reform, and the public financing of private sector R\&D - in order to
   sketch a new understanding of political and ideological change. It
   focuses on the institutional mechanisms through which industrial
   strategy will ostensibly be implemented, including subnational and
   private spheres of governance. The article argues that recent industrial
   policy developments do not represent the receding of neoliberalism, but
   rather have provided opportunities for the reseeding of neoliberal norms
   in British economic statecraft. The strategy has reinforced forms of
   state machinery through which pre-crisis elite practice can be
   maintained and legitimated. By demonstrating that the apparent revival
   of state intervention in the wake of capitalist crises must not be
   assumed automatically to challenge pre-crisis economic orders, and
   highlighting the crucial role of exigent political circumstances, the
   article makes an important contribution to the literature on neoliberal
   resilience.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of a ``parasitic critique.{''} It
   begins by theorizing the ethico-political positionality of
   ``critical{''} researchers by speaking with Michel Serres to introduce
   the figure of the parasitic-researcher. That device explores a tension
   in critical research between hearing ``thick{''} descriptions of our
   interlocutors' lifeworlds before channeling them into ``thin{''}
   metatheoretical accounts. The paper argues that this dilemma relates to
   the rhetorical ``style{''} of critical approaches in IR, which employ a
   certain ``suspicious hermeneutics{''} that is unwilling to take
   seriously the voices of particular interlocutors. By contrast, a
   parasitic critique is laid out as a critical orientating sensibility
   focused on reordering the methods of critique, with the hope of
   cultivating a non-judgmental ethic of ``care-full{''} analysis and
   description. This argument is made by drawing out one ``lay{''} critical
   theory of political violence that sees critique make a three-fold switch
   from suspicion to learning, exclusion to combination, and contradiction
   to composition. Throughout, these claims are nested within
   self-reflections on work interviewing both victims and perpetrators of
   torture, which demonstrate-often uncomfortably-how it is necessary to
   find points of critical sympathy between the subjugator and the
   subjugated that can be leveraged for the ethico-political good.},

Volume = {13},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Recent contributions in the domains of governance and regulation
   elucidate the importance of rule-intermediation (RI), the role that
   organizations adopt to bridge actors with regulatory or ``rulemaking{''}
   roles and those with target or ``rule-taking{''} roles. Intermediation
   not only enables the diffusion and translation of regulatory norms, but
   also allows for the representation of different actors in policymaking
   arenas. While prior studies have explored the roles that such RIs adopt
   to facilitate their intermediation functions, we have yet to consider
   how field-level structuring processes influence (and are influenced by)
   the various and changing roles adopted by RI. In this study we focus on
   the mutually constitutive relations between field-level change processes
   and the evolving roles of RIs by studying the rise of the International
   Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)/Local Governments
   for Sustainability, an RI serving as a bridge for sustainable urban
   development policies between the United Nations and local authorities.
   Using ICLEI as an illustrative case, we theorize four different
   processes of regulatory field structuration: problematization, role
   specialization, marketization, and orchestrated decentralization. We
   discuss their implications for RI roles in the field and further
   theorize the changing dynamics of trickle-up intermediation processes as
   an RI gains power and influence.},

Abstract = {The primary elections of the United Russia party serve as a tool for
   party organisation and voter mobilisation. In this study, we employ
   United Russia's capacity to mobilise voter turnout in the 2016 primary
   elections as an indirect indicator of the strength of party-controlled
   regional political machines. Our analysis of the results of the 2016
   Duma elections in 83 regions of Russia demonstrates that voter turnout
   in the spring 2016 party primaries of United Russia to a significant
   extent explains cross-regional variation in party success.},

Abstract = {The focus of this article is on ethnic diversity and polarisation in
   Latvia after 1989. Our fundamental question is that if we interpret
   diversification as a dynamic process, and include polarisation as a
   potential direction of diversification, how much will the results
   differ, compared to the explanations usually proposed in the literature?
   The recognition that apparent homogenisation results, in particular
   cases, in polarisation (in this case in 35\% of Latvia's entire
   population) is the major contribution of our empirical analysis. Taking
   into account the broad scale of the potential impact of polarisation,
   our findings raise significant questions for the classification
   mechanisms that may be employed in further investigations.},

Abstract = {The article assesses the empirical validity of Okun's law on the
   relationship between a country's unemployment and its output with a
   focus upon the Visegrad Group economies and upon the post-transition
   period from the first quarter of 2000 until the first quarter of 2016.
   The study also accounts for cyclical fluctuations in male and female
   unemployment and applies different approaches to the estimation of Okun
   coefficients. Fixed long-run Okun coefficients are compared to the
   trajectories identified under the state space approach based on the
   Kalman filter in an attempt to capture their possible time
   non-constancy. The findings cast doubt about the universal validity of
   Okun's law in the Visegrad countries in the investigated period.},

Abstract = {The immense secondary literature on the Cuban missile crisis of October
   1962 tends to overlook the U.S. government's promotion of a case in
   international law to legitimize and generate support for the naval
   blockade of Cuba. This article explores the development and presentation
   of the legal case and then gauges its success by looking at the response
   of various non-Communist governments. Those governments endorsed U.S.
   policy despite, not because of, the U.S. legal case, which they found
   highly questionable. The analysis here draws extensively on archival
   sources as well as on the latest published research and presents a fresh
   contribution to the historiography about the most dangerous
   confrontation of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Following the outbreak of armed conflict in 2014, Ukraine adopted a
   National Action Plan within United Nations Security Council Resolution
   1325 for the period 2016-20, the first country in conflict to do so.
   Ukraine's case demonstrates that in a situation of active conflict, the
   Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda becomes strongly linked to
   military security. Drawing on interviews, documents, and narratives by
   feminist and public figures, I argue that the WPS agenda in Ukraine has
   taken a narrow militarized form as a result of a combination of three
   interrelated and mutually constitutive factors: the ongoing conflict,
   nationalistic feminism, and the role of international organizations. The
   open conflict has generated a militaristic and nationalistic discourse
   among mainstream Ukrainians with an emphasis on defending the country.
   This discourse has been translated by international organizations and
   national actors into the WPS agenda, which has prioritized security
   sector reforms. Implementation of the WPS agenda in Ukraine therefore
   seems to be at odds with this norm's feminist principles. It is not
   leading to peace but to militarization, neglecting broader insecurities,
   including socioeconomic inequalities that have, in turn, been
   exacerbated by the conflict and the state's institutional reforms.},

Title = {How did the Washington consensus move within the IMF? Fragmented change
   from the 1980s to the aftermath of the 2008 crisis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {384-409},
Abstract = {While the Washington Consensus is one of the most (in)famous economic
   policy paradigms of recent times, the literature on it still lacks a
   detailed, diachronic analysis of how it evolved within one of its most
   important disseminators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Such an
   analysis is important not just for gaining a better empirical sense of
   the Consensus, but also for illuminating a key question of interest in
   the study of international organizations: how ideas and institutions
   change. Toward this end, this paper uses content analysis to explore
   almost 12,000 IMF documents from 1982-2011, providing a uniquely
   detailed map of the institution's discourse on the Consensus. It tracks
   this policy paradigm's constituent parts across three different types of
   institutional documentation, representing different aspects of the
   institution's operations: Executive Board meeting minutes, Article IV
   staff reports, and Working Papers. Using vector autoregression
   techniques, the paper also examines the relative timing of discursive
   shifts across these three document types. Through these discussions, the
   paper advances and shows the relevance of ``fragmented{''} change, where
   different dimensions of an overall policy paradigm shift at several
   different speeds, at different points in time, and led by a variety of
   different institutional activities.},

Abstract = {This article explores the escalation of tensions surrounding Angola's
   independence from Portugal in 1975, when a protracted war of national
   liberation escalated sharply into an international crisis. Rather than
   see Angola as merely a proxy war, the article depicts the varied
   responses to Angolan anti-colonial nationalism as consequences of
   internationalization, or the deliberate and endogenous process of
   framing the struggle for Angolan independence in global terms. By
   establishing Angolan independence as part of a worldwide battle against
   imperialism, racism, and Western hegemony in the early 1960s, and by
   raising the issue in international forums, creating transnational
   support networks, and operating across borders and oceans, the Angolan
   national liberation movements created the ideological and political
   preconditions for the military interventions and Cold War political
   theater of the 1970s. Angola thus demonstrated how national liberation
   movements, as transnational actors, learned to operate within the
   international system to gain necessary material and moral support but
   also provoked the ire of more powerful external actors who had their own
   political and ideological reasons for opposing a pro-Soviet regime in
   Angola.},

Abstract = {National governments frequently pull strings to get their citizens
   appointed to senior positions in international institutions. We examine,
   over a 60-year period, the nationalities of the most senior positions in
   the United Nations Secretariat, ostensibly the world's most
   representative international institution. The results indicate which
   states are successful in this zero-sum game, and what national
   characteristics correlate with power in international institutions. The
   most overrepresented countries are small, rich democracies like the
   Nordic countries. Democracy, investment in diplomacy, foreign aid, and
   economic/military power are predictors of senior positions-even after
   controlling for the U.N. staffing mandate of competence and integrity.
   National control over the United Nations is remarkably sticky; however
   the influence of the United States has diminished as U.S. ideology has
   shifted away from its early allies. In spite of the decline in U.S.
   influence, the Secretariat remains pro-American relative to the world at
   large.},

Abstract = {What effects do International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans have on
   borrowing countries? Even after decades of research, no consensus
   exists. We offer a straightforward explanation for the seemingly mixed
   effects of IMF loans. We argue that different loans have different
   effects because of the varied conditions attached to IMF financing. To
   demonstrate this point, we investigate IMF loans with and without
   conditions that require public sector reforms in exchange for financing.
   We find that the addition of a public sector reform condition to a
   country's IMF program significantly reduces government spending on the
   public sector wage bill. This evidence suggest that conditions are a key
   mechanism linking IMF lending to policy outcomes. Although IMF loans
   with public sector conditions prompt cuts to the wage bill in the
   short-term, these cuts do not persist in the longer-term. Borrowers
   backslide on internationally mandated spending cuts in response to
   domestic political pressures.},

Abstract = {Country-of-origin information has secured a central place in European
   asylum systems, underpinning state decisions on the asylum status of
   refugee populations. All European states produce this type of
   information, and dedicated country-of-origin information units are
   increasingly common. This article analyzes the knowledge politics of
   country-of-origin information, with a focus on the relation between
   knowledge and decision. We are interested in this type of knowledge
   precisely because it is uneasily positioned in-between social scientific
   methodology and policy decision-making and is infused with a pulsional
   normativity. We distinguish three phases of country-of-origin
   information production: first, a phase of investigation, where foreign
   lands are reduced to stable and mobile forms so that they can be studied
   as research units; second, the concordance of information production,
   relying on standardized instruments and practical skill; and third, the
   consolidation phase, which involves the return of country information
   constructed inside research units back into the administrative and
   regulatory world. The final section of the article examines how complex
   and frail information about countries of origin becomes deployed as
   valid grounds for asylum decision-making.},

Abstract = {The Me Too movement has focused mainstream attention on the
   pervasiveness of sexual coercion in public and private life. The fact
   that sexual coercion is so widespread suggests that gender hierarchy is
   at least partially maintained by the most intimate of human
   interactions. This article argues that the work of Simone de Beauvoir
   illuminates the operation of sexual coercion as a mainstay of gender
   hierarchy and the Me Too movement as an exercise of the responsibility
   for political freedom. To be responsible for freedom is to undertake new
   projects as expressions of one's values but always with the duty to
   enhance the freedom of others. These projects can never be complete
   because humans act in a world not entirely of their own making and so
   must grapple with the facticity of existence. Reading Me Too through
   Beauvoir's existentialist ethics reveals the potential for expansive
   political solidarity while acknowledging the movement's incompleteness
   and potential failure. Through an appraisal of the nascent movement's
   activity and broader social responses, the article concludes that a
   continued responsibility to work against sexual coercion is part of a
   collective political freedom in pursuit of gender equality.},

Abstract = {Defining intelligence is not just a terminological but also a political
   question. Intelligence methods are spreading quickly in the contemporary
   security landscape, and defining intelligence gives us a clearer idea of
   what we are in fact spreading, and therefore also of the political and
   social consequences that this may entail. When using intelligence
   methods in, say, policing, public administration or immigration
   services, we import a specific adversarial logic and thereby transform
   the social relationships that these regulatory and administrative
   practices support and rest upon. In this paper, I shall propose a new
   definition of intelligence in order to analyse the social
   transformations that may be produced by the logical structure implicit
   in the concept of intelligence.},

Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {Spies and scholars in the United States have had a close, largely
   hidden, relationship. Both professions are in the business of
   information acquisition. Spies, though, work for the government, while
   the allegiance of most scholars is to independent research and teaching.
   Moreover, spy organizations view students as potential hires; in
   contrast, scholars are likely to see students as young charges placed in
   their hands to educate and prepare for lives of consequence. One school
   of thought argues that, since spies and scholars are both citizens, they
   should work together in partnership: sharing knowledge to improve the
   intelligence product, training and recruiting students, warning of
   radical activities on campus. A second school counters that the
   university is meant to be a pure and open place, dedicated to unbiased
   learning and free of government ties - especially entanglements with
   secret agencies. Campuses can find themselves torn between the two
   schools, caught up in a swirl of practical and moral issues that lead to
   a sense of ambivalence about the proper relationship between the academy
   and a nation's secret services.},

Abstract = {SOCMINT (SOCial Media INTelligence) is increasingly considered relevant
   and cost efficient information, and the exploitation of social media
   information in the name of security and public safety is generally
   regarded as unproblematic. We will critically scrutinize this claim and
   argue that the exploitation of such information by Intelligence and
   Security Services raises new ethical concerns. Drawing on recent moral
   discussions about privacy, we will argue that individuals have an
   interest in privacy in public spaces, including online spaces. We will
   discuss the role of such public privacy interests and argue that the
   systematic surveillance of social media platforms by security
   authorities potentially entail a negative chilling effect.},

Abstract = {Since the eurozone, refugee and Brexit crises, it has become evident
   that the EU contributes to divergence among member states and inequality
   within them. It is also evident that the days of permissive consensus,
   integration by stealth, and trust in promises of peace and prosperity
   are long gone. Publics across the EU now wonder why the EU ought to
   garner their respect, and what role, if any, the EU should play in
   mitigating both cross- and intra-national socioeconomic inequalities.
   They wonder, that is, what gives the EU legitimacy beyond securing a
   growth dividend and protecting against another European war, and what
   criteria of justice we ought to use in assessing the distributional
   consequences of integration. This contribution articulates a conception
   of legitimacy that has received very little attention in the literature,
   namely telic legitimacy, distinguishes it from conventional criteria of
   `input' and `output' legitimacy, explains its usefulness in addressing
   the EU's crisis in confidence, and outlines its relation to principles
   of justice.},

Title = {American hegemony: intellectual property rights, dollar centrality, and
   infrastructural power},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {490-519},
Abstract = {How does dollar centrality persist in the face of continuous US current
   account deficits and a steadily worsening net international investment
   position? Two mechanisms create a structural basis for dollar
   centrality, explaining how dollars enter global credit markets and why
   surplus countries continue to hold dollar-denominated assets. First,
   institutional structures deriving from late development suppress
   domestic demand in major current account surplus countries, making them
   reliant on external demand for growth. Local banks recycle those dollars
   into the global economy, creating huge dollar liabilities and assets on
   their balance sheets. This locks them into continued use of the dollar
   and reliance on the US Federal Reserve during crises. Second, US firms
   participating in the global unbundling of production have constructed
   commodity chains in which they capture disproportionate shares of global
   profits through their control over Intellectual property. These profits
   sustain valuations and thus the attractiveness of dollar-denominated
   assets. Routinization in use of the dollar and compliance with
   Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and US
   controlled commodity chains creates infrastructural power in Michael
   Mann's sense. This routinization sustains US geo-economic power in the
   face of persistent current account deficits and growing net
   international debt relative to US gross domestic product.},

Abstract = {The principal goal of this chapter is to empirically and inductively
   answer the main topic of the volume, the influence of sub-state actors
   on national security, by focusing on the correlation between Greenland's
   quest for autonomy and the political dynamism regarding Thule Air Base.
   The important points the author wishes to make in this chapter are that
   during the negotiations on the radar upgrade and the transformation of
   Thule Air Base into an outpost in the U.S. missile defense shield
   Greenland on the surface maintained a negative stance towards the
   continuation of Thule Air Base while, in fact, arguing on the premise
   that the base would stay, and that, through the continued existence of
   the base and its transformation into a missile defense outpost,
   Greenland was attempting to increase its say in diplomatic and military
   matters. In contrast with that, to Denmark the Thule problem posed the
   question of neglect and responsibility-Denmark found itself in a
   situation where it had to take a visible, concrete approach toward
   Greenland and conduct negotiations while constantly trying to keep the
   political cost down. The attitude of Denmark to deal with the wishes of
   its sub-state actor Greenland with flexibility and compromise was a
   pervasive leitmotif in the discussions regarding the missile defense
   shield.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political economy and law of bank resolution
   in the case of Italy - specifically, its treatment of three failing
   banks - the Monte dei Paschi, Veneto and Vicenza banks - which were
   resolved in 2016-17. These three cases stand out for the relatively
   large degree of discretion exercised by the national resolution and
   state aid authorities, ultimately with the permission of their European
   counterparts. This article examines the motivations of Italian
   authorities in lobbying the Commission for leeway in applying the bank
   recovery and resolution directive and analyses the intricacies of the
   legal framework to underline the extent of discretion exercised by
   policy-makers. It concludes that the discretion visible in these three
   cases is not (entirely) contained within EU law, and that bending the
   law or turning a blind eye to infractions was key to understanding the
   EU approach to Italy.},

Abstract = {To what extent does collective identity, as expressed by national
   constitutions, provide a legal limit to (creeping) European integration
   in areas of core state powers? This article contrasts the approaches by
   the EU and national legal orders. While EU law does not allow any area
   to be a priori carved out of its scope of application, certain national
   courts consider they can disapply EU law where it too deeply affects
   areas that are considered core to the state, in order to guarantee
   sufficient space for national self-determination so as to sustain
   national collective identity. Article 4(2) TEU, although touted as a
   platform to mediate constitutional conflict about the limits of EU
   powers, has made little difference in this respect. At the same time,
   the discord should not be overstated: national actors that credibly
   invoke legitimate interests within the framework of EU law will often
   find these recognized by the CJEU.},

Title = {The politics of regulatory enforcement and compliance: Theorizing and
   operationalizing political influences},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {653-685},

Abstract = {There is broad consensus in the literature on regulatory enforcement and
   compliance that politics matters. However, there is little scholarly
   convergence on what politics is or rigorous theorization and empirical
   testing of how politics matters. Many enforcement and compliance studies
   omit political variables altogether. Among those that address political
   influences on regulatory outcomes, politics has been defined in myriad
   ways and, too often, left undefined. Even when political constructs are
   explicitly operationalized, the mechanisms by which they influence
   regulatory outcomes are thinly hypothesized or simply ignored. If
   politics is truly as important to enforcement and compliance outcomes as
   everyone in the field seems to agree, regulatory scholarship must make a
   more sustained and systematic effort to understand their relationship,
   because overlooking this connection risks missing what is actually
   driving regulatory outcomes. This article examines how the construct of
   ``politics{''} has been conceptualized in regulatory theory and analyzes
   how it has been operationalized in empirical studies of regulatory
   enforcement and compliance outcomes. It brings together scholarship
   across disciplines that rarely speak but have much to say to one another
   on this subject in order to constitute a field around the politics of
   regulation. The goal is to sharpen theoretical and empirical
   understandings of when and how regulation works by better accounting for
   the role politics plays in its enforcement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of intelligence in the formation of
   British war policy during the Napoleonic Wars, 1807-1810. During this
   period, intelligence was conceived of broadly and was inseparably linked
   with secret diplomacy; to attempt to separate these strands would be
   anachronistic. It shall be argued that a lack of professionalism and
   institutional support was one of the key factors that limited the
   effectiveness of intelligence but that nevertheless it exerted a
   significant influence over Britain's war policy. Ultimately, it is
   argued that the intelligence dimension is central to understanding
   British policy during the Napoleonic Wars.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Do political gender stereotypes exist in egalitarian settings in which
   all parties nominate women? Do they matter for candidate selection in
   systems of proportional representation with multiparty competition and
   preferential voting? To date, these questions remain unanswered because
   related research is limited to the U.S. case. Our pioneering study
   examines political stereotypes in one of the ``least likely{''} cases,
   Finland-a global forerunner in gender equality. We find, first, that
   stereotypes persist even in egalitarian paradises. Second, when testing
   across settings of candidate choice, we find that the effect varies
   greatly: political gender stereotypes are powerful in hypothetical
   choices, but they work neither in favor of nor against female candidates
   when many ``real,{''} viable, experienced, and incumbent female
   candidates are competing. Although in open-list systems with
   preferential voting, gender stereotypes can directly affect female
   candidates' electoral success, in Finland, their actual impact in real
   legislative elections appears marginal.},

Abstract = {A notable feature of nationalism's contemporary resurgence is the
   increasing eagerness of governments to support and shape the political
   causes of populations living abroad that are viewed as ethnic kindred.
   However, global criteria for judging when such kin state activism is and
   is not acceptable have so far remained elusive, as the objectionable
   instances of the practice tend to overshadow the legally and morally
   consistent ones. I argue that the analysis of world affairs and
   promotion of global justice would benefit from an ethic of transnational
   conduct that has a rightful place for kin states. I defend a set of
   cosmopolitan criteria for this purpose, outlining how they enable us to
   recognize and combat the dangers posed by certain forms of kin state
   mobilization without forgoing the opportunities presented by certain
   other forms to overcome minority repression and enhance regional
   security.},

Abstract = {Psychological warfare, the use of propaganda to aid military operations,
   acquired prominence in British strategy in the early Cold War Middle
   East. This article argues planning made limited progress until the 1956
   Suez crisis. Suez produced optimism about propaganda?s ability to
   address threats from Egypt, the USSR and the Yemen. In Oman, Aden and
   Cyprus, psychological warfare was practiced to demoralise enemies,
   bolster allies and counter smears about British conduct. Only mixed
   results ensued though, and doubts about the military?s involvement in
   propaganda lingered. Psychological warfare endured because it was a
   cheap option that might sometimes work, and could induce opponents to
   surrender rather than fight on.},

Abstract = {When they joined the euro in 1999 Belgium and Italy were almost
   identical in two respects: both had public debts equal to 110 per cent
   of GDP and the same GDP per capita. Today the situation in the two
   countries is very different. This article looks at the evolution of
   public debt in Belgium and Italy since 1990 and uses the debt dynamics
   equation to explain the contrasting evolution in the two countries in
   the run-up to the introduction of the euro, during the early years of
   the euro and since the beginning of the crisis. It argues that Italy's
   current predicament was not caused by the euro, as some have suggested.
   Instead, as the experience of Belgium suggests, the euro could have been
   used also by Italy to make a sufficiently large fiscal adjustment prior
   to the crisis to avoid the harsh adjustment that the crisis eventually
   imposed on the country.},

Abstract = {The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, which provides
   income support to individuals who become unable to work because of a
   disability, has not been substantially reformed since the 1980s, despite
   sweeping changes in health, medical technology, and the functional
   requirements of jobs. I review how the SSDI program works, its history
   in terms of caseloads and reforms, and findings from the research
   evidence that offer lessons for the future. I then propose two
   interlocking reforms that would modernize the core functions of the
   program. The first is to improve SSDI's process for determining whether
   an applicant has remaining capacity to work by replacing the outdated
   medical-vocational ``grid{''} with a new system of individual work
   capacity measurement. Second, I propose the introduction of partial
   disability benefits, which would make use of the new system for
   measuring work capacity and allow beneficiaries to combine benefit
   receipt with work. Partial benefits could be paired with a generalized
   benefit offset to further encourage work by beneficiaries, and the
   Social Security Administration's complex array of work-related rules
   could be eliminated.},

Abstract = {The Unemployment Insurance (UI) system is the largest general social
   insurance program for working-age individuals in the United States and
   currently insures more than 140 million workers against temporary income
   losses related to unemployment. UI has been the bedrock of U.S. social
   policy in recessions, but the system has remained largely unchanged
   since the mid-1970s despite substantial changes in the labor market that
   include deindustrialization, higher female participation, increases in
   wage inequality, and technological changes. This article summarizes
   existing empirical evidence on the state of the UI system and its
   effectiveness in achieving its stated goals. A range of reform proposals
   are discussed that aim to address both the well-known, long-term issues
   with UI, as well as UI's readiness to support the workforce of the
   twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {In much of the early literature on gender dimensions of disarmament,
   demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) processes - from the 1980s and
   1990s - the focus was on women as victims in conflict and DDR processes.
   This article reviews the literature on gender dimensions of DDR
   processes, exploring its many different topics - such as discussions of
   the definition of combatants, the political economy of DDR processes,
   group identity, cultural contexts, and masculinity - while focusing the
   discussion on the representation of female and male combatants of armed
   groups along the victim-actor axis. It furthermore analyzes the
   consequences of these representations for the way in which DDR processes
   are structured, and for who is allowed to participate in them. Finally,
   the article questions the push toward normalization in DDR processes and
   the neglect of progressive changes in gender relations within armed
   groups during war.},

Abstract = {This article discusses EU energy and climate policy through the prism of
   multidimensional power. In so doing, it explores the forms of power EU
   policy draws from and employs. The article argues that through its gas
   first policy the EU misused its productive power and failed to shift
   structural power dynamics, while overplaying its institutional and
   compulsory power to fulfil its energy/climate goals despite the EU's
   obvious limitations in the former and impotence in the latter. This
   mismatch between means and goals points to the need for an alternative
   power toolbox. This consists in the exercise of productive power to
   signify clean energy as the new normal; the use of coercive structural
   and market power to shape and regulate clean energy markets and the
   increased use of institutional power deriving from a comprehensive
   energy transition. This power toolbox relaxes the shortcomings of the
   EU's gas first policy, cements EU energy security and supports the
   global uptake of transitions to renewable energy.},

Abstract = {The Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) prosecuted an online campaign
   to undermine the 2016 US presidential election. It sought to accentuate
   existing social conflicts to affect the electoral behaviour of select
   groups. However, the IRA?s actual effect on the election outcomes, as
   assessed through its effect on its specifically targeted regions, was
   minimal. Nonetheless, the Kremlin successfully exploited the shock of
   Trump?s victory to exaggerate the apparent effect of Russian
   intervention. By seemingly fecklessly denying an apparently successful
   covert action, Moscow further challenged the legitimacy of the US
   election and degraded the coherence of US strategic decision making.},

Abstract = {Recent political events, ranging from the 2016 presidential election to
   the ``Women's March on Washington,{''} have brought women's interests
   and their representation in the political process to the forefront.
   Political representation, however, is a complex and nuanced process, and
   legislator time and energy are finite resources. Which contextual
   factors and personal characteristics then make legislators decide to
   focus their representational activity on one group of constituents
   rather than another? Looking at floor speeches for the 111th through the
   113th Congress, this study argues that while the extent and content of
   women's representation in the US House are fundamentally dependent on
   the gender and partisanship of legislators, the precise effect and
   interaction of gender and partisanship are shaped and conditioned by
   contextual factors, specifically a political environment of
   receptiveness to women in positions of political power. This has
   implications both for researchers trying to understand women's political
   representation as well as for citizens and political elites engaging in
   the process of representation.},

Abstract = {The need to define intelligence is understandable because the secrecy
   surrounding it can almost make it appear too amorphous to study. In most
   definitions, the authors not only attempt to define what intelligence is
   but also who does it. Until recently the focus has been on the state
   with occasional focus on sub-state actors such as law enforcement
   agencies. After 9/11 there was a shift from the study of inter-state
   intelligence to the use of intelligence against non-state actors such as
   Al Qaeda. The literature still treated these non-state actors as
   something to be acted upon rather than intelligence actors in their own
   right. By examining the North Vietnamese use of intelligence during the
   Second Indochina War this article takes a step to redress that
   oversight. This article will discuss the North Vietnamese use of
   intelligence in the context of definitions of intelligence and
   intelligence actors and will use John Gentry's proposed model of violent
   non-state actor intelligence as its analytical framework.},

Abstract = {While companies usually prefer private to hybrid governance, they
   sometimes transfer governance to governments. This paper assumes that
   this emerges from a decline in a firm's relative market position. It
   tests this assumption in a two-stage qualitative analysis: First, it
   conducts a fuzzy-set QCA of these decisions based on BP's Annual Company
   Reports. Second, it presents a process tracing of the voluntary
   self-nationalisation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Corporation. The paper
   produces three core findings: First, threats to a company's survival
   enable a preference reversal in favour of governmentalisation. Second,
   shareholder dissatisfaction is a crucial motivator for
   governmentalisation. Third, managers with an entrepreneurial role-model
   are more sensitive to autonomy costs and more likely to opt for
   unconventional governance options.},

Abstract = {Chile is one of the first countries to adopt, what later became known as
   neoliberal policies, and is therefore one of the most cited examples in
   critical IPE literature. The adoption of these reforms in Chile tended
   to be explained largely as an outcome of interplay between transnational
   ideas/culture embodied in Chicago-trained economists and domestic
   coercion (armed forces). Far less attention was paid to the
   transformation of domestic material interests and the complex domestic
   legitimation process which involved material concessions. The article
   pays attention to the emergence and strengthening of transnationally
   oriented fractions of capital within Chile during the dictatorship and
   their articulation within the state apparatus. It shows that
   internationalisation of Chile was a highly contested process, which
   although occurred in the context of the emergence of powerful global
   transformations and forces, essentially depended on the outcome of

Abstract = {This article argues that gender-equality policy may function to
   cultivate women's `psychological capital', that is, psychological traits
   that assist women in becoming better workers and therefore further the
   interests of capital. It assesses documents produced by the UK
   government's Body Confidence Campaign. First, the article finds that the
   campaign promoted narrow and corporate ideas about gender equality, only
   treating women's aspiration as valuable if it led them to pursue
   profitable and traditionally `male' professions. Second, it finds that
   despite campaign leaders' criticisms of initiatives that blame women for
   their own low self-esteem, in practice, the campaign ended up doing
   exactly this by portraying low confidence as a drain on society and
   instructing women and girls to `build resilience'. Finally, the article
   finds that the campaign allowed companies to receive credit for limited
   and temporary efforts to appear `woman-friendly' without overhauling
   their harmful marketing strategies in the long term.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament is an increasingly central actor in attempts to
   regulate surveillance and find the balance between safeguarding personal
   freedoms and ensuring EU citizens' security. However, virtually nothing
   is known about what drives the positions of MEPs on this issue, or about
   how the cohesion of European parties is affected by these attempts. We
   explore this subject and propose a novel theoretical framework focusing
   on the interplay between the characteristics of the two principals of
   the MEPs - European party groups and national parties. We tested the
   model by analysing the votes held on the two most salient directives
   adopted in this field. The findings indicate that national parties'
   ideological positions, and the differences between them and the European
   parties in the salience assigned to human rights and law and order,
   predict to a great extent both MEP votes on the directives and dissent
   from the European party line.},

Abstract = {This paper explains variations in education spending among
   non-democracies, focusing on policy interdependence by trade
   competition. Facing pressures from spending changes in competitor
   countries, rulers calculate the costs and benefits associated with
   increased education spending: education increases labor productivity; it
   also increases civil engagement and chances of democratization.
   Therefore, we expect that rulers in countries whose revenues depend less
   on a productive labor force and those with shorter time horizons are
   less likely to invest because of lower expected benefits; rulers with
   single-party regimes, authoritarian legislatures, and especially
   partisan authoritarian legislatures are more likely to invest because
   such institutions enable them to better survive the threats associated
   with increased human capital. We find empirical support for policy
   interdependence and the conditional effects of government revenue
   source, time horizon, and partisan legislatures.},

Abstract = {The concept ``targeted killing{''} has been increasingly adopted in
   scholarship, policy, and media discourses, particularly in the context
   of US armed drone attacks. While ``targeted killing{''} is often
   understood as something new, there are strong historical continuities
   with more traditional concepts such as ``assassination{''} and
   ``extra-judicial execution,{''} as well as with the colonial concept
   ``police bombing.{''} This paper builds on an analysis of over nine
   hundred Security Council debates, Human Rights Council reports, legal
   papers, and policy documents. Tracing the conceptual continuities, I
   argue that the peculiar novelty of ``targeted killing{''} does not
   mainly stem from the novelty of the practices and claims it describes
   but from the contradictory modes in which the term has been used, which
   has problematic repercussions for recent counterterrorism discourses.
   Posed as a new category that reacts to a new situation, the adoption of
   the concept ``targeted killing{''} has, I argue, played an important
   role in the promotion of claims that were long considered unlawful and
   illegitimate. Demonstrating the importance of language in setting
   political struggles up in a particular way, the paper contributes to a
   growing body of critical work on counterterrorism use of force.},

   Feedbacks That Distort Power and Derail Prospects},

Abstract = {The standard account of policy feedback holds that social policy can be
   self-reinforcing: policies provide resources that promote economic
   security and well-being, and they also encourage beneficiaries to engage
   with government. Criminal justice policies have typically had the
   opposite effect: they embolden those with interests in a punitive policy
   agenda, while disempowering those most affected by the policies. This is
   of particular concern for children and adolescents in race-class
   subjugated communities (RCS), whose first encounters with government
   beyond public schooling often come through police contact and carry
   adverse social and political consequences at a critical developmental
   stage. In this article, we reimagine youth engagement with the state,
   arguing for substantial reductions in police surveillance of young
   people and for the promotion of youth attachment to civic life. We call
   for an investment in institutions, both state-based and community-based,
   that reinforce political inclusion and civic belonging.},

Title = {The ``male{''} privilege of White women, the ``White{''} privilege of

Abstract = {This article is an intersectional analysis of race, gender, and
   nationality in development work. Using interview, document, and
   observational data, I situate this inquiry in the context of US women's
   work in the Peace Corps, an organization within a field marked by
   colonialism. I find that White women and women of color have similar and
   yet instructively different experiences of their gendered identities in
   field sites, because race and gender differently affect their identities
   and relative privilege abroad. Specifically, White women volunteers are
   often afforded some degree of ``male{''} privilege because of their race
   (though their race may render them vulnerable to sexual violence), while
   some volunteers of color are afforded a degree of ``White{''} privilege
   because of their nationality (although their race may also render them
   vulnerable to violence). However, because the Peace Corps does not
   challenge conventional race and gender privileges, it lacks the
   organizational orientation and capacity to effectively address safety
   and assault among its women volunteers.},

Abstract = {Critical feminist scholars of conflict and displacement have
   demonstrated that ``womenandchildren{''} (Enloe 1993) have become an
   uncontroversial object of humanitarian concern in these contexts
   (Carpenter 2003; Hyndman and Giles 2011). Yet very little scholarly work
   has attempted to understand the position of refugee men as a demographic
   within humanitarianism. Through an analysis of the Syria refugee
   response in Jordan, this article investigates how humanitarian workers
   relate to refugee men and think about refugee masculinities. It argues
   that refugee men have an uncertain position as objects of humanitarian
   care. Seeing refugee men as objects of humanitarian care would disrupt
   prevailing humanitarian understandings of refugeehood as a feminized
   subject position and of gender work as work that ``helps women{''}
   (Cornwall 2007; Johnson 2011). It would furthermore challenge prevailing
   binary visions of refugee men as agential, political actors, and refugee
   women as in need of ``empowerment{''} through the implementation of
   technocratic programming. In the context of the Syria refugee response,
   these gendered and racialized understandings of refugee men and
   masculinities are mediated by particular conceptions of ``Arabness.{''}
   This research is based on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative
   interviews with humanitarian workers and Syrian refugees, which was
   undertaken in Jordan in 2015-2016.

Abstract = {This Special Issue holds that managerialism is not an abstract,
   trans-historical category, and this article argues that neither is it
   hidden within an impenetrable black box. An important new form of
   managerialism is being revealed which is specific to what Moore and
   Joyce argue to be a very observable, and also widely contested, platform
   management model (PMM). Marx's `hidden abode' is a more appropriate
   metaphor than a black box, thus, given empirically demonstrable cases of
   control and resistance. Drawing on insights from labor process theory,
   the article reveals how control methods are at work, and transversally,
   how platform managerialism generates considerable levels of worker and
   union resistance. Despite its seeming inevitability and invincibility,
   platform managerialism is as knowable and as contestable, indeed, as
   contested, as other forms.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the determinants of citizens' trust in the
   European Commission. We examined four predictors of citizens' trust in
   political institutions: political participation, value congruence,
   performance outcomes and attributability of performance outcomes. We
   argue that these factors impact trust in the European Commission, which
   is a necessary precondition for making a risky investment and
   willingness to pay taxes, which can be understood as behavioural
   consequences of trust. To examine our hypotheses we have implemented a
   vignette study. Our analyses show that value congruence, the European
   Commission's perceived performance and attributability impact risky
   investments via trust, as expected. Political participation exerts a
   direct significant influence on risky investments.},

Abstract = {One of the key characteristics of Stalinism was the relationship between
   its formal and informal aspects. This is reflected clearly in the way in
   which, over time, the formal institutions of rule were supplanted by
   more informal mechanisms of decision-making. However, although the
   formal institutions seemed to atrophy, they were not abolished, but
   continued to become the basis upon which the post-Stalin leadership
   rested. The essay explains why one of those institutions, the Politburo,
   was maintained despite its atrophy as a decision-making organ,
   explaining this principally as a result of both strategic and tactical
   considerations.},

Title = {Economic self-interest, information, and trade policy preferences:
   evidence from an experiment in Tunisia},

Abstract = {We address a central question about the integration of developing
   countries into the global economy: what factors affect public support
   for such globalization. Do public preferences toward trade correlate
   with its economic consequences or sociocultural resonances? Using a
   nationally representative survey experiment in Tunisia, a majority
   Muslim, developing country, we investigate whether providing information
   about trade's distributional consequences causes respondents to connect
   their economic self-interest to their trade policy preferences.
   Respondents seem to understand their economic self-interest, and
   information provision enhances this. Information about the likely
   benefits of trade causes people in the export-oriented sector to respond
   more positively to trade liberalization, as economic theory predicts.
   Information about its costs has confounding effects on those in
   import-competing sectors; those involved in global value chains maintain
   support for trade more than those outside such production chains who
   become protectionist. We find scant evidence that sociotropic,
   political, or cultural variables influence trade attitudes. Contributing
   to the recent debates over trade policy preferences, we show that public
   preferences align most strongly with their economic self-interest as
   derived from recent trade theories.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of central counterparty clearing houses
   (CCPs) in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. To achieve this
   goal, this paper introduces the notion of infrastructural authority. The
   notion of infrastructure, borrowed from Science and Technology Studies,
   is employed to locate a form of private authority stemming from how
   power and legitimacy are exercised by enabling the performance of
   specific functions in financial markets. As OTC derivatives had become
   widely discredited after the crisis, regulators had come under strong
   pressure to reform what had grown to be a systematically important
   segment of the global financial system. G20 leaders thus responded in
   2009 by pledging to make the central clearing of standardized OTC
   derivatives mandatory to improve financial stability. Therefore, this
   study argues that the infrastructural authority of CCPs is politically
   contingent, originating from the statutory requirement of mandatory
   clearing in the OTC market. However, by reviewing specific moments in
   financial history, this study concludes that the infrastructural
   authority of CCPs may actually destabilize financial markets,
   undermining the G20's original intent to strengthen systemic stability.
   More generally, the research conducted in this study provides evidence
   of the changing nature of authority in financial markets following the
   2007-2008 financial crisis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {324-333},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This short essay offers a broad and necessarily incomplete review of the
   current state of the human rights struggle against torture and
   ill-treatment. It sketches four widespread assumptions in that struggle:
   1) that torture is an issue of detention and interrogation; 2) that
   political or security detainees are archetypal victims of torture; 3)
   that legal reform is one of the best ways to fight torture; and 4) that
   human rights monitoring helps to stamp out violence. These four
   assumptions have all played an important role in the history of the
   human rights fight against torture, but also resulted in limitations in
   terms of the interventions that are used, the forms of violence that
   human rights practitioners respond to, and the types of survivors they
   seek to protect. Taken together, these four assumptions have created
   challenges for the human rights community in confronting the multiple
   forms of torture rooted in the deep and widespread inequality
   experienced by many poor and marginalized groups. The essay ends by
   pointing to some emerging themes in the fight against torture, such as a
   focus on inequality, extra-custodial violence, and the role of
   corruption.},

Abstract = {During times of economic recession, migrants face long periods of
   unemployment or underemployment in destination countries. This
   information is transmitted to migrant-sending households via networks
   that link communities of origin and destination, letting potential
   migrants know that if they were to migrate they would likely experience
   low and unstable earnings, and that remittances normally expected from
   international migration might be placed at risk. In this event, there
   are few incentives for other household members to migrate. This study
   examines the effect that information sent through networks during
   recessionary times has in reducing the likelihood of out-migration,
   thereby explaining why Mexico-U.S. migration fell so suddenly with the
   onset of the Great Recession in the United States.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on generational differences in women's
   representation and hypothesize that younger generations of women should
   be more highly represented than older generations, both in general and
   within the same parliament. We tested this hypothesis with data on all
   members who have ever served in the European Parliament since 1979. Of
   the four generations who have ever served in Brussels and Strasbourg -
   the World War II generation, the 1968 generation, the post-1968
   generation and the post-materialist generation - we found both that
   women's representation increased with every generation and that their
   representation differs between generations within the same parliament.
   Finally, our results indicate that while these processes occurred
   roughly one generation later in eastern and southern Europe, yet, they
   happened faster in these parts of the European Union.},

Abstract = {Trade policies have been a contested aspect of economic globalization.
   Concerns arise over economic outcomes, political processes, and the
   balance of power between states and corporations. Religious actors are
   rarely studied in spite of their political discourse and engagement in
   trade policy debates. In this paper, I examine three faith communities
   in the Americas that have been engaged in debates over trade policies,
   specifically NAFTA, CAFTA and CA4FTA. I find that the Catholic Church in
   Costa Rica, the Presbyterian Church in the USA, and Kairos, an
   ecumenical justice coalition in Canada, have all been engaged in
   discussion and public action surrounding trade policies. Religious
   values of solidarity and community have been part of the discourse of
   these groups as they critique market foundations. However, the groups
   vary in the ways they understand their role in engaging the political
   economy. Options vary from 1) framing policy debates within key values,
   2) providing a lens with which to evaluate policy decisions and 3)
   taking action on behalf of an alternative economic order.},

Title = {The political economy of family policy expansion Fostering neoliberal

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1238-1265},

Abstract = {This article presents a new theoretical and empirical approach to
   understand family policy expansion in relation to the political economy
   of welfare state retrenchment and social reproduction in 23 OECD
   countries. From a Polanyian perspective, this expansion can be
   interpreted as a movement toward commodification and liberalization, and
   a countermovement of gender liberation. The first movement seems to
   characterize family policy expansion as a tool to foster neoliberal
   capitalism and the advent of a Schumpeterian Workfare State, conspiring
   with welfare state retrenchment to encourage employment within an
   environment of growing precarization. The second movement appears to
   assuage the social reproduction crisis. This countermovement seems to
   act as a cushion to soften the shift from a male income earner toward a
   dual earner model, supporting working parents in meeting escalating
   childare costs. Looking at the expansion of childcare spending and the
   retrenchment of minimum income guarantees for couples with children, an
   empirical illustration of this concomitant `double movement' reveals
   that the first holds sway over the second in most countries.
   Furthermore, household income and maternal levels of education impact on
   childcare usage, magnifying the negative distributional consequences of
   cutting minimum income guarantees in favor of childcare.},

Abstract = {Financial investment in the food and agriculture sector has grown in
   recent decades, including investment in equity-related funds that invest
   in or track the performance of a range of publicly traded transnational
   agrifood companies. At their height in recent years, equity-related
   investment funds accounted for around one third of financial investment
   in the sector. Despite their significance, investment in the agrifood
   sector via these types of investment funds has received much less
   academic and policy attention than other types of financial investment,
   such as farmland acquisition and commodity speculation. This paper
   examines the rise of equity-related investment in the agricultural
   sector and analyzes its implications for the food system. It provides an
   overview and analysis of the available data on these investment
   vehicles, including their holdings (i.e. the companies in which they
   invest) and ownership (i.e. the investors who own shares in those
   companies). This data shows a rise in common ownership of large agrifood
   firms by large asset management companies. The paper makes the case that
   this new pattern of investment in agrifood firms by large asset
   management firms has the potential to contribute to the already
   concentrated market power in the agrifood system.},

Title = {Cherry picking in the design of trade policy: why regional organizations

Abstract = {As states have established preferential trade agreements outside of the
   World Trade Organization over the past three decades, different designs
   have been developed: region-to-region, region-to-single state or
   state-to-state even if members belong to regional organizations. What
   accounts for this variation? Conventional approaches which focus on
   domestic politics provide no fully sufficient explanation for this
   variation. I argue that coherence within regional organizations, or a
   lack thereof, triggers design changes between inter-regional and
   bilateral. More specifically, I hypothesize that a lack of coherence
   within a region leads to the adoption of a bilateral design by the
   negotiation partner in situations where this partner competes with other
   states for a trade agreement with the same region. I test my argument on
   interactions of the European Union (EU) with regional organizations in
   Asia and Latin America by employing rigorous process-tracing and
   interviews with negotiation officials from all three regions. The
   findings show that the EU shifted from trade negotiations with these
   regional organizations to singling out member states when regional
   coherence faded. This was part of an attempt by the EU to advance
   commercial interests against its competitors China and the United States
   in these regions.},

Abstract = {The practice of humanitarian military action has changed markedly in the
   21st century when compared with the 1990s. This essay explores three
   broad trends that have shaped this evolution. First, the UN has adopted
   the protection of civilians as a central element of its agenda and as a
   guiding principle for reforming its peace operations and its responses
   to atrocities such as genocide and ethnic cleansing. Second, major
   powers have played a central role as belligerents or patrons of
   belligerents in many of the worst conflicts of the last two decades. And
   third, the wealthy Western states with the greatest resources and
   military capabilities for ambitious humanitarian operations have
   substantially reduced their direct contributions to these missions.
   Together, these developments have shifted the balance of responsibility
   and effort for humanitarian military operations toward the UN and
   developing countries; constrained the ambitions of these missions;
   limited what they can accomplish and contributed to gaps between the
   expectations they create and the protection they are able to deliver;
   and discouraged meaningful action in response to many of the century's
   most devastating conflicts.},

Abstract = {In this article, we address the question of how electing women to
   national or subnational parliaments affects future female candidate
   selection in an open-list proportional representation system, using the
   example of Poland. We consider three potential effects of electing a
   woman. First, based on existing theories of the incumbency advantage,
   elected women should have higher chances of reselection and reelection
   in future elections (incumbency effect). Second, as a result of becoming
   more powerful within their party, elected women might have a stronger
   influence on future list composition, and thus more women should run for
   office on these lists (empowerment effect). Finally, we argue that other
   parties might adjust their candidate selection patterns in response to
   the election of women on other party lists (contagion effect). We find
   strong evidence for the incumbency effect and some support for the
   contagion effect. The empowerment hypothesis, however, finds no
   empirical support.},

Title = {Numbers in regulatory intermediation: Exploring the role of performance
   measurement between legitimacy and compliance},

Abstract = {Much regulatory intermediation has come to entail forms of calculation
   and performance measurement. In this paper we analyze the role of
   performance measurement in regulatory intermediation in a transnational
   multistakeholder setting where intermediation lacks an official mandate.
   We do this through a study of the Access to Medicine Index, which ranks
   pharmaceutical companies in terms of their access to medicine policies
   and practices in developing countries. We conceptualize multistakeholder
   intermediaries as ``second order rulemakers{''} reconciling diverse and
   often competing implicit and explicit rules across the governance field.
   We then detail various intermediation roles of performance measurement
   between attaining input and output legitimacy and enticing compliance
   among targets. Our case demonstrates how the selective formalization of
   measurement processes and the related ability to move back and forth
   from the role of intermediary to that of ``ad hoc rulemaker{''} are
   important conditions for achieving and maintaining legitimacy.
   Furthermore, it shows that for multistakeholder intermediaries that rely
   on performance measurement, compliance by targets depends on the uptake
   of performance information by powerful constituencies. This illustrates
   how addressing legitimacy concerns and enticing compliance through
   performance measurement should be examined as co-emerging processes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-127},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We most commonly encounter the word defiance when used as an adverb to
   classify a peculiarly courageous or risky act of resistance. However,
   the use of the word defiance in this way is a departure from the
   historical meaning of the word. Moreover, it occludes the possibility
   that there exists political activity that is manifestly defiant. The
   article takes issue with this tendency and identifies a mode of
   resistance that is explicitly defiant. In order to do this, the paper
   draws from the phenomenological approach underpinning the standing
   sculptures of the British sculptor Antony Gormley. This informs an
   exploration of the protest enacted by the standing man of Taksim Square,
   who participated in a large antigovernment movement in Turkey in 2013.
   In acts we might distinguish as defiant, the paper demonstrates the
   materialist vulnerability of the protesting body, the aesthetic ontology
   at work, the prevalence of the standing metaphor, the role of silence,
   and the absence of futurity. By unearthing defiant modes of protest, the
   heterogeneity of resistance is affirmed, and a new domain where art
   encounters the political is revealed.},

Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-176},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {China has for almost four decades been experiencing a market transition
   and an associated tax state transition, leading to the emergence of
   capitalists who increasingly control economic resources and serve as
   important sources of tax revenue. Some theories suggest that these
   changes should give capitalists political power. From the perspective of
   the taxation institution, using a mechanism-based case study, this
   article investigates whether China's emerging capitalists have gained
   bargaining power with the party-state. Findings suggest that hidden
   bargaining, patron-clientelism, legislature co-optation, and legal
   repression constrain their bargaining power. The underinstitutionalized
   taxation system has co-opted the capitalists through patronage and, more
   important, deterrence, thereby building an asymmetric mutual dependence
   between the local state and capital owners.},

Abstract = {Injecting over two trillion dollars into the international economy, the
   Federal Reserve effectively operated as an international lender of last
   resort during the 2008 financial crisis. Over half a trillion dollars
   went to foreign central banks through bilateral arrangements known as
   Central Bank Liquidity Swaps. While studies show that a key determinant
   of a country's chances of receiving Fed liquidity was the exposure of US
   banks to the foreign economy, the literature overlooks the ambiguous and
   politicized nature of the Fed's decision-making that explains the
   selection of emerging market swap recipients. Through a consideration of
   all economies that officially requested a swap line, including those
   rejected, this article analyses the bilateral politics of Fed swaps. By
   evaluating transcripts of the Fed's deliberations, it identifies
   strategic motivations underlying the Fed's decision-making and argues
   the Fed was more likely to grant a swap to economies that shared its
   policy preferences for greater capital account openness. Further, the
   article argues that the influence of shared policy preferences was
   mediated by political and diplomatic considerations. The article
   concludes that the Fed strategically chose its emerging economy partners
   to reinforce economic alliances, particularly with those who experienced
   increased influence in economic governance post-2008.},

Abstract = {This article provides a definitive, in-depth case-study, using primarily
   Russian sources, of Russia's use of the informal ``Wagner Group{''}
   private military company (PMC) and its antecedents (from 2012 to 2018)
   in Nigeria, Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, and the Central
   African Republic. It explores why Russia has used this group without
   legalizing its existence or role. While Wagner is sometimes used in the
   same ways that other rational states use PMCs, corrupt informal networks
   tied to the Russian regime have also used it in ways that are not
   typical of other strong states and that potentially undermine Russian
   security interests. Understanding the Wagner Group is interesting for
   comparative academic studies of PMCs, because Wagner doesn't fit well
   any existing PMC category or template in the literature. It is also
   crucial for US and allied policy analysts attempting to attribute
   ``Russian{''} actions in foreign theaters.},
