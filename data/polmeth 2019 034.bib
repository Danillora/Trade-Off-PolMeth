Abstract = {While the EU takes on an increasingly global regulatory role, we have
   only a limited understanding of how or when foreign firms influence EU
   regulation. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) have many of the power
   resources that determine lobbying success. We argue, however, that high
   salience blunts foreign corporate power. High salience generates
   legitimacy concerns for EU institutions, creating a political
   opportunity structure that favours pluralistic participation. Civil
   society can point to the instrumental power of foreign firms as a means
   to contaminate business interests, amplifying consumer voices in the
   process. We label this the MNC-Coalition paradox. We investigate the
   European Union's General Data Protection Regulation to assess our
   argument, as the revelations made public by Edward Snowden created an
   exogenous shock in salience. Highlighting the presence of MNCs - such as
   Google and Facebook - in the lobbying process allowed civil society
   leaders to delegitimize business preferences and bolster consumer
   protection. In addition to the theoretical contribution, our evidence
   sheds light on the policy process behind legislation that will shape
   fundamental civil liberties and privacy rights not only for Europeans
   but globally.},

Abstract = {This article examines how religious affiliation shapes support for
   European Union membership. While previous research has shown that
   Protestants are typically more eurosceptic than Catholics, little is
   known about the nature of this relationship: specifically, whether
   religion affects one's utilitarian assessments of the costs and benefits
   of membership, or one's affective attachment to the EU. Using the 2016
   British Election Study Referendum Panel, this article shows that
   religious affiliation influences both sets of attitudes, suggesting that
   the values and shared history associated with one's religion shapes how
   a voter perceives the performance of the EU in delivering its policy
   objectives, and its operation as a legitimate institution. Moreover,
   some findings from previous research are challenged: Protestants are not
   as unified in their scepticism of the EU as is widely assumed, and the
   positive relationship between Catholicism and support for EU integration
   is not apparent in the UK.},

Title = {Chinese migrant wives in Taiwan: claiming entitlements, resisting

Abstract = {A considerable number of Chinese women have migrated to Taiwan through
   marriage over the last two decades. Although the demographics of these
   marriage migrants have transformed over the years, a misunderstanding
   still exists as migrant wives are seen as commodities and gaining
   citizen status is seen as their ultimate goal. Using in-depth
   interviews, this research takes a bottom-up approach by allowing Chinese
   migrant women in Taiwan to define and interpret their own citizenship.
   It explains how they negotiate the politics of citizenship as they
   confront harsher immigration restrictions than immigrants of other
   origins because of their Chinese identity. This paper suggests that
   immigrants' intersectional identities shape their conceptualization of
   Taiwanese citizenship, although their agency is limited. My findings
   illustrate that some Chinese migrant wives embrace citizenship
   entitlements while others' experiences with citizenship differ depending
   on their positionality in both the private and the public. My findings
   also show that some migrant wives actively reject Taiwanese citizenship,
   challenging the myth that all Chinese immigrants desire Taiwanese
   citizenship. This study contributes to citizenship and migration studies
   using a feminist, intersectional approach and raises implications for
   the degree to which migrant wives have agency in constructing their
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {What impact does the size of the ethnic minority population have on the
   representation of women in national legislatures? We examine this
   question by using provincial-level data from 32 Latin American and
   postcommunist countries. Our study finds that the size of the ethnic
   minority population shapes female legislative representation but only in
   candidate-centric electoral systems. In party-centric systems, any
   gender bias or resource disadvantage that female legislative candidates
   face in minority areas appears to be muted by electoral rules.},

Abstract = {Gender mainstreaming measures adopted by armed forces have gained
   scholarly attention for the ways in which they ascribe meaning and
   relevance to military institutions, perform national identities and
   order international politics. This article analyzes how gendered and
   sexualized subjectivities and symbols are mobilized in recent marketing
   campaigns launched by the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF). In these
   campaigns, Sweden is performed as a ``progressive{''} nation/state whose
   citizens hold values, rights and freedoms considered ``extreme in the
   eyes of others,{''} thus being in need of protection by the SAF. This
   notion of Swedish progressiveness-often constituted as equality between
   people of all sexual orientations and gender identities-is epitomized in
   the campaign slogan ``Sweden, a country to fall in love with/in.{''}
   This article probes how performative enactments of a gender-exceptional
   nation works within broader discursive terrains constituting a military
   institution undergoing large-scale transformations. We argue that
   constructions of a tolerant and modern Sweden (re)produce treacherous,
   single narratives of distant and dangerous Others and risk making
   invisible domestic discrimination on the basis of gender identity and
   sexual orientation, ultimately enabling the ongoing rearmament and
   reterritorialization of the SAF.},

Abstract = {Boom-bust cycles in the eurozone periphery almost toppled the single
   currency and recent experience suggests that they may return soon. We
   check whether monetary or macroprudential policy could have prevented
   the periphery's violent boom and bust after the euro adoption. We
   estimate a DSGE model for the two euro area regions, core and periphery,
   and conduct a series of historical counterfactual experiments in which
   monetary and macroprudential policy follow optimized rules that use
   area-wide welfare as the criterion. We show that single monetary policy
   could have better stabilized output in both regions, but not the housing
   market or the periphery's trade balance. In contrast, region-specific
   macroprudential policy could have substantially smoothed the credit
   cycle in the periphery and reduced the build-up of external imbalances.},

Abstract = {The increasing abundance of information regarding human rights and
   international humanitarian law violations presents a significant
   challenge for transitional justice processes. This information is
   valuable and actors need to adopt new technology to preserve, interpret
   and present it for future use. We consider the Sri Lanka Conflict
   Mapping and Archive Project and suggest future options for implementing
   technology in preparatory work for transitional justice processes.
   Technology can increase the efficiency of acquiring and systematizing
   data, and it can facilitate speed and consistency in complex content
   analysis. Importantly, it can also present data in a way that is
   accessible and intuitive for a variety of purposes, while still
   reflecting its complexity. The transitional justice sector can greatly
   benefit from examining the technologies that are being implemented in
   the broader human rights field, identifying developments useful for
   collecting, analyzing and presenting documentation for use in
   transitional justice processes.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This article critically examines how moral emotions are intrinsically
   tied to the process of apportioning blame and credit in postconflict
   societies. In doing so, it draws out the complexity that underpins moral
   emotions during key junctures in transitional justice. Recognizing that
   moral emotions naturally stem from the making of a judgement about a
   target,' the article argues that the relationship between those
   experiencing the moral emotion and the target' fundamentally determines
   whether the target' becomes the object of blame or credit during seminal
   moments of transition. Through using a focused empirical case study, the
   article identifies why and how changes over time in the relationships
   between the judgemental self' and the target,' in personal and political
   identities, and in perceptions of what is and is not moral, influence
   the moral emotions expressed by different versions of the judgemental
   self' towards the target.'},

Abstract = {Since 1945 the number of multilateral development banks (MDBs) has
   increased at a linear rate, with approximately one new MDB created every
   three years. The proliferation of MDBs has resulted in an inefficient
   duplication of international institutions with overlapping functions.
   Further, this trend contradicts our existing understanding of why states
   create countervailing international organizations. This article proposes
   a novel, two-step theoretical model of institutional change and creation
   in an attempt to explain this empirical puzzle. Utilizing the
   complementarities of rational-choice and historical institutionalism,
   the model demonstrates that the rational actions of states in the past
   can lead to seemingly irrational institutional change in the future.
   This process results in the repetitive creation of countervailing MDBs
   designed to solve the same functional problems. To evaluate the model's
   hypotheses, three case studies are undertaken, employing archival
   material, internal documents, and 48 interviews conducted by the author
   in London, Washington, D.C. and Manila, Philippines. The empirical
   results are of direct interest to policy-makers currently negotiating
   the structure of new MDBs in Asia and Latin America.},

Abstract = {Contemporary discourse on sexual(ized) violence in armed conflicts
   represents a powerful source for legitimization of highly controversial
   military interventions. Recent gender-responsive security studies have
   called for enhanced protection of women and girls from widespread and
   systematic sexual(ized) violence. Yet military operations reproduce the
   Western masculine hegemony rather than providing inclusive and
   apolitical assistance to victims of sexual assault. The article aims to
   critically assess discourse on sexual violence in a case of military
   intervention in Libya initiated under the rubric of the Responsibility
   to Protect (R2P). The case study indicates a set of discursive
   strategies exercised by Western political representatives and
   nongovernmental organizations and even more expressively by the media to
   legitimize the military campaign. Typically, sexual(ized) violence is
   presented as a weapon of war, used by one of the conflicting parties
   without an adequate response of the state. This is followed by urgent
   calls for international action, willingly carried out by Western powers.
   The simplified narrative of civilized protectors versus savage
   aggressors must be challenged as it exploits the problem of sexual(ized)
   violence in order to legitimize politically motivated actions.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The article draws on insights from feminist literature, science and
   technology studies (STS) and governmentality studies to explore how
   technologies introduced through agricultural research for development
   (ar4d) participate in performing gender. Drawing on gender audits of two
   international agricultural research institutions, we discuss the
   performativity of three types of technologies: material technologies
   intended to increase agricultural productivity, such as new seed
   varieties; social technologies, such as household surveys and evaluation
   techniques used to monitor projects; and political technologies, such as
   participation, deployed to enlist farmers in the adoption of
   productivity-enhancing material technologies. We show that all three
   technologies participate in performing gender as they are introduced
   into rural environments, sometimes in interaction with an ``apparatus of
   gender{''} that emerges from gender mainstreaming. But performances are
   not uniform, producing both an iron cage of hierarchical gender dualism,
   but also enactments that exceed the vision of the apparatus, blur
   binaries and diffract the realities they project in unanticipated
   directions.},

Abstract = {This policy and practice note explores the possibilities of a vision of
   human rights protection that conceives of universities as human rights
   actors. This vision is situated in the broader human rights context, in
   which it is increasingly recognized that non-traditional human rights
   actors, rather than only the central government level, also bear
   responsibilities in the field of human rights. Given their crucial
   societal role, it is argued that universities should similarly take up
   their human rights responsibility. This note will present the case study
   of the human rights policy of Ghent University (Belgium), which applies
   to that university's international relations, as a good practice of how
   the human rights responsibility of universities can be operationalized.
   The paper concludes with a number of critical reflections.},

Abstract = {Gender-equality work in Sweden is increasingly carried out by private
   consultancy firms. In this article, we explore the rationalities that
   govern Swedish market-based gender-equality policy through an analysis
   of the subject positions that are made available to gender-equality
   consultants. The article is an adapted version of our published work in
   Swedish. We analyse what types of agency these positions enable and
   preclude, as well as how they shape the meaning of gender equality and
   the content of gender-equality work. While market logics constrain the
   space for critical analysis and cause gender equality to be subordinated
   to other goals, consultants nevertheless find ways to resist these
   tendencies in pursuit of transformative change.},

Abstract = {This essay engages critically with the personal narratives of rodina
   (home, motherland) among Russian-speaking youth in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan. It is argued that the concept of rodina as an important
   locus of belonging cannot be imbued with a single meaning; instead, it
   is characterised by internal conflicts and variations. Supported by
   empirical material, the essay moves beyond the confines of `nation' and
   `nationality' to illustrate the different ways in which Russian speakers
   frame their perception of rodina, and how such narratives can influence
   the construction of self- and community-identification.},

Abstract = {A growing body of academic and policy research seeks to understand and
   address the problem of contemporary unfree labour. In this article, we
   argue that this literature could be strengthened by a stronger
   conceptualization of, and more systematic attention towards, the role of
   national states. In particular, we argue that there is a need to move
   beyond simplistic conceptualisations of states as simple agents of
   regulation and criminal justice enforcement who respond to the problem
   of unfree labour, and to recognize the causal and multifaceted role that
   national states play in creating the conditions in which unfree labour
   can flourish. We propose a framework to understand and compare the ways
   in which national states shape the political economy of unfree labour.
   Focusing on the United States, we outline three arenas of governance in
   which national states have been particularly central to enabling the
   conditions for unfree labour: the regulation of labour mobility, labour
   market regulation, and business regulation. We conclude by reflecting on
   the comparative political economy research that will be required to
   understand the role of different states in shaping the conditions in
   which unfree labour thrives or is eliminated.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we examine the connections between media use and trust
   strategies, and the identity development of the Russian-speaking
   populations in Estonia and Latvia in the context of the political crisis
   in Ukraine. We argue against the levelling, uniform view of
   Russian-speaking audiences as being completely under the influence of
   Russian media and thereby politically identifying themselves with the
   Kremlin. We present a typology of Russian-speaking audiences, explain
   how they construct their identities as audience members within these
   types in times of political crisis, and discuss how this
   self-identification as audience members shapes the development of
   broader civic and ethnic identities among the Estonian and Latvian
   Russian-speaking populations.},

Abstract = {The Philippines' long democratic experience has been remarkably free of
   deeply politicized cleavages. Roman Catholicism as a hegemonic religion
   prevents religious polarization, ethnic identity fragmentation limits
   ethnic polarization, and weak parties forestall ideological or class
   polarization. Nevertheless, the country suffered a crisis of
   polarization during the short-lived Estrada presidency (1998-2001) and
   that of his successor, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010). The severe
   conflict was a product of power maneuvers by anti-Estrada forces,
   followed by anti-Arroyo actors returning the favor, given her gross
   abuses of power. Echoing Machiavelli's famous distinction, the conflict
   pitted Estrada's popoli (the many) against Arroyo's oligarchic grandi
   (the few). This Machiavellian conflict ended with an oligarchic
   reassertion of Madisonian democratic rule through the electoral victory
   of Benigno Simeon Aquino III in 2010. We conclude the article by
   considering whether the populist challenge of current president Rodrigo
   Duterte (2016- ) might spark a similarly destabilizing conflict in the
   years to come.},

Abstract = {Women's rights advocates, in southern Africa as elsewhere, have
   challenged gender inequality to advance the status of women in society
   and as a means to also address related, cumulative issues of
   disadvantage. As communication technologies and neoliberal globalization
   alter forms of communication, the potential for organizing, coalitions,
   and advocacy work across time and space, such as through transnational
   feminist networks (TFNs), has grown. Understanding the rise of TFNs has
   largely relied on historical narratives and case studies, and the
   literature has tended to emphasize transnational over regional
   dimensions. Our approach, however, finds that regional connections not
   only play an important role in linking TFNs to local women's rights
   initiatives in southern Africa, but that information-rich academic
   institutes focusing on gender studies bring structure to local and
   regional information networks in the region and act as bridges between
   the local, regional and global. Methodologically, we employ an
   innovative approach to visibly capture the work of regional and local
   activists by taking a meso-level snapshot of website links among 70
   women's rights organizations operating in southern Africa. We pair the
   network visualization with a case study of our central academic center,
   the African Gender Institute, to demonstrate the work of this critical
   hub in the local and regional communication network.},

   recommendations are presented. The text begins with analyzing the
   terrestrial strategic goals of European states and agencies, followed
   with their manifestation in the space domain, and continuing with the
   description of European space capabilities that will lead to the section
   dedicated to the SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
   analysis of the European space program. Finally, the propositions for
   the European space strategy based on the implicitly followed strategic
   principles are presented.},

   sharing all it could find with its close partner, the UK. Despite the UK
   offering little intelligence material in return, it secured detailed US
   intelligence reports on Japanese BW war crimes, and colluded with the
   United States to keep these Japanese war crimes a secret.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how selfish justifications enter cosmopolitan
   rationales in the political plane of the discourse. It makes sense of
   the ways in which selfish ideas are allowed to meddle in and merge with
   morally-based cosmopolitan norms. The article commits to the ontological
   and epistemological premises of critical discourse analysis, and focuses
   on us presidential papers since 1989. It substantiates the claims it
   makes by using computer-assisted discursive process tracing method as a
   supporting tool for qualitative analysis of texts. The computerised
   analysis of discursive entanglements reveals that cosmopolitan
   protective operations are in fact mainly framed nationalistically. The
   roots of such selfish nationalistic arguments for international
   protective military operations can be traced in the realist and
   hegemonic fallacies that emphasise the naturality of national
   selfishness and the need for global hegemony. Furthermore, the article
   shows how the entanglement of discourse strands about `protection' and
   `innocent victimhood' as well as the entanglement between `crime
   prevention' and `terrorism prevention' legitimate selfish
   internationalist arguments in the us political debate.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers the contribution of student debt to inequality in
   student participation. Debt is often portrayed as a tool for equality,
   but at least in New Zealand, student debt seems to be entrenching
   inequality among students. Part of this inequality is economic, but the
   accounts of the students also suggest that this disparity extends to
   participation in public life. Inadequate financial support formed real
   barriers to political engagement for some students, and also contributed
   to a lack of social networks and experiences of isolation. I argue the
   twotiered participation of New Zealand students suggests universities in
   context of high debt may be less likely over time to be `politicising'
   environments. I also make the case that this inequality in participation
   lends weight to the value of more universal forms of student support,
   rather than approaches that seek to target student assistance more
   effectively.},

Abstract = {Sensorimotor-based concepts (SBCs), a variation of political metaphors,
   are frequently used in political discourse. The particular challenge
   with these kinds of metaphors is that for a long time they have kept a
   low profile. SBCs are basic level concepts and can be used, not only
   frequently, but also iteratively to convey a subliminal story line. The
   present paper seeks to call attention to SBCs and to the extent to which
   this subgroup of metaphors orchestrates a wide range of precise,
   persuasive functions, by discussing differences in their usage during
   the French and U.S. presidential campaigns; in particular, in the
   speeches of Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump before and after their
   respective election.},

Abstract = {This article exposes a new form of global governance based on an
   emergent network of corporate social responsibility (CSR) schemes. Our
   study is the first to uncover the network structure of this system,
   based on a dataset that includes 61 transnational CSR schemes and 31,987
   firms. We demonstrate that the network exhibits a significant level of
   cohesiveness, despite having evolved without any form of hierarchical
   control. Drawing on a social network analysis, we find a positive
   correlation among the sustainability performance of the firms, their
   membership in CSR schemes, and their network characteristics. We show
   that membership in multiple schemes and the firms' position in the
   CSR-schemes network constitute credible predictors of their
   sustainability performance, generating a separating equilibrium that
   distinguishes high from low CSR performers. We develop a model that
   explains the effectiveness of the CSR-schemes network based on the
   synergistic properties of the network and on a distinctive signaling
   dynamic. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of CSR to the
   resolution of global governance dilemmas.},

Abstract = {Studies identify cost as a key factor determining the effectiveness of
   economic sanctions. We argue that failing to account for market dynamics
   in the sector in which sanctions are imposed undermines the validity of
   estimates of the economic costs imposed on target countries, and we
   propose that market structure powerfully conditions sanctions
   effectiveness. To examine the effect of market structure, we trace the
   causal path through which economic sanctions purportedly lead to
   targets' behavior changes, and we reveal the prevalence of adjustments
   that minimize the cost to the target. Our empirical data is drawn from a
   sanctions episode that can be evaluated as a best-case scenario for the
   imposition of effective economic sanctions: China's 2010 embargo of rare
   earth elements supply to Japan. We show that Japan was able to adjust to
   avoid the Chinese sanction's bite despite the dominance of Chinese
   producers and Japan's seeming vulnerability as a key downstream consumer
   of rare earths. Our results show that measures of economic cost that
   fail to capture key components of market structure are not valid in
   assessing sanctions effectiveness, and the ability to impose economic
   costs on target countries is limited.},

Abstract = {In this article I analyse the EU's social status in world politics. I
   argue that recognition grants the EU both club and positional status.
   Drawing on existing literature on status in international relations, I
   conceptualize the diplomatic corps of various polities as the embodied
   recognition of their positional status in world politics. To indicate
   and measure the positional status of the EU, I applied social network
   analysis to data on the exchange of embassies from 1960 to 2010. This
   methodology allows for consistent longitudinal comparisons of standing
   between heterogeneous polities in world politics. The results indicate
   that the EU's rise in the status hierarchy has been meteoric since 1960.
   However, fear of status congestion and status dilution among countries
   has thwarted the EU's full inclusion into the various status clubs of
   nation-states. I show that due to its lack of full club status the EU
   struggles to convert its high positional status into influence.},

Abstract = {The debate around the production and circulation of feminist knowledge
   has been rekindled since the emergence of the Women, Peace and Security
   (WPS) agenda. While much attention focuses on the diffusion of WPS
   norms, less is paid to the sociocultural context within which feminist
   ideas circulate through WPS gender-mainstreaming (GM) interventions, its
   broader implications, and what happens beyond. I propose a double
   reading of GM as a site of feminist knowledge production and
   circulation: I combine anthropological and feminist governmentality
   insights to analyze GM as a form of (disciplinary) governing with
   insights from post/decolonial scholars that call for an engagement with
   the ``exteriority{''} of interventions, with what lies outside our grid
   of intelligibility of the narrow political terrain of GM. Through a case
   study of the post-conflict GM intervention in Liberia, I illustrate how
   this double reading reveals the ways in which GM works as a gendered
   form of governing to prescribe dualistic social roles and (re)produce
   social differentiation mechanisms linked to ``civilization.{''} An
   engagement with the exteriority of the GM intervention reveals critiques
   and alternative forms of feminist knowledge production and circulation
   that emphasize non-dualistic and non-judgmental attitudes and propose
   invited partnership and dialogue.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) acquired over
   1,200 material submissions through the gifts it received at its events.
   Though other TRCs mention objects in their records, the gift-giving
   practice that became central to TRC events in Canada was unprecedented,
   and so is its large collection of TRC-gifted objects today. The Canadian
   TRC is thus unique and faces the challenges of categorizing, preserving,
   displaying and honouring these material artefacts. What has been the
   post-TRC life of these objects and art pieces? What is their role in
   creating a collective memory of residential schools and how might they
   promote reconciliation? This article shows that the post-TRC life of the
   objects opens up new museological spaces and practices through the ways
   the objects are curated (or not) for remembering and learning about
   residential schools according to Indigenous protocols and ways of
   thinking and feeling.},

Abstract = {The events preceding the 2013 Maidan protests exemplified Russia's use
   of its economic power over Ukraine. In trying to prevent Kyiv leaving
   its orbit, Moscow threatened economic rupture and closed borders, used
   phytosanitary and technical norms to impose import bans, and demanded
   swift payment of Ukraine's debt to Russia. Accompanying these negative
   measures were incentives: Russia promised Ukraine significant
   concessions in the form of loans or preferential trade treatment. As a
   result of this pressure, President Viktor Yanukovych, against his own
   preferences, refused to sign the Association Agreement with the European
   Union. Nevertheless, Moscow's pressure did not succeed in compelling
   Yanukovych to join Russia's Eurasian Economic Union.},

Abstract = {Prior research, polling, and accounts from female politicians themselves
   suggest that with greater representation by women comes a less
   confrontational leadership style with a greater willingness to reach
   bipartisan compromise. If women are more willing to work across party
   lines and compromise than their male counterparts, a state?s budget
   process should benefit from greater representation of women in the state
   legislature. This article examines all budget enactments in the American
   states from 1993 to 2006, focusing on both the occurrence and duration
   of budget failures (impasses), specifically examining if greater
   representation by women reduces gridlock and ensures the timely passage
   of a budget. While the findings offer some support that increasing
   female representation, in particular in the political minority, makes a
   government more collaborative only after it fails to pass its budget,
   the impact of gender ultimately is considerably nuanced depending both
   on polarization and distinct differences by legislative chamber.},

Title = {Cultivating ?new? gendered food producers: intersections of power and

Abstract = {This paper advances a critical gendered analysis of the ways in which
   food-producing identities are constructed and mobilized in Trinidad.
   Utilizing a historical and intersectional feminist lens, it shows how
   gendered identities and subjectivities both shape and are shaped by the
   political economy, and are intimately intertwined with race, class, and
   nation. The research draws on fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016.
   Through historical analysis of secondary literature and visual analysis
   of a billboard campaign that attempted to cultivate ?new? images of
   farmers and agriculture, it shows how traditional Caribbean identities ?
   informed by distinctive colonial legacies ? are both reproduced and
   reformulated in the contemporary neoliberal era. The paper argues that
   the construction of food-producing identities is a complex combination
   of colonial history, positionality, self-making and aspiration, and how
   actors encounter, experience and engender these has implications for how
   we understand relations between the state, capital and food producers.
   It makes three key contributions. Firstly, it enriches Feminist IPE
   scholarship with an intersectional analysis of situated gendered
   identities and their relationship to political-economic processes beyond
   class. Secondly, it highlights the importance of studying peripheralized
   regions in the global South and applying the insights of their feminist
   scholars for understanding broader power relations in the Global
   Political Economy (GPE). Finally, it demonstrates how an intersectional
   framework can shed light on why local food and agricultural policy plays
   out in distinct ways.},

Abstract = {Although Islam is described as a fundamental aspect of Kyrgyz national
   identity, its theological aspects are generally elided in nationalist
   discourse. However, as Islam becomes more prominent in Kyrgyz society,
   anxieties about `Arabisation' and the weakening of national traditions
   permeate popular and political discourse. These anxieties operate
   simultaneously in the national and religious registers, suggesting the
   extent to which theological beliefs inform national identity, even in
   secular states. Examining a recent controversy over veiling in
   Kyrgyzstan, this article argues that theology is both linked to
   nationality and also a site of contestation over the terms of
   nationalism itself.},

Title = {Trickle-down gender at the International Monetary Fund: the
   contradictions of ``femina economica{''} in global capitalist governance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},

Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {What forms do gender equity arguments take in major international
   institutions? What broader struggles do these reflect? What
   contradictions does gender mainstreaming reproduce and what feminist
   possibilities does it open up? This contribution describes, critiques,
   and tentatively explains the recent understudied ``gender turn{''} in
   the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Fund, a major international
   financial institution. The IMF's concern with gender is late compared to
   other multilateral institutions, like the United Nations and the World
   Bank. Nonetheless, since 2013, the IMF has published more than 2,900
   documents, videos, and podcasts specifically about women, alerting the
   public to gender equity matters through a dedicated ``Gender and IMF{''}
   homepage and through Twitter, via the hashtags \#Women4Growth and
   \#IMFGender. In so doing, the IMF draws on existing, economistic
   ``women's empowerment{''} initiatives by major finance and corporate
   enterprises, in newly opened policy space following the 2008-09 crisis,
   under unprecedented feminist leadership at the highest level of the
   Fund. The IMF's attentiveness to gender, pursued alongside market-led
   economic efficiency aims, produces a new actor, ``femina economica.{''}
   This elastic figure is symptomatic of tensions within the organization
   and of broader contradictions in the current, uncertain moment of the
   capitalist world political economy.},

Abstract = {While the literature on business power and global finance has
   illuminated the ways in which financial institutions limit the policy
   autonomy of states in developing countries, we know much less about the
   circumstances under which the power of financiers is undermined. In this
   article, I advance explanations of these circumstances by arguing that
   state access to natural resource revenues reduces the power of financial
   institutions and enhances the capacity of the state to pursue central
   bank policies which violate the interests of major financiers. I employ
   a case study of central bank policy in Nigeria to probe this argument
   and find evidence that supports the claim that whenever the Nigerian
   government's access to resource revenues increased, the state's capacity
   to diverge from financiers' preferred central bank policies and to
   advance its own preferences increased as well. The analysis provides the
   basis for broader propositions about the policy space of developing
   countries vis-a-vis financial institutions and the variability of
   structural power.},

Abstract = {The literature on the effects of investment in broadband infrastructure
   finds positive macroeconomic effects. However, it is severely
   constrained because it could hitherto only analyse investment or
   adoption up to basic broadband, but not up to the newer generations of
   hybrid fibre and end-to-end fibre-based broadband. Utilizing a
   comprehensive panel dataset of EU27 member states for the period from
   2003 to 2015, we estimate a small but significant effect of end-to-end
   fibre-based broadband adoption over and above the effects of basic
   broadband on GDP; specifically, we find that a 1 per cent increase in
   adoption leads to an incremental increase of 0.002-0.005 per cent in
   GDP. The incremental effect of hybrid fibre broadband adoption over
   basic broadband is slightly lower (0.002-0.003\%). Our cost-benefit
   analysis implies that policy intervention - as foreseen by the European
   Commission - is only justified for coverage and adoption levels of
   around 50 per cent, whereas for a 100 per cent coverage level net losses
   are likely.},

Title = {Uber uber regulation? Regulatory change following the emergence of new

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {340-361},

Abstract = {Can emerging technologies transform not only markets, but also foster
   new regulatory change mechanisms? In the context of prevailing theories
   of regulatory change, this article explores the extent to which an
   interest-based explanation can account for the regulatory responses
   toward emerging Transportation Network Companies (TNCs). Based on a
   primary cross-city analysis of the 40 largest cities in the United
   States, the study found that although the existence of ex ante interest
   groups indeed somewhat limited the extent of ex post regulatory
   acceptance of TNCs, regulators seemed to prefer the newcomers over
   existing incumbents and approved TNCs in 77.5 percent of the examined
   cities, rarely pursuing harsh enforcement even when TNCs operated
   illegally. The research attempts to explain this intriguing phenomenon
   by extending the interest-based approach to account for the key role
   played by ``technological regulatory entrepreneurs.{''} The
   entrepreneurs bridged collective action barriers by becoming the central
   agent that managed, and reaped the benefits of, the collective action,
   by lowering the organizational costs and by disseminating information
   effectively and turning consumers into political campaigners, thus
   successfully promoting regulatory change.},

Abstract = {A growing literature explores the causes and consequences of dramatic
   political protests in autocracies. Yet, we know comparatively little
   about other forms of protests in these regimes. The Lankina Russian
   Protest-Event Dataset (LAruPED) facilitates the investigation of protest
   in Russia, a classic example of an electoral authoritarian regime. The
   data, which are human-coded, identify, in wave one, protests across
   Russia from March 2007 until 2016. Unlike other datasets, which focus on
   political protests, LAruPED covers a wide range of social and economic
   protests and imposes no limitations on the minimum number of protesters
   involved in events as a prerequisite for inclusion in the dataset. We
   introduce LAruPED and discuss how it differs from other data. We also
   present examples from work that leverages the dataset to show how the
   data could be used to explore questions of authoritarian politics,
   highlighting variation in the type of suppressed protests in electoral
   autocracies.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to debates on the political economy of
   global health by offering a `planetary' perspective. We initially sketch
   contestations concerning improvements, inequalities and inequities in
   the state of global health in order to move towards a more integrated
   conception of significant social forces driving transformations in
   health, society and ecology. We then explore key agencies (e.g. large
   energy and pharmaceutical corporations; sympathetic governments) and
   structures of contemporary capitalism to interrogate their impacts on
   health care and ecology, for example in driving global pollution and
   climate change. We propose that such forces play a significant role in
   an unprecedented planetary organic crisis. Finally, we suggest that the
   world has reached an historical crossroads, necessitating a significant
   change of direction to promote a more ethically and ecologically
   sustainable, socially just future and argue for new paradigms of health
   that are `planetary' in scope and perspective.},

Abstract = {Russia, Hungary and Poland have been at the forefront of the illiberal
   counter-movement to neoliberalism. However, while there is increasing
   knowledge about how `populism' as a discursive strategy has brought
   illiberals to power, especially in Poland and Hungary, we know
   surprisingly little about the socioeconomic programme and guiding
   principles of illiberals. In this article, we argue first that there is
   such a programme and that - notwithstanding the differences between
   countries - it features a similar programmatic core in the three
   countries that took shape in conservative think tanks and guides
   socioeconomic policy recommendations. Second, this programmatic core is
   best understood not so much as populism, but as a combination of
   economic nationalism - subordinating the economy to national interests
   and to the imperative of protecting national identity - and
   conservatism, reorienting economic policies to serve the traditional
   family and undo the perceived wrongdoings of post-communist elites, in
   particular, privatisation. We call this core conservative developmental
   statism. Thus illiberalism is reducible neither to populism nor to the
   whims of the power-holders of the day, and in these countries it needs
   to be seen in a wider context in which rightwing intellectuals have been
   working in parallel with politicians to give illiberalism a conservative
   content.},

Abstract = {The three decades following Stalin's death in 1953 witnessed a dramatic
   expansion in Soviet tourism to the other countries of the European
   socialist bloc. Youth tourism in particular was an important feature of
   efforts to build friendlier and more durable links with the satellite
   states at the grassroots level. However, the prospects for long-term
   success in this endeavour were continually hampered by Soviet concerns
   about the dangers of interaction, and as the years passed, the economic
   benefits of tourist travel rather than the initial goal of building
   solidarity were accorded priority.},

Abstract = {Workers' rights violations have been pervasive in many global supply
   chains. In the apparel sector, production workers often face precarious
   working conditions, including persistently low pay, excessive and often
   forced overtime, unsafe buildings, and repression of their right to form
   unions and bargain collectively. This article explores how purchasing
   practices of lead firms adversely affect working conditions and workers'
   rights in supplier factories. It attributes these trends to a price
   squeeze and a sourcing squeeze in which lead firms pay increasing lower
   prices to suppliers while also imposing short lead times and high order
   volatility. To test this argument, trade data of apparel imports to the
   United States and the European Union are explored. The article then
   turns to original surveys of Bangladesh supplier factories and workers
   carried out in 2016 and 2017. The final section of this paper examines
   the impact of the squeeze on working conditions and workers' rights
   using the Labour Rights Indicators.},

Abstract = {This article studies changes in the preferences concerning restrictions
   on minority foreign ownership of equities among powerful groups of
   domestic asset holders in Russia. In three episodes between 1992 and
   2006, local business interests opposed the easing of the rules for
   minority foreign ownership while they competed for control over disputed
   assets. Once they gained outright control of those assets, the winning
   groups began favoring lowering the barriers to portfolio investment
   inflows that would allow them to access liquidity and investment, and
   also aid their efforts to legitimize ownership rights. This account of
   financial integration in Russia suggests that domestic economic elites
   change their preferences with respect to financial openness policies
   depending on the outcome of ongoing contests for control over the
   relevant assets. Scholars of financial globalization in developing and
   emerging market economies should consider how contestability of property
   rights in the absence of the rule of law can influence the preferences
   of key domestic groups toward policies that enable or restrict the
   process of financial internationalization.},

   Chechens},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {71},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1705-1733},
Abstract = {This article presents the views of emigre Chechens on the reasons behind
   the particular patterns of demographic growth of Chechnya. The main
   driving force, identified by the respondents interviewed in the
   research, is the fear of national extinction. The traditional obligation
   for Chechen men to defend the homeland adds another explanation: the
   Chechen respondents consider demographic growth to be related to
   preparedness for war. Both explanations are related to the perception of
   Russia as an imminent threat. A range of other factors was mentioned by
   smaller numbers of respondents. The article concludes that Chechen
   demographic growth is related to the unresolved Russo-Chechen conflict.},

Abstract = {Brexit has reopened and repoliticised the debate about future growth
   models for the UK economy. This contribution argues that this debate is
   built around historically specific path dependencies that reflect the
   particular character of public debate about British political economy,
   while also suggesting that the debate around Brexit takes place at a
   very distinctive moment in the history of democratic capitalism in
   Europe. This combination gives the renewed politicisation a specific and
   perhaps perverse character. The paper considers how we should approach
   debates about growth models, paying particular attention to the
   importance of the politics of support. It suggests that recent debate
   about growth models has been largely subsumed within the politics of
   Brexit, which has politicised that debate, albeit through the emergent
   political economy frames that Brexit has provoked. The paper explores
   the ways in which the demise of three key props of European democratic
   capitalism - a sustained period of economic growth, a governing
   philosophy that subordinated the market to wider social purposes and
   strong political parties - play out in the context of Brexit and the
   search for a new politics of support.},

Abstract = {This article builds on the growing literature on lobbying in a
   multilevel context. Whereas previous studies have sought to explain why
   national groups start lobbying at the transnational level, this articles
   examines the policy positions of interest groups once they are active at
   this level. The main argument is that group type is a key factor for
   explaining the level of interest group support for states, yet the
   effect of group type is conditional on the institutional and issue
   contexts. The data for analysis are derived from 198 interviews
   conducted with representatives from businesses and NGOs at the
   Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization and the UN
   Climate Summit negotiations in 2011 and 2012. The results confirm that
   business groups support states much more often than NGOs do. Yet, the
   amount of support varies substantially across a country's level of
   development and democracy, and the salience of issues.},

Abstract = {In power, the Vietnamese Communist Party has experienced three `moments'
   of growth, each with some differences of detail and of meanings:
   `traditional communism'; the transition from a planned to a market
   economy in the 1980s; and, since 1992, a `socialist-oriented market
   economy'. For each, the article discusses the ideologically defined
   nature of change; intentionality-'how growth was to happen'; and the
   quantitative data used. It suggests that critiques throughout the period
   have engaged with the intentionality issue: in the first moment, by
   isolating the socialist relations of production within socialist
   construction as the cause of difficulties; more recently, by engaging
   with the lack of effective policy despite contemporary ideology's
   unreliable belief in policy as key to growth.},

Abstract = {Scholars of comparative politics have increasingly turned to parties to
   explain the variation in women's representation. However, the literature
   has not fully considered that green parties may provide unique insight
   into women's representation due to their longstanding ideological
   attachment to feminism. To understand the question of women's
   representation in green parties, this analysis examines green parties in
   20 European countries. Relying on data from party websites and
   quotaproject.org, the following categories were examined: the inclusion
   of women in leadership positions, the inclusion of enforced gender
   quotas in party structure, the inclusion of women's party member
   organizations, the structure of recruitment processes, and the content
   of party platforms. The results show that European green parties
   maintain a higher level of commitment to gender equality than their
   individual parliaments. This piece contributes to the growing literature
   on green parties by examining the ideological connection between green
   parties and feminism, as well as studying a larger cross-section of
   green parties than previous studies.},

Abstract = {South Africa had a small, highly classified nuclear weapons program that
   produced a small but potent nuclear arsenal. At the end of the 1980s, as
   South Africa was nearing a transition to black majority rule, the South
   African government destroyed its nuclear arsenal and its research
   facilities connected with nuclear armaments and ballistic missiles. This
   article, based on archival research in the United States and South
   Africa, shows that the South African nuclear weapons program has to be
   understood in the context of the Cold War battlefield that southern
   Africa became in the mid-1970s. The article illuminates the complex
   U.S.-South African relationship and explains why the apartheid
   government in Pretoria sought nuclear weapons as a deterrent in the face
   of extensive Soviet-bloc aid to black liberation movements in southern
   Africa, the escalating conflict with Cuban forces and Soviet-backed
   guerrillas on Namibia's northern frontier, and the attacks waged by the
   African National Congress from exile. A clear link can be drawn between
   the apartheid government's quest for a nuclear deterrent, liberation in
   southern Africa, and the Cold War.},

Abstract = {In 2013, the Governor of the Bank of England heralded that the Bank of
   England is `open for business': ready to buy and sell every asset it can
   value, thereby adjusting the role of the Bank of England to the demands
   of market-based finance. This article examines this re-articulation of
   the role of central banks in financial markets, situating it in the
   context of the recently enacted Basel III regulatory reforms. By placing
   a regulatory price on private liquidity provision, Basel III hampers
   broker-dealers' market-making capacity and the liquidity of assets used
   as collateral in repo-transactions. The BoE aims to counter these
   fragilities of market-based finance, providing a potential backstop for
   market prices. Endorsing entrepreneurial principles, a hallmark of
   neoliberal reason, this hybrid mode of external and internal
   intervention establishes a new balance in the relationship between
   central banks and private market actors. Our paper complements analyses
   which showed that such liquidity-providing interventions of central
   banks are of institutional necessity by highlighting how regulators and
   central bankers engage with this task. We show that the `cultivation of
   market liquidity' is driven by the intention to transform shadow-banking
   into a value for society, therefore accepting to engage in an
   investment.},

Abstract = {Feminist cringe comedies eschew the conventions of romance and
   sentimentality in favor of comedy that discomforts. Cringe comedies are
   one example of what I call feminism's visual realisms, so named for
   doing feminist political work by evoking laughter and the cringe. The
   cringe pulls us inward in our posture, while laughter opens us to
   others. This bodily response to cringe comedies interrupts the fantasies
   of the male gaze and makes space for spectators to acknowledge the
   excessive, complicated, and seemingly shameful realities of female
   desire. My primary example is Jill Soloway's television adaptation of
   Chris Kraus's I Love Dick, a series that builds on the feminist legacy
   of avant-garde director Catherine Breillat. Departing from politically
   correct narratives and comforting or sentimental affect, I Love Dick
   achieves feminist community through the appeal, the cringe, and the
   irruption of laughter.},

Title = {Regulating drinking through alcohol taxation and minimum unit pricing: A
   historical perspective on alcohol pricing interventions},

Abstract = {Discourse on alcohol policy in several countries has recently become
   dominated by discussions of pricing. In Britain, proposals for a minimum
   unit price for alcoholic drinks are frequently depicted as radical and
   new. However, other means of legally intervening in alcohol pricing have
   long been used to shape consumption habits. Key to recognizing this
   historical lineage is a conceptualization of taxation as partly a form
   of regulation. This article builds upon findings from a wider historical
   study of alcohol excise duties in England and Wales to develop an
   empirically-based typology of the main forms of government interventions
   in alcohol pricing. By connecting some instances of alcohol excise
   taxation to government attempts to shape behavior, this typology enables
   advances in understanding of the relationship between taxation and
   regulation. In so doing, the article also provides an original
   historical perspective on an ongoing policy debate. (c) 2017 John Wiley

Abstract = {This article makes the case for recovering women's roles from the
   forgotten corners of diplomatic history, and for considering the
   consequences of the gap between feminist and non-feminist research. It
   shows how ignorance of the gendered nature of diplomatic norms and
   practices impacts our understanding of diplomatic history, and how
   specific biographies are hampered by gender blindness in particular.
   Using the history of Margaret van Kleffens and Dutch World War II
   diplomacy as an example, the article demonstrates how historians'
   continued neglect of the role of women and gender norms has influenced
   representations of twentieth-century diplomacy. To dismiss the history
   of gender and of women as by definition irrelevant to the actions of
   states and of male statespersons is not simply part of a self-appointed
   focus on the political at the expense of the personal; rather, it omits
   much of the political history too, reproducing stereotypes and resulting
   in a skewed understanding of diplomatic history and foreign policy
   decisions. The article argues that both historians and feminist scholars
   need to historicize gender in order to recognize women's roles in
   diplomacy, and so gain a better understanding of the history of
   international politics as a whole.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the erstwhile historical reliance upon the
   memoirs of the key protagonist of British Scientific Intelligence during
   the Second World War. Meticulous archival research has confirmed that
   the history of the genesis of British Scientific Intelligence has been
   distorted by the legacy and legend of R.V. Jones and his memoirs
   entitled Most Secret War. This article confirms that British
   Intelligence success in this regard was not solely the result of one
   man's heroic accomplishments but, in reality, involved many individuals
   and organisations whose valuable exploits have been hidden in the
   shadows by Most Secret War.},

Abstract = {The literature on party positions on European integration and the
   closely related literature on Euroscepticism rely largely, from a
   methodological point of view, on coding of election manifestos and
   expert surveys/judgments. This paper opts for a different approach to
   study party positions on European integration based on an analysis of
   variation of the metaphors used by political parties in the discourse
   about the EU political finality. On the basis of key conceptual
   metaphors used in the discourse on EU finality that are identified in
   the relevant literature as well as the corpus itself, we analyze Czech
   political parties' election manifestos issued for the 2004, 2009 and
   2014 European Parliament elections. The analysis is then connected to
   party positions on European integration.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the identitarian context of Russia's cinematic
   narratives on the war in Chechnya. It draws on various strategies of war
   representation through films and uncovers their ideological and
   political underpinnings. The author explicates how the cinematographic
   imagery grounded in the Chechen war experience boosts the hegemonic
   discourse of the Kremlin, and then discusses whether fictional films
   deliver critical or counter-hegemonic arguments.},

Abstract = {This chapter considers the types of politics New Zealand students
   preferred to engage with when they had a student loan. Many students
   actively adopted a more guarded and careful type of politicsmemorably
   described by one student as applying the `precautionary principle' from
   environmental management to their political participation. I suggest
   that to a limited extent student debt acted as a type of discipline for
   these students, encouraging a deliberately cautious type of political
   agency that tended to be uncontroversial in its approach and measured by
   what other actors external to the university considered acceptable. Yet
   neither were students entirely `robbed' of their political imagination.
   Far from it. I make the case that in a context of debt New Zealand
   students are demonstrating considerable creativity in opening up new
   spaces for participation that pragmatically enable them to engage
   politically without compromising their future security.},

Abstract = {Many countries now operate state-funded international broadcasters,
   communicating directly with foreign publics to promote a variety of
   foreign policy goals. RT (formerly known as Russia Today) is currently
   one of the most prominent broadcasters in a crowded field. What is RT's
   strategy, the size of its audience, and the effectiveness of its
   broadcasts in implementing its strategy? To answer these questions, we
   explore a case study of RT's YouTube programming utilizing a new dataset
   of 70,220 video titles spanning the 2 years from February 2015 through
   January 2017. RT's three-prong strategy focuses attention on strategic
   groups outside the West, including Arabic, Russian, and Spanish
   speakers, circumvents local media in target countries to promote Kremlin
   aims, and spreads a positive image of Russian accomplishments,
   particularly in Syria, which it considers a foreign policy success. The
   data presented here show that RT's strategy is only partially successful
   since it underperforms among Arabic speakers, its main target, while
   doing relatively better among Russian, global English, and Spanish
   audiences.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to examine how the U.S. interests
   regarding Thule Air Base have changed in the post-Cold War period.
   Initially, various U.S. bases in Greenland were established or
   strengthened to counter the Soviet threat in the early stages of the
   Cold War. Therefore, when that threat receded, it was expected that
   their strategic importance would diminish dramatically. However, by the
   end of the 1990s, the U.S. recognized the increased missile capabilities
   of ``rogue states,{''} accelerating the deployment of the missile
   defense system. Thus, the value of Thule Air Base increased as a key
   part of the system, affecting the trilateral negotiations between
   Washington, Copenhagen, and Nuuk. The U.S. military bases in Greenland
   also serve as hubs for scientific research concerning the Arctic region,
   although this feature affects base politics less directly than do
   military factors, due to third-party influences, such as civilian
   infrastructure and international cooperation.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Fire safety has traditionally been regulated by prescriptive rules that
   stipulate requirements according to the type and size of a building,
   with the regulator's job being to check that these rules have been
   followed. However, many jurisdictions now allow performance-based design
   regulation in which approval depends on the regulator assessing the
   prospective performance of a bespoke fire safety design for a particular
   project. Regulators thus need to be able to adjudicate on the knowledge
   claims put forward by fire safety engineers, but most regulators lack
   the knowledge to interrogate claims that are often the product of
   complex mathematical modeling across a range of disciplines. This
   expertise asymmetry poses a challenge for the effective regulation of
   fire safety designs, and the relative immaturity of fire safety
   engineering as a profession needs to be addressed before it would be
   wise to rely on professional competence and ethics alone to ensure
   safety.},

Abstract = {How did ethnic Azeris in the Marneuli, Bolnisi and Dmanisi districts,
   located inside Georgia but bordering Azerbaijan, react to the
   reorganisation of political space along national lines after the Soviet
   Union's dissolution? `Beached' in foreign states bent on nationalising
   their domains, minorities throughout Eurasia sometimes rejected and
   sometimes accepted their alien rulers. This essay examines reactions to
   this predicament among Georgia's Azeris. Drawing on elite interviews and
   data from a matched-guise experiment, it concludes that locals have come
   to accept their host state after its state-building nationalism took an
   inclusive turn and the distinction between aliens and natives faded.},

Abstract = {On 12 July 2018, the central government of the Netherlands changed its
   approach relating to traveller camps in the Netherlands. This change
   constitutes a huge political shift, as the government had previously
   adopted a `hands-off' and `repressive-inclusion' strategy, which was
   especially known for its infamous `phase-out policy' or `extinction
   policy' of traveller camps. This has now been replaced by a fundamental
   rights-proof approach that facilitates the travellers' way of life. This
   article aims to uncover the various actions undertaken by international
   and national actors that seem to have contributed to the Dutch
   government's changed stance. It looks particularly at the role played by
   four national actors: the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights, the
   National Ombudsman, the Public Interest Litigation Project, and activist
   Roma, Sinti and travellers and their various interest groups. The
   article concludes that these actors' efforts to establish political and
   legal change were successful as they addressed the same issue from
   different vantage points and through different means. That is, they all
   focused on the issue of the incompatibility of the phase-out policy with
   fundamental rights standards and relied on a variety of means available
   to them (such as litigation, lobbying, reporting, raising international
   awareness, and ensuring media coverage). By drawing some general lessons
   from this case study, this article aims to contribute to the existing
   literature on mobilizing human rights. In particular, it focuses on the
   (legal) activities national actors can undertake to bring about
   political and legal change in order to enforce the compliance of
   national authorities with fundamental rights standards in both law and
   policy.},

Abstract = {This article provides a better understanding of victims'
   individual-level agency and their differences in terms of transitional
   justice preferences and capabilities by inquiring into
   intra-organizational conflict. While it is primarily conceptual, it
   combines secondary literature with case study material from Colombia and
   Panama, converging on Latin America as a geographical area and the crime
   of forced disappearance. Tracing the evolution of the 2004/2005
   fragmentation of the Colombian Association of Relatives of Detained
   Disappeared Persons, it argues that victims' collective action and
   perceived homogeneity is a performance that builds on much internal
   negotiation between members. When deliberations have clear winners, they
   end in adjustments of the mission statement of the group, purges and
   voluntary member withdrawal, but fragmentations result from situations
   where the leaders of opposing coalitions are evenly matched and their
   proposals equally engaging to peers.},

Abstract = {In recent years, central banks have continued to preach inflation
   targeting even as they have pursued a wide range of unorthodox
   inflation-management policies. As the disconnect between discourse and
   practice grows, there is a growing risk of a serious credibility gap.
   This article seeks to shed some light on these dilemmas by looking
   backwards, focusing on the `Great Inflation' in Britain in the 1970s and
   early 1980s and the successive failures of Labour's incomes policy and
   the Conservatives' monetarist experiment. These historical experiences
   suggest that for inflation policy to work it needs to be both understood
   as and made credible-which means that key actors need to not only learn
   that this is how the inflation game works, but also put into place a
   whole range of supporting practices that reflect and reproduce this
   conviction. In spite of the many claims by economists and central
   bankers to the contrary, quantitative targets do not in fact anchor
   inflationary expectations - social practices instead play that crucial
   anchoring role. At the same time, these cases both underline the
   particular dilemmas associated with a reliance on hard quantitative
   targets in times of social instability - lessons that do not bode well
   for our present moment.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions can regional and international courts (ICs) make
   decisions against their governments' preferences? To answer this much
   debated question, we develop a new, majoritarian model of state-IC
   relations. It posits that in cases where well-established ICs' positions
   are congruent with policy-specific public opinion in leading member
   states, ICs can rule against their governments' position. We apply our
   approach to a series of landmark decisions by the Court of Justice of
   the European Union (CJEU) regarding United Nations sanctions against
   terror suspects. We find that the CJEU was able to harness growing
   public support to strengthen terror suspects' rights, punish states for
   superficial compliance with its rulings and ultimately broaden the
   Court's judicial review powers. Our analysis suggests that ICs can be
   agents of legal change and advance human rights against governments'
   resistance, but this role is conditional on the presence of public
   support.},

Abstract = {The debate on the Sustainable Development Goals framework offered a set
   piece for civil society organizations/CSOs to challenge institutions
   such as the EU. This article maps and analyzes how the EU's framing of
   trade policy in the SDGs related to that of European CSOs. The process
   is understood in terms of the interaction of different forms of
   ideational power. Key lines of contestation emerged over the question of
   constraining market forces. The lead EU institutions adopted some of the
   CSO's moral economy discourse but used various techniques to insulate
   trade policy from interventionist thought. They allocated a new range of
   responsibilities to developing countries, ignored numerous political
   issues and rejected calls for more regulatory global governance from
   CSOs and the European Parliament. To do so they were able to deploy a
   range of ideational and institutional powers. However, EU trade policy
   remains full of contradictions and potential `rhetoric traps'.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the British referendum to leave the European Union
   and the European Commission's `White Paper on the Future of Europe', it
   is not only time to take stock of the existing literature on
   differentiated integration, but also to rethink the perimeters of
   disintegration. We argue that phenomena such as Brexit embrace forms of
   differentiation which trigger the need for conceptualizing
   differentiated disintegration altogether. This article first sketches
   the path of the scholarly debate in a chronological way to grasp the
   breadth of existing literature. Second, it discusses differentiated
   disintegration as a potentially new area for research. Mapping several
   scenarios for future research, we propose that differentiated
   (dis)integration needs to be conceived as a negotiated, but profoundly
   path-dependent process, which is structurally locked-in, and deeply
   conditioned by pre-existing organizations and institutions of European
   integration.},

Abstract = {We aimed to explore the extent to which women and men politicians tweet
   about different issues. We captured 82,890 tweets sent by Labour and
   Conservative politicians during the 2017 British general election
   campaign, analysed 38,255 original tweets and identified 7,651 tweets
   that mentioned a political issue. We also qualitatively analysed 210
   tweets to better understand the content, tone and orientation of
   content. We suggest that gender and party, both together and separately,
   exert some influence on tweet topic. However, we also suggest that the
   particular interests of individual politicians play a role in
   determining the focus of their issue-based tweets.},

Abstract = {This article offers reinterpretation of the current economic and
   political crisis through the lens of Gramsci's concept of
   ``interregnum,{''} departing from the model of ``punctured
   equilibrium{''} to analyze the specific political dynamics of
   nonhegemonic periods between the breakdown of one ideological order and
   the emergence of a new one. Although political science has a range
   theories about periods of hegemony and paradigmatic stability, the
   periods between stable hegemonies remain distinctly undertheorized. A
   theoretical concept describing periods of interregnum is offered and
   applied to the changes in economic ideology and political alignments
   that followed the breakdown of the liberal order in the interwar period
   and the postwar Keynesian consensus of the 1970s. The concept is then
   applied to the current juncture, in which the hegemony of neoliberalism
   has been shaken by the 2008 financial crisis but no clear successor has
   emerged.},

Abstract = {Regulatory behavior and effectiveness in authoritarian settings are
   subject to alternative characterizations. By tracing enforcement
   processes through a variety of case studies, this article proposes and
   refines a new model, at least with respect to energy efficiency
   regulations in China: authoritarian but responsive. Local rulemaking and
   operationalization is authoritarian, with strong and coordinative bodies
   of regulation, strategic plans, and active involvement of local
   authorities. Local authorities, however, often find themselves facing a
   welter of laws imposed on companies that create competing priorities for
   these local officials who then must struggle to find pragmatic
   solutions. On numerous occasions, such satisficing behavior by local
   officials makes them responsive to the performance and demands of
   regulated firms. Embedded in the decentralized authoritarian context,
   the authoritarian but responsive approach is found to be a rational
   choice of local governments and different from previous
   conceptualizations. It helps local governments coordinate across a
   diverse array of regulatory issues. Drawing on environmental enforcement
   in China, the model provides consistent explanations for the seemingly
   changing and discretionary enforcement incidents.},

Abstract = {The article explores the role played by the Visegrad Group-a
   multilateral platform of four Central and Eastern European states (the
   Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia)-in the Brexit process. It
   surveys the group's performance during two distinct phases of the Brexit
   process: first, David Cameron's EU renegotiations and, second, the first
   phase of the Article 50 (withdrawal) negotiations, ending in December
   2017. The author concludes that while the group managed to maximise its
   clout in the case of EU renegotiations, it has been much less effective
   during the withdrawal negotiations in the period under study.},

Abstract = {In the 1980s some thirty members of paramilitary groups in Northern
   Ireland both republican and loyalist, agreed to provide evidence against
   their former colleagues in return for a reduced sentence or immunity
   from prosecution, a new identity and life. Such individuals became
   commonly known as `supergrasses'. This article drawing on archival and
   documentary research explores the potential opportunity these supergrass
   trials provided for republican paramilitary groups to gather open source
   intelligence on their loyalist counterparts. It also tracks whether
   individuals named by loyalist supergrasses were subsequently targeted by
   opposing paramilitary groups on their acquittal or release from prison.},

Abstract = {How is the perception of the state authorities affected when aneconomic
   downturn interferes with citizens' patriotic unity? Whichreaction takes
   the upper hand: a ``rally around the flag,{''} born ofgeopolitical
   success, or grievance over economic misfortune? Bymeans of a survey
   experiment, we aim to explore the mechanismsof blame and credit when a
   rally around the flag coincides witha major economic downturn, and we
   estimate the effects of theCrimean events and the economic crisis on how
   Russians assessthe performance of federal political institutions. Our
   findingssuggest that economic hardships are attributed exclusively to
   thegovernment and the State Duma, while it is only the president
   whobenefits from the rally around the flag. Moreover, the
   presidentreceives an additional benefit when the ``patriotic unity{''}
   primingmeets the ``economic hardship{''} priming, thereby resulting in
   adouble rally around the flag effect.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {749-772},

Abstract = {In response to the ongoing legitimacy crisis of investor-state
   arbitration, the European Union (EU) developed a new model of
   investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) that replaces international
   arbitration with a system of bilateral investment courts. In this
   article, we draw on literature on the role of legitimacy in driving
   institutional change in international institutions to explain the rise
   of the new EU model. We further examine the extent to which the new EU
   model is able to overcome this crisis, thereby potentially giving the
   ISDS a new legitimation. We argue that the new EU model in large part
   does provide a substantial response to several frequently contested
   legitimacy gaps of ISDS. At the same time, however, we suggest that the
   EU model does not effectively address the most fundamental criticism of
   ISDS, which questions the very existence of a specific judicial forum
   providing exclusive rights for international investors, particularly
   between states with highly developed economies and legal orders.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the issue of the French financial system design
   based on a historical analysis of the development of the fund management
   industry. It recounts how the main banks have become leaders in the
   global asset management industry. This success relies on a long-term
   institutional evolution towards a hybrid model and the ongoing close
   relationships between banks and the State since the end of World War II.
   The establishment of a friendly institutional framework for the bank
   intermediation expansion was rooted in the seizure of power by reformist
   civil servants in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, who would later
   become heads at the Treasury and the main banks. We also argue that the
   State's ability to develop new forms of interventions, especially during
   financial liberalization and European construction, has been crucial in
   the development of a competitive fund industry. Finally, we show that
   the State's and banks' interests have driven the hybridization process
   of the fund sector and that the fund sector serves primarily the State's
   interests and the funding needs of the financial sector at the expense
   of the real economy.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a fresh approach to debates on democratic
   backsliding and European Union (EU) influence in East Central Europe
   (ECE), drawing on the discursive institutionalism of Vivien Schmidt.
   Underlying assumptions about backsliding in CEE largely reflect a set of
   ideas derived from the rational institutionalist and historical
   institutionalist schools. Moreover, the same theoretical assumptions
   were previously deployed to explain the apparent success of
   democratization and EU leverage in CEE. A discursive institutionalism
   perspective, stressing the role of actors and their discourses in making
   and unmaking institutions, suggests that democracy in CEE was always
   less secure than assumed. It also highlights the key role of liberal
   mainstream parties in embodying democratic institutions. Case studies of
   the liberal centre-right in Bulgaria and social democrats in the Czech
   Republic highlight the way background ideas of ethnically exclusive
   titular states have increasingly impinged on foreground ideas of liberal
   pluralism.},

Abstract = {This article investigates linguistic traces of changing trends in the
   substantive representation of women, as well as broader representational
   claims related to constituencies, via an analysis of all backbench
   questions posed during Prime Minister's Questions in the UK House of
   Commons during 1979-2010. We investigate the impact of sharp increases
   in female MPs, in particular, left-wing female MPs, and the presence of
   a left-wing government on MPs' talk about women and about
   constituencies. We find no evidence of curvilinear trends in talk about
   women related to changes in government and female parliamentary
   presence. We also find that female MPs can be considered critical actors
   with regard to constituency talk.},

Abstract = {The principles of the best interest of children and subsidiarity
   constitute the conceptual foundation of the Convention on Protection of
   Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (HCIA).
   Subsidiarity in the HCIA dictates a priority for domestic adoption
   placements for children over intercountry adoption. This article argues
   against subsidiarity on two fronts. First, the analysis shows that the
   in-principle priority of domestic adoption cannot be justified on the
   basis of either heritage rights or state sovereignty. Second, the
   principle of subsidiarity in the HCIA is a procedural principle, one
   that stipulates the political/geographical location of the placement of
   children through a priority ordering. This does not comport with the
   principle of subsidiarity as it has been conceptualized in ethics and
   social philosophy, which gives normative structure to the process of
   decision-making by stipulating the proper level for decisional
   authority. Subsidiarity in this original sense holds that decisions
   regarding child welfare should be made at the lowest level possible, by
   those most affected by the decisions, unless doing so would not be the
   most suited to protecting and promoting the best interests of children.
   Appealing to subsidiarity in this theoretical version reveals at least
   two significant problems with HCIA placement policy and leads to the
   conclusion that subsidiarity in the HCIA must be formally revised as a
   structural principle of ethics that will not support the general
   priority of domestic adoption.},

Title = {Revolution from Below: Cleavage Displacement and the Collapse of Elite
   Politics in Bolivia},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {47},

Pages = {205-250},

Abstract = {For fifty years, Bolivia's political party system was a surprisingly
   robust component of an otherwise fragile democracy, withstanding coups,
   hyperinflation, guerrilla insurgencies, and economic chaos. Why did it
   suddenly collapse around 2002? This article offers a theoretical lens
   combining cleavage theory with Schattschneider's concept of competitive
   dimensions for an empirical analysis of the structural and ideological
   characteristics of Bolivia's party system from 1952 to 2010. Politics
   shifted from a conventional left-right axis of competition, unsuited to
   Bolivian society, to an ethnic/rural-cosmopolitan/urban axis closely
   aligned with its major social cleavage. That shift fatally undermined
   elite parties and facilitated the rise of structurally and ideologically
   distinct organizations, as well as a new indigenous political class,
   that transformed the country's politics. Decentralization and political
   liberalization were the triggers that politicized Bolivia's latent

Abstract = {Among the many disruptions caused by artificial intelligence (AI) and
   other digital technologies (including automation, cyberwarfare,
   surveillance, loss of privacy, fake news, infrastructure vulnerability),
   the effects on development pathways are likely to be significant and
   complex. AI will enable low-income countries to leapfrog in several
   sectors, including e-governance, e-finance, e-health, and e-education.
   Yet AI will also lead to automation, reducing the demand for labor,
   especially unskilled labor. Labor-intensive sectors such as apparel will
   provide fewer jobs, and lower export earnings. Development strategies
   will need to adjust accordingly.},

Abstract = {The European Union has become a contested issue amongst voters in
   Europe. I analyze how the increasingly salient attitudes toward European
   integration have affected how voters hold their governments accountable
   for their policy decisions at the EU-level. I argue that attitudes
   toward the EU have become an important source of electoral
   accountability that complement attitudes on the left-right dimension,
   but they matter differently for pro- and anti-European voters. Whereas
   Eurosceptic voters are likely to use their attitudes toward the EU to
   hold their governments accountable, pro-European voters tend to rely on
   their specific attitudes toward particular policies to assess the
   responsiveness of their politicians. The paper presents the results of a
   conjoint experiment in a survey of 2,540 Germancitizens to analyze how
   pro- and anti-European voters' attitudes influence their assessment of
   typical signals of government responsiveness.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, Iraq has faced three international
   interventions. While their humanitarian component was a secondary - and
   at times, arguable - factor, they all played a central role in normative
   debates on the extent to which states should protect populations from
   mass atrocities beyond their borders (and what that actually entails),
   making Iraq a central piece of the human protection puzzle. In addition
   to analysing how Iraq's fate has played a key part in the development of
   human protection over the years, the article argues that France had a
   central role in both the interventions and the normative debates they
   generated, and investigates its role in depth. By doing so, it deepens
   our understanding of human protection, France's foreign policy and
   Iraq's development.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how Russian foreign policies are shaped in a
   two-level interactive social game. Russian foreign policies take their
   cue from ingrained identity positions articulated by the state
   leadership and negotiated in domestic debates, but they are also
   informed by interaction with other states. The article explains the
   shift in Russian policies away from pragmatic cooperation with the West
   in Syria from autumn 2015 onwards. While the Russian leadership
   initially sought such cooperation, the prominence of anti-Western
   discourse in Russia following the crisis in Ukraine as well as the
   West's rejection of Russia in this period spurred Russia to act
   independently in Syria.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of the state in development by examining
   the funding mechanism of China Development Bank (CDB), the world's
   largest development bank. In recent decades, CDB has gained its
   international reputation by lending massively to infrastructure projects
   inside and outside China. At first glance, this seems a typical story of
   state-led development, i.e. the state channels preferential capital to
   selected projects, thereby allowing policy-oriented investments to take
   place. But in fact, CDB raises most of its funds from the capital
   market. How can CDB afford loaning mostly to the usually long-term and
   low-profit public projects if its funding is directed by profit-driven
   market incentives? What does CDB's fund-raising mechanism reflect about
   state-market relations in China and the role of the state in
   development? The answers, this paper argues, lie in the state's
   guarantee for CDB bonds. Receiving credit ratings as high as government
   bonds, CDB supplements fiscal spending and creates a bond market of
   which the bank itself is a dominant player. Using quantitative data,
   historical documents and interviews, and comparing CDB to its
   counterparts in Japan and Germany, this paper characterises a mutually
   constitutive state-market relation in development finance.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan is home to the longest serving ruler in post-Soviet Eurasia
   while Kyrgyzstan is among the region's most competitive polities. Do
   these regime differences correspond to divergence in political
   attitudes, as an extensive body of literature posits? Are Kyrgyzstanis
   more likely to strongly support democratic ideals? Are Kazakhstanis less
   likely? Contrary to expectations, data reveal the two populations to be
   attitudinally indistinguishable when it comes to strong support for
   practices associated with democracy. Whatever country differences we
   find are minor or statistically insignificant. We explain this
   convergence by shifting focus away from the political features that
   distinguish the two nascent democracy versus consolidated
   authoritarianism to those that they hold in common. Notwithstanding
   major constitutional reform in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, politics there, as in
   Kazakhstan, remains fundamentally patronal, or patronage- based. Mass
   attitudes, we argue, align in many ways with the countries' shared
   patronal politics, rather than with their contrasting regime types.},

Abstract = {Since the founding of Harvard College, colleges and universities have
   used many types of examinations to serve multiple purposes. In the early
   days of student assessment, the process was straightforward. Each
   institution developed and administered its own unique examination to its
   own students to monitor their progress and to prospective students who
   applied for admission. Large-scale standardized tests emerged in the
   twentieth century in part to relieve the burden placed upon high schools
   of having to prepare students to meet the examination requirements of
   each institution to which a student applied. Up to that point, local
   communities of tutors and teachers were attempting to prepare students
   to succeed on each higher education institution's unique examination.
   Large-scale standardized tests have enjoyed more than a century of
   popularity and growth, and they have helped higher education
   institutions to solve problems in admissions and placement, and to
   measure learning outcomes. Over time, they have also become
   controversial, especially pertaining to race and class. This article is
   a historical view of educational testing in U.S. higher education,
   linking its development with past and present societal challenges
   related to civil rights laws, prominent higher education policies, and
   the long struggle of African American people in the United States.},

Abstract = {Foreign direct investment (FDI) can deliver benefits beyond the
   provision of capital, such as efficiency gains. We argue that the
   theorised positive effects of economic linkage are reduced when linkages
   are based on natural resources. Domestic elite coalitions supporting
   reform are also weaker in countries with extensive natural resources.
   Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have high-value natural resources and
   significant FDI, making them most likely cases for reform. Kyrgyzstan is
   a contrasting case as it has few natural resources. We find that the
   institutional reforms we would anticipate because of linkages have not
   occurred and those that exist are often cosmetic.},

Abstract = {Past experiences and expectations about the future shape how people
   think about work and welfare. Given the uncertainty many young people
   face when entering the labor market, we investigate whether 1) young
   peoples' experiences of social mobility and 2) their future mobility
   expectations impact their attitudes regarding the meaning of work and
   welfare. Drawing on the concepts of self-interest and deservingness, we
   examine how both the experiences and expectations of intergenerational
   social mobility influence the ways in which young adults view the
   so-called moral dimension of work and welfare. Results of logistic
   regression analyses of around 11,000 young adults in eleven countries
   suggest that the relationship between mobility and individuals' views on
   work and welfare varies depending on the dimension of mobility (economic
   and social origins, for example), with expected future mobility exerting
   a stronger effect on attitudes than past mobility experiences. We find
   that self-interest, not empathy with one's social origins, appears to be
   the primary driver of these attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualises gender expertise in global governance as a
   transnational field. We propose two theoretical shifts: a
   depersonalisation to understand expertise as a field rather than experts
   as individuals or a group of people; and a re-conceptualisation of
   expertise from a depoliticised body of knowledge towards expertise as a
   performative and intrinsically political practice. Drawing on
   qualitative data, we identify practices of boundary drawing and erasing
   to analyse three key cleavages of this field: contestations over the
   boundary between gender expertise and feminism; contestations over
   scientific epistemologies and authority; and contestations over the
   logics of (post-)colonial politics surrounding gender expertise.},

Abstract = {Studies of minority `integration' often focus heavily on group
   boundaries of ethnicity, language and identity. This essay challenges
   these conventional approaches in Latvia by examining individuals'
   quotidian, lived experiences and how these transcend common analytical
   boundaries. Using the Daugavpils region as a case study, I explore
   Russian speaker and Latvian participation in events explicitly linked
   with `ethnic' Latvian cultural identity. I argue, by adopting
   multifaceted analytical measures of identities, ethnicity and belonging,
   new perspectives on banal integration and minority engagement within
   national culture emerge. Individuals engage with each other and with
   `national' identity and culture in complex ways. Young `Russian
   speakers' are often more integrated with their ethnic Latvian peers than
   the extant literature suggests, both civically and in Latvia's cultural
   sphere, as consumers and producers of Latvian `national' identity.},

Abstract = {This article is about women's economic empowerment within the United
   Nations (UN) Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. Based on analysis
   of the core agenda-setting documents, it traces where two different
   versions of women's economic empowerment, ``liberal{''} (including women
   in the formal economy) and ``liberating{''} (women collectively
   mobilizing to challenge the status quo), appear in the WPS agenda. It
   argues that the two exist in uneasy tension in the UN's aspirations for
   women's economic security post-war, but that when it comes to actual
   activities and achievements, the liberal version dominates over the
   liberating version. The article argues that it is important not to
   overstate the divide between the two approaches, and that the seeds of a
   liberating approach can be found within the liberal. It is initiatives
   to facilitate women's economic empowerment that contain opportunities
   for collective action to transform the structures of the economy that
   WPS advocates should advocate. This would strengthen the WPS agenda and
   its ability to contribute to security as feminists envisage it, as
   encompassing freedom from want as well as freedom from fear.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {329-343},
Abstract = {This article sheds light on the complexity and sensitivity of
   crowd-based intelligence in security governance. The `crowd' as special
   manifestation of `the public' is both challenging and enabling new forms
   of intelligence practices. As a spontaneous eruption of collective
   activity, the crowd is a notion of great versatility. Sometimes
   considered mad/dangerous, sometimes wise/useful, the crowd's drivers are
   a context-dependent collage of (affective) group engagement, projection
   from the outside and the workings of digital technologies. The article
   traces how the existence of crowds in its variations is connected to how
   they are approached by security agents and their intelligence practices.},

Abstract = {Throughout its history the European integration process has not
   undermined but rather strengthened the autonomy of member states
   vis-a-vis wider societal interests in relation to political economy,
   labour markets and social provisions. Both the `golden age nation state'
   of the 1960s as well as the considerable transformations of member state
   political economies over the past decades, and especially after the
   euro-crisis, was to a considerable degree orchestrated through
   transnational, most notably European, arrangements. In both cases the
   primary objective has been to strengthen state capacities of public
   power and law against the encroachment of private interests into the
   state. In spite of this continuity, considerable changes can be observed
   in the substantial economic policies advanced due to the switch from a
   Keynesian to a monetarist economic paradigm. It is suggested that the
   debate on constitutional imbalances between the EU's economic and social
   constitutions should be seen in this light.},

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},

Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-139},
Abstract = {The constitutions of Eurasia's more authoritarian countries
   categorically differ from those of the region's more democratic
   countries, in that they codify a doctrine of presidential supremacy as
   well as several constitutional tools allowing for its implementation.
   Therefore, the classic typology of forms of government is inadequate for
   understanding the architecture of power in these countries. Rather,
   their routine categorization as presidential or semi-presidential
   formats of executive-legislative relations causes flawed case selection
   in extant comparative research about the impact of forms of government,
   particularly president-parliamentarism, on regime performance and
   stability. This article shows that almost a third of all constitutions
   in the region reflect a regional variety of genuinely authoritarian
   presidentialism. It systematizes the properties of this constitutional
   pattern of Eurasian-type presidentialism or, for that matter,
   superpresidentialism. Methodologically, the article encourages
   contextual analyses to understand non-Western, non-liberal constitutions
   from within.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to illuminate structural limits of Gender Responsive
   Budgeting (GRB) by analysing the interplay between economic and fiscal
   reforms, promoted by International Financial Institutions (IFIs), and
   gender budgeting initiatives in the Western Balkans. GRB is the core
   concept bridging revenue mobilization and gender equality in the work of
   IFIs. However, as the Western Balkans experience demonstrates, GRB
   initiatives are best characterized as ``empty gestures{''} towards
   gender equality as they cannot compensate for the continued adverse
   effects of IFIs overall policies.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, the security
   situation of Europe's eastern `frontline states' has undergone
   significant changes. In and around the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the
   Barents Sea, the scope and scale of military activity has grown, as has
   the frequency of Russian-Western military encounters. Despite the many
   similarities between the three regions, and despite the increased risk
   of negative spillover from one region to another, there are also
   noteworthy regional differences. As of today, the security challenges
   appear to be more severe and pressing in the southern and central part
   of the `frontline' than in the northern.},

Abstract = {Tens of millions of peasants died during the Great Famine in China from
   1959 to 1961. Numerous Chinese peasants remained silent during the
   famine while others staged resistance. This article explores how peasant
   resistance was possible in a communist regime and how the government
   contained such resistance. It finds that resistance was considerably
   affected by the availability of protest leaders. Chinese peasants were
   organized into rural collectives controlled by the party-state through
   local cadres. Sympathetic rural cadres played crucial roles in
   facilitating peasant resistance. However, government control generally
   deprived rural communities of protest leaders. When collective
   resistance did occur, the government contained its influence through
   accommodation and repression. Effective control rendered the government
   insensitive to the famine suffered by the vast rural population of the
   country.},

Abstract = {Recent instances of political backlash against global governance efforts
   as well as conventional wisdom suggest that there is a link between
   shifting decision-making authority from the domestic to the global
   level, on the one hand, and the legitimacy of global governance
   institutions as perceived by citizens and other stakeholders on the
   other. We use a population-based survey experiment in Germany and the
   United States (N=1600 each) to investigate whether increasing the
   authority of a global governance institution negatively affects
   citizens' legitimacy perceptions. The empirical focus is on climate
   change, a costly and paradigmatic global governance effort. The results
   show that shifts of political authority, notably changes towards
   majority decision making at the international level and automatic
   implementation of international decisions domestically, do not, on
   average, significantly affect citizens' legitimacy perceptions of global
   governance institutions. Interestingly, the absence of the presumed
   negative effect is not due to citizens' incapacity to understand the
   implications of increasing international authority in the sense that
   increasing international authority results in a loss of control over
   climate policy in Germany and the United States. Rather, legitimacy
   perceptions appear to be shaped by citizens' perceptions of procedural
   and performance quality of such efforts in more general terms, and not
   by authority levels per se. Overall, these findings suggest that there
   could be more room for increasing the authority of global governance
   institutions, provided this can be done in ways that ascertain high
   procedural and output performance quality.},

Abstract = {Do international treaties lead to cross-national increases in women's
   rights? In contrast to Asal, Brown, and Figueroa's (2008) suggestion
   that the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against
   Women (CEDAW) is not an important factor in explaining the
   liberalization of abortion rights polices, this article argues that the
   treaty contributes to increases in abortion rights when the terms of
   ratification are disaggregated. Previous excursions into this question
   have only considered whether a state has ratified the treaty, which is
   problematic from both a methodological and theoretical standpoint given
   that many states ratified with conditions, while only six states did not
   ratify at all. Additionally, some states ratified the Optional Protocol
   and some have not. We demonstrate that the disaggregation of levels of
   treaty ratification is associated with increases in women's rights in a
   model replicating that of Asal, Brown, and Figueroa. Further, we extend
   our knowledge of the dynamics of treaty ratification through the use of
   structural equations to more fully model how political, cultural, and
   economic factors, as well as exogenous international pressures, interact
   to produce changes in women's rights around the world.},

Abstract = {Motherhood as a political identity grants women political legitimacy,
   enabling them to make rights-based claims. However, the efficacy and
   possibility of motherhood as a political identity is entangled in the
   sexist and racist narratives that are inextricable from white supremacy.
   In this article, I analyze the language used by the Mothers of the
   Movement (MothM) at the 2016 Democratic National Convention to
   demonstrate how the identities and experiences of Black women,
   specifically Black mothers, are co-opted and reproduced as deficient,
   criminal, and irrelevant, thereby limiting their ability to make claims
   as mothers and citizens. How, then, can marginalized mothers confront
   the tools of white supremacy, which portray them as ``bad{''} mothers
   and ``bad{''} citizens, to be heard within the dominant order without
   conforming to it? I contend that in appropriating the very discourses
   and spaces that seek to exclude and subjugate them, the MothM
   demonstrate the hypocrisy of the system of ``good motherhood{''}-all the
   while reaffirming their status as equal citizens deserving of political
   recognition. Drawing from Black feminist thinkers, I demonstrate how
   motherhood and the rights that the MothM claim as mothers can be
   conceptualized as assertions of freedom and equal citizenship.},

Abstract = {Much research examining gender bias in politics analyzes responses to
   explicit survey questions asking individuals whether they prefer male
   over female leaders or agree that male political leaders are superior.
   Drawing insights from the measurement of other types of prejudice, this
   article explores the methodological shortcomings of a widely used
   question of this type. Analyzing the results of two surveys-one national
   and one state-level-I compare response patterns to a standard, highly
   explicit question that is frequently administered by the Pew Research
   Center with those for a modestly altered item that employs multiple
   strategies to reduce social desirability bias. Compared with the
   alternative measure, the conventional item seriously underreports
   prejudice against women leaders. Moreover, the underreporting of bias is
   especially prevalent among individuals belonging to groups that are
   strong advocates of gender equality.},

Abstract = {The `power of bond markets' is a widely assumed and poorly understood
   feature of the global economy. We demonstrate that even in a bond market
   as stable as the United States this influence is considerable. In this
   article, we scrutinise a particularly direct influence, the impact of US
   Treasury yields on presidential approval rates. Our empirical analysis
   from 1961 to 2010 demonstrates that rising/falling bond yields lead to a
   decline/increase in approval rates. We show that this impact is mediated
   via the US mortgage market. The stronger the rise in mortgage rates, the
   stronger the influence of Treasury yields on presidential approval. We
   then outline the broader possible political impacts of this,
   particularly given foreign and domestic central bank ownership of US
   Treasuries.},

Abstract = {Many aspects of labor migration to Russia are consistent with different
   strands of general social science theories of migration. We illustrate
   how based on an account of migrant experiences drawn from focus groups
   we conducted with return migrants in Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine.
   Participants discussed their motives for migrating, experiences in
   Russia, and the impact on their views of Russia. In contrast to the
   overwhelmingly negative portrayals that predominate in prior accounts,
   they report a diverse set of experiences. For many, appreciation for
   income earned in Russia is the most salient aspect of their time there,
   outweighing more negative aspects. Their views of Russia are generally
   positive, in part due to their perceptions of where they stand in
   Russia's ethnic hierarchies. These findings suggest that Russia's
   reputation benefits from migration through what we call geopolitical
   remittances.},

Abstract = {In recent national elections and in those to the European Parliament,
   populist radical right parties (PRRPs) have gained many more votes than
   in previous decades. What could that mean, at least in the long run, for
   EU activities in such areas as for example, the internal market, defence
   and security and the fight against discrimination? Beyond these parties'
   general eurosceptical attitude, little is known about their agreed plans
   for specific EU policies. Therefore, we have collected and analysed
   their programmatic statements. In this article we discuss how coherent
   or incoherent the demands of different PRRPs in the EU actually are, in
   terms of comparing their policies. How much do they agree or disagree
   when it comes to reforming EU policies?},

   forbearance or imposing a sanction. We employed a representative survey
   experiment (n = 1,546) in which we test the effect of transparency in
   general (providing information about a decision or not) and the effect
   of specific types of transparency (process or rationale transparency).
   We do this for agencies supervising financial markets, education, and
   health care. We find that overall decision transparency significantly
   increases citizen trust in only two of the three agencies. Rationale
   transparency has a more pronounced positive effect only for the
   Education Inspectorate. We conclude that the overall effect of decision
   transparency is positive but that the nature of the regulatory domain
   may weaken or strengthen this effect.},

Abstract = {Since China launched the 16 + 1 forum for meetings with Central and
   Eastern European (CEE) countries in 2012, European observers have
   struggled to understand the Chinese approach. In contrast to its
   oft-repeated claim of `win-win' cooperation, some believe China is
   pursuing an assertive strategy of `divide and conquer' designed to
   benefit China at Europe's expense. China's economic diplomacy in CEE is
   examined through the critical lens of Holslag's `offensive mercantilism'
   framework, finding it useful for assessing empirical aspects of China's
   approach to CEE, but failing to find evidence for the assertion that
   China's economic diplomacy is divisive and bad for Europe.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that Durkheim's positions on happiness and socialism
   are relevant in today's neoliberal and post-affluent societies. Durkheim
   dissociates happiness from economic progress and makes it contingent
   upon the relationships between the individual and society. An important
   component of Durkheimian happiness is the dynamic equilibrium between
   desires and means. Therefore, his friendly criticism of the socialist
   project is that it promises to fulfil the desires that were released by
   a disembedded market economy. Durkheim's point helps us to understand
   why the social democratic promise was broken and how the neoliberal
   imperatives of competition and unlimited wants sow unhappiness.},

Abstract = {Large-scale carbon emissions reductions in the United States likely
   require national-level policy, but political and institutional
   constraints restrict the scope of policy that can be enacted in
   Washington. State governments, on the other hand, have demonstrated a
   remarkable willingness to enact climate policies, despite the global
   nature of the problem. Although it is limited in directly reducing
   carbon emissions, state policy has the potential to make the terrain of
   U.S. climate politics more fertile for future policy. I discuss
   mechanisms by which climate policies enacted at the state level can
   influence climate politics across the states and at the national level.
   Finally, I make policy and political strategy recommendations that take
   these multilevel policy feedback dynamics into account.},

   relationship between female political leadership and the
   emotionalisation of political culture by focusing on the case study of
   the media coverage of the former UK Prime Minister Theresa May. The
   article argues that the emotional turn in political culture is a
   gendered phenomenon because it reinforces deeper fears and fantasies
   about irrational femininity and the inherent instability of female

Abstract = {The essay challenges the frequent references to the concept of Soviet
   nationality policy by historians and social scientists. The argument
   proceeds, first, by unpicking some of the logic in the use of the term;
   second, by examining the evidence for the existence and nature of such a
   policy; and third, by considering alternative explanations for major
   decisions and events concerning non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet
   Union. The essay concludes that, at least after the 1920s, there was no
   Soviet nationality policy, and the processes of negotiation and
   nation-promoting practices pursued by republic leaders were, instead,
   the key influences on decision-making.},

Abstract = {Like other contributors to this special issue and beyond, I believe we
   are at a critical inflection point in human rights and need to
   re-energize our work broadly to address growing economic inequality as
   well as inequalities based on different axes of identity. In relation to
   the constellation of fields involved in `health and human rights'
   specifically-which link distinct communities with dissonant values,
   methods and orthodoxies-I argue that we also need to challenge ideas
   that are taken for granted in the fields that we are trying to
   transform. After setting out a personal and subjective account of why
   human rights-based approaches (HRBAs) are unlikely to be meaningful
   tools for social change as they are now generally being deployed, I
   suggest we collectively-scholars, practitioners and advocates-need to
   grapple with how to think about: (1) biomedicine in relation to the
   social as well as biological nature of health and well-being; and (2)
   conventional public health in relation to the social construction of
   health within and across borders and health systems. In each case, I
   suggest that challenging accepted truths in different disciplines, and
   in turn in the political economy of global health, have dramatic
   implications for not just theory but informing different strategies for
   advancing health (and social) justice through rights in practice.},

Abstract = {How do the material aspects of intermediary work affect regulators,
   targets, and beneficiaries? To shed light on this question, we studied
   an information intermediary in the form of a website and the
   organizations who founded it. Specifically, we analyzed FracFocus, a
   self-regulatory initiative with strong industry ties, charged with
   disclosing data pertaining to the chemicals used in oil and gas wells
   completed using hydraulic fracturing technology (fracking) in the United
   States and Canada. We found that between 2010 and mid-2017, the vast
   majority of legislation in states and provinces where fracking actively
   occurred was updated to mandate or encourage disclosure via FracFocus,
   meaning that it had a considerable effect on the trajectory of official
   regulation on fracking disclosure. We also found that FracFocus
   disclosed important data but did so in a manner that limited
   accessibility and reduced the comprehensibility of environmental and
   public health risks to beneficiaries. Our analysis suggests that the
   public's experience of such a device is one of opaque transparency, in
   which the line between official and non-official regulation is blurred.
   We traced these outcomes to the material affordances created by
   FracFocus.},

Abstract = {Technology has an outsized impact on the modern world; it is how we have
   tamed our frontiers. But that role is largely ignored when it comes to
   the Arctic frontier. Emerging technologies, especially AI, can enable
   desperately needed services and infrastructure-but they can also
   challenge ethics, law, and policy, as they usually do. For instance,
   autonomous icebreaker ships pose a dual-use dilemma since they can be
   used for both humanitarian and military purposes. As a lesson for other
   frontiers, this article will broadly introduce the potential role of AI
   in the changing Arctic and some of the ethical concerns that deserve
   attention before that future arrives.},

Title = {Of Principal(s') Interest? A Disaggregated, Multiple Principals'
   Approach to Commission Discretion},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {How much discretion does the Commission enjoy in the European Union? To
   address this question, we draw on principal-agent theory and propose
   `interest in a decision' by principals as a proxy for agent discretion.
   This has three advantages over existing approaches. First, it overcomes
   the high-conflict bias of case studies. Second, it accounts for the
   phenomenon of rational anticipation. Third, it allows for a more
   fine-grained measurement than analyses of the act of delegation.
   Empirically, we disaggregate the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) into 27 chapters and account for multiple principals.
   We use surveys and interviews with Commission negotiators, which we
   triangulate with publicly available data sources. Our findings paint a
   picture of a Commission that is constrained rather tightly. While the
   Council follows all chapters and acts as a `safety net', citizens and
   the European Parliament act as fire alarms and focus on selected, often
   overlapping, chapters.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the activities of UN commissions of inquiry and
   asks whether investigations can be a viable solution to human rights
   violations. A case study of UN commissions of inquiry was used to
   evaluate the activities of commissions. The recent increase in UN
   commissions is significant as they could potentially be an alternative
   to the international accountability system. Specifically, there have
   been three achievements: (1) innovations in investigation methods; (2)
   international agenda setting; and (3) establishing grounds for
   accountability. However, there are still problems and issues with UN
   investigations that need to be overcome in the course of future
   developments. Three requirements were identified: (1) a balanced
   perspective; (2) reliable sources of information; and (3) more access to
   and cooperation from the target state.},

Title = {What Constitutes `Reasonable' State Action on Core Obligations?
   Considering a Right to Health Framework to Provide Essential Medicines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Universal access to essential medicines is both a core obligation under
   international human rights law and a key component of the Sustainable
   Development Goal (SDG) for health. In light of the high prices of some
   essential medicines and finite health budgets, how can states' core
   obligation to provide essential medicines be interpreted? We propose
   that the lens of reasonableness offers a deeper understanding of states'
   minimum core obligation in relation to resources. Enshrined in the
   Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
   Cultural Rights, the standard of reasonableness suggests that in the
   context of essential medicines, the right to health may be better
   fulfilled by applying uniform criteria to set the scope and texture of
   local minimum standards rather than a one-size-fits-all universal list
   of medicines. Drawing on authoritative guidance by the UN Committee on
   Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, this article selects four criteria
   to evaluate the standard of reasonableness: deliberate, targeted, and
   concrete measures to mobilize state resources; low-cost policy options;
   international assistance; and non-discrimination. The framework allows
   policymakers, judges and civil society to assess states' compliance with
   their core obligations with regard to essential medicines. Examples from
   domestic law and policy for access to medicines illustrate the potential
   definition, scope, and value of the first three criteria for domestic
   legislators and judiciaries while depicting how such a consideration
   could be discharged in practice. This proposal is relevant for
   progressing towards the SDG target of universal access to essential
   medicines.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of work experience abroad on
   migrants' geopolitical preferences. For this purpose, I analyze
   representative survey data from Moldova, a country caught in an
   ideological battle between Russia and the West, with high emigration
   rates to both destinations. In a first step, I show that return migrants
   from the West are significantly more likely to support European Union
   (EU) accession than non-migrants, while return migrants from the East
   are more likely to support closer ties with Russia, controlling for
   economic, demographic, and ethnic confounding factors. In a second step,
   I use district-level variation in migrant networks as an instrument for
   individual migration. Second-stage regressions show that work experience
   in the West increases support for EU accession, while no evidence of
   causal effects is found for work experience in the East. Differences in
   information exposure and migration policies between the EU and Russia
   may explain this asymmetry.},

Abstract = {This study explores an information interpretation explanation of
   strategic surprises using a non-traditional national security threat: a
   popular uprising. To explain why this type of assessments fail, I
   emphasize the role of information relevance when evaluating intelligence
   about civilian unrest. I posit that the dynamic nature of relevance is
   crucial for signals of popular dissent becoming dominant indicators that
   are incorporated into security assessments. A case study and
   observational data analysis of the Palestinian uprising (Intifada, 1987)
   demonstrate how information relevance contributed to the Israeli
   intelligence failure and how it affects the potential for strategic
   surprises facing a civilian threat.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {503-525},
Abstract = {National security decision-making is informed by intelligence
   assessments, which in turn depend on sound information evaluation. We
   critically examine information evaluation methods, arguing that they
   mask rather than effectively guide subjectivity in intelligence
   assessment. Drawing on the guidance metaphor, we propose that rigid
   `all-purpose' information evaluation methods be replaced by flexible
   `context-sensitive' guidelines aimed at improving the soundness,
   precision, accuracy and clarity of irreducibly subjective judgments.
   Specific guidelines, supported by empirical evidence, include use of
   numeric probability estimates to quantify the judged likelihood of
   information accuracy, promoting collector-analyst collaboration and
   periodic revaluation of information as new information is acquired.},

Abstract = {In the wake of 9/11 and the war in Iraq, the Office of the Director of
   National Intelligence adopted Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203
   - a list of analytic tradecraft standards - and appointed an ombudsman
   charged with monitoring their implementation. In this paper, we identify
   three assumptions behind ICD203: (1) tradecraft standards can be
   employed consistently; (2) tradecraft standards sufficiently capture the
   key elements of good reasoning; and (3) good reasoning leads to more
   accurate judgments. We then report on two controlled experiments that
   uncover operational constraints in the reliable application of the
   ICD203 criteria for the assessment of intelligence products.},

Booktitle = {WILD EAST: Criminal Political Economies in South Asia},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {168-193},
Abstract = {This chapter explores the inter-state criminal political economies of
   the sand and oil mafias in North India. It puts forward the concept of
   `mafia assemblages' to nuance understanding of `organised crime' and
   simultaneously provides insights into contemporary political formations.
   Mafia assemblages in the studied cases are not hyper-fluid, autonomous
   and amorphous illegal networks; nor are they discrete, structured,
   hierarchical and bounded `mafia systems'. The criminal economies of sand
   and oil constantly mutate, transform and break up as they adapt to new
   business opportunities and political constraints. The chapter explores
   how the sand and oil mafia assemblages intertwine and how the very same
   local political bosses protect (and are part of) them. Contrary to
   economic analysis that emphasises different tax rates as the main
   engines of cross-border criminal economies, the working of sand and oil
   mafias suggests that it is instead the search for impunity by political
   bosses and the nature of caste territorial sovereignties that drive
   criminal economies in border areas.},
