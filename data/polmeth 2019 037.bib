Abstract = {Are foreign policy attitudes among Russian elites structured around
   broader beliefs about the nature of world politics? Are these attitudes
   consistently related to individual cognitive styles? I address these
   questions using survey data on the Russian foreign policy elite spanning
   most of the post-Soviet period. In my analysis, I focus on militant
   internationalism - a hawkish foreign policy orientation - and its
   relationship to the dogmatic cognitive style. The internal structure of
   militant internationalism among Russian elites reveals two constituent
   dimensions: perception of threat from the United States
   (anti-Americanism) and acceptance of using armed force abroad
   (militarism). I also demonstrate that militarism is positively related
   to dogmatism, whereas anti-Americanism appears to be more volatile. This
   analysis represents the first attempt to study elites' views on foreign
   policy within the motivated cognition framework using survey data from
   outside of the United States.},

Abstract = {How do civilians react to being harmed in war? Existing studies argue
   that civilian casualties are strategically costly because civilian
   populations punish a belligerent who kills civilians and support the
   latter's opponent. Relying on eighty-seven semi-structured interviews
   with victims of coalition attacks in Afghanistan, this article shows
   that moral principles inform civilians' attitudes toward their own
   harming. Their attitudes may therefore vary with the perceived
   circumstances of an attack. Civilians' perception of harm as unintended
   and necessary, in accordance with the moral principles of distinction
   and necessity, was associated with narratives that cast an attack as
   relatively more legitimate and with a partial or full release of the
   coalition from blame. The principle of proportionality, which requires
   that civilian casualties are caused in pursuit of a legitimate war aim,
   informed their abstract attitudes toward civilian casualties in
   Afghanistan. Two rules of international law, which accord with the moral
   principles of distinction and necessity, were reflected in the
   civilians' attitudes. The legal rule of proportionality, which diverges
   from the namesake moral principle, failed to resonate with the
   civilians. The article explores whether compliance with the legal rules
   of distinction and necessity can contribute to mitigating the strategic
   costs of civilian casualties.},

Abstract = {Growing interest in ``Medicare for All{''} has revived hopes for
   universal health insurance. Yet serious disagreements remain over how to
   expand Medicare and how far to move toward a universal Medicare system.
   In this article, I consider these disagreements in light of what we know
   about ``policy feedback{''}-the ways in which policies, once enacted,
   reshape public opinion, governing institutions, and political
   organizations. Rather than focusing on the ``political feasibility{''}
   of proposals for Medicare expansion, I focus on their ``policy
   sustainability{''}: whether proposals, once enacted, can be established
   in place, entrenched over time, and expanded and improved as
   circumstances change. Achieving these ``three E's,{''} I argue, requires
   a flexible approach that builds on the current system (and hence falls
   short of Medicare for All) but also contains a universal coverage
   guarantee and other provisions designed to create strong feedback
   effects conducive to the expansion of Medicare over time.},

Abstract = {As the Republican Party has moved to the Right, conservative politicians
   have become more comfortable viewing policy as a means of demobilizing
   their political adversaries. In this article, I show how conservative
   activists within the Republican Party have leveraged cutbacks to union
   rights to weaken their political opponents. This case study thus reveals
   the role of policy feedback strategies in asymmetric partisan
   polarization. It also illustrates lessons about the conditions under
   which policy feedback can durably shift the distribution of power in
   America's fragmented polity. These insights underscore how the success
   of policy feedback effects depends not just on the initial passage of
   policies in one city or state, but on the ability of political actors to
   organize in multiple venues simultaneously. In particular, they
   highlight the importance of organizing at the cross-state level given
   the substantial political authority of states.},

Abstract = {As part of the roundtable ``Economic Sanctions and Their
   Consequences,{''} this essay discusses whether economic sanctions are
   morally acceptable policy tools. It notes that both conventional and
   targeted sanctions not only often fail to achieve their stated
   objectives but also bring about significant negative externalities in
   target countries. Economic dislocation and increases in political
   instability instigated by sanctions disproportionately affect the
   well-being of opposition groups and marginalized segments of society,
   while target elites and their support base remain insulated from the
   intended costs of foreign pressure. Sanctions might also incentivize
   target governments to use repressive means to consolidate their rule and
   weaken the opposition. Given these serious shortcomings, I argue that
   sanctions are ethically problematic tools of foreign policy.
   Nonetheless, this does not mean that sanctions should be rejected
   outright, as there might be cases where sanctions are the only viable
   option, and they might work effectively under certain circumstances.
   Rather, the essay suggests that policymakers should apply more caution
   in considering the use of sanctions given their low probability of
   success, and should be more concerned with the delicate balance between
   political gain and civilian pain before levying sanctions, whether
   comprehensive or targeted.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Frontex through the lens of organizational
   sociology, challenging conventional accounts of the agency as a
   coherent, rational actor. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic
   fieldwork, it argues that Frontex can more appropriately be understood
   as a fragmented and only loosely coupled organization, with
   discrepancies existing between different units, languages and
   structures, and between those implementing Frontex operations on the
   ground, staff in the headquarters, and the management board. The article
   shows that, faced with contradictory demands, Frontex seeks to maintain
   support from its environment and to preserve legitimacy among its key
   stakeholders; in particular the European Parliament, the Commission and
   different member states. The loose coupling of the agency allows for the
   coexistence of different rationalities across different aspects of
   Frontex's work, catering to diverse stakeholders while also minimizing
   open conflict within the organization.},

Abstract = {Economic self-interest has been central to explaining individual trade
   preferences. Depending on the theoretical trade model different
   variables influence individuals' attitude towards globalization and
   existing research has come to different conclusions as to whether
   individuals' preferences are dependent on skill level, income or the
   sector of employment. Other studies depart from economic self-interest
   by arguing that it is not self-interest that motivates individuals to
   form their preference, but country-level economic factors (sociotropic
   considerations) instead. We argue that one needs to approach trade
   preference formation from an information-based perspective and we test
   experimentally how people react if they are aware that they personally
   or nationally will gain or lose from trade and which of the two aspects
   are more important. By using survey experiments embedded in a
   representative national survey in the U.S. we are able to differentiate
   whether a person was triggered by ego- or sociotropic benefits/costs of
   free trade.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to explain why Hollywood's dominant firms are narrowing
   the scope of creativity in the contemporary period (1980-2015). The
   largest distributors have sought to prevent the art of filmmaking and
   its related social relations from becoming financial risks in the
   pursuit of profit. Major filmed entertainment, my term for the six
   largest distributors, must discount expected future earnings to present
   prices with the forward-looking logic of capitalisation; and uncertainty
   about where creativity in cinema is going can produce financial
   uncertainty about the future earning potential of new film projects.
   Conversely, a degree of confidence in the expected future earnings of
   Hollywood cinema can increase when the art of filmmaking and broader
   social world of mass culture are ordered by capitalist power {[}Nitzan,
   J. and Bichler, S., 2009. Capital as power: a study of order and
   creorder. New York: Routledge]. For the period of 1980-2015, major
   filmed entertainment lowered its risk relative to the period before,
   1960-79. This historical process of risk reduction is the effect of
   major filmed entertainment making the wide-release strategy (a.k.a.,
   saturation booking) more predictable through an aggressive
   implementation of the blockbuster style and the high concept standard.},

Abstract = {Defining the state as `organised violence', based on the emergence of
   the modern European national state system, Charles Tilly identified four
   essential war-driven, state-building activities: `war-making';
   `state-making'; `protection' of elite `clients'; and `extraction' of
   resources. Drawing on Tilly's primary categories of analysis, this essay
   considers the ways in which war, or the threat of war, real or imagined,
   shaped the Soviet state, particularly in its Stalinist manifestation.
   This essay argues that Tilly's warfare-state paradigm, judiciously
   deployed, brings into high relief facets of Soviet state-making that few
   other paradigms do.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the relationship between relative group position
   in an ethnically stratified social order and anti-immigrant attitudes in
   Russia. Based on data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of
   the Higher School of Economics, it studies the role of two objective
   indicators of group position: relative ingroup size and the group's
   dominant political status within a region. The findings show that when a
   group position is measured in numerical terms, the attitudes of ethnic
   Russians seem to follow social dominance theory, while titulars tend to
   conform to the alienation-based extension to the group position model.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is reaching into every aspect of global
   health. In this essay, I examine one example of AI's potential
   contributions and limitations in global health: the prediction,
   treatment, and containment of a global influenza outbreak. The potential
   advantages are clear. AI can aid global influenza surveillance platforms
   by improving the capacity of organizations to look for novel influenza
   outbreak strains in the right places, to identify populations most
   likely to spread influenza, and to produce real-time information about
   the disease's spread by monitoring social media communications to track
   outbreak events. There are also very real limitations to what AI can do,
   and it is crucial that AI not be used as an excuse not to invest in
   strengthening health systems and other traditional components of global
   healthcare. AI may also be able to improve our understanding of who
   should receive a vaccine and what is most effective for large-scale
   vaccine delivery, but there will always be blind spots that the data
   cannot fill. Investment in healthcare, with attention to the danger of
   minimal access to care for minority groups that are at risk and in
   fragile situations, remains the best chance to prepare communities for
   outbreak detection, surveillance, and containment.},

   Allocation to Female Ministers},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In light of the growing scholarship on women's representation in the
   executive, we examine whether extant theories on the determinants of
   female ministerial appointments apply to and explain the role of women
   in the executive in new democracies. We are further interested in better
   understanding the dynamics of portfolio allocation to female ministers.
   Given the different meanings that the political left and right carry in
   new compared with established democracies, we argue that ministerial
   appointments and portfolio allocations reflect this difference and
   therefore show diverse results. Presenting data on women ministers in
   five southeastern European states between 1990 and 2018, we analyze the
   descriptive representation of women at the highest echelons of political
   power. We establish that while the standard claim found in the
   literature that left political parties stage more women and with more
   progressive views, as shown primarily in scholarship on Western
   democracies, southeastern European women ministers who are given
   portfolios traditionally reserved for men are appointed primarily by
   parties of the right. Moreover, we find little support for the link
   between legislative and executive representation; rather, we see that
   the appointment of women ministers is related to the
   institutionalization level of the parties in power.},

Abstract = {Standardized tests are regularly used as education system monitoring
   tools to compare the average performance of students living in different
   states or belonging to different subgroups (e.g., defined by
   race/ethnicity, sex, or parental income) and to track their progress
   over time. This article describes some uses and design features of tests
   in system monitoring contexts. We provide the example of the National
   Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the only large-scale system
   monitoring test in the United States. The availability of NAEP data, in
   turn, has facilitated the construction of the Stanford Education Data
   Archive (SEDA), a publicly available database that can be used to
   describe patterns of achievement for nearly all school districts in the
   United States. Here, we discuss progress in and challenges to the use of
   standardized tests as system monitoring tools.},

Abstract = {With the Treaty of Lisbon, national Parliaments obtained a direct role
   in the legislative process of the European Union (EU). When the
   Commission releases a legislative proposal, each national Parliament has
   eight weeks to issue a Reasoned Opinion stating that the draft violates
   the EU principle of subsidiarity if they wish to do so. This article
   provides context on this so-called Early Warning System (EWS), and then
   studies empirically when national Parliaments issue Reasoned Opinions
   under the EWS. A within-between panel regression covering all 28 EU
   countries for 2010-16 leads to novel findings on the issuance of
   Reasoned Opinions. In particular, there is no robust statistical
   evidence that variations in public attitudinal euroscepticism in a
   country affect the number of Reasoned Opinions issued by its Parliament.
   In contrast, electoral euroscepticism as measured by the election of
   eurosceptic Parliaments is found to have a strongly significant
   across-country effect on the number of Reasoned Opinions.},

Abstract = {In recent years a subtle change has taken place in the policy-making
   machinery shaping European integration. The traditional methods for
   producing collective European Union (EU) policies, typified by the
   extensive analysis of a problem, extended phases of consultation with
   stakeholders, the deliberate cultivation of support for proposals,
   occasional decision-making moments and their long-term implementation,
   now share space with what is best described as crisis-oriented methods
   for arriving at collective decisions. These methods prioritize the early
   identification of the next crisis, specific kinds of actors and
   technologies, abbreviated decision-making procedures and new narratives
   on the raison d'etre of European integration. This article treats this
   development as a kind of crisisification of EU policy-making - a change
   in the processes by which collective decisions are made - and explores
   its implications for practice and research by drawing on both classical
   EU studies approaches and insights from critical security studies.},

Abstract = {Taking Syria's armed conflict as a case study to illustrate the
   processes of normative contestation in international relations, this
   article is interested in re-examining the typology of Russia as a
   `rising power' to account for `rise' in a non-material dimension. The
   article integrates the concept of `rising power' with the literature on
   international norm dynamics to reflect on the rationale for Russia's
   engagement in Syria despite adverse material preconditions. It will
   argue that Russian norm divergence from alleged `Western' norms
   illustrates Moscow's ambition to co-define the conditions for legitimate
   transgressions of state sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to understanding the role of technologies
   during political violence and in transitional justice contexts, studying
   a case that was contemporaneous with the transnational construction of
   human rights activism. Examining documentation technologies that
   sustained nonviolent civic resistance to state terrorism during Chile's
   Augusto Pinochet dictatorship (1973-1990), the article highlights the
   role of technology in creating the kind of register that has become
   commonplace in human rights settings. Considering the use of technology
   over time, we propose the notion of political technologies of memory' to
   name the lasting effects of artefacts that register and denounce human
   rights violations. We discuss as transposition' the operations by which
   technologies may be transferred and appropriated, transcending their
   initial production context and purpose. We offer examples of registry
   technologies' transposition into transitional justice mechanisms,
   showing how one such example was represented through an artwork that
   engaged Chilean society in an ongoing transitional justice conversation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the agenda of research on work values that has
   been developing since the late 1960s. It distinguishes four phases,
   which successively broadened the scope of research on work values. The
   first phase focused on the likely impact of economic development and
   rising incomes on work values. The second interrogated the role of work
   values for those experiencing unemployment. The third extended the focus
   to gendered work values related to women's increasing participation in
   the labor market. Finally, there has been increased interest in the
   strength of role attachment to a job and organization. In each area of
   research, the growth over time of cross-national comparative studies has
   revealed variations in work values across countries that point to the
   importance of understanding differences in institutional structures and
   cultural values.},

Abstract = {There has been much talk about ordoliberalism recently. Scholars and the
   press identify it as the dominant economic instruction sheet for
   Germany's European crisis politics. However, by analyzing ordoliberalism
   only as an economic theory, the debate downplays that ordoliberalism is
   also an ethical theory, with strong roots in Protestant social thought.
   It is this rooting in Protestant social thought that makes
   Ordoliberalism incompatible with the socioeconomic ethics of most of the
   European crisis countries, whose ethics originate in Catholic and
   Orthodox social thought. This divergence is the source of a crisis of
   understanding between European nations and hinders a collective response
   to the Euro crisis.},

Abstract = {While a consensus seems to be emerging that bureaucracies of
   international organizations are of growing relevance for policy-making
   beyond the nation-state, we still do not systematically understand if
   and how exactly international bureaucracies seek to influence policy.
   Most importantly, there is a lack of concepts for a comparative
   assessment of bureaucratic influence across different International
   Organizations. This article addresses this shortcoming by offering a
   conceptualization of administrative styles. Depending on dominant
   strategic orientations shaping administrative routines, we identify four
   ideal types: a servant style, an advocacy style, a consolidator style,
   and an entrepreneurial style. We argue that the variation in
   administrative styles across different organizations can be explained by
   two factors, namely the internal and external challenges they face. The
   concept and theoretical explanation are illustrated in four case studies
   on the bureaucracies of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for
   International Settlements, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the
   International Labor Organization.},

Title = {Euroscepticism among Dutch Leftist and Rightist Populist Constituencies:
   How can the U-Curve be Understood?},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},

Volume = {57},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The U-curve in euroscepticism is well established: both leftist and
   rightist populist constituencies are more eurosceptic than voters for
   establishment parties. Using rich survey data on a country with both
   constituencies represented in parliament (the Netherlands; n=1,296), we
   examine why euroscepticism drives populist voting. Our analyses
   demonstrate that euroscepticism is part of the well-established link
   between both 1) distrust in politics and politicians, and 2) support for
   protectionism on the one hand, and voting for both types of populist
   party on the other. It is also part of the well-known relationship
   between 3) ethnocentrism and rightist populist voting. Surprisingly,
   euroscepticism is not part of the typical association between economic
   egalitarianism and voting for a leftist populist party. The concluding
   section discusses the implications of our findings and provides
   suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {Values guide our attitudes and behavior, but to what extent and how do
   individual values determine our overall well-being? Self-determination
   theory holds that particular types of values (i.e., intrinsic or
   extrinsic) matter most, but the person-environment fit perspective
   argues that any values can be beneficial as long as they align with
   values prevalent in one's environment. The evidentiary support for these
   competing claims is inconclusive. We use the World Value Survey to see
   how these perspectives do in predicting life satisfaction, happiness,
   and health in youngsters aged 18 to 30 around the world. Our results
   generally confirm hypotheses derived from self-determination theory,
   showing that the type of values held by youngsters and the type of
   values prevailing in their environments account for significant
   variation in young peoples' life satisfaction, happiness, and health.
   The pattern of evidence suggests that youngsters benefit from attaching
   greater importance to intrinsic values related to affiliation and
   community contribution rather than to extrinsic values that relate to
   financial success and accumulation of power.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the transformation of identity of Russian-speakers
   in independent Ukraine. Based on survey, focus groups and public
   discourse data, it explores the hierarchy of identities of those people
   who use predominantly Russian in their everyday lives and the meaning
   they attach to their perceived belonging to the Ukrainian nation.
   Although many scholars argued after the breakup of the USSR that
   Ukraine's Russian-speakers would form into a community distinguished by
   its preferred language, the present analysis shows that they have
   instead been transformed from Soviet people into Ukrainians-and that
   without drastic changes in their language practice.},

   most dynamic and prioritised policy fields of the EU. The UK's unique
   opt-in and opt-out arrangements with the EU in this field have enabled
   it to selectively participate in measures which it perceives to be in
   its national interest, contributing to the field's complex
   differentiated integration. However, the UK has deeply shaped the AFSJ,
   with the UK's involvement having benefitted both the UK and the EU,
   leading to Brexit potentially having a deep impact on the internal
   security of both parties.},

Abstract = {In 1980, Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party Platform foregrounded
   the significance of Supreme Court nominations in promoting the
   ``sanctity of human life{''} and ``traditional family values.{''}
   Opponents of abortion were thus confounded when, in the first six months
   of Reagan's presidency, he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to the highest
   bench in the land. Right-to-lifers believed O'Connor was a supporter of
   abortion rights and feminist goals, and they were deeply troubled by the
   revelation that their access and symbolic capital did not translate into
   influence. The chapter demonstrates the fragility of the alliance
   between right-to-lifers, the New Right, and the Religious Right, as well
   as the fraught dynamics between the pro-life movement, the Reagan
   administration, and the Republican Party. The attempt to block O'Connor
   was doomed to failure, but it threw into stark relief which segments of
   the Reagan Revolution were willing to risk antagonizing the President in
   defense of their goals.},

Abstract = {In Reagan's first term, the triumph of the New Right and the new
   Republican majority in the Senate made it seem that the executive and
   legislative branches would provide fertile ground for the ultimate
   anti-abortion goal, a Human Life Amendment to the US Constitution.
   However, the pro-life movement was plunged into chaos in the early 1980s
   as two competing models emerged in the Senate. This chapter examines
   movement turmoil, charting the complicated religious, ideological, and
   strategic schisms which erupted and that were indicative of deeper
   divisions within the movement over the past and future of the cause.
   This struggle over the movement's constitutional strategy also revealed
   the divisions within the Republican Party over economic and social
   conservatism. Neither measure was successful, and the constitutional
   strategy effectively came to an end in 1983. These experiences forced
   anti-abortionists to confront the question of compromise and just what
   they could expect from their allies in Washington, DC.},

   Struggle and Mass-Based Conflict in Deeply Polarized Thailand},

Abstract = {Thailand fits the pattern of pernicious polarized politics identified in
   this volume, where a previously excluded group successfully gains
   political power through the ballot box, governs unilaterally to pursue
   radical reforms, and produces a backlash from the traditional power
   elites. In Thailand, elite conflict has been a major part of the story,
   but this article argues that political polarization there cannot be
   merely understood as ``elite-driven{''}: conflict among the elites and
   the masses, and the interaction between them, produced polarized and
   unstable politics. Violent struggle is caused by class structure and
   regional, urban-rural disparities; elite struggle activates the existing
   social cleavages; and ideological framing deepens the polarization.
   While the Yellow Shirts and traditional elites want to restore and
   uphold the ``Thai-style democracy{''} with royal nationalism, the Red
   Shirts espouse the ``populist democracy{''} of strong elected government
   with popular nationalism and egalitarian social order.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of the discourse of law in legitimizing
   the protection of intelligence secrets. It draws on examples from the
   United Kingdom and the United States to illustrate rhetorical
   regularities with respect to the need to protect intelligence officers,
   agents, sources and methods, the effectiveness of intelligence agencies,
   international intelligence relationships and the effects of a mosaic of
   disclosed information. It concludes that judges produce specialized
   knowledge on state secrecy that plays a part in shaping the
   understanding of state secrecy in society.},

Abstract = {Poland represents a surprising case of democratic backsliding since the
   return to power of the PiS party in 2015, given that positive conditions
   associated with democracy are present-consistent strong per capita
   economic growth since 1989, moderate inequality, rising wages, strong
   preference for democracy, high levels of happiness, and a parliamentary
   system with proportional representation. The lack of strong underlying
   cleavages indicates the polarization was not bottom up. Instead, this
   article argues that polarization was driven from the top down by a
   segment of the political class that donned the cloak of radical populist
   anti-establishmentarianism to gain popular support, win an election, and
   rewrite the constitutional rules of the game to its own benefit. The
   Polish case points to the importance of elite cues, and especially the
   pernicious consequences of system-delegitimizing rhetoric, creating
   distrust in the media and institutions.},

Abstract = {After Kremlin policymakers decided to incorporate the territory of
   Crimea into Russia, updates on public attitudes in Russian-speaking
   communities elsewhere in Ukraine would have been in high demand. Because
   social media users produce content in order to communicate ideas to
   their social networks, online political discourse can provide important
   clues about the political dispositions of communities. We map the
   evolution of Russian-speakers' attitudes, expressed on social media,
   across the course of the conflict as Russian analysts might have
   observed them at the time. Results suggest that the Russian-Ukrainian
   interstate border only moved as far as their military could have
   advanced while incurring no occupation costs - Crimea, and no further.},

Abstract = {Policy documents are a source of authority in both a legal and a
   normative sense. When policy documents make particular assumptions about
   care work requiring private, not public, consideration, this can push
   care, its concerns, and those who give and receive care out of the
   public sphere. This marginalization of care work, however, is ethically
   suspect, and as such I argue here that we should use the feminist ethics
   of care as a way to analyze current policy and guide the creation of
   future policy to ensure more ethically robust policy statements. I
   advocate for the use of care ethics in addition to human rights
   ethically guided public policy, which prioritizes the effort to
   implement human rights standards through government action. My claim is
   that human rights should not be our sole basis for moral and political
   reasoning, especially in the policy process. Policy shapes our lives,
   and how we live in relation to particular others. Care ethics can and
   should be used as an ethical guide for the policy process because it can
   bring to the fore how institutional patterns of power shape our
   relations, an analysis that human rights theories are not, in general,
   built to undertake.},

Abstract = {The integration of small states into the international financial system
   has constrained their ability to enact the traditional macroeconomic
   tools of fiscal and monetary policy. As systems of mortgage credit are
   tightly integrated into global capital markets and influence flows of
   capital between states, this paper uses Denmark as a case study to
   explore whether domestic mortgage sector reforms have been used to build
   financial capacity to compensate for the loss of economic policy
   autonomy. The results of this analysis suggest that the Danish
   government has actively used mortgage credit to meet three specific
   macroeconomic objectives since the 1980s: (1) mortgage credit was
   restricted in the 1980s to resolve Denmark's persistent balance of
   payments problem; (2) liberalisations of mortgage credit in the 1990s
   and 2000s allowed the Danish government to stimulate the economy via
   privatised/house-price Keynesianism and reduce their sovereign debt
   burden; and (3) mortgage credit has been used as a form of privatised
   monetary policy, allowing Denmark to break-free from the `iron-cage' of
   the Mundell-Fleming trilemma. It is in these specific ways that the
   Danish government has used mortgage reforms to achieve macroeconomic
   policy autonomy and navigate economic challenges whilst adhering to the
   constraints of the international financial system.},

Abstract = {The EU's legal system has been built on the principle of a single legal
   order. Undeniably, however, differentiation has crept in. The UK has
   been at the forefront of seeking opt-outs and exceptions to the euro,
   the Schengen area and so on. After Brexit, will requests by member
   states for special treatment continue, or will the Brexit experience
   strengthen the legal order? Is the EU's legal system capable of
   absorbing differentiation in its fabric? This article argues that
   differentiation can be accommodated only so far in the Treaty
   arrangements without a wholescale re-evaluation of the purpose of EU
   law. The UK's departure removes the member state most ready to challenge
   some of the fundamentals of the legal order, but the article urges
   caution against a full re-characterization of the nature of EU law
   post-Brexit. Instead, the article foresees a continuation of the status
   quo, in which differentiation exists in various forms but as exceptions
   to the rule, rather than the rule itself.},

Abstract = {Does the participation of women in international criminal courts enhance
   the provision of gender justice? Scant scholarly attention has been paid
   to women as prosecutors, despite the pivotal role that prosecutors play
   in determining who is charged and what charges they face. In this
   article, we explore the influence of women in the Office of the
   Prosecutor (OTP) in international criminal courts. First, we examine the
   relationship between the presence of women on prosecutorial teams and
   sexual violence charges that are brought forth at trial. Next, we move
   beyond the influence of women prosecutors on indictments to consider how
   their presence is shaped by the internal dynamics of the institutions.
   We point to the culture of trial teams, the processes of investigations,
   and internal hierarchies to demonstrate how informal practices and
   gendered norms affect women's positionality within the OTPs and their
   ability to provide gender justice.},

Abstract = {Why do member states of regional intergovernmental organizations (RIOs)
   voluntarily adapt their policies and institutions to the norms and
   procedures implemented in other member states? I tackle this puzzle by
   investigating the domestic effects of health cooperation among South
   American states within the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). The
   article shows how the establishment of a regional sector-based
   institution like the Health Council of UNASUR triggered the diffusion of
   similar policies by reducing transaction costs and increasing
   information exchanges among member states' health bureaucracies. I argue
   that RIOs such as UNASUR catalyse transnational diffusion not by
   enforcing binding regional norms (as in the case of the EU), but by
   bridging member states' shared functional needs and asymmetric
   capacities in specific policy areas. Using the case of UNASUR Health,
   the article contributes to the study of the logics of transnational
   diffusion within RIOs in the absence of authority delegated to
   supranational institutions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigatethe divergence in Russian public opinion
   between the masses and elites in terms of attitudes toward foreign
   countries in the post-Crimea era. To do so, we combine elite surveys
   conducted in Russia from 2000 to 2016 with an extensive database of
   Levada Center mass public opinion polling to test two competing models
   for explaining the observed divergence in mass and elite opinion: a
   demographic-driven Common Determinants model and a novel Kremlin Cueing
   model. More specifically, we assess the extent to which a set of
   demographic variables trained on a model of mass attitudes is able to
   predict elite attitudes. Our empirical evidence is more consistent with
   the predictions of the Kremlin Cueing model, indicating that, in some
   cases, elite opinion reacts very differently to shocks such as the
   Crimea crisis due to ``where they sit{''} rather than who they are as
   individuals.},

Abstract = {Although political scientists have documented the effects of
   incarceration on those serving time in prison and jail, there has been
   much less discussion about feedback effects on the attitudes of those
   who work in correctional institutions. This is a considerable oversight,
   given the enormous growth of the correctional workforce and its
   importance in the implementation of crime policy. In this article, we
   present original survey data from a large sample of California
   correctional officers. Our analyses suggest that characteristics of the
   institutions where correctional officers work-the levels of violence to
   which they are exposed, the proportion of inmates involved in
   high-quality rehabilitation programs, as well as the quality of
   management-help to shape officers' attitudes toward rehabilitation.
   These dynamics have important implications for how public policies can
   create political constituencies among criminal justice officers. The
   attitudes of these officers should therefore be a concern for scholars,
   advocates, and practitioners who are interested in political strategies
   for long-term, meaningful reform to the correctional system.},

Abstract = {The internet industry has emerged as an important economic and political
   actor, both within the United States and internationally. Internet
   companies depend on exceptions from copyright law in order to operate.
   As a result, internet companies have considerable incentive to try and
   influence international copyright law. However, the current literature
   has neglected the role of the internet industry, instead focusing on the
   influence of copyright owning media companies. This has largely
   homogenized the concerns of business interests, neglecting the interests
   of business actors which do not favor stricter copyright protection. By
   examining business conflict over recent copyright initiatives by the
   United States, this article criticizes the literature. It illustrates
   that the internet industry has been able to alter the negotiating
   preferences of the United States against the wishes of copyright owners.
   This argues against the homogenization of business interests regarding
   copyright while illustrating the importance of material over discursive
   factors in determining political outcomes.},

Abstract = {Most studies of the coup d'etat in Iran in August 1953-a coup backed by
   U.S. and British intelligence agencies-attribute it at least partly to
   U.S. concerns about the threat of a Communist takeover in Iran. This
   article examines the evidence available to U.S. officials about the
   nature of the Communist threat in Iran prior to the coup, in the form of
   reports, analyses, and policy papers written on this subject at the time
   by U.S. officials. The documentation reveals that U.S. policymakers did
   not have compelling evidence that the threat of a Communist takeover was
   increasing substantially in the months before the coup. Rather, the
   Eisenhower administration interpreted the available evidence in a more
   alarming manner than the Truman administration had. The coup the
   administration undertook in response was therefore premature, at best.},

Abstract = {This article explores the evolution and determinants of public support
   for the euro since its creation in 1999 until the end of 2017, thereby
   covering the pre-crisis experience of the euro, the crisis years and the
   recent recovery. Using uniquely large macro and micro databases and
   applying up-to-date econometric techniques, the authors revisit the
   growing literature on public support for the euro. First, we find that a
   majority of citizens support the euro in nearly all 19 euro area member
   states. Second, we offer fresh evidence that economic factors are
   important determinants of change in the level of support for the euro:
   crisis reduces support while periods of recovery from unemployment bode
   well for public support. This result holds for both macroeconomic and
   microeconomic factors. Turning to a broad set of socioeconomic
   variables, we find clear differences in support due to education and

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a consistent theoretical approach
   to the financial links between the so-called debt-led (DLG) and
   `export-led' (XLG) growth regimes. Assuming the endogenous supply of
   money and the unstable dynamics of financial markets, the leveraging
   process of DLG regimes is taken as an inherent dynamic of developed
   domestic financial systems, without the need of any external capital
   inflow. Foreign inflows are not a requisite for such expansions;
   however, attracted by high expected returns, they can play a key role in
   fueling DLG cases. Alternatively, current-account imbalances are not an
   indicator of the international financial flows but rather a side effect
   stemming from the productive, financial and trade links between DLG and
   XLG countries. Based on this approach, we study the relationship between
   changes in credit and current-account balances in several countries
   before and after the crisis of 2008. Both the observed general
   relationship of these variables for most of the countries, as well as
   some specific national cases `out of the norm' are fundamental for
   understanding the national and international financial links between DLG
   and XLG models.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {This study analyses how a state's reactive currency statecraft - its
   strategic reaction to an international currency issued by a foreign
   state - is shaped, by devoting special attention to its broad foreign
   policy stance towards the state issuing that international currency,
   with a main empirical focus on the Japanese case with regard to the
   Chinese renminbi. This research argues that a state uses its policy
   related to a foreign international currency as a diplomatic means of
   managing its political relationship with the state issuing that
   currency, while also showing that in general most market actors are not
   greatly interested in their governments' policies regarding foreign
   international currencies, especially those that are newly
   internationalising ones. This study finds as well that the conventional
   notion of `competition' between international currencies does not
   necessarily affect a state's reactive currency statecraft, even if its
   own currency is a major international one. All of this suggests that the
   inter-state politics between the state issuing an international currency
   and foreign states does have a crucial impact on the currency's
   international use, especially during its early stages of
   internationalisation. It also implies that a state's reactive currency
   statecraft can be fluid, depending upon the directions of its foreign
   policy.},

Abstract = {This article re-examines a case of corruption that was perpetuated
   during a period of authoritarian rule in the Philippines: the subversion
   of `coconut levies', a tax on coconut production imposed by strongman
   President Ferdinand Marcos from 1971 to 1982. Literature on the case has
   formed the basis for locating the political origins of the country's
   struggles with long-run economic transformation in terms of the extent
   of `rent-seeking' and articulations of `neo-patrimonialism' in this
   middle-income developing economy. The article interrogates how extant
   analyses of the case have explained associated malign developmental
   outcomes with reference to institutional design and governance
   conditions. It forwards a re-interpretation that focuses on the
   distributional contest underpinning levy mobilisation, including the
   types of state-engineered privileges contested, and how access to these
   were politically determined and regulated during and after the Marcos
   period. This approach, in which developmental possibilities of
   rent-creating state interventions are not universally denied but
   considered with reference to configurations of power and structures of
   political bargaining, will be shown to address limitations of
   preponderant analyses and bear relevance to developing countries where,
   because of structural reasons, neo-patrimonialism may be endemic but
   rent-creating state interventions cannot be discounted as instruments
   for promoting economic development.},

Abstract = {The conflation of Stalinism with socialism was a key aspect of the
   relationship between Stalinism and capitalism. The Russian Marxist
   Nodari Simoniya exposed that conflation in his book What We Have Built,
   which is discussed in this essay in the context of Russian
   historiography about Stalinism. The main themes of Simoniya's critique
   of Stalinism as a historical reversal are elaborated and linked to
   political images during the Cold War that distorted the meaning of
   socialism. Stalinism is revealed as a negative satellite of capitalism,
   constituting an external economic zone, not an alternative form of world
   order.},

Abstract = {The transformation of public infrastructure and services into vehicles
   of profit-making through privately financed and operated partnerships
   (PPPs) has successfully weathered high profile project failures, changes
   in government, scathing audits, public resistance, financial crises,
   fiscal austerity, and found a home around the world despite vastly
   different legal, cultural, and institutional contexts. Public
   procurement and traditional budgeting practices are now a distant memory
   in many jurisdictions - not by happenstance but through dogged efforts
   to transform public sectors from service provider into commodity
   purchaser. Understanding the political economy of global PPP markets
   requires knowing the connection to managerialism underpinning the story
   of public administration as contract management. This paper explores the
   emergence, sophistication, and normalization of PPP using primary and
   secondary sources including interviews with those involved in, or keenly
   aware of, the historical creation of pioneering PPP markets. It
   identifies three apposite categories of PPP management: models, methods,
   and mindsets. Models are homogenously portable yet malleable templates
   for partnering. Methods include accounting treatment and standards, and
   new budgeting and tendering practices. Mindsets are the ideas and ideals
   initially spread by enthusiasts like the Big Five consultancy firms and
   Macquarie Bank, later entrenched through specialized quasi-public
   agencies such as Partnerships UK and the World Bank's PPIAF.},

Abstract = {Feminist researchers have used social movement concepts such as the
   ``velvet triangle,{''} mobilizing structures, and political opportunity
   to explain why national governments and international organizations
   adopt gender mainstreaming. However, these theories are unable to
   explain patriarchy's profound influence on bureaucrats or to propose
   strategies to reduce bureaucratic resistance. This study suggests that
   Putnam's social capital theory allows us to see that, in the political
   process of gender mainstreaming, feminist activists need social
   relations to strengthen their mobilizing solidarity, potential allies,
   legitimacy, and power. We examined how and why the Taiwanese feminist
   activists who participated in women's policy machineries from 2005 to
   2009 successfully institutionalized gender mainstreaming throughout the
   central government, including the installation of individual gender
   equality committees in all ministries. We found that their success lay
   in their ability to utilize political opportunities, emotion work, and
   confrontational tactics to enhance their social capital. They also
   created and established important social capital with and among
   politicians and civil servants. Their experience shows that gender
   equality mechanisms that allow civil society groups to engage in
   decision-making processes and that provide regular opportunities for
   dialogue between feminists and state actors can improve gender
   mainstreaming implementation and reduce bureaucratic resistance.},

Abstract = {Services dominate the US economy and are increasingly traded across
   borders yet little is known about service firms' trade policy objectives
   or lobbying activities. We fill this gap by examining services'
   political engagement on trade policy as manifested through lobbying,
   public positions on trade, and reports issued by U.S. Industry Trade
   Advisory Committees. We document for the first time that service firms
   are highly active in the politics of US trade agreements and, compared
   to firms in goods-producing industries, are much less likely to disagree
   over trade. Instead, service firms are almost uniformly supportive of US
   trade agreements, which we explain by focusing on the stark US
   comparative advantage in services. Service firms are therefore a key
   constituency for deeper international economic cooperation, helping to
   explain the present era of global integration despite tough times for
   uncompetitive US manufacturing. We expect service producers to join the
   defense of global economic order against emergent populism.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the idea of the pluriverse as one response to recent
   calls for the decolonization of international and global ethics. It
   argues that taking pluriversality seriously challenges prevailing
   understandings of global ethics as the acquisition and application of
   moral expertise. Instead of aiming to know the meaning of global justice
   and then apply it to particular contexts, a pluriversal ethics addresses
   the question of how to cultivate a practical ethic of coexistence and
   collaboration with others in an ontologically plural and radically
   hierarchical world.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the degree of autonomy the Ukrainian volunteer
   battalions had from the regular forces during the war in Donbas. The
   findings indicate that the degree of autonomy was high and that in
   particular, three initial conditions were decisive for this outcome: (1)
   the relative level of militia military strength in the initial states of
   conflict; (2) the degree of agenda overlap; (3) the degree of bottom-up
   organization. The empirical evidence further suggests that the three
   factors produced the identified outcome through the mechanisms of
   ``institutional lock-in,{''} ``performance interdependence,{''} and
   ``entitlement.{''} Consequently, the Ukrainian state and regular forces
   ended up accepting a higher degree of autonomy, in terms of command and
   control, on the part of the volunteer battalions than they otherwise
   probably would have preferred. This outcome contributed significantly to
   saving the sovereignty of the Ukrainian state in 2014-2015, but may also
   have created conditions for challenges to the same state further down
   the road.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {A key battle has been fought within the UK cabinet on the direction of
   post-Brexit trade policy. The opposing sides have favoured either
   continued alignment or a `hard' break with the European Union's (EU's)
   regulatory and customs regime, in the latter case to allow the UK to
   pursue an independent and ambitious trade policy agenda. Contrary to
   much commentary on `post-truth' politics, both sides have relied on
   rival forms of expertise to support their claims. I argue for the need
   to not only re-emphasise the malleability and political nature of expert
   knowledge, but also appreciate its emotional bases. The Treasury has led
   the charge in favour of a softer Brexit by drawing on econometric
   ('gravity') models that emphasise the economic costs of looser
   association with the EU. In contrast to this attempt at technocratic
   legitimation, the specific legal expertise drawn upon by cabinet
   advocates of `hard' Brexit has appealed to an emotive political economy
   of bringing the UK, and its (in this imaginary) overly regulated
   economy, closer to its `kith and kin' in the Anglosphere, deepening the
   UK `national business model'. I conclude by calling for more explicitly
   emotive and values-based argumentation in the public debate on the UK's
   future trade policy to improve the quality of democratic deliberation.},

Abstract = {The elites of Western Europe prefer social security for all citizens as
   the major aim of the EU, while the preference of Central and Eastern
   European elites is for a more globally competitive European economy.
   This disparity between elite preferences may be accounted for by the
   distinct electorates and elites' responsive strategic calculations, or
   by the process of socialisation Central and Eastern European elites
   undergo during exposure to the EU. This article argues that the
   predominant reason for the difference in elite attitudes towards
   economic competition is the lasting effect of state socialism in Central
   and Eastern European countries.},

Abstract = {The capability approach to human development, which has been very
   influential within the United Nations Development Programme, has been
   instrumental in bringing out an emphasis on final goals of development
   connected to the expansion of human freedom. Because these final goals
   are also seen as means for further development, there is a tendency to
   neglect other means of development, such as changes in the productive
   structure and in the distribution of power within the relations of
   production. Here I assess the intellectual origins of the capability
   approach to human development, and its influence on development
   discourse. I argue that it is important to bring back to development
   discourse, and to the capability approach to human development in
   particular, a concern with productive structures that characterised
   earlier approaches to development centred on industrialisation. This
   requires a greater focus on how power relationships in productive
   systems influence human capabilities.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how the gendered patriarchal mechanisms that
   exclude women from the political sphere are being produced, re-produced,
   and challenged in interpersonal political conversations by concentrating
   on the discursive mechanisms that construct the way young Israeli women
   and men talk about politics. The research is based on a yearlong
   intra-group dialog process. The group met for weekly sessions during two
   semesters, in which the group members discussed and expressed their
   thoughts and feelings regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   Critical discourse analysis (CDA) demonstrated how the political space
   is being marked, defined and delimited through gendered discursive
   practices. We present the different roles participants take in the
   group, and in particular the different strategies women use in face of
   disciplinary discursive mechanisms. The process revealed that the
   development in the group discussion was strongly intertwined with the
   change in the positioning strategies of the female participants. In
   particular, we found that women deployed emotionality as a tool of
   resistance that challenges gender binaries and masculine dominance. Our
   conclusion highlights the importance of the daily interactions in
   creating, sustaining and changing the political discourse of a society
   in conflict.},

   Convergence Effects of ESIF Funding in the Presence of Spatial

Abstract = {The European structural and investment funds (ESIF) constitute the prime
   instrument of EU regional policy. We study the ESIF's effectiveness in
   terms of fostering intra-EU income convergence through investment
   support to lagging regions. Our empirical results for the period
   1997-2007 indicate that the ESIF's contribution to income growth is
   insignificant or even negative for several peripheral EU regions. We
   argue that the negative link between funding and regional growth is
   mainly attributable to spatial spillovers. While the latter may reflect
   the intensified competition for scarce production factors among highly
   funded regions in geographical proximity, we also discuss the role
   played by structural backwardness in a macro-regional context to explain
   this sobering result. As such, we show that negative funding effects
   significantly correlate with lower levels of regional institutional
   quality. Taken together, our findings indicate that unintended
   distortionary effects restrain EU regional policy from working
   effectively to foster income convergence.},

Abstract = {The EU has established a new architecture of international labour
   standards governance within the Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD)
   chapters of its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). To examine the
   operationalization of this framework, we draw upon 121 interviews
   undertaken with key informants in three FTAs signed with the Caribbean,
   South Korea and Moldova. We engage with wider debates over external
   governance and the projection of EU power by showing how operational
   failings, including a lack of legal and political prioritization of TSD
   chapters and shortcomings in the implementation of key provisions, have
   hindered the impact of the FTAs upon labour standards. We also identify
   significant limitations to the EU's `common formulation' approach when
   applied to different trading partner contexts, alongside ambiguities
   about the underlying purpose of the trade-labour linkage. Reflection
   about the function and purpose of labour standards provisions in EU
   trade policy is therefore required.},

Abstract = {The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) raises questions
   about what comparative advantage, if any, human beings will have over
   machines in the future. This essay explores what it means to be human
   and how those unique characteristics relate to the digital age. Humor
   and ethics both rely upon higher-level cognition that accounts for
   unstructured and unrelated data. That capability is also vital to
   decision-making processes-such as jurisprudence and voting systems.
   Since machine learning algorithms lack the ability to understand context
   or nuance, reliance on them could lead to undesired results for society.
   By way of example, two case studies are used to illustrate the legal and
   moral considerations regarding the software algorithms used by
   driverless cars and lethal autonomous weapons systems. Social values
   must be encoded or introduced into training data sets if AI applications
   are to be expected to produce results similar to a ``human in the
   loop.{''} There is a choice to be made, then, about whether we impose
   limitations on these new technologies in favor of maintaining human
   control, or whether we seek to replicate ethical reasoning and lateral
   thinking in the systems we create. The answer will have profound effects
   not only on how we interact with AI but also on how we interact with one
   another and perceive ourselves.},

Abstract = {Despite shared historical experience and cultural proximity, the
   Visegrad group (V4) struggles to institutionalise its cooperation
   through stable mechanisms ensuring internal cohesion and external
   credibility. This is especially evident in the field of security and
   defence, which requires a shared strategic vision, in particular, common
   norms regarding the legitimate use of military force. While in the 1990s
   the four countries exhibited solidarity and unity in their collective
   ambition under the narrative of the `Return to Europe', their general
   perception of security threats and strategic culture prevents deeper
   integration into a security community.},

Abstract = {This essay asks what place language holds in the composition of
   Ukrainian national identity and whether the use of Ukrainian and Russian
   across Ukraine indicates a split in identity. Despite acknowledging the
   potential of these two languages to generate political cleavages, the
   essay shows that language controversies have not necessarily impeded the
   population's attachment and loyalty to the Ukrainian state. Moreover,
   the increasingly civic nature of Ukrainian national
   identity-particularly since Euromaidan-appears to be an important factor
   that allows people to speak Russian and still identify strongly with the
   Ukrainian nation.},

Abstract = {Growing racial, ideological, and cultural polarization within the
   American electorate contributed to the shocking victory of Donald Trump
   in the 2016 presidential election. Using data from American National
   Election Studies surveys, we show that Trump's unusually explicit
   appeals to racial and ethnic resentment attracted strong support from
   white working-class voters while repelling many college-educated whites
   along with the overwhelming majority of nonwhite voters. However,
   Trump's campaign exploited divisions that have been growing within the
   electorate for decades because of demographic and cultural changes in
   American society. The 2016 presidential campaign also reinforced another
   longstanding trend in American electoral politics: the rise of negative
   partisanship, that is voting based on hostility toward the opposing
   party and its leaders. We conclude with a discussion of the consequences
   of deepening partisan and affective polarization for American democracy
   and the perceptions by both experts and the public of an erosion in its
   quality.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {395-408},
Abstract = {As cyber-security incidents become increasingly prevalent, we are facing
   a major political and democratic challenge: who comprises `the public'
   in relation to such incidents? Based on a study of the controversies
   surrounding the WannaCry ransomware attack, this article unpacks issues
   facing the creation of publics in contemporary ICT-mediated security
   practices. It shows how cyber-security incidents, such as WannaCry, do
   not neatly align with traditional national security politics and
   democracy, and it demonstrates the need to attend to how security
   publics are created. This may paradoxically entail both political and
   democratic challenges and possibilities for security politics in the
   digital age.},

Abstract = {This chapter covers the early years of Tanaka's career as a law
   professor (1923-1930), a pivotal period when Tanaka got married,
   converted to Catholicism, and wrote his first book, one of his most
   important, on Law, Religion and Social Life (1927). Building on his
   discovery of universality in the principles of commercial law, it shows
   how Tanaka's Christian understanding of the dualism of Man as caught
   between the flesh and the spirit led him to a broader understanding of
   law as not a necessary evil but as a social and moral good. In Law,
   Religion and Social Life, he drew on the lessons of President Calles's
   persecution of Catholics in Mexico to argue that Japanese also must
   resist efforts to pass laws that would restrict religious freedom, a
   point he reinforced with references to Pope Pius X's Vehementer Nos.},

Abstract = {Focusing on Tanaka's role as a judge, the chapter opens with his
   appointment as the Chief Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court in 1950
   and ending with his 1970 retirement from the International Court of
   Justice in The Hague. The Tanaka Court heard some of the most important
   cases in modern Japanese history, but Tanaka's importance extended
   beyond the decisions of the court to his critical role in establishing
   the independence of the court from outside influence. Both in Tokyo and
   at The Hague, Tanaka put into practice the principles of World Law, thus
   bringing to fruition the promise inherent in his life-long globalist
   jurisprudence. The culmination of his implementation of World Law is his
   famous dissenting opinion in the South West Africa Case that is still
   held up today as an example of the relevance of Natural Law to the
   defense of human rights and the struggle against racism.},

Abstract = {After understanding the underlying dynamics of space travel and
   describing the main features of the space environment, we can continue
   with an analysis of the outer space domain by researching the outer
   space as a military-diplomatic field. Unlike the previous understanding
   of the outer space, this area of the space geopolitics is to a large
   extent shaped by the human activity and is thus partially socially
   created. It, therefore, does not only follow physical constraints but
   also depends on human activities and norms. As evident from the name,
   this part of space analysis can be roughly divided into two
   sections-military operations and diplomatic affairs. However, to
   understand the nature of the military-diplomatic space in full detail,
   we will subdivide each of these parts into more sections so that we can
   get a clear picture about the nature and interactions of the processes
   inside this understanding of the astropolitics. The following chapter
   will thus deal with following issues-space law, space diplomacy, space
   warfare, and space security. The first sub-chapter will analyze the
   legal environment, the second examines the relationship among the
   space-faring actors regarding the space activities, the third describes
   the logic of conducting warfare in and from the outer space domain, and
   finally the fourth explores space security as a broader concept.},

Title = {US-China conflict in global trade governance: the new politics of
   agricultural subsidies at the WTO},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-231},
Abstract = {This article shows how China's rise has radically altered the politics
   of one of the most prominent and controversial issues in the global
   trading system: agriculture subsidies. Agriculture subsidies depress
   global prices and undermine the competitiveness and livelihoods of poor
   farmers, and therefore have been long seen as a symbol of the injustice
   of the trading system. The issue has traditionally been understood in
   North-South terms, with developed countries seen as the perpetrators of
   harm and developing countries as innocent victims. In this article,
   however, I challenge this prevailing conception of the agricultural
   subsidies issue, arguing that it is now out of date and no longer
   corresponds with the emerging reality. A momentous but underappreciated
   change has taken place, largely beneath the radar of IPE scholarship:
   China has emerged as the world's largest subsidizer, profoundly
   transforming the global politics of agricultural subsidies. From a
   North-South battle, WTO negotiations on agricultural subsidies are now
   primarily centered on a conflict between the US and China. While
   reducing subsidies remains a pressing concern for developing countries,
   efforts to negotiate new and strengthened disciplines at the WTO have
   been thwarted by an impasse between the two dominant powers.},

Abstract = {This article describes the results of field research into religious
   Jewry of St. Petersburg. I analyze biographies of Modern Orthodox and
   Hasids of Lubavitcher traditions (or the Chabads as they call
   themselves), who in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's disintegration
   in the 1990s chose observance as their self-identity and lifestyle. The
   paper is aimed at answering the following questions: how do modern
   Jewish identities differ from one another among the St. Petersburg
   observant Jewry raised in non-religious families and Soviet schools? How
   do they coordinate their collective identity with other Jewish
   communities around the world? To conceptualize my research, I have used
   Giddens and Beck's theories of modernity, while my methodology draws on
   the use of biography and biographical narrative in ethnographic studies.
   I argue that individual reflexivity gained new importance for both
   Modern Orthodox Jews and the Chabads in the post-Soviet religious
   liberation and the arrival of new religious influences. However, whereas
   Modern Orthodox Jews emphasize the autonomy of their subject position
   and stress the meaning of individual dogma, the Chabads foreground the
   primacy of tradition when reflecting on their identity as religious
   Jews.},

Abstract = {A key to understanding regulation through private intermediaries is how
   third-party actors are selected and controlled. This paper examines the
   question in prostitution policy, a value-loaded policy field that
   stimulates regulators to carefully select private intermediaries to
   avoid regulatory capture. By means of a novel data set on prostitution
   policy in 25 OECD countries (1960-2010) as well as with a comparative
   case study on two German states, the paper discovers that the
   responsibilization of private intermediaries is a slowly diffusing
   phenomenon, accompanied by strong public oversight. Moreover, the
   selection of private regulatory intermediaries is an ideology-driven
   process in which the congruence in (moral) goals is key for the
   establishment of any relationship, while regulatory capacities are
   secondary. Thus, private intermediaries generally rule under a ``shadow
   of moral hierarchy{''} in prostitution policy. This emphasis on shared
   moral goals enriches the young research on regulatory intermediaries
   with a largely disregarded selection criterion, which is able to reduce
   the risk of regulatory capture by private actors in delicate regulatory
   areas.},

Abstract = {Recent literature on international trade has devoted increased attention
   to the role played by the extensive margin of trade for economies
   engaged in liberalization and structural transformation processes, such
   as the new EU countries. This article documents the leading role of the
   new goods margin in trade growth for the new member states that have
   acceded the EU in 2004 and 2007. Product trade data is used to analyse
   the trade share of the new goods over the sample period 1999-2014. The
   results show that the extensive margin of trade grew from 10 to around
   50 per cent for most bilateral trade flows of the new EU member states.
   Further decomposition of the new goods margin shows that the goods
   already traded though in small volumes at the beginning of the period
   play a leading role.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a distinct critical turn in transitional justice
   scholarship has emerged, seeking to question the naturalness and
   inevitability of mainstream transitional justice theory and practice and
   to envision a broader and more holistic project. While in many ways a
   positive development, this newfound critical enthusiasm risks producing
   an unwarranted sense of pessimism and failure. This points to the need
   to better manage expectations as to what `success' looks like even as we
   try to reimagine what transitional justice could become. To these ends,
   I draw upon and propose revisions to Robert Cox's famous distinction
   between problem-solving and critical theory. To better maintain balance
   and perspective, I argue for the adoption of an `integrated' approach to
   transitional justice critique that does more to engage with the
   difficult tradeoffs, policy choices and contextual realities that would
   inevitably be associated with efforts to implement an alternative vision
   of transitional justice.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Recent debates about the 1\% vs. 99\%, CEO compensation, minimum wage,
   and income inequality suggest an increasingly unfavorable division of
   economic gains for labor. Indeed, how capital and labor divide the gains
   from production is central to the study of political economy,
   particularly the impact of globalization and unionization. Yet, the
   prominent measures featured in the research to date, most notably labor
   compensation over GDP, are inadequate for studying the split of gains
   between labor and capital. We argue that the division of gains between
   labor and capital is more accurately and precisely conceptualized and
   measured by the ratio of labor compensation over operating corporate
   profits in the private sector. Using newly collected private-sector data
   from 17 industrial democracies over 30 years from 1981 to 2012, our
   analysis uncovers important patterns. First, labor compensation and
   corporate profits both rose in absolute terms over the last three
   decades, but the compensation-profit ratio experienced a sharp decline,
   meaning that the improvement was smaller for labor than capital. Second,
   rising economic openness and declining union density contributed to the
   fall of the compensation-profit ratio. Finally, there was a clear
   cross-national convergence toward declining compensation-profit ratio,
   rising openness, and shrinking labor unions. We conjecture that these
   results point to the movement of advanced industrial democracies toward
   a new capitalism equilibrium.},

Abstract = {The paper makes three contributions to the understanding of the
   post-crisis European banking governance. First, it offers a more
   comprehensive approach to banking governance, beyond the Banking Union,
   through its concept of ?New European Banking Governance? (NEBG) that
   incorporates EU state aid rules and fiscal regulations. Second, it
   considers the impact of NEBG on democratic institutions and processes in
   EU member states, an under-researched topic in the literature on
   European banking governance. Finally, through its in-depth case study of
   Slovenia it considers the NEBG in relation to peripheral Eurozone
   states. It argues that the post-crisis banking governance framework of
   the EU not only severely constrained the Slovenian state in its policy
   choices but rearranged its policy-making institutions in a way that
   restricted and continues to restrict democratic banking policy
   formation.},

Abstract = {This essay critically examines the discourse of participation in
   development finance directed at the poor in the Global South from
   national and international development agencies. This discourse, often
   termed financial inclusion, posits the ability of development actors to
   reach the poor involving them in important economic decisions affecting
   their lives, provides access to products that improve their material
   conditions, and ensures their credit worthiness through highly nuanced
   information technology and social media tools. The paper presents
   evidence from two ethnographically inspired studies undertaken by the
   author in India and Kenya to ascertain the ways in which the
   participatory discourse in finance is understood among societal
   participants themselves. The paper presents relevant epistemes for
   analyzing what `grassroots' actors understand as their participation in
   development-oriented financial inclusion projects. The study forwards
   two major conclusions: (1) `habits of authority' among various
   development actors thwart effective participation; (2) technology
   platforms that allow for successive innovations and interconnections
   from businesses and other organizations encourage financial inclusion.},

Abstract = {This article critiques recent operationalisations of social justice
   theories in empirical research in comparative political economy from an
   epistemological entry point. It offers an alternative epistemic
   framework based on Habermas's system and lifeworld distinction to
   reconcile normative theory with empirical research before developing a
   critical theory of social justice based on two principles: Nancy
   Fraser's parity of participation and Hauke Brunkhorst's notion that
   functional differentiation in systems cannot generate asymmetric moral
   standards. These principles are then operationalised for regimes of
   welfare capitalism before exploring the contemporary German labour
   market in these terms, drawing on original qualitative research. It
   demonstrates that parity of participation cannot be achieved when the
   moral duty to participate is asymmetrically applied. It concludes
   capitalism is inherently unjust in any variety due to the inequality of
   wealth and free movement of capital reinforcing the inequality of moral
   expectations characterising the lived experience of welfare-mediated
   labour markets. Therefore, accepting this inherent injustice and whether
   institutions of the welfare state exacerbate or mitigate it should be
   the central focus of future research on social justice in comparative
   political economy.},

Abstract = {When do firms oppose international climate policy? Existing work often
   assumes that firms disapprove of climate regulation due to the immediate
   costs of compliance. We claim that if policy is implemented gradually,
   private preferences for climate policy vary as a function of its
   progressive stringency. That is, supportive views may rise in the
   initial phase of the policy, while opposing views may emerge as the
   policy becomes more stringent. We also argue that emissions of
   individual companies, as well as emissions levels in their respective
   sectors, influence corporate positions on these two dimensions. We test
   our argument with new corporate survey data on the European Union
   Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We find that firms' views on the
   performance of the EU ETS vary based on whether they concentrate on the
   policy's current state or its future, more stringent development.
   Moreover, we find that individual firm and sectoral emissions correlate
   with support for the early-stage, more lenient version of the ETS, but
   that high-emission firms are more interested in disinvesting and
   relocating if the ETS becomes stricter. Our findings imply that both
   firm and sectoral organization can constrain environmental regulation,
   and that domestic compensation, especially at early stages, can have
   important effects on the continuity of climate policy.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how far the workplace inspection program established
   under the 2013 Accord on Fire and Building Safety has served to improve
   safety in Bangladesh garment factories, and the extent to which its
   operation has been influenced by factors that the literature suggests
   are important in shaping the outcomes of private regulatory initiatives.
   The findings suggest that such regulation can generate positive
   outcomes, even in the absence of strong public regulatory support. They
   also caution against discounting the role of compliance-based
   enforcement strategies, while highlighting the importance of their
   adequate resourcing and transparency. Some support is also offered for
   the argument that such regulatory initiatives could directly influence
   the market dynamics that shape supplier working conditions.},

Title = {Why national parliamentarians join international organizations},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-430},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is customary to argue that international organizations (IOs) are very
   much dominated by national executives, with national parliaments
   wielding no or at best marginal influence. According to this accepted
   wisdom, there cannot be many reasons for national parliaments and their
   members to be active within IOs. However, we can observe a movement
   towards the parliamentarization of IOs, materialized in a growing number
   of parliamentary bodies with increasing competencies that accompany
   governmental actions and decisions. My paper wants to shed light on the
   underlying incentive for members of national parliaments (MPs) to engage
   in these international parliamentary assemblies (IPAs). Proceeding from
   the assumption that IPAs can enable parliamentarians to fulfil their
   representation and control function, I argue that (1) district level
   factors related to internationalization can explain why some MPs become
   members of IPAs, and (2) opposition parties can use the information
   generated in IPAs to control governmental activities in International
   Organizations. I test the claims with data of all parliamentarians of
   the recent legislative period of the German Bundestag and personal
   interviews with 10 IPA members. The results suggest that especially
   district incentives are positive predictors for membership in the
   different assemblies, whereas variance in membership can hardly be
   explained by party-level factors.},

Abstract = {Public policies are products of politics, but they also feed back into
   the political system by shaping the actions and attitudes of members of
   the polity. To date, scholarly examinations of feedback processes have
   been mostly concerned with understanding the relationship between public
   policy and democracy; relatively little attention has been paid to
   connecting policy feedback to the practical questions that animate
   politics. This article examines policy feedback as it applies to efforts
   aimed at achieving universal health coverage in the United States-a
   widely held policy goal shared by a majority of American voters across
   partisan lines. I argue that in the contemporary political context,
   Medicaid-a pillar of the American healthcare system and the primary
   mechanism for insuring low-income and disabled citizens-can produce
   negative feedbacks that demobilize political action, destabilize
   advocacy groups, and deter coalition building. Together, these feedbacks
   undermine future possibilities for universal healthcare. After detailing
   these democratic dilemmas, I outline strategies for proactively
   addressing them.},

Abstract = {Against current developments in the sociology of IR, from new systemic
   theorizations of world society to Bourdieusian approaches to the
   practices of IR scholars, this article claims that relevant problems
   remain regarding how IR theorizes its social location and reconciles the
   social character of the world it observes with the social character of
   its observations. To reformulate these problems, the article draws from
   an underused paradigm of social system theorizing, sociocybernetics,
   offering a radical constructivist treatment of the problem of
   observation and reflexivity. Elaborating the notion of second-order
   cybernetics and Niklas Luhmann's take on the reproduction of observing
   social systems, the article argues that IR can be conceived as an
   observing social system that adapts by altering and subdividing the
   semantic boundaries of its systemic communications, that is, IR
   theories. This socio-heuristic process structures both the first-order
   observations IR makes about the world, as well as second-order
   observations of itself. In this manner, the article argues that
   sociocybernetics-informed sociology of IR communications can contribute
   to a more nuanced understanding of IR as a social system that observes
   society from society.},

Abstract = {According to United Nations data, one in three women worldwide are
   subject to violence. Yet, the systemic embedding of male sexual violence
   often fails to be part of public discussion. To explore this relative
   silencing of mediated discussion is to consider how media normalise male
   violence towards women. This structural obfuscation serves to reinforce
   the gendered violence upon which these structures are located. This is
   the context in which hegemonic masculinity now takes a reified
   neoliberal form, which serves to normalise the violence of gendered
   power relations. Illustrating this, we explore the way in which
   austerity has been positioned as a policy of violence. We argue that by
   exposing how neoliberal hegemonic masculinity is central to the
   construction of gender, and exploring how this is disseminated, we are
   able to show how male violence towards women is legitimated in mediated
   political discourse.},

   assess efforts by the United States and South Vietnam to penetrate the
   Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. I offer the first extended account of
   the United States' most successful intelligence penetration of the
   conflict. After initial recruitment by South Vietnam, a mid-level Viet
   Cong cadre spied for the CIA from 1969 until the end of the war. U.S.
   experience in this episode and others in Vietnam points up a challenge.
   Local allies offer expertise in identifying potential informants. But
   prospective spies view U.S. intelligence as more trustworthy and
   legitimate than local agencies with dubious operational security.},

Title = {Toward ``hardened{''} accountability? Analyzing the European Union's
   hybrid transnational governance in timber and biofuel supply chains},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-132},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The voluntary/mandatory divide is a constant feature of scholarly
   debates on corporate accountability for sustainability in global supply
   chains. A widely held assumption is that the addition of state authority
   to private transnational governance in global supply chains will
   ``harden{''} accountability and, thus, promote more sustainable
   production. The state's ability to set legally binding requirements is
   expected to coerce companies into complying. The hybridization of
   private and state authority is seen to strengthen good practice in
   private authority. This empirical study questions these assumptions
   based on an analysis of two hybrid governance arrangements for
   sustainability in global supply chains: the EU's Timber Regulation
   (EUTR) and Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The results demonstrate
   that both EUTR and EU-RED yield sector wide efforts of compliance and to
   this extent can be seen as enhancing accountability in the sense of
   answerability. At the same time, we find that the policies in both cases
   are not more demanding, nor enforced strictly, the latter putting into
   question their potential to coerce companies. Further, a ``hardening{''}
   of accountability is at least obscured as both EUTR and EU-RED have
   stripped private authority they employ in their hybrid transnational
   governance from the need to establish legitimacy with a broader
   audience. This makes legal compliance and cost-effectiveness the core
   factor for companies' efforts to demonstrate compliance. Our findings
   hence question whether the EUTR and EU-RED have led to ``hardened{''}
   accountability compared to private transnational governance, and ask for
   an empirical, more nuanced understanding of what there is to gain or
   lose from hybridizing private and state authority in transnational
   governance.},

Abstract = {The article offers a critique of the prevailing understanding of the
   relationship between neoliberalism and classic nineteenth-century
   liberalism in contemporary international political economy (IPE) and
   offers a redefinition inspired by Polanyi and Gramsci. Within critical
   IPE studies, a consensus has emerged that neoliberalism cannot be
   reduced to a simple attempt to roll back the economy and let loose
   free-market forces. However, this insight relies on contrasting
   neoliberalism with a classic liberalism, that is, a simple attempt to
   implement just this naive laissez-faire ideology. In contrast, this
   article argues that nineteenth-century liberalism is also characterised
   by an active use of state and legislative power. Through a historical
   study of two cases from nineteenth-century Britain, Poor Law reform and
   the Gold Standard, the paper will argue that state action played a
   central role even during the heyday of laissez-faire liberalism. With a
   starting point in Polanyi's dictum that `laissez-faire was planned',
   this reinvestigation will point towards a need to develop a more nuanced
   understanding of the distinctions between economic theory, ideology, and
   practical policy, as well as pointing towards a general reinterpretation
   of the role of the state in liberal economic ideology.},

Abstract = {To help curtail future sovereign exposures to banking losses, the
   European Union (EU) introduced the Bank Resolution and Recovery
   Directive, which mandates bail-in of creditors in the event of
   significant bank losses. In this article, we examine the impact of
   resolution on subsidiary banks, notable in terms of their substantial
   role throughout the EU. Significant differences in risk and funding
   characteristics are apparent between domestic and cross-border European
   bank subsidiaries. Subsidiary banks are found to possess a larger
   proportion of loss absorbing capacity than underlying parent banks.
   Results indicate the suitability of single point of entry resolution in
   the case of domestic subsidiaries and multiple points of entry
   resolution for cross-border subsidiaries. Our findings highlight a
   worrying decline in loss absorbing capacity in European banks more
   generally since 2006, pointing to a necessary future focus on broad
   capital thresholds to ensure the success of the resolution model.},

Abstract = {This article examines how Kosovo's postwar struggle for statehood
   intersected with interethnic reconciliation processes from 1999 to 2008.
   It argues that, among other factors, it was the ensuing governance in
   postwar Kosovo that made it difficult, if not impossible, for any kind
   of meaningful interethnic reconciliation to take place. Drawing on
   primary sources and personal interviews, the article focuses on groups
   that can be called `reconciliation agents' and that were among the main
   actors dealing with the legacy of the Kosovo war. They were typically
   multiethnic actors, both in terms of their staff members and their
   declared agendas, and they were exceptionally creative and courageous in
   their efforts to promote interethnic reconciliation. They were, however,
   not seen as postconflict forces by much of the population and were often
   perceived as agents continuing the conflict over the status of Kosovo by
   other means. The same was true for their international donors and other
   relevant international governmental actors that were supporting
   interethnic reconciliation activities.},

Abstract = {Economic arguments seem to be the most promising avenue for driving
   reform of America's bloated penal state in the aftermath of mass
   incarceration. Raising human rights concerns has limited appeal beyond
   cultural elites and, on occasion, courts, but today reform is coming
   from elected branches. Talk of human rights for criminals, or human
   dignity for prisoners, can risk backlash as happened around the death
   penalty in the 1970s. This essay challenges this conventional account in
   three ways. First, I argue that historical conditions make the potential
   for backlash limited. Second, that economic arguments will always be
   limited by the political and institutional frameworks that define the
   current meanings of criminal justice; only a human rights approach can
   drive a truly abolitionist reform agenda, one aimed at rethinking the
   institutions themselves, not just their budgets. Third, human rights
   campaigns can, if properly conceived, expand the constituency for deep
   criminal justice reform.},

Abstract = {Does the ever-increasing stock of cross-border asset holdings pose a
   threat to macro-economic stability and to US geo-economic power? Recent
   analyses suggest that exchange rate changes might drive massive changes
   in net asset positions that in turn create equally large wealth effects.
   These wealth effects might compromise US macro-economic policy. In
   contrast, this manuscript argues that these fears are misplaced. Income
   flows are the dog that wags the asset tail. Those income flows in turn
   derive from differences in national growth rates and in the ability of
   firms to capture profit from global value chains. Expectations around
   these flows validate asset values. Attention should therefore focus on
   the source of flows and control over flows, particularly profits, rather
   than on asset stocks, which are a dependent variable. Although wealth
   effects driven by exchange rate changes are large, other routine changes
   in flows and expectations have similar or larger effects on the stock of
   wealth.},

Abstract = {Intended beneficiaries have an undeniable relevance to regulation.
   However, current research has focused mainly on the two-party
   relationship between rulemaking and rule-taking. We attempt to fill this
   gap by exploring the formal and informal roles that beneficiaries'
   intermediaries played in co-creating European Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) rules and associated practices between 2000 and
   2017. By linking recent conceptualizations of regulatory intermediaries
   with the literature on critical political CSR, we offer a more dynamic
   and contextualized understanding of the roles of beneficiaries'
   intermediaries. Specifically, we identify six micro-dynamics through
   which they influenced the regulatory process. Notably, our findings
   highlight how the convergence of interests between three groups of
   beneficiaries' intermediaries - the Non-governmental
   organization-Investor-Union nexus - had a key role in reshaping CSR
   rules. We conclude that, in the European context, stronger and
   better-coordinated beneficiaries' intermediaries are crucial in order to
   achieve more effective corporate conduct regulation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the potential of collage epistemology to cultivate
   queer intellectual curiosity about international relations. It argues
   that collaging and queering share many points of departure: in both,
   objects are taken from their conventional contexts and assembled into
   new relational constellations. The article draws from pedagogical work
   where collages were used in university teaching on the politics of
   gender and sexuality. A set of collages made by students are interpreted
   and brought into a dialogue with queer theorizing. The article suggests
   that collaging involves smashing a variety of containers that social
   sciences inquiry often operates with. It troubles not only established
   conceptions of sexuality and intimacy but also territoriality and
   theorizing. On this basis, the article concludes that collaging offers a
   fruitful modality of thought, analysis and expression for queer
   world-making projects.},

Abstract = {Studies of women's participation in civil conflict as armed combatants
   have attributed diverse motivations to such participation and examined
   the implications of participation for women's empowerment in the
   aftermath. The authors contribute to these studies through an in-depth
   analysis of female combatants' struggles for equality and empowerment
   during and after Nepal's decade-long Maoist conflict. Scholars have
   argued that the emphasis of Maoist ideology in Nepal on the emancipation
   of women and on ending gender discrimination attracted a large number of
   women to the cause. Based on narratives of Maoist female ex-combatants,
   the authors investigate women's engagement with Maoist ideology during
   and after the conflict. These narratives reveal that despite discourses
   of gender equality in Nepal's Maoist struggle, promises around gender
   equality remain unkept in the period after the war. A reintegration
   program has offered women ex-combatants few options and has pushed women
   back into traditional gender roles. Struggles continue in this terrain.
   Incorporating intersectionality, the paper highlights how women
   ex-combatants' gender identities intersect with caste and other social
   locations to produce diverse challenges for their lives.},

Abstract = {This article provides a brief history of K-12 education testing in the
   United States from colonial America to the present. In early America,
   students were examined orally. After the mid-nineteenth century, written
   tests replaced oral presentations. In the late nineteenth century,
   graded schools gradually replaced the single-teacher, one-room schools.
   In the beginning of the twentieth century, standardized intelligence
   tests were increasingly used to categorize and promote students. State
   departments of education have played a larger role in local school
   funding and policies in the past hundred years. Since the 1960s, the
   federal government has expanded its involvement in national education
   while also promoting the role of states. During the past three decades,
   the federal government and states increased the use of high-stakes
   national testing with initiatives such as America 2000, Goals 2000, No
   Child Left Behind, and Every Student Succeeds.},

Abstract = {Based on newly declassified documents from former Yugoslav archives,
   this article reconstructs the process of material and political
   assistance that was rendered to the People's Movement for the Liberation
   of Angola (MPLA) by Yugoslavia throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s
   until the time of Angola's independence and the beginning of the Angolan
   civil war in 1975. The archival evidence demonstrates that Yugoslavia's
   assistance to the MPLA guerrillas was one of the crucial factors that
   enabled the organization not only to survive the vicissitudes of
   international politics, but also to preserve and stabilize its strength
   for the final phase of the power struggle in Angola.},

Title = {Discrimination and Policies of Immigrant Selection in Liberal States},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-116},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {How should liberal societies select prospective members? A conventional
   reading of immigration history posits that whereas ascriptive
   characteristics drove immigration policy in the past, contemporary
   policy is based on the principle of nondiscrimination. Yet a closer look
   at the characteristics of those admitted reveals systematic group biases
   that run counter to liberalism's core moral commitments. This article
   first discusses liberal states' basic moral obligation to treat their
   citizens with equal respect. It then identifies ways in which the group
   biases produced by immigration policy violate that principle, when
   states either deprive their citizens of fundamental rights or stigmatize
   them through hierarchical constructions of citizenship. Three mechanisms
   are presented-structural bias, profiling, and positive selection-by
   which seemingly liberal admissions policies produce illiberal outcomes.
   The empirical analysis explores the resulting discriminatory group
   biases in the context of language and income conditionalities on family
   migration, excessive demand restrictions against economic migrants, and
   visa waivers for international travelers. We conclude that immigration
   reforms that mitigate, if not erase, these morally problematic patterns
   are within the reach of liberal states.},

Abstract = {After the Greek veto on Macedonia's NATO accession in 2008, the
   Macedonian government launched comprehensive policies to reconstruct the
   Macedonian ethno-national narrative as stretching back to ancient
   Macedonia. The `Skopje 2014' project, which was a large-scale
   reconstruction of the capital city in neoclassical and baroque styles,
   as well as new educational and mass media campaigns claiming the
   continuous existence of the Macedonian nation since antiquity, were the
   cornerstones of the Gruevski government's project. The so-called
   `antiquisation' programme was both a domestic and international
   assertion of Macedonia's name, identity and history amid Greek
   challenges and attempts to undermine Macedonia's legitimacy in the eyes
   of the international community. The Skopje 2014 project increased
   tensions between ethnic Macedonians and Albanians in Macedonia, and also
   deepened divisions among Macedonians.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Documentation of human rights violations is a difficult and dangerous
   practice. The capacity of human rights organizations does not match the
   extent of the problems they encounter and the depth of the issues they
   illuminate. Documentation of human rights violations frames
   claim-making, manifestations of victimhood and citizenship. By examining
   documentation practices in Bangladesh, I show how information travels
   through a line of filters that determines and delimits what we can know
   about violations, what we can do to assist victims, and how we can
   prevent future abuses. I argue that this filtering process is a
   selective political practice one which is conditioned by the individual
   capacities, organizational resources, and political contexts through
   which exposures to violence become human rights cases. It is this the
   `how' of documentation that delimits what is made public and what is
   known about violations.},

Abstract = {The current attack on the administrative state and its more inclusive
   policies is accompanied by a push to limit judicial deference to
   administrative rulemaking. This recent trend stands in tension with the
   \#MeToo movement and a shift in constitutional culture regarding sexual
   misconduct that has been developing over several decades. While the
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has continued to expand what
   counts as discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII of the 1964
   Civil Rights Act (recently adding sexual orientation to that list), and
   the Supreme Court has recognized some of these expansions, \#MeToo
   invites rethinking what Title VII has and has not accomplished for
   women, why, likely prospects for addressing sexual misconduct, and the
   limits of law.},

Title = {R2P and Refugee Protection: Framing the Responsibility to Protect Prima
   Facie Refugees Fleeing Mass Atrocity Crimes},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been increasing recognition that the Responsibility
   to Protect principle (R2P) and refugee protection are inextricably
   linked and conceptually connected. The question remains, however,
   whether the link between the two protection frameworks can provide a
   basis for the protection of prima facie refugees fleeing mass atrocity
   crimes. This article identifies that prima facie refugees have the right
   to protection irrespective of where they arrive. It finds that the prima
   facie provision is one that exists under international refugee law and
   is highly relevant to the R2P principle. R2P facilitates a framework of
   prima facie protection, but it must include the political and legal
   norms of R2P and international refugee law. The article argues that
   -expanding the idea of R2P and refugee protection as an interlinked
   agenda offers a protection-oriented framework to address the protection
   needs of prima facie refugees fleeing mass atrocity crimes.},

   photographic intelligence during the Second World War},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {78-94},
Abstract = {This study examines Anglo-American narratives of British and German
   photographic intelligence (PI) in Europe during the Second World War.
   According to these narratives, Germany relegated PI to tactical and
   operational applications; by contrast, Britain performed these same
   functions but also made strategic use of the discipline. This paper
   reevaluates how British and German PI actually differed. It further
   examines whether each side's successes and failures were within the
   `agency of agencies' - how much did PI successes and failures directly
   result from intelligence organizations' choices and actions ? Finally,
   this paper identifies implications of these narratives for comparative
   intelligence studies and historiography.},

   there are manifold potential consequences of Brexit in these areas, with

Abstract = {What instruments and mechanisms are available to harness the `political
   will' to pursue justice for the allegations of `atrocity crime' in
   Rakhine, Myanmar? Analysing country's ratification trend, declarations
   upon ratification on relevant global instruments, and interactions with
   the un on human rights issues, this paper reveals the `mind' of Myanmar
   and its obligations. Exploring the mechanism of four International Crime
   Tribunals (icts), it outlines the pathways to pursue justice. Revealing
   the inadequacies of current actions by key state actors resulting in
   invidious outcomes that privilege impunity for atrocity crimes, the
   paper suggests ways to harness the political will to pursue justice.
   This paper contends that the establishment of an ict for the trial of
   atrocity crimes in Rakhine (ictm-R) would be best facilitated by: a
   consensus mandate to prosecute individuals and not the state; precisely
   defined jurisdiction; and provisions to integrate the host nation's
   apparatus, buttressed by the advocacy of the right groups and media.},

Abstract = {Engaging critically with the concept of `political society', this
   chapter examines the issue of land grabbing in Punjab, and focusses in
   particular upon the systematic small-scale encroachment on village
   communal land in a rural Punjab district. It shows how politicians often
   help farmers to continue occupying village common lands illegally, doing
   so for electoral gains not necessarily consistent with the logic of `the
   market' or of capital. In these cases, politicians seem to be driven by
   political motives related to electoral calculations rather than solely
   by financial ones. However, the chapter illustrates how these
   clientelistic bargains ultimately serve politicians and local elites
   more than they do those facing the prospect of dispossession.},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {This article develops an analysis of the concept of disciplinary
   neo-liberal feminism through a focus on gendered poverty alleviation
   strategies and illustrates the value of this through a discussion of
   microfinance. By locating this study within an analysis of the expansion
   of global capital accumulation, the article argues that the liberal
   frameworks of female empowerment and entrepreneurialism that are central
   to these programs and to feminism in this form, mask their underlying
   political, social and economic objectives. In contrast, a Marxist
   Feminist approach more adequately explains the interplay of class and
   gender that underpins poverty alleviation strategies. This article
   argues that in the context of financial crisis and reduced social
   provision, women living in poverty in the Global South were identified
   as targets for the expansion of global finance. Their integration into
   global financial networks via microfinance and other pro-poor strategies
   has facilitated the expansion of markets for credit while at the same
   time disciplining market participation through the twin forces of risk
   and incentive. Disciplinary neo-liberal feminism has underpinned this
   incorporation of women into global capital accumulation creating
   profound effects for households and families, with microfinance programs
   representing important sites of contestation for the politics of class
   and gender.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, forms of `small-scale' land grabbing in urban West
   Bengal shed light on the workings and methods of local `land mafias' and
   their entanglement with state officers, the police, judges and
   politicians. The chapter uses the concept of `blurred boundaries' to
   explore local manifestations of intreccio, particularly mastan raj (rule
   by thugs/enforcers). In the process, the field research reveals how the
   reach of the state as the provider of justice is limited by at least two
   factors: first, by an inefficient court system, and second, by corrupt
   state functionaries and politicians. Ultimately, the chapter shows that
   the justice system is deeply bound into a nexus of party politics, crime
   and business, a nexus that is essential to the working of the criminal
   economy.},

Abstract = {Under the Justice and Development Party AKP and Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
   Turkey has become one of the most polarized countries in the world, and
   has undergone a significant democratic breakdown. This article explains
   how polarization and democratic breakdown happened, arguing that it was
   based on the built-in, perverse dynamics of an ``authoritarian spiral of
   polarizing-cum-transformative politics.{''} Furthermore, I identify ten
   causal mechanisms that have produced pernicious polarization and
   democratic erosion. Turkey's transformation since 2002 is an example of
   the broader phenomenon of democratic erosion under new elites and
   dominant groups. The causes and consequences of pernicious polarization
   are analyzed in terms of four subperiods: 2002-2006, 2007, 2008-2013,
   and 2014-present. In the end, what began as a potentially reformist
   politics of polarization-cum-transformation morphed into an
   autocratic-revolutionary one. During this process, polarization and AKP
   policies; the politicization of formative rifts that had been a divisive
   undercurrent since nation-state formation; structural transformations;
   and the opposition's organizational, programmatic, and personal
   shortcomings fed and reinforced each other.},

Abstract = {In light of the renewed popularity of Hegemonic Stability Theory (HST)
   in the context of governance debates in the aftermath of the 2007-2008
   crisis, this paper revisits, from a conceptual angle, the shaky basis
   upon which the theory draws a causal link between hegemony and
   stability. The paper is a critique of HST as a theory of hegemony that
   contains an underdeveloped concept of hegemony only defined ex post,
   highlighting that it is precisely this hollow conceptualization that has
   allowed for the perceived compatibility between US power and stability
   at a point in time (the Bretton Woods years) to be erroneously
   generalized into a causal relationship. The paper also shows, via the
   example of Germany in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
   how inattention to the conceptual content of HST has permitted the
   heedless extension of a problematic understanding of hegemony through
   stability to cases of regional hegemony.},

Abstract = {Most current work on privacy understands it according to an economic
   model: individuals trade personal information for access to desired
   services and websites. This sounds good in theory. In practice, it has
   meant that online access to almost anything requires handing over vast
   amounts of personal information to the service provider with little
   control over what happens to it next. The two books considered in this
   essay both work against that economic model. In Privacy as Trust, Ari
   Ezra Waldman argues for a new model of privacy that starts not with
   putatively autonomous individuals but with an awareness that managing
   information flows is part of how people create and navigate social
   boundaries with one another. Jennifer Rothman's Right of Publicity
   confronts the explosive growth of publicity rights-the rights of
   individuals to control and profit from commercial use of their name and
   public image-and, in so doing, she exposes the poverty of treating
   information disclosure merely as a matter of economic calculation. Both
   books emphasize practical and doctrinal solutions to the problems they
   identify. In this essay, I take a step back and draw out the extent to
   which they converge on a fundamentally important point: the blunt
   application of market logic with its tools of property and contracts
   fails to protect the interests that lead us to turn to privacy in the
   first place; the tendency to economize privacy is a significant part of
   why we inadequately protect it.},

Title = {Producing Airpower: The Rise and Fall of Neo-Liberalism's Defence Agenda},

Abstract = {Few policy issues are more challenging than complex weaponry's
   procurement and employment. Technology drives weapon costs upwards
   faster than economies are growing and militaries struggle to maintain
   increasingly sophisticated arms. Certain governments have adopted a
   reform agenda rooted in neo-liberal economic theory to address these
   challenges. Two broad policies - enhancing inter-firm competition for
   contracts and outsourcing activities to the private sector - emerged as
   central to this reform agenda. Although rarely presented as such, these
   reforms present a significant intellectual challenge to the hitherto
   predominant statist model for military power's provision. Surprisingly,
   in light of neo-liberal policies' adoption by militarily active states,
   no study has systematically examined these reforms' content and impact.
   My article fills this lacuna by examining the state - the United Kingdom
   - that most consistently enacted neo-liberal defence reforms. To preview
   the conclusion, neo-liberal reforms initially generated small initial
   efficiencies, but then produced significant adverse consequences when
   pursued beyond a certain minimal level. Britain's competition policy,
   for example, ultimately incentivized firms to consolidate into
   monopolies, which narrowed the scope for future competition and
   prevented the state from upholding fixed price contracts. Outsourcing,
   likewise, proved detrimental once policymakers sought to extend its
   scope beyond a limited range of simple services.},

Abstract = {The European Commission's 2017 White Paper on the Future of Europe sets
   out several scenarios related to differentiated (dis)integration. But
   although our understanding of the causes of differentiated
   (dis)integration has substantively improved over recent years, our
   knowledge about its consequences still remains limited. This shortcoming
   may lead to difficulties when it comes to formulating policy
   recommendations. Accordingly, we propose closer attention to the
   effects-of-causes of differentiated (dis)integration, linked to a more
   careful implementation of insights on causal inference. After briefly
   reviewing the foci and methods of existing literature on differentiated
   (dis)integration, we introduce a potential outcome model of causal
   inference. We provide an illustrative application of the synthetic
   control method, as one method related to this framework. Our analysis
   shows that the UK has economically benefitted from not joining the
   eurozone, but our argument more generally is about the practical
   implications of methodological choices in the study of differentiated
   (dis)integration.},

Abstract = {The UK government proudly affirms that the country has some of the
   strongest equalities legislation in the world, including the Equality
   Act 2010. For it to be true, however, the government should implement
   the legislation in its entirety, including the socio-economic duty
   (section 1 of the Act). That duty would require public authorities to
   actively consider how their decisions and policies of the highest
   strategic importance can increase or decrease inequalities of outcome.
   Regrettably, successive governments have failed to commence the duty,
   and therefore it is not technically binding on public authorities. It is
   encouraging that the duty was brought to life in Scotland in 2018 and
   the Welsh Government has announced they will follow suit in 2020. The
   socio-economic duty is potentially a useful lever to understand and
   address the structural causes of material inequalities and their
   negative effects on human rights and well-being. This article presents
   and draws conclusions from the strategic choices made by the people
   running \#1forEquality, the national campaign to bring the
   socio-economic duty to life. The article introduces four key factors
   that contributed to making progress between 2017 and 2019, despite the
   limited resources available: a) the added value of merging advocacy and
   epistemic communities working on equality and on human rights; b) the
   engagement with political actors at key stages of the process; c) the
   combination of `naming and shaming' and best practice; and d) the
   celebration of smaller victories along the way.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Canada's trade policy developments after NAFTA
   have been influenced by the stalemate in multilateral liberalization and
   the discriminative nature of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) that
   have proliferated during the last 25 years. First, the impasse in the
   Doha Round of negotiations made Canada consider regional and bilateral
   options of opening up new markets as an alternative to multilateral
   liberalization. Second, the discriminative nature of PTAs accelerated
   the process of Canada's regional and bilateral liberalization, as PTAs
   have diverted trade away from Canada, prompting it to pursue its own
   preferential trade initiatives to level the playing field for Canadian
   businesses.},

Abstract = {In contrast to dependent market economy (DME) literature, which argues
   that Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies serve primarily as
   assembly platforms for multinational corporations (MNCs) and try to meet
   their demands, this paper argues that CEE states have done much more
   than merely accommodating the interests of foreign investors. An
   analysis of the automotive sector in Poland reveals that the Polish
   state engaged actively in industrial policy to shape the profile of
   automotive production and to improve the country's position in the
   automotive value chain. Instead of waiting for MNCs to establish
   backward linkages, it nurtured the rise of a supply industry with
   forward linkages in the automotive value chain, thus decreasing Poland's
   dependence on lead MNCs. Moreover, this paper finds that while EU
   integration limited policy space for development, it also offered new
   developmental opportunities, which Polish state actors used to improve
   the international competitiveness of the sector.},

Abstract = {The subject of this analysis is a situation observed in Poland and, in
   recent years, other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in which
   the leadership of the executive is located outside a constitutionally
   defined government. A representative situation in which a prime minister
   is controlled by a party leader without a formal government position is
   defined as a ?surrogate government?. Five Polish cabinets in the period
   1991?2019 met the preliminary criteria of ?surrogate government?; of
   these, the cabinets of Beata Szyd?o and Mateusz Morawiecki come closest
   to fulfilling the criteria completely.},

Abstract = {The EU has deeply transformed the economic and political environment of
   business and thus the representation of economic interests has become
   Europeanized. But what is the effect of this Europeanization at the EU
   level? We focused on the interplay of change at the domestic and
   European level and asked how the specific ways in which national
   organizations seek to have a European presence generate variations in
   the European system. We present an analytical model and provide
   empirical evidence to demonstrate that Europeanization is not
   concomitant with supranationalism. Thus, our research findings fit
   neatly into the debate on integration without supranationalism. The data
   analysis highlights the importance of national economic resources, the
   length of EU membership and the associations' scope. In the conclusion,
   we give reasons why a Europeanized system of business interest
   representation is not inherently set to become supranational.},

Abstract = {How do transnational integration regimes (TIRs) shape domestic
   developmental capacities to benefit from trade integration? Some
   scholars acknowledge the passive influence TIRs can have on domestic
   capacities to spur development. Others conceive of TIRs as active agents
   of change but disagree as to whether their effects are positive or
   negative. This paper takes issue with some of these approaches and
   reveals important caveats of others by investigating how the shallow
   mode of transnational market integration shapes domestic developmental
   capacities. The paper uses the developmental pathway of Ukraine's
   automotive industry as a case study. Strikingly, the sector maintained
   its peripheral position despite initial developmental features that made
   it as good an investment destination for multinationals as automotive
   sectors in other peripheral economies that eventually became more
   integrated in transnational value chains. I argue that it needs strong
   states being able to use the opportunities offered by the shallow mode
   of integration for development. By contrast, weak states can hardly
   shield themselves against capture by rent-seeking networks, since TIRs
   only provide limited assistance for building developmental capacities in
   the context of shallow integration.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the thesis of GVC-oriented industrial
   policy and the view that traditional industrial policy is no longer
   relevant. This is done from the perspective of Africa. Placing Africa at
   the core of GVC-oriented industrial policy reveals several problems.
   Using the example of industrial policy in Nigeria's cement sector, the
   article will argue for the relevance of traditional industrial policy,
   whereby a country seeks to build a complete production chain within its
   borders. The case study fleshes out the argument that traditional
   industrial policy is still relevant - both in itself and as a
   pre-condition for GVC-oriented industrial policy in Africa.},

Abstract = {Regions of the United States have seen their incomes diverge
   dramatically over the last four decades. This article makes the
   empirical and political case for treating regional economic disparities
   as a national phenomenon best resolved through federal policy, rather
   than exclusively as a matter of local responsibility. It then considers
   reinvigorated antitrust enforcement as an example of a federal policy
   that would strengthen local economies while benefiting from policy
   feedback effects.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {This article attempts to discover why states have chosen to co-ordinate
   within ad hoc informal international organizations instead or on top of
   formal ones, in order to resolve the Iranian nuclear crisis in the
   period 2003-15. Three informal groups of states - the E3 (France,
   Germany and the UK), the EU-3 (the E3 + the EU High Representative), and
   the EU-3 + 3 (the EU-3 + the US, Russia, and China) - are widely seen as
   having contributed to the diplomatic solution. Empirically, one can
   wonder why formal international organizations like the UN, the IAEA and
   the EU were not able to do the wheeling and dealing by themselves in the
   case of the Iranian nuclear conflict. From a theoretical perspective,
   this article highlights the role of informal international
   organizations, a subject that is under-researched both in EU and
   International Relations studies. It will argue that these temporary
   informal international organizations have three advantages: no (or less)
   bureaucracy, speed, and the ability to buy time for more important
   diplomatic actors like major states or formal international
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarly works on memory practices in Europe often appeal to the
   notion of the East-West memory divide or, more dramatically, to the
   European memory wars which have been allegedly raging at least since the
   Eastern enlargement of 2004. These terms are supposed to stand for the
   heated debate between the East and the West, between the countries on
   the opposing sides of the former Iron Curtain, about what the
   appropriate memory for Europe should be. In this article, I challenge
   this simplistic division and I argue that it completely disregards the
   role of agency. In contrast, I conduct an agent-centred empirical
   analysis and show that the social actors involved in the debate are far
   more diverse, the fault lines are far less clear and the sides of the
   debate are far more heterogeneous than the carelessly used notion of the
   East-West memory divide would have us believe.},

Abstract = {Research on female politicians suggests that women face a double bind.
   Female politicians must embrace their femininity but not be too
   feminine, and they must demonstrate masculinity without deviating from
   gender norms. Hillary Clinton has often struggled with this balance,
   which has resulted in conflicting and inconsistent portrayals of her in
   the news. To examine the extent of this coverage, this study provides a
   longitudinal analysis of Clinton's personal and professional media
   coverage in the New York Times. A content analysis of news coverage of
   Clinton from 1969 to 2016 shows that she has largely not been bound to
   gender labels, gender traits, or mentions of physical appearance. In
   addition, Clinton was not overly discussed as a novelty or norm
   challenger. These findings contradict previous literature, demonstrating
   a potential trend away from using gender as a descriptor for or
   limitation to female politicians.},

Abstract = {Residents of the Komi Republic have enjoyed some benefits from the oil
   industry, through taxation, jobs and business opportunities. They have
   also suffered repeated oil spills, including one of the world's largest
   in 1994. Since most petroleum taxes go to Moscow for redistribution, the
   economic benefits are limited, and are focused in urban centres. Rural
   populations, who suffer most from oil spills, experience benefits
   primarily through companies' social projects. We analyse local
   perceptions of the corporate social responsibility performance of
   Lukoil-Komi and consider how a weak-or `phantom'-social licence to
   operate can lead to open protest.},

Abstract = {Monetary policy operations in corporate security markets confront
   central banks with choices that are traditionally perceived to be the
   prerogative of governments. This article investigates how central
   bankers legitimise corporate security purchases through a comparative
   study of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank
   (SNB). As we show, central bankers downplay the novelty of corporate
   security purchases by relying on familiar pre-crisis justifications of
   Central Bank Independence. Citing an ideal of `market neutrality',
   central banks present corporate security purchases as pursuing a narrow
   objective of price stability and obfuscate their distributive
   consequences. In this way, central bankers depoliticise corporate
   security purchases: they reduce the potential for choice, collective
   agency, and deliberation concerning both the pursuit of corporate
   security purchases and the choices made in implementing these policies.
   We also describe the undesirable democratic, social and environmental
   dimensions of these practices, which we propose to address through
   enhanced democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experimental test of ethnic-based bias in
   citizens' evaluation of a political leader's decision-making across
   three multi-ethnic regions of the Russian Federation (Sakha, Buryatia,
   and Tatarstan) and one mono-ethnic region (Arkhangel'sk Oblast). With
   variations in the intensity of ethnic loyalties, degree of titular
   ethnic group assimilation, and differences in an ethnic division of
   labor, Russian regions present an interesting site for the investigation
   of these conjectures. The experiment participants read a vignette
   describing a decision by a local mayor and assess the decision. We
   randomly vary the mayor's ethnicity and policy choice. Our findings
   suggest that policy substance is the primary influence and dominates
   ethnicity when citizens evaluate public officials in three of the four
   regions. In the fourth region, Sakha in Northern Siberia, we provide
   analyses to explain the greater salience of ethnicity.},

Abstract = {This study explores whether being a member of a migration-trust network
   (MTN; social structures that immigrants create to manage the challenges
   of undocumented status) affects the acquisition of English language
   proficiency among undocumented heads of household who migrate to the
   United States from Mexico. The analysis shows that human capital
   accumulation and interactions with non-Hispanic white Americans are
   important to learning English in this migrant population. But it also
   suggests that membership in an MTN can inhibit the acquisition of
   English language proficiency. I use Mexican Migration Project data and
   other accumulated research to argue that being undocumented and
   participating in MTNs can deter migrants from assimilating into American
   mainstream society: a lack of legal status among many first-generation
   Mexican immigrants pushes them toward survival strategies that rely on
   MTNs.},

Abstract = {Established at the height of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, the
   intergovernmental European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has, potentially,
   considerable influence over decisions on the provision of loans to
   Eurozone member state governments and on the recapitalization of banks.
   Legally and organizationally, the ESM is an international financial
   institution and thus its accountability can be compared to that of the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial
   institutions. However, the ESM's governance structure and
   decision-making procedures show that it is deeply embedded in the
   Eurozone governance architecture, resulting in a dual institutional
   embeddedness. Focusing on vertical and horizontal accountability
   combined with a learning perspective on accountability, this article
   presents an assessment of the accountability mechanisms applicable to
   the idiosyncratic ESM and how these mechanisms work in practice.},

Abstract = {In recent years, more out-of-the-closet lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans
   and queer individuals have entered parliaments. Their visibility raises
   the question of how they imagine that their non-heteronormative
   sexuality interferes with their mandate of political representation.
   Based on interviews with 20 out of the 25 openly lesbian, gay and
   bisexual legislators in Canada in 2017, this article shows that they do
   imagine numerous ways in which being out of the closet empowers their
   role of representation. Without a doubt, being proudly visible is an
   asset for lesbian, gay and bisexual legislators.},

Abstract = {Within the literature on financial governance a key question is why the
   2008 financial crisis did not elicit a stronger regulatory reaction than
   it did - the `post-crisis stasis' puzzle. We explore a neglected
   dimension of this puzzle: public attitudes toward financial regulation.
   Using a variety of survey data of the US public we find that there was
   persistent support for stronger financial regulation following the
   crisis, even support for radical reform in some instances, and support
   continued even after regulatory reform had been enacted. Despite such
   general sentiment, however, at nearly every stage public attitudes were
   highly conditional on partisan affiliation - a hugely consequential
   detail that meant that demand for reform was not channelled into more
   stringent policy but rather into a highly partisan, status quo
   protecting political machinery. Our analysis challenges notions of US
   public attitudes as either conservative in orientation or placated
   through modest reform, but also highlights the importance of domestic
   political constraints in shaping financial reform options despite
   majoritarian support for more robust reform.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, with the increase in both numbers of
   participating jurisdictions and media attention, international
   large-scale assessments (ILSAs) have come to play a more salient role in
   global education policies than they once did. This has led to calls for
   greater transparency with regard to instrument development and closer
   scrutiny of the use of instruments in education policy. We begin with a
   brief review of the history of ILSAs and describe the requirements and
   constraints that shape ILSA design, implementation, and analysis. We
   then evaluate the rationales of employing ILSA results for different
   purposes, ranging from those we argue are most appropriate (comparative
   description) to least appropriate (causal inference). We cite examples
   of ILSA usage from different countries, with particular attention to the
   widespread misinterpretations and misuses of country rankings based on
   average scores on an assessment (e.g., literacy or numeracy). Looking
   forward, we offer suggestions on how to enhance the constructive roles
   that ILSAs play in informing education policy.},

Abstract = {Existing EU study approaches have come under stress as comprehensive
   models of European politics. In this context, bilateral relations
   between EU members remain under-researched yet important for
   understanding the inner workings of the EU. While EU membership puts
   strong limitations on certain kinds of state behaviour it also leaves
   room for the pursuit of national interests through economic and legal
   means. Against this background, the article presents and develops the EU
   Geoeconomics Framework. Focussed on situations where state and companies
   share control over vital sectors of the national economy, this framework
   theorizes the relations between EU member states (MSs). After presenting
   the main assumptions and focus of EU Geoeconomics, the article develops
   six testable propositions. It then discusses these propositions as well
   as the fruitfulness of the framework against the latest developments in
   EU studies theory. The article concludes by pointing towards a renewed
   discussion of bilateral relations.},

Abstract = {As the progressive cycle in Latin America wanes, scholars are attempting
   tounpick the contradictions that underpinned left-wing regimes. This
   article seeks to trace the political economy of the Movement Towards
   Socialism (MAS) from its neostructural and neoextractivist roots in the
   2006 National Development Plan (NDP) through the economic strategy
   actually implemented by the MAS during its time in government. By
   examining macroeconomic indicators, the structure of the economy,
   industrialisation efforts and infrastructural projects this article
   advances a two-pronged argument. On the one hand, economic policy, as
   well as industrialisation and infrastructure projects, have focused on
   maximising economic surplus in the extractive sectors over cultivating
   the sectors that employ the majority of Bolivians. It has then
   redistributed part of the rents captured by the state into these
   labour-intensive sectors. This has consolidated Bolivia's insertion into
   the global market as a primary commodity producer. On the other hand,
   the neostructuralist tenets of the NDP have meant that the class
   character of these policies has been ignored by the government. As the
   commodities bonanza came to a close in 2013 the government increasingly
   sided with capital over labour in social struggles over economic
   development.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the expectations of many, the break between Portugal and its
   former colonies in southern Africa was far from complete after
   decolonization. This article points to three major reasons. First, the
   impact on relations with Angola and Mozambique of the fragmentation of
   Portuguese state power and tense polarization in the Portuguese polity
   after the military coup of 24 April 1974 has been overstated and was far
   from entirely negative. Second, diplomatic relations were normalized
   between Portugal, Angola, and Mozambique during the Cold War in a way
   that has significant parallels with West Germany's Ostpolitik.
   Portugal's Sudpolitik saw a cultural identity worth preserving despite
   geopolitical divisions and pushed for better relations and deepened ties
   with these states to help move them away from strict alignment with the
   Soviet bloc. Third, officers of the Armed Forces Movement that carried
   out the April 1974 coup exercised a fundamental, positive influence in
   Portuguese policies toward Angola and Mozambique during decolonization
   and for years afterward.},

Abstract = {Normally, privatisation is seen as beneficial. This paper considers the
   case of Serbia - a latecomer in the matter - where privatisation was
   partly a result of exogenous pressures and where the process has been
   deemed a failure. In Serbia, a sizeable number of privatised firms were
   bought by bureaucrats and politicians and all firms were subjected to a
   period of supervision. We argue that the design of this process allowed
   rent-seekers to conserve their privileges through asset-stripping, which
   explains the failure. In order to do so, we perform an empirical
   analysis of the determinants of liquidation, merger and bankruptcy of
   privatised firms from 2002 to 2015. We construct a novel data set from
   primary sources, free of the `survivorship bias' and containing proxies
   for various types of owners, indirect signs of asset-stripping strategy
   and a broad range of controls. Our results indicate that firms owned by
   politicians faced significantly higher risks of bankruptcy, especially
   after the end of supervision.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have the potential to
   transform transitional justice in the digital era. However, it is
   difficult to evaluate whether ICTs generally democratize access and
   participation in transitional justice processes, or whether they
   reinforce preexisting power asymmetries because of inequalities in terms
   of access and technological skills. Instead of endorsing a
   techno-optimistic or a techno-pessimistic vision, this Note from the
   Field focuses on how the everyday use of technology by civil society
   actors contributes to shaping the potential impact of ICTs. Drawing upon
   science and technology studies, it argues that the conceptualization of
   transitional justice is co-constructed during the adoption and use of
   different technological tools. The Note describes two different uses of
   ICTs in the context of the Justicia y Paz law in Colombia from 2005.
   While ministries and state institutions created an integrated
   information system to improve procedural efficiency, civil society
   organizations created open information systems to circulate data and to
   contribute to historical memory and truth. These two examples illustrate
   how the use of ICT is shaping new conceptualizations of transitional
   justice among actors and in society in general.},

Abstract = {While policymakers often make bold claims as to the positive impact of
   intellectual property (IP) rights on both developed and developing
   country economies, the empirical literature is more ambiguous. IP rights
   have both incentive and inhibitory effects that are difficult to isolate
   in the abstract and are dependent on economic context. To unravel these
   contradictory effects, this article introduces an index that evaluates
   the strength of IP protection in 124 developing countries for the years
   1995 to 2011. We illustrate the value of this index to economics study
   and show evidence that is consistent with IP leading to increased
   growth. Our results are further consistent with two causal pathways
   highlighted in the literature: that IP leads to greater levels of
   technology transfer and increased domestic inventive activity. Yet other
   aspects of our study fit uneasily with this simple story. For example,
   we find evidence suggesting that increased levels of growth lead to
   greater levels of IP protection, contradictory evidence in the
   literature linking IP with growth, a lack of evidence that increased
   levels of IP protection lead to actual use of the IP system, and
   problems with what IP indexes measure. Because of this, we suggest
   another - and so far undertheorized - explanation of the links between
   IP and growth: that IP may have few direct effects on growth and that
   any causality is a result of belief rather than actual deployment of IP.},

Abstract = {Does colonialism have long-term effects on political stability? This
   question is addressed in a study of India's Naxalite insurgency, a
   Maoist rebellion characterized by its left-wing proponents as having
   roots in the colonial period. The article highlights three mechanisms
   linking colonialism with contemporary Naxalite violence-land inequality,
   discriminatory policies toward low-caste and tribal groups, and
   upper-caste-dominated administrative institutions. It analyzes how the
   degree of British influence relates to Naxalite conflict in 589
   districts from 1980 to 2011. A positive association is found between
   British influence and the strength of the Naxalite rebellion across all
   of India, within both the ``Red Corridor{''} region and former princely
   states. The results are robust to a coarsened exact matching analysis
   and a wide array of robustness checks. The findings call into question
   whether the supposedly beneficial administrative and institutional
   legacies of colonialism can be evaluated without reference to their
   social costs.},

Abstract = {The \#MeToo Movement both within academia and popular culture has
   largely been seen as an issue for white women (and men). While the
   phrase Me Too was originally coined by Tarana Burke in 2006 to raise
   public awareness of sexual harassment, violence and assault experienced
   by women of color, the Movement has largely been whitewashed by
   primarily depicting victims and survivors as white women. Black women
   academics, like myself, also experience sexual harassment. By
   highlighting the ways that race-based sexual harassment further
   marginalizes already underrepresented groups in political science, I use
   my personal story to elucidate how a gender-only lens misses the
   complexities of Black women's experiences with power inequities in
   academia. Throughout this narrative I underscore the importance of
   mentorship, professional networks, and the ability to harness
   scholarship as a vehicle to combat the pervasiveness of sexual
   harassment, violence, and assault for Black women in political science.},

Abstract = {This article compares the impact of the \#MeToo movement in South Korea
   and Japan. In South Korea, \#MeToo inspired many women to go public with
   their accusations in numerous high-profile cases. Those accusations
   inspired the mobilization of mass demonstrations and demands for legal
   reform. In South Korea, the movement's impact is evident in policy
   proposals and the revision of laws on sexual harassment and gender-based
   violence. In Japan, however, the movement has grown more slowly. Fewer
   women went public, and if they did, many remained anonymous. The
   movement remains limited to a small number of cases that resulted in the
   formation of a professional network to support women journalists. We
   argue that the different outcomes in these countries can be explained by
   the strength of women's engagement in civil society and the nature of
   the media coverage in each case. In both countries, however, women
   continue to face a powerful backlash that includes victim-blaming and
   social and professional sanctions for speaking up.},

Abstract = {Sexual misconduct matters not only when it is perpetuated by political
   actors in political institutions. It matters wherever it happens and
   whomever it happens to, because it is, at its base, political. Politics
   is fundamentally about power: who gets what, when, and how. As political
   scientists it should be at the heart of what we study, but it isn't. Our
   discipline creates artificial (and somewhat arbitrary) boundaries about
   which studies of politics count as meaningful research and which do not.
   We discourage research that explores more expansive notions of how
   politics is practiced in broader society. As academics we have the
   luxury of speaking out. I argue here that political scientists ought to
   embrace an expansive definition of politics to address the real
   questions of power, its abuse in our society and in our profession.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores how the emerging negotiation position of the UK
   regarding future cooperation in internal security with the EU is
   characterised by a largely unsubstantiated expectation that little will
   change in this area of cooperation for the sake of collective security.
   The EU, meanwhile, has signaled that it wants a partnership beneficial
   for both sides, but has also pointed out various challenges to future
   cooperation and voiced frustration with the UK's vague position and the
   experienced difficulties in the negotiations-feelings that, the authors
   warn, could reduce the political will necessary to reach a substantive
   future security agreement.},

Abstract = {The third chapter analyzes the spatial characteristics of the outer
   space as a geopolitical domain deals with its socioeconomic
   characteristics and importance. As the name itself tells us, the section
   will present impacts of the outer space on the social development and
   economic activity on Earth and possible development of the economic
   relations in the outer space region. We will thus look into both present
   and future roles of the outer space for these two areas of human
   activity. The text will be divided into the following sub-chapters: the
   social importance of space assets, economic importance of space assets,
   private and commercial space actors and space utilization, resource
   extraction and energy from space, and the future of space economy.},

Abstract = {The article describes EU cross-sectoral policy work on online
   information threats, focusing on the intersection between values and
   `referent objects'. Examining discussions on strategic communication,
   censorship, media literacy and media pluralism, two value-perspectives
   were identified: while abstract procedural values of efficiency and
   coherence guide content management in the security/defence/internet
   communities, media/education communities highlight the end-goals of
   content pluralism and enhanced citizen judgement. In implementation, the
   former's lack of substantive goals, coupled with an outsourcing of
   content management, may give rise to hybrid values. The findings
   highlight the danger of neglecting substance in favor of efficient
   management of an online `battlespace'.},

Abstract = {David Ben-Gurion, the founder of the State of Israel, repeatedly accused
   Britain of provoking the Arab states to invade Israel the day after its
   establishment in May 1948. To date, historians have not found proof of
   his accusations in British archives. However, evidence may be found in
   French archives, especially in Syrian and secret British documents
   obtained by the French secret services, originating from agents who had
   infiltrated the Syrian government in Damascus and the British Legation
   in Beirut. This article, based on French, Syrian, Israeli and British
   sources, argues that under the Labour government, Arabist MI6 officers
   in the Middle East, in collaboration with the British High Command in
   Cairo, pursued an alternative policy to that of the Foreign Office. They
   provoked Egypt's King Faruq to go to war against Israel without the
   knowledge or approval of either Prime Minister Clement Attlee or Foreign
   Secretary Ernest Bevin, frequently misinforming and misleading them.
   This watershed research provides details of the goals and modus operandi
   of those involved in that clandestine plot.},

Abstract = {In their contributions to the symposium ``Just War and Unjust
   Soldiers,{''} Michael Walzer, Jeff McMahan, and Robert O. Keohane add
   greatly to our understanding of how best to study and apply just war
   doctrine to real-world conflicts. We argue, however, that they
   underestimate both the degree to which the American public seeks
   revenge, rather than just reciprocity, and the extent of popular
   acceptance of violations of noncombatant immunity by soldiers perceived
   to be fighting for a just cause. We call on empirical political
   scientists, lawyers, psychologists, and historians to engage with moral
   philosophers and political theorists in debates about the influence of
   just war theory and the laws of armed conflict.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive overview of several efforts at
   creating reconciliation barometers in 10 countries worldwide. The
   discussion is based on reflections from the originators of the
   barometers themselves convened in a workshop in 2016 about methodology,
   definitions, challenges and outcomes of these efforts to longitudinally
   measure reconciliation in postconflict contexts. We conduct a
   cross-barometer comparison and conclude that the different barometers
   have many more similarities than differences - a surprising finding
   considering the variety of contexts they represent. With the
   proliferation of efforts to develop reconciliation barometers in the
   past decade, we propose a new research agenda to contribute to a growing
   need to better understand the consumption of these tools by policy
   makers and implementers, as well as how they are best developed and
   disseminated.},

Abstract = {The 1996 welfare reforms imposed major changes on the nation's
   means-tested benefits, including a requirement that states place at
   least half of their cash welfare caseload in work or related activities.
   Congress also increased both cash and in-kind subsidies for low-income
   working families. Between the mid-1990s and 2000, work and wages among
   low-income women increased and poverty declined. The recessions of 2001
   and 2007-2009 caused rising employment to falter, but after 2014,
   women's employment rose again, and poverty declined. The impacts of
   welfare reform on these outcomes have been disputed, with many on the
   Left charging that states have used welfare funds inappropriately and
   many on the Right arguing that welfare reform played a major role in the
   improvements in work, wages, and poverty. We review reforms that have
   been proposed by one or both parties in recent years, including focusing
   spending on benefits and work. We conclude with lessons of these reform
   experiences for future reforms of entitlement programs.},

Abstract = {The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known
   as the Food Stamp Program, is a cornerstone of the U.S. safety net. SNAP
   provides means-tested electronic vouchers that can be used to purchase
   most foods at participating retail outlets and helps low-income families
   afford the food that they need. It also helps to stabilize the economy
   in fiscal downturns, because more benefits are paid when jobs and income
   are scarce. SNAP households range widely in their demographic
   characteristics, from those with elderly or disabled members, to
   prime-age families (typically with children) who combine work and
   benefit receipt, to those with no or very low levels of income.
   Potential reforms, such as policies to encourage work or improve dietary
   outcomes, may have different impacts on various subgroups and should be
   designed with the heterogeneity of the caseload in mind. I review the
   theoretical and empirical research literature on SNAP's impacts and
   consider potential reforms by analyzing them in terms of the program's
   stated goals.},

Abstract = {Financial market integration processes in the European Union (EU) are
   characterised by an epistemic problem of economic theory. This problem
   encompasses what `the market' is, how it is to be `integrated', and the
   nature and role of `money' as infrastructure of the fully integrated
   market. The EU's legal framework has imported this epistemic problem
   along with the competitive conception of the market as described in
   economic theory - as a `level playing field' for private exchange, under
   free, fair and ideally unrestrained competition. It manifests itself in
   European financial market integration processes, as exemplified in the
   article, via two otherwise disconnected areas of European Central Bank
   (ECB) activity: (a) the provision of central bank credit for the purpose
   of financial transaction settlement in the Eurozone; and (b) the conduct
   of ordinary monetary policy in the Eurozone. While the problem can be
   stabilised through legal, technical and other means, it remains latent,
   and may manifest itself again in unexpected ways, as happened in the
   wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, contrary to ideologies that are
   widely understood as more or less coherent systems of doctrines,
   epistemic problems are characterised by specific tensions,
   contradictions and conceptual uncertainties.},

Abstract = {The European stability mechanism (ESM) is a permanent crisis resolution
   mechanism for euro area countries. We analysed the costs of the current
   ESM refinancing design and evaluated an alternative asset-backed
   securities (ABS) structure under different scenarios. Our simulation
   results indicate that switching to an ABS structure could substantially
   lower the ESM refinancing rate by up to 3.5 per cent. Moreover, the
   current structure severely limits the ESM's potential to stabilize
   financial markets. As an unintended consequence, the ESM is likely to
   act as a crisis accelerant rather than a stabilizer in the most likely
   case of requests for medium-sized financial support from distressed ESM
   members at a time when other ESM countries might be unwilling or unable
   to provide new capital.},

Abstract = {This paper re-examines why global collective action problems persist,
   and how to overcome them. Drawing on 140 interviews with campaigners,
   politicians, and businesses in 10 European countries, it suggests that
   many activists are stuck in a despondency trap. Never seeing radical
   reform, they lower their ambitions, and invest in more feasible but
   sub-optimal alternatives. This creates a negative feedback loop, in
   which the dearth of radical reform becomes self-fulfilling. But if
   reformists see advances at home and abroad, they may become more
   optimistic about collective mobilisation and break out of their
   despondency trap. This is shown by tracing the drivers of
   ground-breaking legislation. From 2018, large French firms must mitigate
   risks of environmental and human rights abuses in their global supply
   chains, or else be liable. This bill ? the world?s first of its kind ?
   was vociferously contested by businesses. But French campaigners and
   politicians persisted for four years, because they saw reasons for
   optimism. These include growing international support; public outcry;
   the French political culture (state intervention, and distrust of
   multinationals); together with a Centre-Left Government. Optimism
   galvanised relentless mobilisation. Legislative success in France then
   delivered a positive shock to activists across Europe, who were
   emboldened to launch similar campaigns and escape their despondency
   trap.},

Abstract = {This paper applies the model of opinion formation developed by John
   Zaller to the study of anti-American attitudes in the Russian elite. It
   examines the relative weight of political predispositions (interests,
   values, and experiences) versus immediately accessible ?considerations?
   that depend on the flow of information in elite discourse. Based on
   survey data from 1995?2016, we find that two key political
   predispositions (identification as a Westernizer or Slavophile and
   service in the military and security agencies) are highly significant in
   the Yel?tsin period, when debates about Western intentions toward Russia
   were robust and the Kremlin?s messaging was diverse. By contrast,
   anti-American sentiment in the elite has become more uniform in the
   Putin era, which we attribute to an increasingly fervent anti-American
   narrative on state-controlled television. In a period of clear and
   unequivocal messaging emanating from Kremlin-controlled media, these
   signals have surpassed civilizational identity and service in the force
   structures in importance.},

Abstract = {By analyzing why English local governments have made extensive use of
   long-term market loans with embedded derivatives, this paper seeks to
   contribute to the growing literature on local government
   financialization. Using an original, large-N panel dataset for the
   period from 1998 to 2014, we show that the configuration of the local
   political economy is an important driver of financialization processes:
   a Labour Party majority as well as fiscal and economic stress make it
   more likely that councils adopt risky financial instruments. As the use
   of financial innovations has also diffused geographically, policy
   diffusion impacts local governments as well. Highlighting the
   conditional effect of finance sector power, which only increases the use
   of financial innovations in very large councils, as well as the temporal
   dimension of fiscal and economic stress, we create ample avenues for
   further research.},

Abstract = {NGOs have been seen as an integral part of civil society and a necessary
   feature of democratic transition. It has been argued that depoliticised
   NGOs in China `embedded' in existing political structures would
   eventually bring about democratic changes through incremental actions,
   as they did in post-Soviet Russia. Both countries, however, recently
   witnessed the shrinking of political and legal space for public
   participation, especially for foreign-funded civil society
   organisations. This article analyses the impact of the NGO laws on civil
   society in Russia and China to update the embedded activism hypothesis.
   It draws on empirical data to describe the strategies that the NGOs use
   to adapt and how the future of the sector is perceived by young people
   in both countries.},

Abstract = {In one of the most influential contributions to modern political
   economy, Hall and Soskice have launched a distinction between `liberal'
   and `coordinated' market economies, placing the Nordic countries firmly
   in the latter category. We argue that, while the H\&S distinction may
   serve classificatory purposes, seeing the Nordic model in terms of
   `coordinated capitalism' blurs the distinctive features of the Nordic
   countries' success as productive and fair economies. We contend that the
   central formula behind this success lies in what we call the Nordic
   model's ambidexterity - the capacity to combine collaborative and
   competitive elements and skilfully navigate between them. Using an
   interdisciplinary perspective (inspired by organisation theory, cultural
   semiotics and evolutionary analysis), we provide a conceptual basis for
   reinterpreting the Nordic Model as an ambidextrous combination of
   culturally rooted, collaborative strategies that are subsequently
   competitively exposed. The article illustrates the workings of this
   ambidexterity in three societal domains: work life (including female
   participation), resource management - illustrated by the Norwegian
   petro-economy - and international business management and regulation
   with a focus on CSR. In each case we will show how collaboration is
   intertwined with pragmatic competitive exposure, yielding high
   productivity, high welfare, as well as fair income and wealth
   distribution.},

Abstract = {This article furthers our understanding of the ontology of modern
   international relations by foregrounding the neglected structuring role
   of nationalism. Most accounts of nationalism in international relations
   reduce the phenomenon to a peripheral threat, whereby nationalism only
   seems to become relevant in moments when the international order is in
   crisis. In contrast, I argue that the ontology of modern international
   relations is inherently parasitic on nationalism. Leveraging on Jacques
   Derrida's writings on ``hauntology,{''} this article recasts nationalism
   as a spectral logic that silently structures the ontology of modern
   international relations, even when it seems to remain absent and
   ineffective. In particular, I explain how the contradictions of
   nationalism become embedded in the concept of sovereignty, which serves
   as the ontological cornerstone of modern international relations.
   Transgressions of sovereignty are therefore not reducible to a tension
   between normative and factual levels, or logics of appropriateness and
   logics of consequences, but stem from the structural impossibility of
   the nationalist project itself. Viewed this way, the aporetic form of
   sovereignty is not merely a logical conundrum but a vital and productive
   ontological opening that sets international relations in motion.},

Abstract = {As part of the roundtable ``Economic Sanctions and Their
   Consequences,{''} this essay examines unilateral coercive measures.
   These types of sanctions are applied outside the scope of Chapter VII of
   the United Nations Charter, and were developed and refined in the West
   in the context of the Cold War. Yet the eventual collapse of the Berlin
   Wall did not herald the demise of unilateral sanctions; much to the
   contrary. While there are no incontrovertible data on the extent of
   these measures, one can safely say that they target in some way a full
   quarter of humanity. In addition to being a major attack on the
   principle of self-determination, unilateral measures not only adversely
   affect the rights to international trade and to navigation but also the
   basic human rights of innocent civilians. The current deterioration of
   the situation, with the mutation of embargoes into blockades and
   impositions on third parties, is a threat to peace that needs to be
   upgraded in strategic concern.},

Abstract = {Statisticians are under pressure to innovate, partly due to shrinking
   budgets and the call to do more with less, but also due to technological
   advances and the emergence of new actors promising to produce more
   accurate and timely statistics with what has come to be known as ``big
   data.{''} This raises the question, how do new forms of data and methods
   become legitimate and official? We approach this question by conceiving
   of official statistics as part of a transnational field in which
   different factions of actors compete and struggle over the authority to
   innovate the data and methods that are legitimated to produce official
   statistics. We consider these struggles as a politics of method that is
   not reducible to a competition between ideas and words. They are also
   material insofar as they feature competing digital devices mobilized to
   demonstrate the validity of new data and methods. Through two empirical
   examples, we identify the strategy of reassembling methods to capture
   how statisticians tame and contain innovations based on big data,
   especially those introduced by data scientists, by integrating and
   simultaneously subordinating them to existing methods. By doing so, we
   suggest that reassembling is an innovation strategy that secures the
   relative position of national and international statisticians within the
   transnational field of statistics.},

Abstract = {This article shows how the Eastern and Central European export footwear
   sector has experienced economic and social downgrading and immiserating
   growth over the last three decades. Based on interviews with 209 workers
   from 12 factories across six countries, it analyses how intense
   gender-based labor exploitation-entailing dangerous working conditions
   and poverty pay-underpins the sector's expansion and extra-regional
   integration. It draws upon and contributes to the global poverty chain
   (GPC) approach by (1) showing how the concept is relevant beyond the
   global south, and (2) providing a gendered political economy perspective
   from which to conduct GPC analysis. It concludes by suggesting that
   GPC's are quite common throughout the world economy, and that their
   existence requires a more critical approach to much global value chain
   analysis.},

Abstract = {In 2017, former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori was pardoned after
   serving less than half of a 25-year sentence for human rights
   violations. The measure was taken amidst political turmoil and an
   impeachment process led by the Fujimorista party against former
   president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Fujimori's victims in the Barrios Altos
   and La Cantuta cases requested the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
   (IACtHR) to annul the pardon due to its incompatibility with Peru's
   human rights obligations. The IACtHR decided that it was for the
   Peruvian courts to exercise jurisdictional control over the pardon, thus
   affirming its subsidiary role. Through an examination of the political
   situation, the underlying principles of the IACtHR's jurisprudence on
   amnesties, and rule of law and international standards, this article
   argues that the IACtHR had sufficient grounds to overturn the pardon.
   The court's resolution to refer the matter to the Peruvian jurisdiction
   may be explained by an increasing awareness of its subsidiary role,
   particularly regarding sensitive political issues.},

Abstract = {This article theoretically and empirically analyzes leader corporations'
   innovation processes in contemporary capitalism. We highlight three
   characteristics: their transnational scope, the primacy of power or
   asymmetric relations exercised by leaders over the participants of their
   innovation circuits or networks, and the relevance of what we called
   technological competition and technological cooperation between leaders.
   Focusing on the latter, our theoretical contribution integrates the
   concepts of innovation circuit, global innovation network and modularity
   of knowledge production in order to elaborate a preliminary model for
   synthesizing leader's technological competition and collaboration
   behaviors. This model is the general framework used for studying three
   big pharma's innovation networks (Roche, Novartis and Pfizer). In
   particular, we study those networks by considering two outputs:
   scientific publications and patents. Network maps are constructed based
   on institutions' co-occurrences, thus looking at who is co-authoring
   their publications and co-owning these corporations' patents. We find
   that big pharmaceuticals co-produce together mainly generic knowledge
   modules, thus develop a strong technological cooperation.
   Simultaneously, to succeed in their technological competition they
   outsource stages of their innovation networks to subordinate
   institutions that, even if they contribute to achieve the innovation,
   will not be co-owners of the resulting patents, while big
   pharmaceuticals enjoy associated innovation rents.},

Abstract = {This study examines the representation of women Members of Parliament on
   parliamentary committees in the German Bundestag since 1990. In line
   with theories on the social construction of gender, our descriptive
   analyses show that women Members of Parliament tend to be
   over-represented on committees handling issues such as health and
   family, and under-represented on committees handling issues such as
   foreign and legal affairs and defence. However, party differences in the
   over- and under-representation of women on certain committees occur.
   Gender segregation is strongest within the conservative parties, which
   also tend to have the lowest proportion of women, and weakest within the
   left-wing parties.},

Abstract = {In many ways the ``practice turn{''} in international relations (IR) was
   a mere ``practices turn,{''} in that it essentially sidelined what were
   presumably two key inspirations of this ``turn,{''} namely the
   philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and American pragmatism. This article
   argues that-despite obvious differences-Wittgenstein and pragmatism
   share a general commitment to the primacy of practice and the
   constitution of meaningful action in language that reaches well beyond
   the ongoing fixation on ``practices{''} (as habits) in IR. We argue that
   a combination of the central insights of both Wittgensteinian and
   pragmatist works offers a fruitful new perspective on the long-standing
   debate about whether the idea and practice of social science differ from
   other scientific disciplines, in particular natural science, in (a) the
   relation to its subject matter, (b) the methodology it applies, and (c)
   the role of theory. A reassessment of this debate will also broaden our
   understanding of the practice of IR theorizing that not only comprehends
   it as the mere habitual or routinized endeavor of social scientists
   bound to their specific method of science but also emphasizes the
   creative momentum of theorizing as a linguistic practice vis-a-vis its
   subject matter.},

Abstract = {The introduction of `gig work' has been accompanied by an official
   discourse which highlights the benefits for `gig workers', especially as
   arises from the more autonomous nature of this particular type of
   employment. In contrast, this paper draws upon the cultural political
   economy approach to argue that the move towards gig work is more
   accurately conceptualised as an attempt to legitimate the further
   flexibilisation of labour markets within advanced industrial
   democracies, seeking to construct economic imaginaries that are best
   described as a form of `fictitious freedom'. In drawing on the cultural
   political economy approach, the paper explores the interaction between
   the structural, discursive and technological selectivities which have
   generated these outcomes. This is done through a discussion of the case
   of Japan, which is selected as a key case that highlights the tensions
   and pressures leading to the introduction of gig work in this way across
   the advanced industrial democracies. The article shows how gig work sees
   new digital technologies used in an attempt to increase productivity and
   thereby further growth, locking gig workers into low-skilled and
   low-paid super-fragmented tasks, whilst at the same time heralding the
   benefits that gig work can provide for a range of contemporary problems.},

Abstract = {The provision of public schooling in the United States has primarily
   been the states' responsibility, but states generally lack the capacity
   to manage day-to-day school operations. Thus, states delegate
   responsibility to districts while maintaining some oversight. Forms of
   oversight include regulations and political and market-based
   accountability. However, these can only do so much in holding schools
   accountable for providing high-quality schooling. Administrative
   accountability based on student outcomes and school process measures
   presents an alternative to complement other accountability mechanisms.
   Standardized measures of performance used for administrative
   accountability can better align curriculum with state standards, improve
   quality, and signal the skills that society wishes for students to
   build. However, they can be counterproductive if they are not reliable,
   valid, or comprehensive. We suggest in this article that no measure is
   perfect and that the usefulness of test-based accountability depends on
   whether the measures enhance educational opportunities and reflect
   shared goals with reliability, validity, and comprehensiveness.},

Abstract = {The paper examines UK government positions on the regulation of
   transnational labour in the context of Brexit. Through an analysis of EU
   regulations on posted workers - the practice whereby a company based in
   one EU member state sends workers to carry out a service in another EU
   member state - the paper argues that the UK has consistently advocated
   further liberalisation of transnational labour markets in EU level
   decision-making, a position consistent with promoting increasingly
   `flexible' labour markets at home. Brexit marks a turning point. Demands
   from British workers for stronger protection against liberalising
   pressure help explain the UK's recent shift towards relaxing its
   opposition to `market-correcting' EU initiatives like the revised posted
   worker directive. Brexit provides a window of opportunity for the
   revitalisation of `Social Europe' in the EU-27, without a longstanding
   veto player at the bargaining table, but one more likely focused more on
   upholding national labour protections than initiating new supranational
   policies.},

Abstract = {Since mid-2005, archivist-activists at the Historical Archive of the
   National Police of Guatemala have been digitizing a century's worth of
   previously suppressed police records so as to protect, mobilize and
   provide access to them - 23 million pages to date. We find that
   digitization amplified the staff's repurposing of the archive to serve
   victims of human rights violations. Digitization enhances short- and
   long-term safeguards for the archive's physical integrity, probative
   value and enduring accessibility, but has required critical human
   factors and institutional solidarity, most notably partnerships with
   international donors and allied organizations, and Guatemalan
   nongovernmental organizations. Finally, technology offers a lens to
   analyze the persistent challenges to promoting truth and justice in
   Guatemala. We show how simple, often ad hoc approaches to digitization
   developed under political urgency can have an irreversible impact when
   used to amplify a unified mission driven by a committed community of
   archival workers.},

Title = {Beyond Victims' Mere Presence: An Empirical Analysis of Victim
   Participation in Transitional Justice in Colombia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {209-228},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Whereas victims' rights and demands have gained attention in the
   practice and scholarship of transitional justice (TJ), victims are at
   best consultees and witnesses, not decision-makers. Victims'
   participation as political actors, and the impact of sociopolitical
   participation on survivors, is still an under-researched area in TJ.
   This article provides an analysis of how victims' participation is given
   shape in the everyday functioning of Colombia's Victims' Law. The
   Victims' Law offers an excellent case to examine this issue, since it
   provides an ongoing and ambitious TJ mechanism with a detailed framework
   for participation. This allows for a better understanding of this
   phenomenon in practice, beyond the understanding of victim-centred
   transitional justice as the mere presence of victims. This article
   critically engages with victim-centred TJ theories which are based on
   long-held assumptions of how participation will lead to participation,
   ownership and citizenship. It moreover explores the impact on victims of
   that participation throughout the different phases of non-judicial TJ
   procedures. It asks whether their engagement means that TJ processes
   indeed respond better to victims' needs, whether victims feel a greater
   ownership of these processes as a result, and whether victims even want
   to participate. It concludes by reflecting on the implications for
   victim-centred TJ, by explaining that participation should privilege
   genuinely participatory processes which take survivors and their agency
   as a starting point. This requires recognizing and building upon
   victims' pre-existent internal organizational and decision-making
   processes and time frames, to create a more horizontal way of relating.},
