Title = {Negotiating environmental protection in trade agreements: A regime shift
   or a tactical linkage?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {533-556},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The prolific literature on the relationship between the trade and
   environmental regimes suffers from three shortcomings. First, it
   myopically focuses on multilateral institutions, while the vast majority
   of trade and environmental agreements are bilateral. Second, when
   studies consider preferential trade agreements' (PTAs) environmental
   provisions, they are often limited to USA and EU agreements. Third, it
   examines how the trade and environmental regimes negatively affect each
   other, leaving aside their potential synergies. Conversely, this article
   assesses the potential contribution of PTAs to international
   environmental law. Several PTAs include a full-fledged chapter devoted
   to environmental protection and contain detailed commitments on various
   environmental issue areas. One possible scenario is that countries that
   are dissatisfied with traditional settings for environmental lawmaking
   engage in a process of ``regime shifting{''} toward PTAs to move forward
   on their environmental agenda. The alternative is that PTAs'
   environmental provisions are the result of ``tactical linkages{''} and
   merely duplicate extant obligations from international environmental law
   to serve political goals. We shed light on this question by building on
   two datasets of 690 PTAs and 2343 environmental treaties. We investigate
   four potential contributions of PTAs to environmental law: the diffusion
   of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), the diffusion of
   existing environmental rules, the design of new environmental rules, and
   the legal prevalence of MEAs. The article concludes that the
   contribution of PTAs to the strengthening of states' commitments under
   international environmental law is very modest on the four dimensions
   examined.},

Abstract = {Political commentators have offered evidence that the ``polling
   misses{''} of 2016 were caused by a number of factors. This project
   focuses on one explanation: that likely-voter models-tools used by
   preelection pollsters to predict which survey respondents are most
   likely to make up the electorate and, thus, whose responses should be
   used to calculate election predictions-were flawed. While models
   employed by different pollsters vary widely, it is difficult to
   systematically study them because they are often considered part of
   pollsters' method-ological black box. In this study, we use Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study surveys since 2008 to build a probabilistic
   likely-voter model that takes into account not only the stated
   intentions of respon-dents to vote, but also other demographic variables
   that are consistently strong predictors of both turnout and
   overreporting. This model, which we term the Perry-Gallup and
   Demographics (PGaD) approach, shows that the bias and error created by
   likely-voter models can be reduced to a negligible amount. This
   likely-voter approach uses variables that pollsters already collect for
   weighting purposes and thus should be relatively easy to implement in
   future elections.},

Abstract = {Ideal types have received less attention than membership criteria in the
   ethnicity and nationalism literature. This article uses crowdsourced
   genealogical data and onomastics software to show that British Isles
   surnames and ancestry remain over-represented among American actors,
   especially in roles connected with the national narrative. Conformity to
   the WASP ideal type persists despite the fact American actors are
   disproportionately born in Los Angeles, New York, and other large
   cities, where British ancestry is rare. Jewish actors are
   over-represented, yet many have Anglo surnames. Compared to athletes and
   politicians, actors are significantly more likely to have Anglo
   surnames, especially those in genres depicting the nation. After
   declining among cohorts of stars born between the 1800s and 1961, the
   share of British Isles surnames has stabilised and remains in the
   majority. We argue that despite rising diversity, this reflects the
   continuing importance of the Anglo-Protestant ethnic imago for American
   national identity.},

Abstract = {Recent research on conspiracy beliefs reveals that the general
   predisposition to believe conspiracy theories cuts across partisan and
   ideological lines. While this may signify that political orientations
   have no bearing on conspiratorial reasoning, it also may suggest that
   conspiracy theorists are simply less engaged in traditional left-right
   politics. In this manuscript, I consider the relationship between
   conspiratorial thinking and political constraint, or the extent to which
   individuals have a clear picture of ``what goes with what{''} with
   respect to the various objects of the political world. Using the 2012
   American National Election Study, I construct a measure of
   conspiratorial thinking, as well as several operationalizations of both
   ideological and group-based constraint and ideological thinking. Results
   show that individuals prone to conspiratorial thinking are less
   politically constrained-when it comes to both thoughts about issues and
   feelings about political groups-than their less conspiratorial
   counterparts. Moreover, conspiratorial thinking is positively associated
   with antigovernmental orientations and a lack of political efficacy,
   with conspiracy theorists perceiving a governmental threat to individual
   rights and displaying a deep skepticism that who one votes for really
   matters. These findings suggest that conspiratorial thinking may have
   broader implications for individuals' basic conceptualization of
   politics.},

Abstract = {When in 1875 Queen Olga of Greece insisted a multi-part chant be
   introduced in the Athens Cathedral, a widespread debate about the
   influence of Western European culture upon Greek-Orthodox tradition was
   initiated in Athens. With a significant part of this debate originating
   in mid-century Vienna, and Russian musical influences affecting the form
   of the otherwise ancient Byzantine chant, the issue of polyphony
   acquired cultural-historical dimensions intimately connected to
   historical continuity and the Orthodox-Christian musical tradition. The
   debate transformed rapidly from a musicological enquiry into a matter of
   national identity, and an otherwise innocent aesthetic choice showcased
   the musical dimensions of Greek national claims at continuity. This
   article examines the historical contingencies that fuelled this debate,
   showcases the importance of patronage for musical transference and
   highlights the potency of Greek national Orthodoxy as a carrier of
   historical continuity for the ethnic group, here seen through music.},

Abstract = {Far-right parties are on the rise across Europe. Their shared populist
   rhetoric, emphasis on sovereignty and policies that promote a `national
   preference' has facilitated the term `the new nationalism'. According to
   an emerging consensus, this new nationalism is primarily a demand-side
   phenomenon triggered by cultural grievances, i.e. a cultural backlash,
   driven by those on the wrong end of a new transnational cleavage. This
   explanation we argue tends to overlook important variations across
   countries and across time. As such, in this article, we contest the view
   that the `new nationalism' is a linear and coherent phenomenon best
   understood as a cultural backlash. Specifically, our argument is
   threefold: (1) it is important to conceptually distinguish between
   populism, nationalism and the far right in order to draw meaningful
   conclusions about the extent to which this phenomenon is linear,
   coherent and comparable across cases; (2) voters' economic concerns
   remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage,
   entailing that voting behaviour is structured by two dimensions of
   contestation; (3) the explanatory power of nationalism is in the supply,
   i.e. the ways in which parties use nationalism strategically in an
   attempt to broaden their appeal.},

Abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach to conduct inferential analyses on
   dyadic data while accounting for interdependencies between observations
   through a set of additive and multiplicative effects (AME). The AME
   model is built on a generalized linear modeling framework and is thus
   flexible enough to be applied to a variety of contexts. We contrast the
   AME model to two prominent approaches in the literature: the latent
   space model (LSM) and the exponential random graph model (ERGM).
   Relative to these approaches, we show that the AME approach is (a) to be
   easy to implement; (b) interpretable in a general linear model
   framework; (c) computationally straightforward; (d) not prone to
   degeneracy; (e) captures first-, second-, and third-order network
   dependencies; and (f) notably outperforms ERGM5 and LSM5 on a variety of
   metrics and in an out-of-sample context. In summary, AME offers a
   straightforward way to undertake nuanced, principled inferential network
   analysis for a wide range of social science questions.},

Abstract = {Many bilateral relationships requiring mutual agreement produce
   observable networks that are symmetric (undirected). However, the
   unobserved, asymmetric (directed) network is frequently the object of
   scientific interest. We propose a method that probabilistically
   reconstructs the latent, asymmetric network from the observed, symmetric
   graph in a regression-based framework. We apply this model to the
   bilateral investment treaty network. Our approach successfully recovers
   the true data generating process in simulation studies, extracts new,
   politically relevant information about the network structure
   inaccessible to alternative approaches, and has superior predictive
   performance.},

   Question, we asked more than 300 students to `draw Cyprus' and surveyed
   their political attitudes, as well as their identities and preferences

   students, in comparison with the students from Turkey and from the other
   countries, are more supportive of a decentralized federative structure,
   identify themselves with the Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot identities, and
   more willing to embrace a consociational approach to the Cyprus

Abstract = {The federal government's power has been an issue in American politics
   throughout the history of the United States. How the public views this
   issue is affected by the dimension of the government's power in
   question. On the general question of government power, a majority is
   wary of big government, and this percentage has been increasing in
   recent years. When the aspect of providing services is included,
   however, public opinion is more evenly divided, with slightly more
   people believing that the government should be providing more services
   than feeling that the government is already doing too much. On the
   personal dimension-that is, whether the federal government controls too
   much of daily life-a significant majority of Americans has consistently
   expressed a wariness of Washington. The public's views on the power of
   the federal government are complex, and this issue will continue to be
   at the center of divisions in American politics.},

Abstract = {The point is that for a constitution to last, it has to be one that is
   accepted from diverse groups in the community and that these same groups
   wish it to survive.(1)
   Our constitution was created under difficult circumstances. It was not
   the result of discussions that took place within a constituted assembly
   created for such a purpose. As a result it lacked that element of
   compromise which brings with it the consensus of all those who had
   participated or at least the majority of them.(2)
   The constitution had been imposed... it had arrested the development of
   the Republic {[}and]. . . placed it in a straitjacket . . . it was
   unworkable and grossly unfair {[}and] suffered from a fundamental defect
   that its basic articles could not be amended. Such a provision did not
   have legal value because a present constituent power had no right to
   restrict the constituent power of the future. . . it was also to ignore
   reality and deny progress.(3)},

Abstract = {The term civic nationalism' as it is used today in nationalism studies
   is misleading because it combines territorial collective identity with
   liberal-democratic values. As such, for example, it does not provide
   much insight into the comparison of Azerbaijani and Georgian concepts of
   national identity. Azerbaijan, arguably an authoritarian country, has
   used unconditional citizenship by birth on territory (jus soli) and
   refused to naturalize Azeri co-ethnics from Georgia. Georgia, seemingly
   a developed liberal democracy, hasn't practiced any jus soli, has
   bestowed citizenship on Georgian co-ethnics abroad and refused it to its
   ethnic minorities. These two cases testify to the need to revise the
   term civic nationalism', inapplicable to many, especially non-Western,
   empirical cases of national identity. By establishing distinct
   historical narratives based on premodernist sources, the article argues
   that the ethnic/territorial tension is premodern, which explains why
   civic nationalism has a premodern (territoriality) and a modern
   (liberal-democratic values) component. Territorial collective identity,
   in its contrast to an ethnic one, has deep historical roots and needs to
   be separated from the overall umbrella of civic nationalism. Such an
   approach resolves many current theoretical objections to ethnic/civic
   dichotomy, a ubiquitous, but still insufficiently understood, heuristic
   tool.},

Abstract = {The Umbrella Movement (Sept-Dec 2014) represented a watershed for Hong
   Kong's political culture and self-understanding. Based on over 1000
   slogans and other textual and visual material documented during the
   movement, this study provides an overview of its claims. The slogans
   mobilize a diversity of cultural and historical repertoires that attest
   to the hybrid quality of Hong Kong identity and underscore the diversity
   of sources of political legitimacy. Finally, it is argued that by
   establishing a system of contending discourses within the occupied
   public spaces, the movement strived to act out a type of discursive
   democracy, which represents an unfinished attempt to build a new civic
   culture among Hong Kong's younger generation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the patterns of parliamentary change observed
   in Myanmar since a constitutionally sanctioned, partially elected
   legislature was revived in January 2011. In particular, it poses the
   question as to whether processes of legislative institutionalisation
   have taken place in the course of the 2010s. Grounded on ethnographic
   work carried out between 2013 and 2018 in Myanmar's Union parliament,
   established in Naypyitaw, the article explores how in the two post-junta
   legislatures elected in 2010 and 2015 a number of institutional legacies
   and parliamentary procedures and functions have been both reintroduced
   and also reappropriated. The findings point to emerging patterns of
   routinisation of some legislative tasks and duties performed by neophyte
   lawmakers and parliamentary staff alike. It is argued that, despite
   persistent capacity and efficiency problems, and a continuing dominance
   of the executive and the armed forces in the postjunta context, a
   parliamentary culture has re-emerged in Myanmar. The article concludes
   by drawing attention to how a process of legislative
   institutionalisation has been developed, albeit cursorily.},

Abstract = {While assuming, as a starting point, that communities in Lebanon are
   `spaces' where various techniques of domination and control are
   reproduced to prevent their members from questioning the religious,
   identitarian or political hegemony, in this paper we argue that the
   Maronite community's resizing process has created in-between border
   spaces within this community, where new discourses aimed at questioning
   this system of control arise. To justify this in-between border spaces'
   relevance to understanding discourses of dissent, the analytical
   category of liminality will be explored. This will help answer the
   questions of why counter-hegemonic discourses arise in marginal spaces
   and how these spaces become liminal. We contend that the manifest
   incapacity of the Maronite elites with regard to bordering and ordering
   the `margins' of their own community is weakening the elites' (political
   and religious) control over these new spaces: they became `arenas' where
   dissent potentially coagulates and new social realities free from the
   community control system can emerge.},

Abstract = {Islamophobia in Eastern Germany and in East Central Europe has very
   similar characteristics to Islamophobia in Western Europe and the USA.
   The difference, of degree rather than kind, is in the success of
   Islamophobia as a political instrument. This is somewhat more pronounced
   in the East of Germany and of the European Union as a whole. It is a
   mistake to attribute this difference mainly to the alleged authoritarian
   heritage of ?Eastern Europe?. Much of the postsocialist public as a
   whole has characteristics similar to specific populations in the West
   who have been shown to be particularly prone to Islamophobic populism.
   These include precariously employed white working and lower-middle-class
   workers and rural residents. What East and West have in common is that
   they have both felt the negative impact of neoliberal policies, which
   have weakened social safety nets and made jobs more precarious. That
   impact was stronger in the postsocialist East, including eastern
   Germany, and that goes a long way towards explaining the greater degree
   of Islamophobia there.},

Abstract = {In many developing countries with weak formal institutions, the
   protection of state actors is essential for organized criminal
   activities and illicit markets to emerge and thrive. This article
   examines the relationship between the state's regulation of drug
   trafficking and its associated violence in highly fragmented markets. It
   argues that political competition influences coordination among the
   police, generating different types of regulatory regimes. Police with
   greater coordination implement protection rackets that curb violence;
   uncoordinated police carry out particularistic negotiations with drug
   traffickers that exacerbate criminal violence. This argument is
   illustrated with a subnational comparison of two Argentine provinces
   that experienced a similar drug market expansion with different patterns
   of violence. These cases show how corrupt states can obtain relative
   order in highly fragmented drug markets, and illustrate police influence
   in shaping the evolution of drug dealing in metropolitan areas.},

Abstract = {Bosnia and Herzegovina's first post-war population census, held in 2013,
   was accompanied by campaigns associated with each of the country's three
   main ethnic groups, which sought to maximise their share of the recorded
   population. These campaigns were challenged by a rival `civic' campaign
   that instead stressed the right to freedom of self-identification,
   however. This article compares the aims, methods and framings used by
   this civic campaign with those of the most prominent of the `ethnic'
   campaigns - that of Bosniak ethnic entrepreneurs. It demonstrates that
   the two campaigns were each motivated by a combination of symbolic
   motives, centred on recognition and highlighting discrimination, and
   instrumental motives relating to the country's power-sharing
   institutions. The limited success of the civic campaign in countering
   the messages of its rival ethnic campaigns demonstrates the difficulties
   that civic movements face in mobilising citizens in consociational
   democracies such as BiH.},

Abstract = {Surveys generally overestimate the overall level of voter turnout in
   elections due to both the misreporting of voting and nonresponse. It is
   sometimes argued that socioeconomic differences in turnout are
   exaggerated in surveys because social desirability has a more pronounced
   effect on eligible voters in more advantaged socioeconomic positions.
   However, the contribution of nonresponse bias has not been taken into
   consideration in these assessments. Using a register-linked survey with
   information on the education, occupational social class, income, and
   voting in the 2015 Finnish parliamentary elections of both respondents
   and nonrespondents, this study shows that nonresponse bias leads to not
   only a larger overestimation of the overall level of turnout than social
   desirability, but also an underestimation of educational, social class,
   and income-related differences in the propensity to vote. Socioeconomic
   differences in the probability of voting in register-based data were at
   least two-thirds larger than differences obtained when using standard
   survey techniques. This finding implies that socioeconomic inequality in
   electoral participation is a more pressing social problem than previous
   evidence might indicate.},

Abstract = {Complex models are of increasing interest to social scientists.
   Researchers interested in prediction generally favor flexible, robust
   approaches, while those interested in causation are often interested in
   modeling nuanced treatment structures and confounding relationships.
   Unfortunately, estimators of complex models often scale poorly,
   especially if they seek to maintain interpretability. In this paper, we
   present an example of such a conundrum and show how optimization can
   alleviate the worst of these concerns. Specifically, we introduce
   bigKRLS, which offers a variety of statistical and computational
   improvements to the Hainmueller and Hazlett (2013) Kernel-Regularized
   Least Squares (KRLS) approach. As part of our improvements, we decrease
   the estimator's single-core runtime by 50\% and reduce the estimator's
   peak memory usage by an order of magnitude. We also improve uncertainty
   estimates for the model's average marginal effect estimates which we
   test both in simulation and in practice and introduce new visual and
   statistical tools designed to assist with inference under the model. We
   further demonstrate the value of our improvements through an analysis of
   the 2016 presidential election, an analysis that would have been
   impractical or even infeasible for many users with existing software.},

Title = {How to Build and Wield Business Power: The Political Economy of Pension

Abstract = {What explains the remarkable resilience of pension regulation in
   postauthoritarian Chile, even after decades of majoritarian voter
   discontent and growing international and domestic criticism of
   Pinochet's pioneering private capitalization system? This puzzling
   outcome can be understood only by looking at the combined effect of the
   pension industry's long-term power-building investments and its
   short-term political actions to outmaneuver state and societal
   challengers. Engaging new theoretical developments in political economy
   and historical institutionalism, this study examines the long-term
   process by which the previously nonexistent Chilean pension industry
   expanded and leveraged its power during key episodes of open
   contestation. The analysis of pension regulation in Chile between the
   1980s and the 2010s illustrates the importance of placing business power
   in time, motivating new rounds of theory building in the quest to
   address the perennial question of how business gets what it wants in the
   political arena.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the Umbrella Movement in 2014 followed decades of
   futility in the democracy movement. Years of conventional protests and
   bargaining had failed to bring about full democracy for Hong Kong. The
   rise of a new political identity and trends of radicalization in social
   and political movements fuelled the massive civil disobedience campaign.
   With Beijing handing down an election formula that allowed popular
   elections only after a Beijing-controlled committee screened the
   candidates, the opposition was prepared to launch an occupation
   campaign. Police violence then triggered the spontaneous participation
   of the masses, culminating in the 79-day occupation that signified a new
   stage of contentious movements for Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to analyse these tensions and investigate the
   importance of the local political context with regard to the ability of
   local civil society organisations to influence local politicians and
   local public administrators. This paper contributes new knowledge on the
   question of what types of relational and contextual factors affect the
   outcome of attempts to exert influence in local communities. The study
   investigates whether the connectedness of organisations and the local
   political context matter. This study uses data from a national survey
   distributed to a random sample of 740 voluntary associations around
   Sweden. The survey focused on local civil societies' attempts to
   influence Swedish decision-makers and public policy at a local level.
   The present study uses this data to addresses the possibility of a
   mutual relationship between civil society organisations and local
   political organisations and test whether contextual factors, such as the
   longevity of the current political majority, have any impact on the
   ability of civil society organisations to exert political influence. The
   results indicate that civil society organisations that have ongoing
   cooperative relationships with local governments seem to also have a
   more privileged position in terms of influencing both local civil
   servants and local politicians. The results also indicate that those
   local politicians that operate in municipalities that are governed by
   broad coalitions tend to be less responsive.},

Abstract = {We study the effect of a Portuguese structural reform, which reduced the
   number of parishes, on municipality spending efficiency between 2011 and
   2016. We build a composite output indicator and use Data Envelopment
   Analysis (DEA) to compute efficiency scores. Then, we use a second-stage
   regression to evaluate the effect of the reform on municipal efficiency
   after controlling for socio-demographic, political and economic factors.
   Overall, we find efficiency gains in approximately 10\% of
   municipalities. In some regions (e.g., Alentejo and Centro), more than
   50\% of the municipalities improved efficiency. The second-stage results
   show that the structural reform did not improve local spending
   efficiency in Mainland Portugal, particularly in the Centro, Lisbon and
   Vale do Tejo regions.},

Abstract = {This paper tests whether the improvement of democratic local governance
   (DLG) positively impacts local economic development (LED). Based on a
   nationally representative citizen perception survey of 3,024 households
   across 56 Union Parishads (UPs) in Bangladesh, the results suggest that,
   although the UP governance program (UPGP) has improved the
   administrative governance of UPs, functional governance involving
   citizens remains weak. Thus, due to partial improvement of DLG, UPGP
   does not appear to have a significant impact on the overall local
   economic development and service delivery of UPs. A significant gap can
   be seen to exist between the claims of UPs and the perceptions of
   citizens around UPs' governance performance, which may result from the
   poor awareness building structures of the UPGP. However, our results
   suggest that providing training to UP officials can partially offset the
   shortfalls of DLG in its pursuit of LED.},

Abstract = {Utilising Oates' fiscal federalism theorem, the Tiebout model and
   Berry's common pool model, this paper examines the effects of four
   characteristics of a macro level governing structure on public sector
   employment using a mixed method approach. Regression analysis explores
   the individual effect of fiscal decentralisation, spatial fragmentation,
   interjurisdictional competition and jurisdictional overlap on the levels
   of local public employment; and the qualitative comparative analysis
   explores the complexities between the four macro characteristics and
   their combined relations to the levels of state public employment. The
   results of the statistical analysis suggest that more labour inputs are
   required to produce public goods and services to meet the needs of local
   residents. Moreover, the qualitative comparative analysis reveals
   causality asymmetry between these characteristics and highlights how
   different interactions of characteristics of a macro level governing
   structure affect different levels of public sector employment.},

Abstract = {Can public administrators use community education interventions in
   disaster management? We examine community education interventions as
   tools that raise awareness of hazards, communicate risks, and develop
   resilience in communities. We study a programme in Essex County, UK, in
   which Essex County Fire and Rescue Services used the results of
   proportional hazards modelling to identify localities at risk of
   accidental dwelling fires and to target community education
   interventions. We then assess the intervention's impact by comparing the
   incidence of accidental dwelling fires before and after the Parish
   Safety Volunteer programme began, as well as between treated and
   untreated areas, in a difference-in-difference regression. We find that
   there are greater reductions in accidental dwelling fires in treated
   areas than in untreated areas, and argue that community education
   interventions can forge vital networks and increase safety for
   vulnerable people, as well as build trust and resilience important for
   disaster and crisis prevention.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on ideological constructions of contemporary
   nationalism shaped by the influence of Dmitrii Galkovskii. At the dawn
   of the Russian Internet, Galkovskii's website, Samizdat, became the
   birthplace for intellectuals of contemporary Russian nationalism who
   emerged around Voprosy natsionalizma magazine and the online magazine
   Sputnik i Pogrom. Enemification strategies described in this article are
   understood as forms of self-representation of contemporary Russian
   nationalism. The goal of this article is to characterize one of the
   ideologies of contemporary Russian nationalism, which serves as a moral
   justification for some odious manifestations-xenophobia and racism.
   Three forces are characterized by contemporary Russian nationalists as
   the most dangerous challenges for the nation: the West, internal
   enemies, and migrants. Traditional and fundamental anti-Western rhetoric
   has turned into Anglophobia in the ideology of contemporary Russian
   nationalism. The most profound evidence might be found in Galkovskii's
   conception of the history of international relations. This idea is also
   used when defining the internal enemy. Caucasians have taken the place
   of Russian nationalism's previous main internal enemies, Jews, and are
   treated as representatives of the British colonial administration. The
   third enemy of modern Russian nationalism is migrants. They are seen as
   tools of the degradation policy toward Russians.},

Abstract = {Using data on 75 big Italian municipalities between 2010 and 2015, this
   paper looks at the extent to which citizens' evaluations of mayors are
   responsive to changes in local performance indicators. While local
   economic and crime measures are found not be associated with mayoral
   approval ratings, there is a correlation between mayors' popularity and
   indicators for local public transportation and air quality. Mayors of
   municipalities where more individuals use public transport and where
   there is less polluted air enjoy higher approval ratings. Additional
   analysis shows that this result is driven by very big municipalities
   (with a population over 500,000) that are more likely to be exposed to
   high levels of traffic congestion and pollution.},

Abstract = {Recent political events have forced an examination of ideologies of
   populism and nationalism in politics. In this piece, I examine
   literature on the post-2016 political context to illustrate why the rise
   of identity-based politics has surprised analysts. An understanding of
   identity-based parties requires a focus on both the forms by which they
   navigate electoral and party systems, and the content of their
   rhetorical appeals to publics. I consider the electoral and party
   systems literature, and indicate some reasons that majoritarian
   electoral systems are more likely to foster the dominance of
   identity-based politics. In such systems, large parties might become
   weaponized by extremist elements, and lack the potential for checks from
   new parties. In addition, presidential systems lack a mechanism for no
   confidence votes, and might also have weak checks on an extremist
   executive. In terms of content, populism and nationalism might draw
   differing boundaries to include or exclude perceived elites. However,
   they can otherwise align in terms of their stances against ``Others,{''}
   and against individualistic or technocratic stances that may fall under
   the label of ``liberalism.{''} Nationalism and populism are not simply
   ideologies, but can be used as strategies by elites who can successfully
   deploy these mobilizing rhetorical appeals.},

Abstract = {National pride is a group-based and sometimes collective emotion that
   people feel toward their nation-state. It is often measured by the
   general national pride item in cross-national surveys. Czechs are among
   those nations whose members express low levels of general national pride
   in comparison with those of other nations in the European Union.
   Scholars debate the extent to which general national pride is influenced
   by social desirability or other identifiable reasons. The goal of this
   article is to identify the specific reasons that influence general
   national pride in the Czech Republic. Using data from the October 2015
   round of the survey Nae spolenost, I examine what makes Czechs proud of
   their country. Among frequently mentioned reasons for national pride are
   the country's beauty, nature, cities, and history, as well as
   respondents' family and friends. Results of an ordinal regression
   analysis based on the European Values Study 2008 data confirm that
   general national pride is significantly influenced by political
   interest, confidence in government and satisfaction with the development
   of democracy, happiness, and social trust.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that, in response to economic recessions,
   governments strategically choose certain strategies to cut spending and
   increase revenues. However, little is known about the factors that
   influence their decisions to rely on certain strategies rather than
   others. To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines and
   compares the cutback strategies of local governments across the two
   recent recessions ? the ?dot-com bubble? in the early 2000s and the
   Great Recession in the late 2000s. Using general-purpose local
   governments in New York State as a sample, this study finds that local
   governments generally employ the same cutback strategies during multiple
   periods of fiscal stress, following a ?path-dependent? pattern. Based on
   this finding, we conclude that previous cutback actions play an
   important role in predicting a government?s current cutback strategies.},

   found in the private-sector workplace. One is referred to as task
   conflict and the other relational conflict. We use their insights to
   devise our own measures of conflict on local elected councils. As
   opposed to `task conflict' we use the term `policy conflict' and keep
   the same nomenclature `relational conflict.' We will contend it is
   important to not conflate the two. In this work, we test our unique
   operationalisations of conflict on an established measure of Governing
   Board Effectiveness. Because of concerns over using the same survey
   instrument to measure both explanatory variables and the dependent
   variable we also test our thesis regarding two-dimensional legislative
   conflict on entirely exogenous measures of `healthy cities.' We find
   that higher levels of policy conflict comport with good governance
   outcomes, while relational conflict provides no measurable benefit.},

Abstract = {Popular protest, which repeatedly occurred in Communist regimes, turned
   into massive mobilizational waves in the late Communist period. Why did
   some protests result in state cooptation and particularist nationalism
   (Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union), and others in state-society
   polarization (Poland) and protest containment (China), when these states
   shared important historical, political, and institutional legacies?
   Political regimes with origins in indigenous popularly-based
   revolutionary movements are more resilient to popular protests and other
   major crises than other authoritarian regimes. Protracted ideological
   armed struggle largely overlaps with broader patriotic causes, such as
   liberation wars or struggles against foreign intervention. The
   revolutionary regimes thus acquire patriotic credentials, while
   boundaries between partisan and patriotic identities become blurred,
   which strengthens their elite unity and popular base. Popular protests
   thus facilitate a complex political game of old and new actors that may
   result in regime survival or transformation. In other regimes, popular
   unrest tends to produce state-society polarization and, ultimately,
   regime delegitimation and breakdown. Popular contention in complex
   multinational institutional settings, if there is no major external
   threat, highlights old and triggers new conflicts along these structural
   and institutional divides and, where dual political identities prevail,
   facilitates identity shifts in particularist direction.},

Abstract = {The resilience of local fiscal resources is an important missing
   component of community recovery after disasters. We know little about
   how quickly or fairlybroad-basedtaxable economic activities return to
   pre-disasterlevels. For example, property tax revenue, typically heavily
   dependent on residential properties, is commonly the largest source of
   General Fund revenue for local governments in the United States. Because
   residential properties are frequently impacted by natural hazards,
   understanding the linkage between housing and fiscal resilience is
   critical. Yet there exist very few broad-basedstudies of housing
   recovery. This paper helps fill that gap by evaluating housing recovery
   in acoastal portion of the U.S.state of Mississippi after Hurricane
   Katrina. We find that while the influence on housing values of Hurricane
   Katrina's flood and wind damage dwindled over time, race and income
   remained salient factors in the level of recovery of single-familyhomes
   and their taxable values.},

Abstract = {Colonial relations are seldom discussed in terms of peacebuilding. Yet,
   dismantling colonial relations requires comprehensive processes,
   approaches and stages that transform the relations toward more
   sustainable, peaceful, relations. Nations do not always want to
   recognize colonial relations and the existence of the indigenous
   populations at the core of the nation and, thereby, long-term
   peacbuilding is impossible. This chapter discusses the nexus of colonial
   violence and peacebuilding through the example of Finnish-Sami settler
   colonial relations. Violence that functions though the indigenous bodies
   render the bodies mute as violence embedded in these relations is
   structural, slow as well as epistemic. The chapter continues the
   discussion on the preconditions of the political and peacebuilding
   started in the previous chapter.},

Abstract = {The aspirations of religious minorities in Iraq for becoming recognized
   ethnonationalist entities have rarely been investigated from a
   historical perspective, particularly in the case of the Yazidis. This
   article addresses changing attitudes about the Yazidi religious minority
   identity across different historical periods. Yazidi identity is
   examined as an ancillary undercurrent to the ethnonationalist identity
   conflict between the central government of Iraq and the Kurdish
   movement. This contrasts with identity as a religious minority in prior
   eras, when religious minorities preserved their distinct core identities
   based on their own social and religious customs and idiosyncrasies,
   making them self-defining communities bound together by coherent
   religious identities. In the case of the Yazidi minority, despite the
   multiplicity of theories and hypotheses about the origins of the Yazidi
   people and their national and ethnic affiliations and increasing rumors
   about Yazidis related to their existence as a potential sub-ethnicity or
   ethno-religion, the important truth is that Yazidis consider themselves
   religiously, culturally, and historically distinct from other
   ethnonationalist groups and communities in Iraq.},

Abstract = {This article critically reexamines how Germans understood Polish
   national identity during World War I, and how their perceptions affected
   German proposals for ruling Polish territory. Recent historiography has
   emphasized the impact of colonial ideologies and experiences on Germans'
   imperial ambitions in Poland. It has portrayed Germans as viewing Poland
   through a colonial lens, or favoring colonial methods to rule over
   Polish space. Using the wartime publications of prominent left liberal,
   Catholic, and conservative thinkers, this article demonstrates that many
   influential Germans, even those who supported colonialism in Africa,
   considered Poland to be a civilized nation for which colonial strategies
   of rule would be wholly inappropriate. These thinkers instead proposed
   multinational strategies of imperialism in Poland, which relied on
   collaboration with Polish nationalists. Specifically, they argued that
   Berlin should establish an autonomous Polish state, and bind it in
   permanent military and political union with the German Empire. The
   perception of Poland as a civilized nation ultimately structured
   Germany's occupation policy and objectives in Poland throughout the war,
   much more than stereotypes of Polish primitivity.},

Abstract = {This article investigates reputation reform in Norwegian and Danish
   local government and whether they have the same strategy content
   depending on the degree of administrative involvement and municipality
   size. Political and administrative actors are likely to cultivate
   different types of reputation strategies (place or organisational
   reputation), which explicitly embrace the potentially diverging
   interests cultivated by the two types of actors. We use a comparative
   design and quantitative method with an empirical ambition to explore
   local government reputation strategies in two national contexts. We find
   that local government responses to reputation reform depend on the size
   of the municipality and the type of actors involved; the larger the
   municipality, the more the administration is involved. And the more that
   administrative actors are involved, the more the strategies target
   organisational reputation. The country-specific factors do not appear to
   be the most important determinants for reputation reform strategies.},

Abstract = {Some local governments lead by doing something new or doing it earlier
   than others, and they gain a reputation as pioneers, but to what extent
   do their policy makers have leadership aspirations - the desire to make
   their local governments achieve or maintain a leadership position? To
   address this question, this study makes the first unique attempt to
   systematically investigate and measure leadership aspirations at the
   level of local government by conducting a content analysis of the
   verbatim assembly minutes of Japanese prefectures. Leadership
   aspirations remained much lower in most, but not all, of the non-capital
   prefectures than in Tokyo. Policy makers across prefectures aspired to
   lead in different areas of action and within different bounds of the
   social system. These findings prompt future investigators to study the
   antecedents and determinants of leadership aspirations at the local
   level and suggest the best areas and social systems for local
   governments to target.},

Abstract = {Ethnoregionalism in Europe is a phenomenon usually studied in the
   context of Western Europe. Still, in Central and Eastern Europe, there
   are some social and political movements that can be categorized as
   ethnoregionalist. The phenomenon started to play a role even before the
   Great War and in the interwar period, but was suppressed during the
   times of socialist regimes. It resurfaced immediately after 1989 during
   the times of transformation of political systems to fully democratic
   systems when problems of decentralization, authority, and division of
   power became openly discussed. In this article, I compare two such
   movements in the context of their political potential. The
   Moravian-Silesian movement in the Czech Republic and the Silesian
   movement in Poland have both similarities and differences, but the
   article mostly focuses on the evolution of these movements.},

Abstract = {According to the nationalisation hypothesis, it is sometimes argued that
   electoral lists competing at local elections under a national party
   label are more likely to win. Yet, in many countries, local lists are
   still much present. This article seeks to assess the attractiveness of
   local and national list labels at local elections. Following Rokkan?s
   hypothesis of the nationalisation of local politics, we test the role of
   socio-economic inequality on the success of electoral lists across local
   polities. Based on an original dataset distinguishing the labels of
   1.012 electoral lists ? be they local, mixed or national ? in the 262
   Walloon municipalities in Belgium, the multilevel regression
   demonstrates that local and mixed labels present a significant electoral
   advantage vis-?-vis national party labels. However, the article shows
   that this electoral gain decreases as economic inequalities increase:
   national labels, especially left-wing parties, attract more voters as
   inequalities rise.},

Abstract = {This study looks at the views of municipal managers in Canada about
   cutback management, using data from a national survey conducted in two
   waves: 2009 and 2015. The first period reflects the onset of the Great
   Recession, and the second its aftermath. We argue that the choice of
   cutback management strategies and tools in Canadian cities is driven by
   two concerns: taking actions that can be justified and avoiding losses
   in services. Other considerations include easy to use tools, having
   council support, and employing New Public Management practices.
   Municipal managers view increases in taxes and user fees to be very
   important. Improving in-house management practices are also very
   important. Targeted cuts, such as cuts to capital expenditures, are
   somewhat important. Cuts to human resources that involve large losses
   for employees and likely service reductions, are less important. Changes
   to the city's mission that reduce services and programmes are
   unimportant.},

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have long noted the importance of community
   resilience to disaster recovery and environmental risk mitigation. Yet
   we know surprisingly little about how local residents perceive the
   resilience of their local communities, including how closely their
   perceptions align with objective measures of resilience or whether these
   perceptions affect community engagement and support for resilience
   building activities and policies. In this paper, we utilise the results
   of public opinion surveys of residents of four Texas coastal shoreline
   counties (Brazoria, Nueces, Galveston, and Cameron) to address this gap
   in the literature. The results reveal that perceptions of community
   preparedness largely reflect social trust and disaster awareness while
   perceptions of recovery reflect perceived risks and preparedness.},

Abstract = {The article introduces the concept of ``milletic secularism{''} which
   invokes the Ottoman millet system to refer to divergent and competing
   transnational collective identities, loyalties, and frames of reference
   coexisting within the same nation-state. These identities are
   conceptualized as resembling the way religious communities functioned
   under the Ottoman millet system but in a reverse, upended way, as today
   Muslims are the minority in a pluralist society and secular state
   governed on the basis of non-Muslim procedures and values symbolically
   overarched by Orthodox Christianity. Foregrounding the case of Bulgaria,
   the article highlights the role of the Ottoman legacy vis-a-vis Orthodox
   Christian heritage for the accommodation of diversity. Milletic
   secularism draws on the implicit social knowledge that evokes differing
   antecedents and values underlying the shared identities of Christians
   and Muslims. Since the 1990s, after half a century dominated by the
   ``secular religion{''} of Communism, the intersection of religion and
   politics in Bulgaria is reshaped by the reemergence of religion as a
   structural force. Milletic secularism has both integrative and
   emancipatory potential, fostered and challenged today by a variety of
   factors. Among them, this article foregrounds the increasingly
   transnational Sunni Muslim identity and the ongoing re-Islamization in
   the form of Hanafism and Salafism.},

Abstract = {This article examines the novel Final Respects by Abdi-Jamil Nurpeisov
   from a postcolonial ecocritical perspective. Nurpeisov was one of the
   first Kazakh writers to discuss the decolonization of the environment
   and the ``process of self-apprehension{''} by writing about the tragedy
   of the Aral Sea, power relations between the center and periphery, and
   the interconnectivity of humans and the environment in the Soviet Union.
   Through the prism of a small fishing village, he shows the tragedy of a
   nation that has an impact on the entire world. The novel is thus a
   critique of anthropocentric policies imposed by Moscow on Kazakhstan and
   other Soviet republics. Throughout the text, Nurpeisov reiterates the
   connection between the local and the global on one hand, and human
   culture and the environment on the other.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes different ways Russian speakers residing in
   Petropavlovsk, a city in northern Kazakhstan close to the border with
   Russia, make sense of the place they inhabit and form a sense of
   belonging to it. Politically and geographically speaking, Petropavlovsk
   serves as a contested area divided between Russian and Kazakhstani
   nation-building projects. While keeping in mind the antagonistic
   politics of both states, this research rather focuses on the everyday
   practices and personal narratives of Russian speakers living in this
   area. With the help of empirical material collected during the
   interviews and dwelling alongside the participants, this article
   demonstrates how through symbolic practices and everyday life
   experiences Russian speakers differently construct their understanding
   of Petropavlovsk as a Russian, Kazakh, and global space simultaneously.},

Abstract = {While many central governments amalgamate municipalities, mergers of
   larger county administrations are rare and hardly explored. In this
   article, we assess both fiscal and political effects of county mergers
   in two different institutional settings: counties act autonomously as
   upper-level local governments (Germany), or counties being decentralised
   branches of the state government (Austria). We apply
   difference-in-differences estimations to county merger reforms in each
   country. In both cases, some counties were amalgamated while others
   remain untouched. Austrian counties (Bezirke) and German counties
   (Landkreise) widely differ in terms of autonomy and institutions, but
   our results are strikingly similar. In both cases, we neither find
   evidence for cost savings nor for staff reductions. Instead, voter
   turnout consistently decreases in merged counties, and right-wing
   populists seem to gain additional support. We conclude that political
   costs clearly outweigh fiscal null benefits of county merger reforms -
   independent of the underlying institutional setting.},

Abstract = {During the last couple of decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of
   the project as an organizational solution in sectors as diverse as IT,
   housing, social services, education and culture. Despite a growing
   interest in the phenomenon, we know surprisingly little of how processes
   of public sector projectification unfold in practice, especially at
   local government level. This article uses an institutional logic
   perspective to illustrate and argue that public sector projectification
   can be understood and conceptualized as the enactment of multiple,
   co-existing institutional logics, but where one particular logic is of
   growing importance - the project logic. It is argued that even though
   the project form is often perceived as more flexible than that of the
   bureaucracy, the practical outcome seldom represents a radical break
   with traditional, bureaucratic management models. Rather, it appears to
   aid a rediscovery and reuse of central bureaucratic practices and
   procedures such as reporting, documentation and standardization.},

Abstract = {Territorial reform is the most radical and contested reorganisation of
   local government. A sound evaluation of the outcome of such reforms is
   hence an important step to ensure the legitimation of any decision on
   the subject. However, in our view the discourse on the subject appears
   to be one sided, focusing primarily on overall fiscal effects
   scrutinised by economists. The contribution of this paper is hence
   threefold: Firstly, we provide an overview off territorial reforms in
   Europe, with a special focus on Eastern Germany as a promising case for
   cross-country comparisons. Secondly, we provide an overview of the
   analytical classifications of these reforms and context factors to be
   considered in their evaluation. And thirdly, we analyse the literature
   on qualitative performance effects of these reforms. The results show
   that territorial reforms have a significant positive impact on
   functional performance, while the effects on participation and
   integration are indeed ambivalent. In doing so, we provide substantial
   arguments for a broader, more inclusive discussion on the success of
   territorial reforms.},

Title = {Strengthening the local representative system: the importance of
   electoral and non-electoral representation},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {196-218},
Abstract = {Local democracy has increasingly faced problems such as declining voter
   turnout and decreasing trust in political parties. Certain forms of
   participatory democracy have been introduced to address political
   disengagement. Often these efforts do not deliver the envisaged results,
   as they exacerbate existing inequalities by attracting only certain
   groups of citizens. This paper takes a close look at representation to
   find out if and how it can strengthen local democracy. Non-electoral
   representation, as manifested by representative claims based on
   non-electoral grounds, such as identity and expertise, made by local
   councillors, as well as non-elected individuals and organisations, might
   serve to mitigate democratic problems. We empirically study
   manifestations of electoral and non-electoral representation and their
   interactions. We conclude that non-electoral representation can
   strengthen local democracy, but its relationship with electoral
   representation can also be problematic. We make suggestions as to how
   these problems might be overcome in an effort to strengthen the local
   representative system.},

Abstract = {The chapter elaborates how people experience war, conflict and
   peacebuilding as felt and corporeal. It highlights that focusing on the
   relational and sensing body it is possible to study war and
   peacebuilding in ways that challenge the prevailing and normalized
   assumptions about conflict and peacebuilding agency, namely the belief
   that agency resides solely either in institutionalized politics or is
   constituted through overt violence. The chapter derives from the
   narratives of two eldery women who have experienced the Second World War
   and it underscores the line where the body intersects with politics. As
   the line is under constant negotiation, it opens up also alternative
   political horizons for peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {This paper picks up a theme from the recent literature on the
   councillor, that of time spent in meeting, and suggests that if we are
   to understand the role of the councillor we must understand the work the
   meeting does. The discussion is based in a series of empirical studies
   and uses interactionist precepts to identify and explore the dynamics of
   the informal encounter, the more formal meeting and its associated
   paperwork, and the special if ambiguous function of meetings about
   meetings. It draws on recent institutionalist theorising to describe how
   the routines and processes of meeting must be inhabited and enacted in
   practice, positioning them in Arendt?s sense of politics as action and
   interaction. In concluding, it considers how future research might
   explore the ways that meetings are separated from the world to which
   they refer, and how different meetings and kinds of meeting are
   articulated one with another.},

   Georgia were under tsarist imperial rule (albeit the two poets lived in
   different periods of Russian imperial history). Through their major
   works, each called for their communities to awaken and revolt against
   oppression, rejected social apathy caused by tsarist subjugation, and
   raised awareness about the historical past of their nations. By
   comparing the works and activities of the two poets and examining their
   impact on national mobilization in tsarist Ukraine and Georgia, this
   article argues that (lyric) poetry rather than prose (novel) constituted
   the agency of common national imagining. It was lyric and not epic
   poetry or novel, this article shows, that laid the foundation of
   nationalist mobilization as it framed the revolt of the ``I{''} against
   colonialism as a revolt of the ``I{''} against an oppressive society
   under which the cultural grounds for common imagining had been
   constructed.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyse whether illegal (corruption) and legal rent
   extraction (high politicians' wages) affect electoral outcomes at
   municipal level. We use an initial sample of 145 Spanish municipalities
   over 50,000 for two electoral periods: 2004-2007 (before the crisis) and
   2008-2011 (during the crisis). Our findings show that neither illegal
   nor legal rent extraction impact on re-election in non-crisis times.
   However, we observe that citizens penalize legal rent extraction in the
   ballots during the crisis. Regarding the economic performance of the
   local governments, we find that its effect on re-election is important
   in non-crisis period. Nevertheless, in time of crisis, given that the
   economic situation is bad in general in the country, voters pay less
   attention to economic factors and focus on politicians' behaviour.},

Abstract = {In the Soviet Union theatre was an arena for cultural transformation.
   This article focuses on theatre director Les Kurbas' 1929 production of
   playwright Mykola Kulish's Myna Mazailo, a dark comedy about
   Ukrainianization, to show the construction of Soviet Ukrainian culture.
   While the Ukrainian and the Soviet are often considered in opposition,
   this article takes the culture of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist
   Republic seriously as a category. Well before Stalin's infamous adage
   national in form and socialist in content, artists like Kulish and
   Kurbas were engaged in making art that was not Ukrainian in a generic
   Soviet mold, or Soviet art in a generic Ukrainian mold, but rather art
   of an entirely new category: Soviet Ukrainian. Far from a mere
   mouthpiece for state propaganda, early Soviet theatre offered a space
   for creating new values, social hierarchies, and worldviews. More
   broadly, this article argues that Soviet nationality policy was not only
   imposed from above, but also worked out on the stages of the republic by
   artists, officials, and audiences alike. Tracing productions of Myna
   Mazailo into the post-Soviet period, moreover, reveals a lingering
   ambiguity over the content of culture in contemporary Ukraine. The state
   may no longer sponsor cultural construction, but theater remains a space
   of cultural contestation.},

Abstract = {In spring 1999, amidst a wider ethnic cleansing campaign, Serb police
   forces abducted Ferdonije Qerkezi's husband and four sons, who were
   never to be seen alive again. She subsequently transformed her private
   house into a memorial to the lost normalcy of her entire social world.
   We trace this memorialization process; her struggle for recognition; her
   transformation into an iconic mother of the nation and her activism,
   both for missing persons and against the internationally-driven
   Serb-Albanian normalization process in Kosovo. From a multi-disciplinary
   perspective, we critically reflect on the theoretical concept of
   ``normative divergence{''} in intervention studies. We are guided by
   social anthropological (including immersive, historical-ethnographic,
   and semantic) analysis of the core tropes of social memory as both
   narratively and materially embodied by the House Museum. In
   systematically juxtaposing these to the normative transitional justice
   principles of truth, justice, non-recurrence, and reparations, and the
   overarching international intervention goal of reconciliation, we
   critically interrogate normative divergence per se. The ethnographic
   ``thick description{''} of this case study-cognizant of context
   contingency, victims' agency and experience, cultural change, and social
   transformation-points to divergent meanings of these principles as
   resulting directly from the political and institutional failure to
   provide key transitional justice goals.},

   ``Fusion{''}-project grant of 15,850 pound (November 2015 to May 2016),
   enabling the co-creative exploration of the relations between
   post-conflict memory, transitional justice, and chances of conflict
   transformation through ``gaming{''} as a new educational technology, in
   collaboration between staff and students of BU, UP, and selected civil
   society organizations in Kosovo. Titled ``Conflict Transformation
   through Gamification: Developing a Storyline and Game Design,{''} the
   project included-among a series of academic knowledge exchange
   activities over the duration of the project-a one-week visit of twelve
   BU cross-faculty students and four staff to Kosovo in March 2016, when
   the visit to Ferdonije's House Museum in Gjakova, Western Kosovo, also
   took place.The wider project relied on close collaboration of BU's
   Conflict Transformation Studies team with UP's Gender Studies and
   Research Program and with forumZFD, Kosovo Program, both based in
   Prishtina, which during the March visit both offered support in kind,
   such as providing meeting venues and logistical support. forumZFD
   additionally hosted a dinner for all involved staff and students and
   funded the visit of their staff to one of the subsequent workshops in
   the UK.},

Abstract = {This study examines the support, control and strategic functions of an
   executive hospital political board from the perspective of how
   institutionalised internal procedures influence board functions. Board
   members and leading hospital managers were interviewed about
   politicians' ways of working, managers' preparation of decision issues
   and board work under the presidency model. The politicians strengthened
   the decision-making processes by requesting additional supporting
   documents, and by defending the hospital from public criticism. However,
   the board exercises weak strategic and control functions; it absorbs the
   responsibilities of the hospital managers and the upper political levels
   as it reaffirms its executive authority. Nonetheless, the study suggests
   that abolishing or replacing the board with a non-political board may
   not improve organisational governance. The study gives insights in
   politicians' contribution to strategic public management, an aspect
   lacking in existing literature.},

Title = {Indispensable, yet Invisible: Drinking water management as a local
   political issue in Swedish municipalities},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {800-819},

Abstract = {Local policy-makers' incentives to address an issue is conditioned by
   how they perceive public attention. Our study focuses on drinking water
   management at the municipal level in Sweden. Provisioning and management
   of drinking water is a responsibility of the local governments.
   Interviews with local politicians and public administrators in seven
   municipalities reveal that local policy-makers think that citizens view
   provisioning of drinking water as a taken for granted service, and also
   lack knowledge of and interest in drinking water issues. Public
   attention is further seen as a double-edged sword since engagement in
   water issues often is a result of problems with water provision. The
   findings are discussed from a theoretical perspective of the role of
   agenda-setting in public policy. It is argued that the view of
   policy-makers of citizens as unengaged negatively affects the incentives
   to bring drinking water to a prominent place on the local policy agenda.},

Abstract = {This research considered levels of public service spending according to
   the alternative service arrangements, and examined how the property tax
   cap as an external constraint, local histories, and local fiscal
   capacity are related to the spending in the context of the state of New
   York. This study provides empirical evidence that the property tax cap
   positively influenced local spending through contracting out, while the
   same variable negatively affected the spending through intermunicipal
   contracting. Second, the previous level of public spending was
   positively associated with the current level of public spending through
   contracts with other municipalities, but this is not the case for
   contracts with nongovernmental providers. In addition, in deciding the
   extent of public spending through contracting out, local government
   officials were influenced by the factors of fiscal capacity, indicated
   by budget solvency and tax revenues.},

Abstract = {This special issue builds on empirical research to provide new insights
   into the interrelations between collective memory and legacies of
   political violence in the Balkans. The contributions pay particular
   attention to two major issues: First, they explore the ways in which
   individuals and groups respond to and cope with violent pasts by
   investigating commemorative practices including public performances,
   narratives, and negotiations of counter-memories. Second, they make
   explicit how people select and reassemble collective memories through
   remembering violent pasts to create and disseminate novel forms of
   identity. Through interdisciplinary lenses, the studies reveal how the
   legacies of political violence and their lived experience become
   important means for people to create and mobilize collective memories
   that are influential enough to shape nationalistic and political
   realities on the ground. On a theoretical level, the articles
   demonstrate various ways in which collective memories enable critical
   discussions around a wider set of issues including national identity,
   nationalism, making of history, and local power games. By engaging with
   these concepts, the contributions question dominant framings of past
   events as they investigate how counter-memories and counter-powers
   emerge in the process of negotiating established versions of history,
   official narratives, and hierarchies of power.},

Abstract = {The article compares the post-Euromaidan Ukrainian politics in the
   domains of memory and language, two prominent aspects of the politics of
   identity that have been sites of controversy since the early years of
   independence. It examines the government's behavior in the two domains,
   taking into account constraints presented by opposition parties, civil
   society, foreign states and international organizations, and the
   perceived preferences of the population. In both cases, the government
   must reconcile the active minority's call for a radical break with the
   imperial legacy and the majority's preference for the preservation of
   the accustomed environment. However, the Ukrainian leadership chose very
   different courses for the two domains. While pursuing a rather radical
   nationalist agenda with regard to memory, they largely refrained from a
   resolute promotion of the Ukrainian language. This difference does not
   reflect popular preferences and rather can be explained by politicians'
   misperception of what the population wants, as well as their
   apprehension of policies that would radically change the country's
   linguistic landscape and thus their own everyday life.},

Abstract = {In his autobiographical writings, the Russian-Jewish author and the
   founder of Zionist Revisionism Vladimir Jabotinsky constructed a
   retrospective self-image, according to which ever since becoming a
   Zionist early in the 20th century he exclusively clung to a Jewish
   national identity. This one-dimensional image was adopted by the early
   historiography of the Revisionist movement in Zionism. Contrary to this
   trend, much of the recent historiography on Jabotinsky has taken a
   different direction, describing him, particularly as a young man during
   the period of his early Zionism in Tsarist Russia, as a Russian-European
   cosmopolitan intellectual. Both these polarized positions are somewhat
   unbalanced and simplistic, whereas the figure of Jabotinsky and his
   worldview that emerge from reading his rich publicist writing in late
   Tsarist Russia present a far more complex picture of interplay between
   his deep ethnic-national primordial Jewish affinity, on the one hand,
   and an array of his different attachments to his non-Jewish surroundings
   including local, cultural, and civil identities, on the other. Focusing
   on Jabotinsky's unexplored journalist writings that address the
   Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905, the article discovers a previously
   unknown identity pattern of the young Jabotinsky-his Russian state
   patriotism-and traces its relationship to his Jewish nationalism.},

Abstract = {What determines the election of mayors? The extent to which
   pre-electoral coalitions (PECs) influence mayoral election outcomes has
   not yet been subject to empirical analysis, despite the question's
   fundamental theoretical and practical relevance. This note uses
   regression discontinuity methods to identify the causal effects of PECs
   on mayoral election results in Indonesia. The study finds that
   candidates backed by PECs comprising political parties that control
   council seat shares exceeding first-round mayoral electoral vote
   thresholds are 14-18 percentage points more likely to win those
   elections than their counterparts supported by smaller-sized PECs. The
   analysis determines that PECs are especially helpful in getting
   non-incumbent candidates elected, although they have no apparent impact
   on incumbents' electoral success. PECs can assist candidates in gaining
   office, therefore, but they are established under corrupt conditions.
   Ultimately, governance issues surrounding the formation and functioning
   of PECs impose significant constraints on the development of local
   democracy in Indonesia.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {241-261},
Abstract = {The extant literature has offered two competitive implications of
   revenue diversification: revenue stabilisation and fiscal illusion.
   Stabilisation helps governments have less revenue volatility, while
   fiscal illusion expands tax burdens through the increase in expenditure.
   The competitive views on revenue diversification leave a niche to
   explore the association between revenue diversification and debt levels
   in local governments. We estimate the static and dynamic effects of
   revenue diversification on both short-term and long-term debt levels in
   150 fiscally standardised cities. Our findings show that local
   governments with greater revenue diversification are more likely to
   reduce short-term debts while expanding long-term debts. The findings
   imply that a stabilised revenue structure helps local governments better
   manage operational budgets but also invest in capital projects with
   greater debt capacity.},

Abstract = {This article is an analysis of the changing role of research on local
   governments in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) within mainstream
   European studies. It refers to dependency theory (Wallerstein, Prebish)
   as applied to scientific research. It classifies CEE as being in the
   semi-periphery of academic research. The empirical analysis consists of
   two parts: (1) qualitative review of the most important of the
   comparative studies of European local governments. It includes a
   discussion on the role of local governments and researchers from CEE in
   these studies; (2) quantitative based on an analysis of articles
   published in international journals and citations for those articles in
   Scopus. The analysis covers 14 countries (all new member states who
   joined the EU from 2004 onwards, plus the Balkan countries: Albania,
   Macedonia, and Serbia).},

Abstract = {Over recent decades, the institutions of political leadership have been
   criticised for being caught up in outdated designs that are not adapting
   to societal changes. In many western countries, this diagnosis has
   spurred design reforms aimed at strengthening political leadership at
   the local level. Based on a study of reforms in Norwegian and Danish
   municipalities, this article first develops a typology of reforms aimed
   at strengthening local political leadership. Leadership reforms are
   categorised into four types aimed at strengthening Executive,
   Collective, Collaborative, or Distributive political leadership. The
   typology is used to map the prevalence of the different types of reforms
   in the two countries. The results show that design reforms as such are
   more widespread in Danish than in Norwegian municipalities. In
   particular, reforms aimed at strengthening Distributive political
   leadership are used more extensively in Denmark than in Norway. The
   article discusses the contextual differences that may explain this
   variation.},

   the creation of new moral actors},

Abstract = {Today's political ambitions are based on the neoliberal aspiration to
   diminish the state's role and responsibilities, and to transfer those
   responsibilities to local communities and individuals in ways that
   idealise those communities, promising to `give power to the people'.
   Instead of highlighting individualism, neoliberalism now celebrates
   communities and participation. This article deals with the effects of
   this ideology with regard to Finnish rural policy objectives. Drawing on
   Finnish village action programmes as data, we argue that these
   ideological views aim to transform individuals and create new moral
   actors. Our research indicates that Finland's rural policy objectives
   invoke actors that are responsible for their communities, have an
   `enterprising spirit', and are change-friendly and innovative. However,
   the ideology disregards the economic and social preconditions and
   resources necessary for building affluent communities and villages,
   which are difficult to attain when there is less government involvement.
   Thus, rural communities face increasing demands and less government
   involvement.},

Abstract = {paper analyses a case of contract reversal in the market for ambulance
   services. The paper suggests that the sociology of markets-literature
   provides insights into market institutions of importance to relations
   between government and contractors that will benefit contracting out
   theory. Building on document analysis and interviews with 19 key
   stakeholders, it is demonstrated how a regional government in Denmark
   tried to wrestle the service provision from a long-time private provider
   and create a competitive market, only to discover that the
   implementation of the new contract was beset by obstacles largely
   stemming from informal norms in the market and attempts of the existing
   provider to hamper market entry for challenger firms. The result was a
   contract reversal: from private provision to government-provided service
   delivery. The paper contributes to the contracting out literature by
   providing a more elaborate understanding of the institutional conditions
   under which contract reversals can take place.},

Abstract = {This article examines the goals and practices of the Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs in Ukraine in the 1970s, a Soviet institution that functioned as
   an ideological organ fighting against Ukrainian nationalists
   domestically and abroad. The central figure of this article is Heorhii
   Shevel who governed the Ministry from 1970 to 1980 and whose tactics,
   strategies, and practices reveal the existence of a distinct phenomenon
   in the Soviet Union-the nationally conscious political elite with double
   loyalties who, by action or inaction, expanded the space of nationalism
   in Ukraine. This research illuminates a paradox of pervasive Soviet
   power, which produced an institution that supported and reinforced
   Soviet anti-nationalist ideology, simultaneously creating an environment
   where heterodox views or sentiments were stimulated and nurtured.},

Abstract = {Fifteen years after the 1999 NATO bombings, a number of emblematic
   buildings in Belgrade still lie in ruins and are at the center of
   debates surrounding their reconstruction. This article examines the
   collective memory and narratives of the NATO bombings through a spatial
   lens, looking at how architectural discourses of reconstruction relate
   to multiple understandings and narratives of the bombings themselves. It
   focuses on how architects in Belgrade discuss and envision the
   reconstruction of buildings such as the Generalstab in relationship to
   the collective memories of political violence and war. The article
   explores the continuum between calls for full restoration and
   memorialization, by discussing how architects relate to the bombing of
   1999 on personal and professional levels, and how narratives of the
   bombing influence architectural visions for the reconstruction itself.
   All in all, the article argues that architectural reconstruction,
   collective memory, and national identity shape each other. On the one
   hand, reconstruction responds to collective memory as architects make
   sense of the collective memory of war, on the other hand, reconstructed
   urban space reshapes memory by creating a new cadre materiel for
   remembrance.},

Abstract = {The article aims to compare the conditions of migrants from Central Asia
   into Russia with that of migrants from the Maghreb into France. Despite
   many similarities in conditions (related to the experience of social
   exclusion), there are deep differences. The precarious legal status of
   the majority of Central Asian newcomers in Russia has prevented them
   from embarking on an effective struggle for public recognition; this is
   in sharp contrast with North African newcomers in France who have been
   engaged in such struggle since the 1980s. In addition, Islam plays
   different roles in the migrants' perceptions by host societies and in
   identification of the migrants themselves. Whereas Islam has become a
   marker of overarching collective identity among the Maghreb migrants'
   descendants, this is not the case with Central Asians in Russia, for
   whom Islam remains part of their individual identity, rather than the
   basis of social consolidation and political mobilization.},

Series = {Rethinking Peace and Conflict Studies},

Abstract = {The chapter shows how the early feminist peace researchers insisted on
   the importance of the relational body and mundane when studying conflict
   resolution, peacebuilding, reconciliation and peace, and how their
   research agenda has not been actualized in the mainstream theorizing of
   peacebuilding. Although feminist peace research has received a little
   acknowledgement among mainstream peace scholars this chapter shows that
   this radical scholarship is instrumental when investigating
   peacebuilding from corporeal perspectives. The chapter introduces also
   the ``local turn{''} scholarship and argues that it is limited when it
   comes to its understanding of the ``here and now{''} everyday and
   mundane practices of peace. An alternative understanding is offered,
   emerging from Judith Butler's observation that adequate responses to
   different forms of violence require the recognition of human
   vulnerability.},

Abstract = {The leaked email accounts of Putin's aide on Ukraine, Vladislav Surkov,
   are vast primary source collections that shed light on the backstage
   happenings of the Kremlin's politics in the Donbas war. Surkov is an
   excellent dramaturg; he writes scripts, casts actors, analyzes their
   performance and narratives, runs promotions, and puts the repertoire
   into motion to achieve intended reactions of the target audience.
   Methods and resources employed against Ukraine have much in common with
   political technology that helps the Kremlin to manipulate public opinion
   as well as election systems using pseudo-experts, technical parties,
   fake civic organizations and youth movement such as Nashi, and covert
   media techniques. Moscow tactically promoted the myth of
   ``Novorossiya{''}-later the circumstances forced Surkov to replace it
   with ``Donbas.{''} These tactics gave false credibility to
   ``separatists{''} who would voice Moscow's objections to any attempts of
   Ukraine to drift westward, creating an illusion in the domestic and
   international audience. the separatists are not puppets of Moscow but
   desperately fight against Kyiv junta for their localized identity, and
   Russia is just there to offer them a helping hand. The Russian policy
   toward Ukraine after the 2013 fall is an extension of its ``virtual{''}
   domestic politics, but not traditional diplomacy at all.},

Abstract = {This article details how an increasingly educated and urban Buryat
   population became both the creators and consumers of new leisure
   activities in the late Soviet period. It argues that central and local
   authorities believed that leisure activities could help them to impress
   upon the Buryats that there were great benefits to living in the Soviet
   Union and to adopting a more pan-Soviet identity within the brotherhood
   of nations. They also presumed that leisure activities could aid in the
   building of a culture that was Buryat, Soviet, and more modern. This
   article examines why authorities assigned great importance to leisure
   and how they used and created cultural-educational institutions and mass
   media content to implement, direct, and promote cultural development. It
   analyzes various institutions such as museums, clubs, and theaters, as
   well as the production and consumption of local newspapers and

Abstract = {This article, through comparative historical analysis, examines the
   traditional marriage rituals of the Dungan diaspora in Kazakhstan.
   Dungans are Chinese-speaking Muslims who were forced to migrate to
   present-day Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan after the defeat of
   their revolt against the Qing dynasty from 1877 to 1888. The article
   focuses on the diversity of wedding ceremonies in three zones where
   Dungan settled in Kazakhstan: Zhalpak Tobe and Sortobe, two rural areas
   in the Zhambyl region; and Zaria Vostok, near the city of Almaty. I find
   that the local variations in traditional wedding ceremonies stem from
   their close intercultural and social cooperation with non-Dungan
   peoplesprimarily Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Uyghurs, and Russians. The example of
   wedding rituals shows that, while Dungan existence in another cultural
   environment has stimulated the consolidation of their ethnic group,
   preserving many of the traditional archaic cultural features, it has
   also led to the transformation of the marriage ceremonies. I address a
   much-neglected pathway-the nature of borrowed elements in Dungan wedding
   rituals-and ask why the extent of borrowing varies from community to
   community even though the Dungan arrived from China with similar
   traditions.},

Abstract = {From the early 1990s through the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, waves of armed
   conflicts in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia/Tskhinvali regions of
   Georgia forced thousands of residents, mainly ethnic Georgians, to leave
   their homes. More than two decades of protracted internal displacement,
   marked by tough economic and social problems, led this vulnerable
   community to a common trap in reckoning with the past: an overwhelming
   sense of the fundamental ruptures between the idealized past and
   current, miserable reality. Failures of the displacement policy and side
   effects of numerous humanitarian aid projects hinder internally
   displaced persons' social integration and leave them on the margins of
   Georgian society with almost a singular option: to constantly recall
   meaningful life in the lost homeland, which they remember as free of
   ethnic phobias and economic problems. In this article, we suggest that
   for persons who are internally displaced, memories are defined not only
   by their past lived experiences and present hardships, but also by the
   official historical narratives that argue that Georgian-Abkhazian and
   Georgian-Ossetian endemic unity and cohabitation was destroyed by
   Russian imperial politics. Living in constant pain also narrows the
   future expectations of the internally displaced persons. However, it is
   the past and the memories that are supposed to be useful in achieving
   the utopian dream of a return.},

Abstract = {In August 2015 the municipality of Sinj, located in the Dalmatian
   hinterland, celebrated the 300-year anniversary of a historic victory
   against the troops of the Ottoman Empire, one that is legendarily
   attributed to the divine intervention of the Virgin Mary. The Sinj
   Tourist Board launched an unprecedented campaign in organizing and
   advertising the various events - ranging from historical re-enactments,
   film and music productions, folkloristic performances, sports events,
   exhibitions, and fashion shows, to religious processions and
   conferences. Using a variety of media formats, these efforts were aimed
   at creating a new national epic, expanding the meaning of the miraculous
   battle of 1715 from a local narrative to a nation-wide symbol,
   representing Croatia in a European and global context. This article
   focuses on various theatrical re-enactments of the historic battle and
   the alleged Marian apparition, assessing the role of nostalgia and
   authenticity in contemporary living history performances. While one of
   the underlying motifs in the case of Sinj is to enhance the region's
   attraction as a tourist destination, the article also theorizes the
   re-enactment's epistemological and political claims by proposing that
   these interactive engagements with history take an active stance in
   promoting and/or re-inventing heroic olden times to advance
   socio-political conditions in the present (Gegenwartsbewaltigung).},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the simultaneous evaluation of local
   governments' standard expenditure needs together with the related level
   of standard public services proposing a new approach to fiscal
   equalisation based on quantitative methods. Standard expenditure needs
   are estimated using quantile regression, moreover robust non-parametric
   methods are employed for the computation of composite indicators of
   demand and supply factors. Data from English local authorities over the
   period 1997-2006 have been used to test the internal and external
   validity of the model.},

Abstract = {There is a large literature that seeks to evaluate municipal
   amalgamations ex post, but a relative dearth of scholarly inquiry into
   the practical political task of persuading the public to accept
   amalgamations ex ante. We address this important gap in the literature
   by conducting a rhetorical analysis to ascertain what types of arguments
   are believed to be efficacious for persuasion on amalgamation. We find
   evidence to suggest belief in the efficacy of persuading the public
   through recourse to various projected dreadful consequences,
   particularly amongst opponents of amalgamation. We conclude by
   considering some of the reasons behind the observed rhetorics and
   briefly outline one possible solution.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},

Abstract = {Local autonomy has been the subject of increasing scrutiny in recent
   decades. The many studies published, based on indicators on the macro
   level, show that local autonomy in Switzerland is comparatively high,
   although its degree varies depending on the canton, the dimension of
   autonomy and the public policy involved. Some scholars criticise this
   reductive formal approach. Therefore, this article considers the
   cantonal legal framework but also follows a bottom-up and sectoral
   approach. It analyses local autonomy through its various dimensions and
   its relationship with the choice of governance arrangements for
   delivering a public service, calling the macro results into question.
   Methodologically, it is based on interviews in 16 Swiss municipalities
   selected according to the executive councillors' perception of autonomy
   in sport and public-transport policies collected in a comprehensive
   survey. It emphasises the differences between formal, perceived and
   effective autonomy and enriches the debate on the various methodological
   approaches thereto.},

Abstract = {This paper utilises the framework of state capacity from international
   relations, including the quality of institutions, bureaucracy, and
   enforcement mechanisms, to evaluate community resiliency. We take
   aglobal perspective on the problems of disorder, crime, and social
   capital, contextualising these issues with abroader global literature of
   how communities respond to systemic stressors driven by both endogenous
   and exogenous factors, including social problems and corresponding
   policy prescriptions are defined in terms of poverty, inequality, and
   civic participation. Locally, these issues are framed as
   individual-levelproblems, such as crime and blight. Our work provides
   abridge between the international relations perspective and the local
   governance perspective. Using macro-levelglobal political research
   drawing on international relations scholarship on quality of governance,
   we examine micro-levelprocesses with Memphis, Tennessee, USA as acase
   study. Our data include reports from the Memphis 3-1-1 system alongside
   crime, weather, social capital and governance indicators.},

Abstract = {Participatory budgeting (PB) is a significant innovation in democracy
   and local development. PB provides the opportunity for citizens to
   engage in processes of deliberation and decision-making upon the
   allocation of public funds. As new critical discourse emerges
   surrounding this model of local government spending, a significant area
   warranting investigation concerns how trust, and indeed mistrust, factor
   into PB. Through an analysis of interviews with residents and Council
   staff engaged in PB processes in a county in the north of England, we
   highlight the ways in which issues of trust can impact on participation
   in these initiatives, and also strengthen relationships between voting
   delegates, project teams and local government. This paper argues that
   increasing the perceived accessibility, and reconsidering the inclusion
   of mass membership groups in PB, might help to create progressive,
   effective and trustful participation.},

Title = {Exploiting the common pool or looking to the future? A study of
   free-riding leading up to the 2007 municipal amalgamations in Denmark},

Abstract = {Municipal amalgamations can create incentives for opportunistic
   behaviour. Several fairly recent studies have examined this on
   amalgamations in Denmark and Sweden using the so-called law of 1 over n.
   However, they have yielded inconclusive results and I argue that one
   plausible explanation is a theoretical deficiency in the law, as it does
   not account for how future political representation can mitigate the
   incentive to free-ride. I examine this using large-scale amalgamations
   in Denmark in 2007. This case is quite unique as the amalgamations were
   implemented in such a manner that they constitute a quasi-experiment,
   and because an extra fiscal year was added to the election period where
   the composition of the new councils was known with certainty, while the
   municipalities retained some decision-making power. The study's findings
   are consistent with the argument that the incentive to free-ride depends
   on the decision makers' future political stake in the new, amalgamated
   municipality.},

Abstract = {In recent years, collaborative networks have been at the forefront of
   theoretical, empirical and practical research into local governance.
   Nevertheless, the managerial behaviours local managers should employ in
   order to improve the performance of these networks are unclear.
   Following scholars' examinations of governance and the complementary
   relationship between government bodies and nonprofit organisations, we
   empirically examined - so far as we know for the first time - the
   relationship between local authority managerial behaviours towards
   nonprofit organisations, and the performance of collaborative networks.
   We found that above and beyond micro- and macro-level factors, the more
   the local authority employs inclusive governance and financial support
   behaviours towards the nonprofit organisation, the higher the
   performance of the collaborative network. In addition, the more the
   local authority employs monitoring-controlling behaviours, the lower the
   performance of the collaborative network. Theoretical and practical
   implications of our findings are developed in the context of local
   governance.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines strategies used by boundary spanners to
   align the institutional logics of bureaucracy, management and networks
   in citizen-state interactions. In-depth interviews conducted within the
   Dutch municipality of Rotterdam reveal that boundary spanners use
   entrepreneurial, mediation, and hierarchical strategies to align
   institutional logics. By providing insight into the strategic toolbox of
   boundary spanners and the perceived effectiveness of these tools, this
   article enhances empirical understanding of how the interplay between
   older and newer institutional logics within public organisations takes
   shape and how boundary spanners make strategic use of hierarchy to
   overcome institutional barriers.},

Abstract = {Peacebuilding is marked by heterogenious histories and tense locations
   of political differences. How the past conflict is remembered is
   fundamental to peacebuilding as the practices of remembering war and
   violence bring forth the corporeal politics of peacebuilding. The past
   conflict is not just remembered, but it is enacted in bodies, i.e.
   corporeally remembered. During peacebuilding the stakes are high since
   it always involves a struggle who has the right to present post-conflict
   community, who has right to be visible and, in more general, who belongs
   to the community. This chapter discusses two remembering, yet resistant
   bodies through Jacques Ranciere's notion of the political. The political
   is understood her to be a struggle of logics that count the parties and
   parts of the post-conflict community.},

Abstract = {This article investigates equality policies in relation to gender
   mainstreaming in local governments, prior to the dismantling of equality
   policies in the wake of the financial crisis that began in 2008. Data
   from 198 municipalities based on the use of mainstreaming instruments
   revealed limited implementation of mainstreaming as a policy strategy.
   Similarly, a qualitative study on mainstreaming as a vision showed that
   the local level tended to reproduce supra-municipal deficits without
   offering a differential contribution. Lack of consistency was also
   observed between the role assigned to local entities by supra-municipal
   authorities and the role they actually played. Important influencing
   factors included the gender of the mayor, political colour of the local
   government, existence of a separate equality council, and adoption of an
   equality plan. The study concludes with recommendations for redefining
   local gender mainstreaming in a post-crisis scenario.},

Abstract = {This article examines an ideological and a narrative rift between two
   elitist formations and two forms of nationalism that a practice of
   memory-making embodies. In the subterranean polemic where Soviet
   generation intelligentsia and liberal intellectuals animate the past on
   Russian-Georgian relations in two distinct ways, past becomes a critical
   terrain where the struggle over Georgia's geopolitical belonging and the
   resulting disputes on national identity take place. This analysis not
   only flashes out recent discursive rifts, linking them to the broader
   political processes, but traces the genealogies of the narrative
   practices that enable two idioms of nationalist discourse. It is both an
   analysis of post-socialist class formations and of the semantic fields
   within which their idioms are embedded.},

Abstract = {The recent occurrence of several large-scale crises, such as the
   Wenchuan and Yaan earthquakes, the Gansu mudslides, the Tianjin port
   blast, and the Funing tornado, has led decision makers in China to
   increasingly recognise the need to engage non-government organizations
   (NGOs) in responding to crises. In this study, we establish a framework
   to analyse collaboration between government and NGOs during crises. This
   framework consists of four levels for cross-sector collaboration, and
   six conditions explaining them. The framework is used to analyse a case
   study on collaboration between local government and NGOs during the
   Funing tornado. Collaboration occurred at the information sharing and
   action coordination levels. We conclude the formal collaboration between
   government and NGOs in this case was still limited and it was not based
   on negotiations and interactions. Instead, it was essentially
   hierarchical and control-oriented. This type of collaboration might have
   the advantage of responding to crises in an effective way, but it comes
   at the cost of trust, commitment and reciprocity.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the ways in which the spread and the overwhelming
   popularity of Turkish television series in Southeastern Europe influence
   the change in perception of Turks and Turkey, as well as how the serials
   are transforming the image of the Balkans and the Ottoman legacy in
   Turkey. Television serials significantly contributed to the shifting
   popular image of the ``other,{''} and initiated interactions
   unimaginable even a decade ago. These exchanges are both following and
   encouraging the breakdown of geohistorical boundaries that were set by
   the nationalist narratives in these regions at the turn of the 20th
   century, toward a more nuanced understanding of a shared past and a
   postnational future.},

Abstract = {The analysis of how weather conditions influence participation at the
   ballot and whether bad weather influences ballot decisions has recently
   gained momentum. This paper analyses the influence of rain on
   participation in the Landsgemeinde - the main decision-making body of
   two Swiss cantons, wherein citizens meet on the main square in order to
   debate and decide bindingly on political matters of all sorts. We rely
   on a survey with an in-built conjoint experiment that presents citizens
   with several hypothetical Landsgemeinde situations characterized by
   randomly varied combinations of weather and other conditions such as
   outcome favorability, the expected closeness of the vote and the company
   available during the event. We find that rain not only decreases overall
   participation but it also lowers participation when votes are expected
   to be uncontested and for individuals who do not primarily attend the
   Landsgemeinde for political reasons.},

Abstract = {Moving the focus away from the epicenters of the antibureaucratic
   revolution, this article looks at the echoes of this movement in the
   provincial, multinational, working-class community of Priboj, Serbia. A
   microstudy of Fabrika automobila Priboj, the town's largest employer,
   and its surrounding community through records of self-management and
   party meetings and through the local press reveals some of the
   less-researched aspects of the social mobilizations in Serbia in the
   late 1980s. Without downplaying the spread of national grievances, this
   study highlights parallel phenomena taking place on the ground, such as
   labor solidarity, growing socioeconomic grievances, and the
   participation of non-Serb (in this case, Muslim) populations. The
   argument is that the presence of a large factory with a multinational
   workforce in the center of the municipality as the organizational core
   of the mobilizations and their focus on local problems helped Priboj's
   antibureaucratic bevolution resemble the proletarian, pro-Yugoslav image
   that the leadership of the Serbian party often hoped to project.},

Abstract = {Many influential theorists of nationalism see war as a social conflict
   that to a great extent homogenizes and unifies the nation. Nowhere is
   that unity more clearly expressed than in war memorials and cemeteries.
   This article considers the examples of Britain and the USA during the
   aftermath of World War I in order to examine how the state legitimized
   its ownership of the bodies of its dead soldiers. It argues first that
   in an internal dispute, when all sides share a normative ideology,
   nationalism cannot offer an effective basis for legitimacy. Second, it
   shows that during the aftermath of World War I, the bodies of dead
   soldiers were not symbols. This article concludes that in order to
   transform a dead body into a symbol, the body first has to be
   ``de-individualized.{''}},

Abstract = {Resilience has become an important concept in the fields of emergency
   and disaster management. Despite the increased use of resilience in the
   academic and public policy arenas, the intellectual topography of this
   subject as it relates to emergency and disaster management contexts
   remains under-investigated. This article provides a snapshot of the
   intellectual structure of resilience studies. Using bibliometric data
   collected from 20 emergency and disaster management journals, this
   article argues that the interdisciplinary nature of resilience research
   comes from its historical roots. The findings also demonstrate that
   resilience research in the emergency and disaster management fields is
   organised into three primary clusters: environmental and ecological
   issues, emergency and disaster management, and public policy and
   administration. The article concludes with implications for
   policymakers, as well as recommendations for future research.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes, from a historical and institutional perspective,
   the sociopolitical cleavages existing between ethnic Macedonians and
   ethnic Albanians in the Republic of North Macedonia. Although primarily
   ethnic, the division between the two groups is deeply connected to state
   ownership and the official status each group occupies and wishes to
   occupy in it. By scrutinizing both groups' claims, standpoints, and
   dissatisfactions, the article asserts that the implementation of
   consociationalism in 2001, through the de facto institutionalization of
   ethnicity, has partly soothed both groups' frustrations, using the
   pragmatic exploitation of the existing ethnic divide as a proxy for
   ``state sharing{''} in addition to power sharing.},

Abstract = {During the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the built physical
   landscape and places of cultural heritage were deliberately targeted and
   destroyed as part of the strategy of ethnic cleansing. The 1995 Dayton
   Peace Agreement recognized the potential for cultural heritage to
   contribute to postwar reconciliation and rebuilding; Annex 8 established
   a commission to preserve national monuments. This paper examines the
   politics of cultural heritage in post-Dayton Bosnia and the ways in
   which it has been (ab)used to propagate a narrow, exclusivist identity.
   It focuses on the struggles to control the Commission to Preserve
   National Monuments as well as the fates of two monuments in particular
   Vraca Memorial Park and the Partisans' Memorial Cemetery-whose
   abandonment signifies the wider struggles over memory and identity in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina.},

Abstract = {Scholars of nation-building and secession tend to prioritize elite or
   broader nationalist activism when explaining the proliferation of
   nation-states. Yet, recent historical research reveals a major finding:
   the influence of great powers tended to eclipse nationalist mobilization
   for new states in Latin America, the Balkans, Anatolia, and Central and
   Eastern Europe. Drawing on recent trends in historical research largely
   unknown in other fields, this article examines context, timing, and
   event sequencing to provide a new approach to multi-case research on
   nation-state proliferation. Major power recognition of new states in the
   Balkans also emerges as transformational for the post-World War I
   replacement of dynastic empires with nation-states in Europe. These
   findings suggest a shift of focus to the interplay of nationalist
   activism and great power policy for explaining the spread of
   nation-states.},

Abstract = {This paper compares nationalism in the two ex-Czechoslovak countries-the
   Czech and Slovak republics. The aim is to analyze the measurement of
   nationalism in the 1995, 2003, and 2013 International Social Survey
   Program (ISSP) National Identity surveys. According to the nationalism
   measures from the ISSP survey - which are frequently used by authors
   analyzing nationalism both countries experienced a significant rise in
   nationalism in the 1995 to 2013 period. Moreover, invariance testing of
   the nationalism latent variable confirms the possibility of comparing
   levels of nationalism between Czechia and Slovakia over time. However,
   the associations between nationalism, as measured in the study, and
   concepts related to nationalism such as xenophobia, protectionism, or
   assertive foreign policy suggest that what is measured as nationalism in
   1995 is very different from what is measured in 2013. This is explained
   by a change of context which occurred in both countries between 1995 and
   2013. While answering the same question had a strong nationalistic
   connotation in 1995, this was not the case in 2013. Based on our
   findings we advise against using the analyzed ``nationalism{''} items as
   measurement of nationalism even beyond the two analyzed countries.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses local development and various governance strategies
   that local governments can use to engage actors in rural communities and
   resources from a broader environment to achieve desired socio-economic
   outcomes. We ask: How can local governance vary in rural communities?
   How can governance arrangements lead to contrasting socio-economic
   outcomes? Our conceptual framework combines a typology of local
   governance roles with socio-economic outcomes associated with
   neo-endogenous development theory. We explore culture-based development
   projects from three rural communities. We find that local governance
   strategies vary between relatively similar rural communities and that
   they represent compromises in terms of socio-economic outcomes. Local
   government in rural communities can act strategically through use of
   local networks. Local governance here is best understood as an emergent
   quality of the local context, history, institutions, culture, and, power
   relations. Therefore, governance strategies in rural contexts should be
   based on careful reflection on potential roles, trade-offs and desirable
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between tax autonomy and the
   structure of local public expenditures. We rely on panel data from
   Poland for more than 2400 municipalities over the years 2002-2014. We
   use a measure of tax autonomy, based on `potential' own revenues,
   defined as revenues that the authorities are entitled to collect, before
   local tax policies have been implemented. This measure alleviates to
   some extent the endogeneity of indicators based on actually collected
   own taxes. Our results suggest a U-shaped relationship between the ratio
   of own local taxes and the share of capital expenditures and a negative
   relationship between the former ratio and the share of education
   spending.},

Abstract = {This paper examines why the support of independent local parties has
   grown substantially in the Netherlands. These are parties that run in
   municipal council elections, but do not run in elections at higher
   levels, specifically the national level. Such parties saw their support
   double in the Netherlands between 1986 and 2010. Parties of this type
   have also grown in other Western European states. This paper examines
   two possible explanations: declining political trust on the level of
   voters and, on the supply side, the rise of parties that are not rooted
   at the local level. The evidence shows that the rise of independent
   local parties reflects the rise of national political parties that do
   not run in many municipal elections. This article examines the case of
   the Netherlands, pooling five surveys from the 1986-2010 period.},

Abstract = {The influences of state government have been curiously absent from most
   studies of collaboration among cities. Extant research on city
   collaboration which promotes on climate and environmental sustainability
   issues focuses primarily on local-level institutions, politics, and
   processes. Thus, the role of states to constrain or facilitate
   collaboration among local governments needs to be more fully accounted
   for. Building on transaction cost and institutional collective action
   theory and drawing on data from a national survey of US cities, we
   investigate the influences of city-level factors together with the
   hierarchical effects of state rules and policies on the extent to which
   mechanisms for interlocal collaboration are employed in pursuing climate
   protection and renewable energy development goals. The results confirm
   predictions that multilevel intergovernmental forces influence the
   extent to which cities collaborate. These results have both theoretical
   and practical implications for understanding interlocal collaborations.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Spanish local governments have come under increasing
   pressure to accommodate severe economic restrictions while maintaining
   their provision of local public services. We analyse overall cost
   efficiency in Spanish local governments during the period of the
   economic crisis (2008-2013), under four different non-parametric
   methodologies. Moreover, given how problematic it is to precisely define
   what municipalities do, we compare three different output models with
   various measures of quantity as well as quality. Results suggest that
   Spanish local government efficiency improved over the period 2008-2013
   since budget expenditures (inputs) fell while local public services and
   facilities (outputs) were maintained. We also find evidence of the
   possible implications of service quality when measuring municipalities'
   efficiency, and of structural differences in the average efficiency
   between municipalities located in different Spanish regions. Finally,
   our results confirm that the level and variation of efficiency scores
   are affected by the approach taken.},

Abstract = {Some post-conflict bodies carry historical and political content that
   cannot be reconciled with peacebuilding. Peacebuilding is a site of
   struggle where some bodies and narratives are casted out from the core
   of the community as the bodies that remind the community of its
   suppressed past are rejected and silenced. This chapter demonstrates how
   the bodies of women who fraternized with the German soldiers during the
   Second World War are post-conflict bodies that became cast out from the
   core of the nation during peacebuilding. The chapter highlights that
   despite the rejection, post-conflict abject bodies can become
   parrhesiastes, speak back to power, and retain the right to remind the
   -post-conflict collective self of the residual historical content that
   bears upon the present.},
