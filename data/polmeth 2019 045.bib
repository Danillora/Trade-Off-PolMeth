Title = {Constructing diagnostic trees: A stepwise approach to institutional
   design},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The idea of institutional diagnostics has sparked considerable interest
   over the last twenty years, especially among those seeking to assess how
   architectural choices can affect the performance of institutions
   established to address environmental issues. But so far, this appealing
   idea has not developed into a practice that is useful in making choices
   regarding the architecture of regimes addressing needs for governance
   arising at various levels of social organization. I argue that this is
   attributable to a dramatic expansion in the range of concerns we now
   include in thinking about needs for governance and how to respond to
   them. Diagnosis cannot deal with the full range of these concerns in one
   step. To make diagnostic procedures useful, we must proceed in stages,
   identifying the basic nature of a need for governance and then
   proceeding in a stepwise fashion to identify and evaluate institutional
   options. I introduce the idea of a diagnostic tree as a tool to guide
   this process and explore its usefulness in a generalized account of key
   issues arising in the realm of fisheries management. I conclude with a
   discussion of points to bear in mind in any effort to use this tool to
   sort out the complexities of institutional design in a variety of
   real-world settings. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Booktitle = {GENDER TRAINING: A TRANSFORMATIVE TOOL FOR GENDER EQUALITY},
Series = {Gender and Politics},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {This book explores how to maximise the - transformative potential of
   gender training scenarios and processes. It does so by highlighting and
   interrogating innovations from practice in order to overcome some of the
   key challenges for gender training. The book constructs a notion of
   feminist gender training, which is reflexive, self-critical and focused
   on process. This chapter traces the historical development of the field
   of gender training, drawing on a range of resources and projects that
   have attempted to map the emergence and current state of gender
   training. It then goes on to map the field of gender training and
   explore how processes of professionalisation and developing quality
   criteria can contribute to a more feminist-informed theory and practice
   of gender training. This chapter establishes the book's explicit focus
   on transformation, which sets it apart from the more technocratic
   aspects of gender training. Moreover, it asks how gender training can be
   harnessed as a catalyst for disjuncture, rupture and change.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In September 2018, following over a decade of informal discussions, the
   United Nations General Assembly launched an intergovernmental conference
   to address the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond
   national jurisdiction. This process is scheduled to take two years and
   is structured around four themes: marine genetic resources, area-based
   management tools (including marine protected areas), environmental
   impact assessments, and capacity building and marine technology
   transfer. This Perspective draws on the earth system governance
   literature and the authors' own experience of and views on the BBNJ
   process to provide insights and recommendations for the ongoing
   negotiations. It highlights three areas of concern: (i) the
   politicization of science and coping with scientific uncertainty, (ii)
   institutional fragmentation; and (iii) the need for a new agreement to
   respond to the complex set of multiple, multilevel, and systemic threats
   to marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. (C) 2019 The

Pages = {71-93},
Abstract = {An important aspect of maximising the transformative potential of gender
   training is the application of feminist pedagogical principles
   throughout all aspects of the training process. This is explored in
   detail in this chapter, which discusses not just feminist pedagogical
   principles, but also what makes a feminist gender trainer. This chapter
   also highlights a range of unresolved and unfinished issues within the
   field of gender training, especially when it comes to implementing
   feminist pedagogical principles-in particular the tensions between
   technocratic demands and feminist politics and practice. It is argued
   that feminist gender training requires individual, collective and
   institutional `transformative courage' in the face of such challenges.},

   important are participation, policy coherence, reflexivity, adaptation
   and democratic institutions?},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2019},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the achievement of the 17 Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) depends on effective governance arrangements.
   However, it is less clear which modes and aspects of governance are
   important for which of the 17 goals. Until now, empirical research has
   mostly studied individual cases, with comparative studies largely
   missing. Here, we conduct a comparative analysis among 41 high and
   upper-middle income countries for the year 2015, drawing on the
   Sustainable Governance Indicators, the Global SDG Indicators Database
   and other official sources. Using multiple regression, we test the
   influence of different aspects of governance, namely participation,
   policy coherence, reflexivity, adaptation and democratic institutions on
   SDG achievement at the national level, controlling for the effects of
   additional socio-economic conditions. Of the tested factors, democratic
   institutions and participation as well as economic power, education and
   geographic location serve to explain SDG achievement. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {Two false dichotomies have distorted our thinking about environmental
   issues since the mid-twentieth century. The first is a tendency to place
   human rights and ecological sustainability in opposition to each other.
   This tendency was epitomized by those Malthusian environmentalists who
   advocated both eugenics and strict governmental control over human
   reproduction in the name of ecological sustainability. The second false
   dichotomy is the tendency to view technology and nature as antithetical.
   This has been evident across the spectrum of popular culture, where some
   of the most acclaimed films with environmental themes frame nature and
   technology as inherently opposed to one another. Each of these false
   dichotomies must be transcended if we are to understand and address
   environmental challenges such as climate change.},

Title = {Proposal for an International Agreement on Active Debris Removal},
Booktitle = {SPACE SECURITY AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF ACTIVE DEBRIS REMOVAL},
Series = {Studies in Space Policy},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {107-129},
Abstract = {Along with the benefits derived from space applications, the burgeoning
   of space activities has also shown a side effect, namely numerous pieces
   of space debris orbiting the Earth. Awareness of the problem of space
   debris has been raised and spread with the increasing severity of this
   issue, and many initiatives have been taken. This note deals with
   several legal questions concerning the implementation of Active Debris
   Removal (ADR). The first question is what should be removed, i.e., the
   definition of the term ``space debris{''}, and the correlation between
   this term and the term ``space object{''} which is frequently referred
   to in the United Nations (UN) space treaties.
   The UN space treaties are commonly referred to as the ``five United
   Nations treaties on outer space{''} which are:
   (i) Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
   Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other
   Celestial Bodies 18 UST 2410 (1967) (Outer Space Treaty);
   (ii) Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and
   the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement);
   (iii) Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space
   Objects 672 United Nations Treaty Series 119 (1968) 24 UST 2389 (1972)
   (Liability Convention);

Abstract = {The final chapter of the book sets out a number of priorities that have
   been identified for `going deeper' with the field of gender training.
   First, it is argued that a more substantive approach to working with
   privilege in gender training needs to be developed. Second, new
   methodologies can be developed drawing from other fields such as applied
   theatre in order to encourage creativity, empathy and action among
   training participants. Finally, the chapter explores feminist ways of
   being in gender training and how techniques and ideas from meditation
   and mindfulness can be used to summon up the `transformative courage'
   required to construct feminist gender training. This involves
   approaching gender training through honesty, compassion and a commitment
   to groundlessness. Taken together, these ideas help move gender training
   beyond its often technocratic form towards a creative, liberating
   process with the potential to evoke tangible, lasting transformation
   across individuals and institutions towards gender equality.},

Abstract = {The rapid integration of commerce, transport, and communication over the
   past century seems to suggest that the world is on the path to becoming
   a single global civilization. Although the form of governance that will
   maintain that civilization has yet to be determined, there is no reason
   to assume that it will be democratic, unless there is a deliberate and
   sustained effort to assure that it is. Given the symbiotic relationship
   between science and democracy, and the superior historical record of
   democratic governments on environmental issues, there is reason to
   believe that the establishment of democratic governance on a global
   scale would offer the best strategy for dealing with climate change.},

Year = {2019},
Pages = {49-70},
Abstract = {In this chapter, the possibilities and limitations of gender training
   for contributing to transformative change for gender equality are
   explored in detail. The chapter argues for a move beyond a focus on
   individual change-as demonstrated in current approaches to the
   evaluation of gender training-and rather on exploring institutional
   resistances and institutional change. This draws on both academic
   literature on feminist institutionalism and reflections from practice,
   with a focus on maximising the impact of gender training on
   institutional change. A key concern for future work in gender training
   is the lack of a clearly articulated theory of the relationship between
   gender training and transformative change. The chapter argues that even
   without perfect conditions gender trainers can work to maximise the
   spaces for feminist change within existing constraints and conditions.},

Abstract = {The analysis in the current chapter advances the discussion on the
   interrelationship between space debris, active debris removal and space
   traffic management, and on how they must necessarily be conceptualised
   and implemented should the international community prefer to safeguard
   the sustainability of mankind's space activities. The first section
   juxtaposes the state of a number of regulatory developments on the above
   issues with a cursory look at the inescapable physical circumstances and
   processes surrounding space activities and space debris, in order to
   derive a number of fundamental implications for the creation of an
   effective future regulatory system. What emerges, above all, is the need
   for suitably tailored, adaptive and largely unprecedented international
   legal `machinery' based on a common construction of the risk attending
   space activities. De lege lata and de lege ferenda, the chapter then
   briefly situates and qualifies the issues under general international
   law and the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in
   the context of international obligations to prevent transboundary
   harm-an area of international environmental law notably concerned with
   risk and its collective management-before finally concluding.},

Abstract = {There are three broad paths to establishing supranational democracy in
   order to address the transnational challenge of climate change. The
   first and most direct path would involve bypassing national governments
   altogether and organizing municipalities on a global scale. The second
   and most cautious path would involve creating an integrated federation
   of established democracies that could grow over time. The third and most
   ambitious path would involve democratizing already existing global
   institutions such as the United Nations. Each of these paths has
   benefits and drawbacks, but the middle path of pursuing greater
   political integration among established democracies is probably the most
   viable.},

Booktitle = {SPACE SECURITY AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF ACTIVE DEBRIS REMOVAL},
Series = {Studies in Space Policy},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {71-92},
Abstract = {Active debris removal is currently being widely discussed, because the
   simple mitigation of the creation of new space debris is no longer
   sufficient to guarantee the sustainable use of outer space. However,
   these discussions have encountered various difficulties due to the fact
   that the authors of the specialized UN space treaties, at the time of
   their drafting, did not take into consideration the many potential
   consequences of increased space activities, such as the problem of space
   debris, among others. The lack of clarity on how to handle this problem
   concerns not only the definition of space debris, but also the ways and
   means to address it, including the rights and obligations of involved
   operators.
   In this setting, the EU initiative for an International Code of Conduct
   for Outer Space Activities is to be highlighted as an attempt at clarity
   in this domain, especially as it envisages the possibility of using the
   right of self-defence to avoid the creation of space debris. This right
   must be assessed in the context of existing international norms, such as
   the provisions of the UN Charter on the notion of self-defence. Its
   application in the frame of active space debris removal is being
   questioned by some Member States, and Russia is currently advocating
   holding a debate on self-defence in UNCOPUOS. Discussions and
   initiatives in the UN First Committee must also be taken into account as
   these are also seeking security and safety in outer space by examining
   the aspect of self-defence.},

   legal regime (referred to as ``First-Generation Space Law{''}) with
   regard to the issue of space debris management, specifically mitigation
   and eradication. Against this analysis a technological framework is
   introduced in order to monitor current and prospective space debris
   removal technologies that enables the design of a framework law regime
   to address the growing problem of space debris. Both the analysis of the
   current international legal regime and the design of the framework law
   regime provide insight into the uncertain nature of the current
   international law on space debris management that is not conducive to a
   solution to the space debris problem. The argument is thus advanced that
   the time has come for the Second-Generation Space Law to be developed in
   this regard.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the interdisciplinarity of postwar applied
   scientific approaches to ``defective{''} children and its direct
   influence on the practices of education and political rhetoric about
   those who were labeled as defective. Victoria Shmidt introduces the role
   of intensive institutionalization of special education in Nazi Germany
   in the vicissitudes of the Czech approach to the children with
   disabilities during the Protectorate and explores the fixing of some
   institutional and discursive German patterns in the politics of
   disability during the Third Republic period, between 1945 and 1948.
   Frank Henschel then explains the rupture between the first decade of
   socialist policy and the composition of driving forces that later made
   the eugenic turn possible and desirable by various interest groups.},

Abstract = {An analysis of the nexus between international relations and
   environmental sustainability since the early twentieth century indicates
   that strategic competition among sovereign nation states has greatly
   impeded efforts to understand and address environmental challenges. In
   particular, the rise of militaristic nationalism has caused extensive
   environmental destruction and has frequently corrupted the practice of
   science by tying it to the secretive culture of the national security
   state. During the twentieth century, numerous advocates of environmental
   sustainability struggled to limit the destructive impact of nationalism
   on scientific cooperation, and their work has attained a new relevance
   in the age of climate change.},

Abstract = {Bearing in mind that there are currently no dedicated instruments
   dealing with dispute settlement in the area of ADR, States and/ or
   private entities can resort to other available dispute settlement
   mechanisms in international law, such as diplomatic means or
   adjudicative methods. After an examination of the pros and cons of
   existent mechanisms, this paper will advocate the creation of a
   specialized International Governmental Organization tasked with the
   development and operation of active debris removal technology and
   equipped with a specialized body or tribunal with compulsory
   jurisdiction over ADR related disputes.},
