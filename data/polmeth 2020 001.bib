Title = {How family and child cash transfers can empower women: Comparative

Abstract = {By leveraging a comparison of Brazil's Bolsa Familia and South Africa's
   Child Support Grant, this article probes whether and how income transfer
   programs enhance the standing of women recipients. Empowerment is
   assessed according to economic decision making, bodily protection and
   integrity, and psycho-social wellbeing and growth. The comparative
   analysis determines that regular income assistance boosts the
   self-esteem and agency of women recipients in both countries. At the
   same time, it underscores the heightened benefits obtained in Brazil as
   a result of the cash transfer program being embedded in a stronger
   public health and social service network. That Bolsa recipients interact
   with these associated institutions generates multiple downstream
   benefits. The broader lesson is that income transfer programs need to
   operate in deliberate coordination with an array of ancillary social
   service institutions to deliver the maximum benefits for women's
   empowerment.},

Abstract = {This article presents an entirely new interpretation of the foundations
   of Alexis de Tocqueville's liberalism. The current scholarly consensus
   is that Tocqueville rejects the state of nature foundation of early
   modern political thought. In contrast to this orthodox view, I maintain
   that this early modern theory serves as one of the foundations of his
   political philosophy. This essay contends that Tocqueville's Memoir on
   Pauperism proves that he has an anthropology that is heavily indebted to
   state of nature theory, particularly Rousseau's. Moreover, key sections
   of Democracy in America, read in light of the Memoir on Pauperism,
   reveal that state of nature theory is operative in Tocqueville's new
   political science. Finally, The Old Regime and the Revolution explains
   why Tocqueville was a moderate state of nature thinker. By unearthing
   this hitherto unnoticed foundation, I hope to challenge scholars to
   reexamine the enduring importance of Tocqueville's innovative
   liberalism.},

Abstract = {What is the emotional impact of extraordinary events and how do they
   shape subsequent electoral outcomes? We posit that voters' emotional
   reactions to such events influence whether they are likely to re-think
   their prior vote choice. We focus on the Brexit referendum as a
   prominent example of such an event. The referendum outcome elicited
   different emotional responses among voters, and these challenged party
   loyalties. Using evidence from an online cross-sectional survey
   conducted in the UK in June 2017 shortly after the UK General Election,
   we show that anger is associated with defection among Remainers and
   enthusiasm is linked to vote-switching among Leavers. Fear, on the other
   hand, does not have an effect. Our article contributes to our
   understanding of how extraordinary events and emotional reactions lead
   to shifting partisan loyalties and electoral change.},

Abstract = {Housing has become a political problem in the vast majority of cities
   around the world, highlighting obvious injustices. The article pursues
   the question to what extent the existing human right to housing can be
   of any interest here. The practice-based approach of Charles Beitz can
   help against the background of some systematic supplements. A `negative'
   approach that distinguishes forms of injustice is an important
   prerequisite for a substantial use of human rights. The negative
   approach makes it possible to uncover injustices and shows the obstacles
   that stand in the way of a practice-based conception of human rights.
   The practice-based conception is, at the same time, necessary for the
   social analysis of the obstacles, in order to analyse human rights as
   well as to be able to justify human rights themselves. The current
   commodification of housing it is argued impedes the exercise of a
   practice-based conception of human rights in the way that Charles Beitz
   has suggested.},

Abstract = {Early studies show that the COVID-19 pandemic causes the
   rally-around-the-flag effect and increases the level of nationalism
   among the voters after the outbreak. However, how long does this boost
   last? Voters may cognitively withdraw their identification to the
   beloved country if the pandemic is rampant in where they live as well as
   when the government fails to address it thoroughly. We conducted a
   pre-registered MTurk experiment (n = 606) on 20 April 2020, in the
   United States-3 months after the first confirmed case and weeks after
   the large-scale lockdown. Results show that US subjects who were primed
   of the COVID-19 in the United States significantly decreased their level
   of nationalism, especially among Democrats. In contrast, the priming of
   ``COVID-19 in the world{''} has no effect. The negative impact of
   COVID-19 on nationalism could be explained by enough time as people
   could observe and evaluate the government's performance after the
   outbreak through the partisan lens.},

Abstract = {Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge provides not only a critique
   of technocracy but a compelling story about the intimate relationship
   between three of today's most important political phenomena: populism,
   technocracy, and democracy. In contrast to many recent accounts that
   treat populism as a backlash against technocracy, Friedman's theory
   suggests that populism is a lineal descendent of technocracy, with which
   it shares substantial intellectual DNA. Friedman's implicit theory of
   populism helps to explain many of its core features, including its
   political stances, emotionality, and hostility to mediating
   institutions, in interpretively charitable ways. Central to Friedman's
   analysis is the importance of political epistemology, which supplies key
   connective tissue between the three phenomena. The relations between
   technocracy, democracy, and populism revealed by Friedman's theory
   generate both enlightening and disturbing implications for democratic
   theory.},

Abstract = {Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, service-providing insurgent
   groups have responded differently, with some initiating more attacks
   amid ongoing destabilisation while others have immediately veered
   towards precautionary measures such as initiating public awareness
   campaigns and setting up quarantine centres. What drives these divergent
   responses? Relying on publicly available and semi-private sources, this
   article examines how the Taliban in Afghanistan, Ha'ayt Tahrir al-Sham
   (HTS) in Syria, and Al-Shabaab in Somalia have operationalised their
   responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal that the
   divergent responses are rooted in the framing of the pandemic discourse.
   The Taliban and HTS both interpreted it as a calamity that needs
   responding to and repurposed their activities accordingly by stepping up
   their attacks against combatants while concomitantly exploiting the
   humanitarian vacuum created by the pandemic by delivering health
   services. However, as the pandemic surged, the two groups gradually
   scaled down their combatant targeting and prioritised delivering health
   services to bolster their legitimacy and build popular support for their
   proto-states. By contrast, Al-Shabaab labelled the pandemic as a Western
   and Chinese `problem', and made no visible changes to their operations
   in response to the crisis, only belatedly beginning to offer health
   services as the pandemic worsened.},

Abstract = {This concluding piece summarises the key advances made by the
   contributions to this special issue by way of discussing how German
   foreign policy is adapting to the (post-)Corona world. While the world
   seemed `out of joint' to German policymakers back in 2015, the
   developments related to the spread of Covid-19 suggest that the
   tumultuous period of international politics will continue well into the
   2020s. Therefore, given the intertwined nature of Germany's relationship
   with the European and global orders, analysing Germany's foreign policy
   should remain extremely interesting in the years to come. We outline the
   key avenues for future studies of German foreign policy (individual
   level, parties, institutions, external environment, domestic consensus
   building), show how they are developed in this special issue, and sketch
   pathways for their further advancement. Thereby, we wish to extend an
   open invitation to an inclusive, theoretically well-informed debate on
   German foreign policy, to which this special issue hopes to contribute.},

Title = {The advice they give: Knowledge transfer of international organisations
   in countries of the former Soviet Union},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-33},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article tests the assumptions of the literature regarding the
   neoliberal agenda ('Washington Consensus') promoted by international
   organisations through knowledge transfer and about the power they
   supposedly have through loan conditionality to impose their will on
   countries in financial need. In addition, it examines `avant-garde
   measures' of neoliberal reforms exceeding the requirements from
   international organisations. Looking at the social policy concepts and
   advice these organisations give countries in the former Soviet Union, it
   utilises the example of healthcare reform in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
   Russia. The article examines the general advice these organisations gave

Abstract = {This article examines how human rights relate to democratic policing. We
   differentiate policing for democracy, which protects democracy, from
   democratically responsive policing, where police are governed
   democratically. Using this two-fold distinction to examine European
   Court of Human Rights cases, we find a close match between Convention
   rights and policing for democracy. Regarding democratically responsive
   policing, the Court provides responsiveness within the structural limits
   of reacting to individual complaints, and as one element in the broader
   landscape of governance. Further, cases show how that landscape features
   in Court judgments. We argue that robust enforcement, and careful
   attention to case law during drafting and implementation of police
   legislation and governance arrangements, help protect democracy and
   enhance democratically responsive policing.},

   how to teach, know and act in these new scenarios mediated by platforms.
   In our platform society, with so many screens at the heart of knowing
   practices, sense making operations take particular ways. The social
   sphere always takes part in the cognitive dimension. And both factors
   constantly influence each other in a dialectic relationship that is
   dynamic, by its very nature.},

Abstract = {To what extent do voters grasp ``what goes with what{''} among key
   political objects as they attempt to understand the choices they face at
   the ballot box? Is recognition of these associations limited to only the
   most informed citizens? We design a novel conjoint classification
   experiment that minimizes partisan boosting and allows for the relative
   comparison of attribute effect when mapping voter associative networks,
   the cluster of attributes linked to parties and ideological labels. We
   ask respondents to `guess' the party or ideology of hypothetical
   candidates with fully randomized issue priorities and biographical
   details. There is remarkable agreement among both high- and
   low-knowledge voters in linking issues to each party and ideology,
   suggesting this minimalist form of associative competence is more widely
   held in the mass public than perhaps previously thought. We find less
   agreement about biographical traits, which appear to pose greater
   informational challenges for voters. Notably, nearly identical issue
   priorities and traits are associated with party and ideology, indicating
   these two dimensions are largely fused in the minds of today's American
   voters.},

Abstract = {The theory of hegemony and the discursive conception of politics allow
   for a break with the essentialist way of understanding the concept of
   homogeneity. Thus, it is posible to conceive it as a political myth
   sustained on a conceptual construction in which heterogeneity would not
   be its opposite, but its reverse. To investigate the structure of this
   construction is useful for the study of a question that goes through
   many conflicts about nationalism: the management of the tension between
   the need for homogeneity required by the sovereign decision and the
   pretension of legitimizing the community through the claim of
   heterogeneity. The Federations, understood through Carl Schmitt, are an
   interesting attempt at this. So are the concepts of nation of nations
   developed in Spain by federal republicanism in the 19th century and
   during the period of transition from dictatorship to democracy in the
   following century. After analysing them, we conclude that both offer
   problematic formulas.},

Abstract = {In a time of rising Euroscepticism across Europe, diffuse support for
   the European Union (EU) is an especially important concept as it
   provides a source of stability for the EU. How important is childhood
   political socialization for the development of diffuse support? The
   extant literature emphasizes the role of childhood socialization.
   However, these studies are based on analyses that cannot fully
   distinguish between the cohort effect and the life-cycle effect. This
   study overcomes this limitation by looking at a more suitable case (the
   European Union) and by using a novel technique that effectively
   distinguishes the cohort effect from the life-cycle effect. The findings
   show that individuals who experienced early life political socialization
   in the EU have equal levels of diffuse support as individuals who grew
   up outside the EU. I thus argue that diffuse support develops through
   experience in adult life, and childhood political socialization is not
   essential for its development.},

Abstract = {Oceans are the life support system for our planet and are vital to human
   health. It is said that half of the oxygen we breathe is generated by
   our oceans. However, ocean space is becoming more globalized over time.
   Hence, it is essential for countries to take up a more holistic approach
   to ending ocean exploitation on the one hand, and also to ensuring a
   healthy ocean future on the other. Today, maritime cooperation is key to
   the management of the global commons, and ocean governance is important
   in establishing maritime connectivity. This article is a qualitative
   analysis of how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will
   undertake such an initiative to promote diverse and collaborative ocean
   governance in Asia. The article will analyze whether ASEAN countries are
   ready to take up the great power game challenge, and simultaneously
   motivate each other to promote sustainable development of common ocean
   governance structures and principles in the region. Last but not the
   least, we will see how ASEAN (Way) will connect with global trends in
   order to realize its a vision of building a community conscious of its
   historical ties and cultural heritage to improve the overall ocean
   health in Southeast Asia.},

Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Who are the colleagues participating when asked to complete expert
   surveys? This research note investigates which individuals'
   characteristics associate with positive responses. Drawing on an expert
   survey dedicated to post-conflict trials, we collect data on various
   attributes of both respondents and non-respondents such as their age,
   sex, academic positions, disciplines, and research outputs. We expect
   that decisions to participate result from an interplay of (1)
   individuals' levels of context-specific expertise, (2) the value
   attached to their expert role, (3) their confidence in making
   authoritative statements, and (4) resource constraints. Employing
   logistic regression models and statistical simulations (n = 414), we
   find that context-specific expertise is the primary, but not the only
   determinant of participation. On the one hand and luckily, individuals
   whose research corresponds closely to the object of study are most
   likely to participate. On the other hand and unfortunately, individuals
   with high citation outputs, female experts, and Area Studies-scholars
   are less likely to respond. Consequently, certain groups are
   under-represented in expert evaluations frequently considered as
   authoritative source of knowledge.},

Abstract = {In the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, Europe became the epicenter after
   Asia, and before it reached America. In this scenario, national borders
   reappeared and citizens felt safe being within their ``closed{''} state,
   even at the expense of their individual rights. The European Union (EU),
   with a complement and support function on health issues, had to
   ``navigate{''} between these multi-level structures. Moreover, even if
   European citizens have criticized EU's slowness and inefficiency, they
   know that it remains a necessary and essential support scheme. In this
   paper, we aim at describing the disruptive effects of the pandemic on
   the process of European integration, identifying three areas: the
   tensions between the national level and the European level, the impact
   on the democratic institutions of the Member States, and citizens'
   perceptions and attitudes about the EU's management of the pandemic.
   Possibly the EU, for the first time in a long time, could give the
   answer that its citizens expect and come out stronger from this crisis.},

Abstract = {Much recent research on coalitions and policy-making in parliamentary
   democracies requires high-quality data on the strength of legislative
   institutions. In this article, I introduce a new index of committee
   policing strength which improves on existing measures in important ways.
   I specify key index parameters using a binary rooted tree model and
   engage human coders to score formal rules. I obtain a novel time series
   of committee policing strength in 17 western and eastern European
   democracies since 1945. I validate the new estimates through convergent
   validation and discuss ways in which the new index contributes to future
   work.},

Abstract = {Surveys reveal that there are great differences among citizens in their
   membership of political associations. Such differences plausibly lead to
   a better representation of interests of privileged citizens compared to
   other citizens. We examine the demographic groups (in terms of
   education, gender and immigration background) that tend to be members of
   interest groups. We also investigate the relation between the membership
   profile of associations and the propensity of interest groups to be
   routinely approached by policymakers. The results of our elite survey of
   Dutch interest associations indicate that relatively well-educated
   citizens and men are better represented in interest groups. Patterns of
   underrepresentation are not further exacerbated by the outreach of
   policy-makers, except that interest associations with a relatively large
   female membership are less likely to be consulted.},

Abstract = {While parents remain key socializing agents for political attitudes of
   adolescents, we observe that parent-child similarity in these attitudes
   is less substantial than initially theorized and seems to vary across
   studies and type of attitude. We hypothesize that social learning
   mechanisms explain differences in the strength of parent-child
   similarity. To assess this proposition, we compare the moderating power
   of political discussion, political sophistication, parental homogeneity,
   and gender using data from the Belgian Parent-Child Socialization Study
   2013 (N = 1943 families). Our results demonstrate that parents and
   children resemble in their political and social attitudes and that this
   similarity is stronger for concrete and socially salient attitudes and
   reinforced by frequency in political discussion. Results also indicate
   that social learning practices, or at least the ones considered in this
   study, are not necessary conditions (anymore) for parent-child
   correspondence. Frequency of cue-giving in the form of direct
   communication is important to internalize parental attitudes but
   political sophistication and consistency in cue-giving less so. Parents
   and children correspond even in the absence of optimal social learning
   conditions which suggests that informal learning and observation of
   parental behavior are crucial to consider as well.},

Abstract = {Can democratic orientations and political in fragile democracies be
   fostered through civic education? Early evaluation work reported
   generally positive effects, though recent work has been more skeptical,
   with some studies reporting negative impacts of civic education on
   political engagement through highlighting the poor performance of
   incumbents and ongoing political processes. In this article, we report
   the results of a field experiment using an encouragement design to
   assess the Voter Opinion and Involvement through Civic Education (VOICE)
   programme conducted in 2010-2011 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We
   adapt Bratton and Mattes' (2007) ``supply and demand{''} model of
   democratic support to the case of civic education, and derive hypotheses
   regarding expected impacts of VOICE on a series of democratic
   orientations and political participation. The results show that the
   VOICE programme had negative effects on support for the decentralization
   process and on individuals' satisfaction with democracy in the DRC, and
   positive effects on non-electoral participation as well as on democratic
   orientations such as knowledge, efficacy, and political tolerance. We
   suggest that this pattern of effects has positive normative
   implications, and that civic education programmes continue to have the
   potential to deepen democratic engagement and values, even in fragile or
   backsliding democratic settings.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the state of South Korea's consolidated
   democracy in the post-2016 Candlelight period. More specifically, I
   identify a ``glass ceiling{''} in raising the quality of South Korean
   democracy, drawing attention to institutional-cultural factors as an
   underlying barrier for further democratic progress. Political culture
   reinforces existing institutional design flaws such as a strong
   executive and a weak political party system. This in turn creates a
   permissive environment encouraging ruling parties to protect the
   presidency and implement the Blue House's agenda through means which do
   not necessarily comport with liberal democracy. After presenting data
   from several indexes that measure the quality of democracy in South
   Korea, I discuss how institutions and culture interact to limit
   democratic advancement. I then use the Sewol ferry disaster during the
   conservative Park Geun-hye administration and implementation of South
   Korea's inter-Korea engagement policy during the progressive Moon Jae-in
   government to illustrate my argument.},

Abstract = {The literature on the reproduction of political participation across
   generations has focused almost exclusively on parental effects. Yet,
   other family members may plausibly play an important role as well. This
   study explores the role of grandparents in the intergenerational
   transmission of the propensity to vote. Grandparental effects are
   theorized in terms of both social learning and status transmission. The
   analysis takes advantage of a unique dataset that links official turnout
   data for grandparents, parents, and adult grandchildren with demographic
   and socioeconomic information from administrative sources. Even
   controlling for a variety of status-related characteristics,
   grandchildren are significantly less likely to vote when their
   grandparents are non-voters. The association between grandparental
   turnout and the turnout of their adult grandchildren is only partly
   explained by the mediating effect of parental turnout. Having non-voting
   grandparents appears to reinforce the effect of having parents who do
   not vote and may even offset the effects of having parents who are both
   voters. These results suggest that it is time to take the role of
   grandparents seriously if we want to understand how political
   disadvantage is transmitted across generations.},

Abstract = {One particularly prominent strand of hate speech theory conceptualizes
   the harm in hate speech by considering the immediate illocutionary force
   of a hate speech `act'. What appears to be missing from such a
   conception, however, is how recognition relations and normative
   expectations present in a speech situation influence the harm such
   speech causes to its victims. Utilizing a particular real-world example,
   this paper illustrates how these defining background conditions and
   intersubjective relations influence the harm of hate speech as it is
   experienced from the first-person perspective. This, more nuanced
   conception of harm, takes note of the effects such speech inflicts on an
   individual's recognitive status, and can provide a clearer understanding
   of the conditions necessary for an act of hate speech to cause the
   speaker's desired effect on their targets.},

Abstract = {Do legislators from marginalized groups have non-electoral motivations
   to represent `their' group? Previous observational and experimental
   research on this question focuses on elected politicians and is thus
   unable to isolate representation absent a desire to win re-election. We
   address this limitation by observing the decision-making of appointed
   legislators who, by institutional design, have no personal re-election
   motive. We administered to Canadian senators and their staff a novel
   survey instrument that captured how they prioritized learning about the
   policy opinions of various groups of citizens. We show that senators'
   group identities-specifically, those associated with racial and regional
   minorities-influenced which group's views they chose to learn about. The
   findings refine the central conclusion of the literature and have
   implications for the study not only of unelected legislators but also of
   elected officials in settings where public monitoring is weak.},

Abstract = {Since the first political alternation in the early 21st century up until
   just before the 2018 concurrent election, the Mexican political system
   had consolidated its competition structure around three dominant
   parties; but where only the PRI and the PAN had alternated into the
   Executive Power. It was precisely in the 2018 elections when a landmark
   occurred in the trajectory of both the political and party systems with
   the emergence of a new left political party (MORENA) and its entry into
   government. This article analyzes the 2018 general election considering
   the evolution of political competition from two perspectives. The first
   one focuses on the trajectories and changes in the structure of the
   party system; and the second one, on the political power conformation
   and its effects until the last elections. The investigation concludes
   that the 2018 elections are the beginning of a new political cycle that
   consolidates a political left project through which Mexico enters into
   the processes of Latin American ideological transition and they show the
   existence of competition cycles in the party system.},

Abstract = {Motivated by recent developments in cyberwarfare, we study deterrence in
   a world where attacks cannot be perfectly attributed to attackers. In
   the model, each of n attackers may attack the defender. The defender
   observes a noisy signal that probabilistically attributes the attack.
   The defender may retaliate against one or more attackers and wants to
   retaliate against the guilty attacker only. We note an endogenous
   strategic complementarity among the attackers: if one attacker becomes
   more aggressive, that attacker becomes more ``suspect{''} and the other
   attackers become less suspect, which leads the other attackers to become
   more aggressive as well. Despite this complementarity, there is a unique
   equilibrium. We identify types of improvements in attribution that
   strengthen deterrence-namely, improving attack detection independently
   of any effect on the identifiability of the attacker, reducing false
   alarms, or replacing misidentification with non-detection. However, we
   show that other improvements in attribution can backfire, weakening
   deterrence-these include detecting more attacks where the attacker is
   difficult to identify or pursuing too much certainty in attribution.
   Deterrence is improved if the defender can commit to a retaliatory
   strategy in advance, but the defender should not always commit to
   retaliate more after every signal.},

Abstract = {Spartans Alternative School is an education project based within the
   Spartans Community Football Academy. Operating in an area of multiple
   deprivation in North Edinburgh, the school offers part time alternative
   education provision for 14-16 year olds at risk of exclusion and/or
   under achieving. This paper explores how the alternative school has met
   the complex needs of young people who have suffered or are suffering
   from adverse childhood experiences. The ethos of Spartans, and the
   Alternative School, is to support young people in a holistic way to
   achieve the very best version of themselves. The students are supported
   by a team of staff who have chosen to focus their training on being
   youth work led, trauma informed and attachment aware rather than focused
   on the narrow and inappropriate parameters associated with aspects of
   ACEs-informed practice.},

Title = {Bicameralism and government formation: does bicameral incongruence
   affect bargaining delays?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-484},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The effects of bicameral legislatures on government formation have
   attracted scholarly attention since Lijphart's (1984) seminal
   contribution. Previous research found support for the `veto control
   hypothesis,' showing that bicameralism affects coalition governments'
   composition and duration. However, the effects of bicameralism on the
   duration of the bargaining process over government formation have yet to
   be explored. Our work contributes to this area of research by focusing
   on the impact of bicameralism on bargaining delays. We show that the
   duration of the bargaining process over government formation decreases
   at increasing levels of partisan incongruence of the two chambers,
   especially in those legislative assemblies in which the upper chamber
   plays a relevant role in the policy-making process. Such empirical
   evidence is in contrast with the conventional expectation according to
   which bicameralism should delay the government formation process, as it
   introduces an additional element of complexity in the bargaining
   environment. We test our hypothesis by using a novel data set about the
   partisan composition of upper and lower chambers in 12 Western and
   Eastern European democracies over the postwar period.},

Abstract = {This study examines the information demands of decision-makers from
   across the globe in their exchanges with interest organizations. It
   proposes two explanatory factors that drive these information demands:
   democracy and development. We argue that decision-makers' information
   demands vary depending on whether they hail from developed countries or
   developing countries, as well as the extent to which their political
   systems are democratically accountable. We test our expectations based
   on interviews with 297 decision-makers from 107 different countries who
   were active during transnational trade and climate change negotiations.
   Our findings demonstrate that decision-makers from less developed
   countries exhibit a higher preference for interactions with
   organizations that provide them with technical information.
   Decision-makers from democratically accountable countries, by contrast,
   tend to place relatively greater value on political information provided
   by interest groups.},

Abstract = {This article examines Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s hegemony in Gujarat
   by studying the changes inaugurated by the party in the caste profile of
   Gujarati political elites. I showcase the transition of BJP from a party
   of elite castes to a limited accommodation of a few Hindu backward
   castes, especially under Narendra Modi's chief ministership. However, I
   argue that the recruitment of Hindu backward castes as ministers
   represents a case of superficial democratization as they were appointed
   in non-influential ministries or were co-opted only near election time.
   Indeed, Modi's developmentalist regime solidified the dominance of upper
   castes and Patels from an urban background and a few Rajputs, and led to
   a rural backlash in the form of Patel agitation. In the final section, I
   analyse these still emerging trends in Gujarat's polity, which became
   visible on a rural-urban continuum in the 2017 state election.},

Abstract = {Larger protests are more likely to lead to policy changes than small
   ones are, but whether or not attendance estimates provided in news or
   generated from social media are biased is an open question. This letter
   closes the question: news and geolocated social media data generate
   accurate estimates of protest size variation. This claim is
   substantiated using cellphone location data from more than 10 million
   individuals during the 2017 United States Women's March protests. These
   cellphone estimates correlate strongly with those provided in news media
   as well as three size estimates generated using geolocated tweets, one
   text-based and two based on images. Inferences about protest attendance
   from these estimates match others' findings about the Women's March.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tests of legislative gatekeeping theories have been hampered by the
   absence of status quo estimates, making these tests vulnerable to
   selection bias. I overcome this problem with a novel data set on
   positions by private interests in Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin because
   these states' legislatures record organizations' positions on lobbied
   bills irrespective of whether the bills receive floor consideration.
   This permits an estimation of the ideological locations of status quo
   policies for bills with and without floor consideration and in turn
   rigorous empirical tests of agenda-control theories. The data provide
   substantial evidence of partisan and nonpartisan gatekeeping and can
   adjudicate among the two models of gatekeeping in specific
   circumstances. In particular, they corroborate partisan gatekeeping in
   the Iowa House and the Wisconsin Assembly and cannot distinguish between
   the two accounts in the other chambers. Moreover, the results show that
   strong partisan institutions need not result in predominantly partisan
   gatekeeping.},

Abstract = {In order to cope with the economic fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic,
   the EU countries hit hardest by the virus requested fiscal support from
   the other EU member states. Likewise, the Eurozone arguably depends on
   some form of a fiscal union. This international redistribution
   critically depends on citizens' support. Do politically knowledgeable
   citizens develop preferences for fiscal redistribution that are
   different from those of ignorant citizens? Based on the 2014 European
   Election Study, this article argues that knowledge plays a limited and
   conditional role. It hardly exerts a systematic independent effect.
   Rather, it helps crystallize party cues and basic European integration
   values. My findings are consistent with a theory, according to which
   knowledge eases the process of rationalizing preferences that originate
   in previous basic orientations.},

Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 OCT 28},
Abstract = {South Africa's adopted neoliberalism framework since democracy has
   spearheaded industrial development such as mining and has contributed to
   eroding civil society formations for environmental justice. Although
   civil society has acted against mining developments, such actions can be
   uncoordinated due to neoliberal development influences. Neoliberalism
   can work to reconfigure the geographies of environmental justice
   struggles contributing to a fragmented `micro-politics'. This paper
   presents viewpoints from key stakeholders to examine civil society
   opposition to a mining proposal in rural Fuleni, KwaZulu-Natal to secure
   environmental justice and the campaign strategies used. The paper
   highlights that for environmental justice struggles against mining to be
   successful and effective against domination, requires communities
   linking up struggles and beyond isolated campaigns, sharing experiences
   and designing common narratives for strategies to combat mining and the
   broader neoliberal ideology producing unjust outcomes. This also
   requires that campaigners include the local youth in discussions on and
   alternatives to mining or run the risk of destabilising mining
   struggles.},

Abstract = {This article asks what shapes public support for comprehensive peace
   agreements that aim to end violent conflict in deeply divided societies.
   Although public perceptions are critical for the success of territorial
   settlements, little scholarly attention has focused on citizen attitudes
   towards peace in the post-implementation phase. We develop and
   empirically test a theory of citizen support for peace agreements that
   relates power-sharing institutions to broader citizens' security
   considerations and integrates into this theory the roles of
   international peacekeeping, ascriptive minority/majority identities and
   exposure to alternative governance structures (i.e. federal,
   consociational and centripetalist). We argue that the degree to which a
   peace treaty provides credible security to citizens determines public
   support for power-sharing. We test this argument in a least likely case
   Bosnia Herzegovina. Using data from a 2013 representative survey with
   1007 respondents, we examine the determinants of popular support for the
   Dayton Peace Accords. Our findings suggest that in each of the three
   main ethnic groups of Bosnia, more people would have voted for Dayton
   than against it and highlight the mechanisms through which individual
   and ethnic group security concerns shape support for the country's
   post-conflict institutions.},

Abstract = {Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood
   and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political
   attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of
   politicians' parental status on candidate viability. Building on the
   concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates'
   parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range
   and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the
   theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates'
   spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a
   more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the
   literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of
   presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using
   2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York
   Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of
   candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential
   primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family
   narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered
   and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of
   presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications
   of such portrayals for establishing candidates' relatability and
   electoral viability.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of early elections varies significantly between and
   within electoral democracies. Previous studies have investigated the
   determinants and the electoral consequences of early elections. However,
   whether early elections affect financial contributions to political
   parties has not been independently studied. This article argues that
   incumbent government parties gain a relative advantage compared to
   non-government parties with regard to private contributions in years of
   early elections. This argument is tested using party-level data from
   Denmark. Taking party-fixed effects into account, the results show a
   strong incumbency advantage in private contributions for early
   elections. The findings suggest that the ability to call early elections
   gives incumbent parties an additional advantage besides being able to
   call elections when economic conditions and opinion polls are favorable.},

Abstract = {What are the consequences of committing violent attacks for terrorist
   organizations? Terrorist attacks might broaden the base of supporters by
   increasing the perceived group efficacy. However, terrorist attacks
   might also lead its supporters to believe that the organization is
   excessively violent or involvement may become too dangerous. This
   article employs a unique dataset with 300,842 observations of 13,321
   Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State (IS), collected during a
   127-day period, to empirically investigate the impact of terrorist
   attacks on the number of the organization's supporters. By exploiting
   the exogenous timing of terrorist attacks as a natural experiment, we
   find that the number of followers of IS-related Twitter accounts
   significantly reduces in the aftermath of the attacks. Additionally, we
   provide some suggestive evidence to disentangle two mechanisms:
   disengagement - a change in supporters' beliefs - and deterrence -
   demobilization due to fear. Because we do not find support for the
   latter, we conclude that the disengagement effect might explain our main
   result.},

Title = {Rainmaker or rent-seeker? Associational landscapes and generalized trust
   of non-members},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {Being at the center of social capital, voluntary associations are
   generally thought to play a crucial role for the functioning of civil
   society and democracy. Several studies, however, cast doubt on the
   contention that associations are the foundation of generalized trust.
   Our study wishes to provide new insights: first by aggregating aspects
   of associations to associational landscapes in terms of number of
   associations, their financial condition, connectedness to local
   politics, frequency of meetings, and activities taking place at the
   municipal level; and second by taking non-members into account. We argue
   associational landscapes matter particularly for non-members: Their
   generalized trust is either diminished since associations serve as what
   Fukuyama calls `rent-seeking' tool for their members only or non-members
   benefit from what Putnam calls `rainmaking effect' of vibrant
   associational landscapes. To test both arguments empirically, we present
   an original data set combining a survey among voluntary associations in
   57 Swiss municipalities with a previously conducted population survey of
   their residents. Results of multilevel models give clear support to the
   rainmaker hypothesis. These findings can contribute to our understanding
   of the foundations of social capital.},

Abstract = {Claude Lefort's theory of democratic indeterminacy has been an
   influential source among democratic theorists to demonstrate that
   democratic times lack absolute and determinate grounds on which to base
   and justify collectivities in the name of society or the people.
   However, few readers have paid sustained attention to Lefort's advice
   that we should read Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological move from
   the idea of ``body{''} to ``flesh{''} to grasp the experience of
   indeterminacy. This article attends to this advice, and excavates how
   Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological discussion of indeterminacy guides
   Lefort's idea of democratic indeterminacy. More importantly, however,
   the article reveals that Lefort's appropriation of Merleau-Ponty's
   concept of flesh signals an ambiguity in Lefort's democratic theory-an
   ambiguity that presents democratic indeterminacy either as the radical
   possibility of creating democratic collectivities, or as the
   impossibility of decisively achieving democratic collectivities.
   Challenging Lefort's subject-centered interpretation of flesh, the
   article contends that Merleau-Ponty's move from body to flesh is to
   emphasize indeterminacy as an intersubjective, worldly experience. This
   world-centered reading of flesh suggests that the promise of democratic
   indeterminacy lies not only in questioning the closure of collectivities
   but also in proliferating collective experiences in many areas of common
   life.},

Abstract = {Why do thinkers hostile or agnostic toward Christianity find in its
   apocalyptic doctrines-often seen as bizarre-appealing tools for
   interpreting politics? This article tackles that puzzle. First, it
   clarifies the concept of secular apocalyptic thought and its relation to
   Christianity. I propose that, to avoid imprecision, the study of secular
   apocalyptic thought should focus on cases where religious apocalyptic
   thought's influence on secular thinkers is clear because they explicitly
   reference such thought and its appeal (e.g. Engels's fascination with
   Christian apocalyptic thought). Second, it argues that the political
   appeal of apocalyptic thought-and, specifically, what I term cataclysmic
   apocalyptic thought (CAT)-partly lies in offering resources to navigate
   persistent challenges in ideal theory. The ideal theorist faces
   competing goals: formulating an ideal that is utopian and feasible. One
   potential approach to this challenge is CAT, which embraces a utopian
   ideal and declares it feasible through identifying crisis as the vehicle
   to realize it.},

Abstract = {Bargaining and coalition building are a central part of modern politics.
   We argue that majoritarian bargaining is important for the formation of
   coalitions and that group-identity preferences have an impact on partner
   selection. We tested the effect of gender, race, and ideological
   distance in a majority-rule bargaining experiment and found that
   ideological distance significantly affected the likelihood and amount
   offered to potential partners. We concluded that formateurs are not
   necessarily purely rational actors pursuing policy goals and/or the
   benefits of office. Rather, they also care about the identity of their
   partners, preferring others who are like themselves.},

Abstract = {Do institutions constrain presidential power in Africa? Conventional
   wisdom holds that personalist rule grants African presidents unchecked
   powers. Consequently, there is very little research on African
   institutions such as legislatures and their impact on executive
   authority. In this article, the author uses original data on the
   exercise of presidential authority (issuance of subsidiary legislation)
   to examine how legislative independence conditions presidential rule
   making in Kenya. The study exploits quasi-exogenous changes in
   legislative independence, and finds that Kenyan presidents issue
   relatively more Legal Notices under periods of legislative weakness, but
   are constrained from doing so under periods of legislative independence.
   These findings shed new light on institutional politics in Kenya, and
   illustrate how executive-legislative relations in the country conform to
   standard predictions in the literature on unilateral executive action.},

Abstract = {The development of Turkey's administration capacity necessary for the
   orientation, monitoring and coordination of the preparatory work for its
   membership to the European Union has reached an important level. For the
   foreseeable future, the transformation and the administration level of
   the relevant body is directly affected by the relations between Turkey
   and the EU, and, in turn, this affects the relations between them. The
   body was first established as the General Secretary for EU Affairs under
   the Prime Ministry. Later, it became an independent body and was named
   the Ministry for EU Affairs. More recently, it started functioning under
   the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the Directorate for EU Affairs. In
   case of Turkey becoming a member of the EU, the directorate for EU
   Affairs will also be in charge of the coordination of the
   post-membership process. Not only has the Directorate's place within the
   administrative structure changed after the passage to the presidential
   system but its internal structure has also changed extensively.
   Monitoring the institutional development of the directorate in recent
   history and the relevant organization in other ministries will shed
   light on the administrative capacity in the membership process. In
   addition, positive developments in the relations between Turkey and the
   EU will allow us to reinterpret the administrative position of the
   Directorate. This study, based on an institutionalist approach, reveals
   the institutional capacity of the Directorate for EU Affairs and of
   other relevant public administration by analyzing the relevant
   legislation and the activity reports of the body. Although the
   Directorate has accumulated the necessary administrative experience
   stemming from a long period of candidacy and membership negotiations,
   its administrative motivation has decreased in the last few years due to
   the stagnation observed in the relations between the parties.},

   the Basic Human Values (Schwartz, 1994, Journal of Social Issues, 50,
   19-45) of 106 national politicians in the UK to examine the impact of
   these individual characteristics on three alternative political
   outcomes: the size of a candidate's electoral majority, their longevity
   as an elected representative and their progression (or not) to
   frontbench office. On the one hand, it seems that the values of
   individual politicians make very little impact on their electoral
   performance at the ballot box. On the other hand, politicians' values
   seem to impact on both their ability to hold on to office once elected
   and in turn to make in-role career progression.},

Abstract = {Analyzing audiovisual communication is challenging because its content
   is highly symbolic and less rule-governed than verbal material. But
   audiovisual messages are important to understand: they amplify, enrich,
   and complicate the meaning of textual information. We describe a
   fully-reproducible approach to analyzing video content using
   minimally-but systematically-trained online workers. By aggregating the
   work of multiple coders, we achieve reliability, validity, and costs
   that equal those of traditional, intensively trained research
   assistants, with much greater speed, transparency, and replicability. We
   argue that measurement strategies relying on the ``wisdom of the
   crowd{''} provide unique advantages for researchers analyzing complex
   and intricate audiovisual political content.},

Abstract = {There has been no shortage of literature that has focused on the role of
   money in politics. While the majority has focused squarely on the
   fundraising activities and spending preferences of parties and
   candidates, far less has paid attention to the spending habits of
   corporations, unions and interests that often register as non-parties.
   Yet these actors have gained prominence across general elections and
   referendum campaigns in the past decade owing to the increase in funds
   spent to influence election outcomes. Little is known about what the
   public thinks about the participation of these actors in campaigns. Yet
   public opinion toward non-party campaign spending is important to the
   degree that it effects perceptions of electoral integrity and might
   compel policy change. This paper uses new survey data collected from
   Canada and the UK to answer questions about how citizens perceive
   non-party campaign spending and what informs attitudes toward
   non-parties. We find that the public in both countries have mixed views
   on the participation of non-parties, but that there is some evidence
   that core concerns about electoral interiority and perceptions toward
   the role of money in politics drives opinion.},

Abstract = {Political encounters between settler governments and indigenous
   communities are freighted with the unresolved issues of indigenous
   independence asserted under ongoing conditions of colonial domination.
   Within political science, these encounters have been primarily theorised
   and analysed as struggles of indigenous communities for political
   recognition from settler states. Further, the politics of recognition is
   widely understood as colonising by indigenous scholars, with some
   arguing for an alternative politics of (indigenous) resurgence and
   refusal, a `turning away' from the state. In this article, we argue that
   in the case of Maori in Aotearoa `turning up' is the ethical and correct
   practice of politics, a practice stemming from the relational ontology
   of the Maori world. Thus `turning up' rather than `turning away' can,
   for Maori, itself be a practice of refusal. We outline the centrality of
   the embodied, face-to-face encounter within Maori politics, and identify
   the ongoing presence of the sovereign's body and embodiment more broadly
   within the Westminster tradition, as symbolised in the concept of the
   Crown. Building on these compatibilities within distinct political
   ontologies, we argue for the potential and productivity of face-to-face
   political encounters, and call on the New Zealand Crown to also
   prioritise `turning up' in its engagement with indigenous communities.},

Abstract = {This article explores how structural changes to the media environment,
   such as the development of social media, might enhance or impede
   presidents' public leadership efforts. We argue that characteristics of
   Twitter as a medium provide presidents with incentives to exploit these
   new opportunities and alter the content of presidential rhetoric. To
   test this claim about presidential rhetoric, we use text analysis tools
   to compare the readability, sentiment, and content of contemporary
   presidents' messages from press conferences and exchanges with reporters
   to tweets from the Barack Obama and Donald Trump presidencies. Our
   findings suggest that social media is being used by presidents in their
   public leadership efforts and that the medium of communication has a
   significant influence on the content of communication.},

Title = {A Red Flag for Participation: The Influence of Chinese Mainlandization
   on Political Behavior in Hong Kong},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article assesses how contemporary forms of regional assimilation by
   centralizing states affect the political behavior of threatened social
   groups within peripheral polities. Recent mainlandization, ``the
   blurring of the physical, social, cultural and psychological border
   between Mainland China and Hong Kong,{''} has constrained the region's
   autonomy. Here, we consider the political consequences of Chinese
   mainlandization. How does mainlandization affect the likelihood of
   political participation in Hong Kong? Drawing and expanding upon
   theories of social identity, we argue that mainlandization increases the
   political involvement among those who make the choice to identify as
   Hong Konger because this is the group under threat by China's recent
   actions. Hong Kongers politically mobilize as a response to
   mainlandization to combat Chinese threat and to improve the status of
   their identity group, of which their own sense of selves is also tied
   to. Using an original survey experiment, we find support for our theory.
   Hong Kongers are influenced by mainlandization to attend contentious
   protests, recruit others to attend such rallies, and sign pro-democratic
   petitions. We conclude by noting implications for China's increasing
   attempt to assimilate this electoral autocracy and discuss how our
   research informs Hong Kong political activism in 2019 and 2020.},

Abstract = {The battle to soften the labour market impact of the pandemic has thrown
   up some unlikely bedfellows, with trade union leaders competing with
   business chiefs over who can most fulsomely praise the government's
   economic response. But does thisententereally presage a new era of
   `Covid-corporatism'? Crises like Covid-19 can provide opportunities for
   temporary social pacts, even in countries lacking the labour market
   institutions needed to sustain these in normal times, and the `social
   partners' have shown an unusual willingness to be bold and constructive.
   But cracks are already appearing over how and when the state should
   begin its withdrawal from the economy. Unions face structural weaknesses
   and recruitment problems that will hamper their ability to take full
   advantage of what will likely prove to be only a temporary lull in
   hostilities.},

Abstract = {This study examines the changing nature of ethnic minority citizenship
   under China's pragmatist developmental transition. Our analytical focus
   is placed on Yanbian Koreans in the Northeast region of the country. In
   the socialist period, Yanbian's Korean Chinese population developed a
   form of socialist ideological citizenship, but it had to be refashioned
   into a complex set of developmental requirements and opportunities under
   post-socialist reform and globalization. The nominally communist regime,
   on the one hand, strengthened its politico-ideological control over
   society and, on the other hand, liberalized the economic system. As to
   Chaoxianzu (Korean Chinese), among other minority nationalities, the
   party-state has emphasized their national (Chinese) identity, whilst, at
   the same time, endeavouring to use the Korean ethnicity for
   transnational developmental linkages with South Korea. This situation
   has required Yanbian Koreans to negotiate the complementary and
   conflicting relationships between (post-)socialist citizenship,
   ethno-local developmental citizenship, and neoliberal compatriotic
   citizenship with South Korea.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {581-593},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Weakly institutionalized party systems are a defining feature of
   third-wave democracies. Yet, in some countries like Peru, party weakness
   is not a static equilibrium but rather part of a dynamic process of
   ``party system erosion{''} in which weak parties become weaker over time
   as independents come to dominate subnational posts. As I argue, party
   system erosion is driven by a particular configuration of institutional
   factors-weak party brands, ease of ballot access, and limited partisan
   control over resource distribution. These institutional features
   increase the likelihood that experienced candidates will run as
   independents. When these candidates are elected, they obtain more
   intergovernmental discretionary transfers, which are used to improve
   performance and maintain clientelistic networks. This resource advantage
   of independent officials further weakens party brands and reduces
   experienced candidates' incentives to run with parties in future
   elections. I test this theory using a data set of 80,000 subnational
   officials and a regression discontinuity design.},

Abstract = {Are parties ``high discipline, low cohesion{''} in Westminster
   legislatures? This study applies network analysis to voting behavior
   among members of parliament (MPs), a novel approach that measures not
   deviation from party-line voting, but rather whether MPs with similar
   voting patterns are co-partisans. We study the Canadian Parliament from
   2006 to 2015, during which time the governing party under Prime Minister
   Stephen Harper maintained tight central control and discipline, a likely
   source of elevated cohesion. We find that ``low cohesion{''} generally
   holds, and parties do not always conform to commonsense expectations
   about how cohesively they ``should{''} behave in various parliamentary
   situations, though they show themselves capable of learning over time.
   Moreover, we find that party cohesion stems less from shared voting
   behaviors and more from simple partisan identity. Further research
   should consider to what extent parliamentary behavior is based mainly on
   party alignment.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we consider the role of academics as change-makers. There
   is a long line of reflection about academics' sociopolitical role(s) in
   international relations (IR). Yet, our attempt differs from available
   considerations in two regards. First, we emphasize that academics are
   not a homogenous group. While some keep their distance from
   policymakers, others frequently provide policy advice. Hence, positions
   and possibilities of influence differ. Second, our argument is not
   oriented towards the past but the future. That is, we develop our
   reflections on academics as change-makers by outlining the vision of a
   `FutureLab', an innovative, future forum that brings together different
   world-makers who are united in their attempt to improve `the world'. Our
   vision accounts for current, perhaps alarming trends in academia, such
   as debates about the (in)ability to confront post-truth politics. Still,
   it is a (critically) optimistic one and can be read as an invitation for
   experimentation. Finally, we sympathize with voices demanding the
   democratization of academia and find that further cross-disciplinary
   dialogues within academia and dialogues between different academics,
   civil society activists and policymakers may help in finding creditable
   solutions to problems such as climate change and populism.},

Abstract = {External interventions by both regional and global powers in Libya have
   not been a scarcity after the 2011 revolution. With the turn of 2014,
   however, the nature of external interventions became more of a military
   one especially with the imposition of Haftar's rule in the east by
   several counter-revolutionary regional and global actors. At the point
   that the same counter-revolutionary alliance attempted to geopolitically
   strangulate Turkey both via propping up hostile and authoritarian
   regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, and also excluding it from
   the prospect of exploiting the riches of the Eastern Mediterranean,
   Turkish intervention materialized in early 2020. This study attempts to
   explain the various motivations of the major intervening actors in
   Libya, namely France, Russia, Egypt, and the UAE with a special focus on
   Turkey. Structural realist perspective is used to elucidate the
   international interventions to the Libyan civil war. The nature of the
   uncertainty emanating from the regional transformation motivated the key
   actors to get militarily involved in the Libyan crisis. The actors with
   defensive motives are more likely to stick to the conflict despite the

Abstract = {In Flanders-Belgium, a Belgo-Iranian politician has gained nation-wide
   attention for her critique of Islam. Safai's political discourses are
   built around her opposition to the violation of women's rights in Iran,
   and to the hijab as a political-patriarchal symbol. Through this latter
   opposition, she has gained prominence among Flemish nationalists. The
   emphasis in Safai's discourses has been on using Iranian gender politics
   to frame her antagonism to Islam as opposed to a patriarchal political
   ideology and the supposed progressive elite who threaten the secular
   order. Sparking fear of political Islam-in her words, `you should be
   more scared'1-and gender as her subject matter has gained Safai
   acceptance not only among some Belgian and Flemish, but also among some
   Iranian nationalists. This paper investigates Safai's gender activism
   and femonationalism featured in online media to show how emancipatory
   gender discourses are employed in the service of right-wing agendas.},

Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES},

Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-365},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What will the world look like in 2040 and how did we get there? How will
   climate change, one of, if not the most pressing issue of our times be
   tackled on a global scale? With these questions in mind, this article
   invites the reader to perform a thought experiment into the future.
   Following an imagined snapshot of the year 2040, the reader is guided
   through major global developments regarding climate change, social
   movements and, eventually, climate justice from the 2020s to 2040s. By
   imagining social, political and economic consequences of climate change
   and responses to them, this article paints a picture of what the future
   could look like if climate justice became a guiding principle in the
   struggle of mitigating the effects of climate change. Suggesting a
   paradigm shift from securitizing climate change to securing climate
   justice, this `future' calls for a discursive turn of the manner in
   which climate change is thought of and acted upon. It requires different
   entities, including academia, to recognize their role as political
   actors within society. Consequently, it is crucial to reflect upon whose
   security is (not) considered but also which responses are taken into
   account in what way to mitigate security risks related to climate
   change. The article concludes that imagining a future of climate justice
   is pivotal to finding solutions to the challenges we are confronted
   with, that is, keeping the metaphoric ship from crashing into the
   cliffs.},

Abstract = {Declaring the so-called Liberal International Order, and Multilateralism
   in general, obsolete has become fashionable after the Russian invasion
   of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in 2014. Among others, Russian and
   American leaders have emphasized competition and the uncompromising
   quest for the national interest as the basic and natural elements of
   inter-state relations. This worldview is reflected within societies
   throughout the world in populist nationalist movements and smacks of
   `strongman politics' with its undertones of toxic masculinity, in which
   the only check against outright conflict is the balance of power.This
   worldview is, clearly, bad news for small states. Alternatives such as
   Xi Jinping's `Community for the Shared Future of Mankind' would also, at
   closer look, seem to refer back to the primacy of national sovereignty -
   in this case that of one particular state, China. Instead, small states
   with open economies such as Finland would prioritize strengthening
   multilateral cooperation and the rules-based international order.
   Adapting the present international order rather than abandoning it
   wholesale is key to overcoming these challenges. That adaptation should
   be driven by a constructive critique of the current state of affairs.
   But we also need to look critically at the `brave new worlds' that
   populists and strongmen are promoting. An international order based on
   the balance of power and a search for absolute national sovereignty will
   rob us of the ability to overcome global threats as well as to seize
   opportunities provided by global civil society activism and scientific
   innovations.},

Abstract = {This project examines the global ``foreign fighter{''} phenomenon, in
   which individuals fight in a foreign conflict. We explore the question -
   ``Why do ordinary people travel abroad to fight and potentially die for
   a foreign cause?{''} - by analyzing a dataset of 27,223 foreign fighters
   from 75 countries who fought for the Islamic State. The statistical
   results demonstrate that one must draw on three different bodies of
   collective action theory to provide a robust explanation. The Islamic
   State's foreign fighters come from countries that are predominantly
   Muslim (social network theory), that have greater levels of educational
   attainment (grievance theory), and that are experiencing elevated levels
   of domestic political instability (political opportunity theory). These
   findings have theoretical implications for understanding the
   international dimension of collection action, most notably regarding
   international democracy promotion. Whereas a country's degree of
   democracy or authoritarianism does not affect the numbers of foreign
   fighters from that country, the democratization process and democratic
   transition foster domestic political instability that in turn favors
   higher numbers of foreign fighters.},

Abstract = {This research paper will commence with an attempt to bifurcate the
   traditional theories of justice from its modern counterparts. Under the
   former category, works of the Greek philosophers like Plato and
   Aristotle will be analysed. The modern theories, on the other hand,
   would comprise of the utilitarian metric of Jeremy Bentham and J. S.
   Mill along with Rawls' difference principle and justice as fairness and
   would further bring out the differences in theories and approaches in
   general. In contrast to all this, the last few sections of this paper
   will be dedicated to Amartya Sen's approach to freedom, equality and
   justice and the reasons it provided for being a better metric for
   evaluating social justice as compared to former archaic alternative
   conceptualizations. It will try to determine the authenticity of the
   differentiation between `transcendental institutionalism' and
   `realization-focused comparison paradigms', the attributes or focal
   variables of the capability approach and its linkage to public reason,
   development and deliberative democracy. Thus, the paper will try to map
   the linear progression of the concept of justice along with its kindred
   concepts of liberty and equality and how this eventually resulted in the
   conceptualization of capability as `Samarthya' and `Sakshamta'.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of authoritarian legislatures underscore the importance
   of institutions for cooptation and information collection, but many
   still consider authoritarian legislatures rubber stamps in policy
   making. We argue that authoritarian legislatures could be important
   arenas of the contestation reflected in delegates' bills and proposals
   instead of their voting outcomes. Specifically, government agencies use
   authoritarian legislatures to build policy coalitions to advance their
   policy agendas. Delegates serve as proxy fighters for key party and
   government elites with different policy preferences. We provide evidence
   based on an original dataset containing education-related bills and
   policy proposals submitted to both Chinese national assemblies between
   1983 and 2007. We identify the existence of the policy coalitions, and
   find coalition building is more intensified prior to the promulgation of
   education-related laws. We then employ network analysis to illustrate
   the channels behind policy coalition network.},

Abstract = {Legislative gridlock is often viewed as a uniquely democratic
   phenomenon. The institutional checks and balances that produce gridlock
   are absent from authoritarian systems, leading many observers to
   romanticize ``authoritarian efficiency{''} and policy dynamism. A unique
   data set from the Chinese case demonstrates that authoritarian regimes
   can have trouble passing laws and changing policies-48\% of laws are not
   passed within the period specified in legislative plans, and about 12\%
   of laws take more than 10 years to pass. This article develops a theory
   that relates variation in legislative outcomes to the absence of
   division within the ruling coalition and citizen attention shocks.
   Qualitative analysis of China's Food Safety Law, coupled with shadow
   case studies of two other laws, illustrates the plausibility of the
   theoretical mechanisms. Division and public opinion play decisive roles
   in authoritarian legislative processes.},

Abstract = {Does the partisanship of officeholders affect environmental outcomes?
   The popular perception is that Republicans are bad for the environment,
   but complicating factors like federalism may limit this outcome. Using a
   dataset that tracks toxic releases over 20 years, we examine how
   partisan control of executive and legislative branches at both state and
   federal levels affect environmental policy. Moving beyond the passage of
   policies or environmental program spending allows us to fully understand
   the impact of Republicans on the environment. In addition, we take into
   account structural complications that may shape the relationship between
   Republican control and environmental outcomes. We find that the
   conventional wisdom that Republicans are bad for the environment has
   some validity, but it is dependent on what offices Republican elected
   officials occupy. More specifically, Republicans significantly affect
   toxic chemical releases when occupying governorships and controlling
   Congress. Our conclusions provide further insight into understanding how
   partisanship affects environmental outcomes, including how partisanship
   composition across the federal system matters.},

Abstract = {In virtue of their capacity forpoliticalagency, political agents can
   possess special rights, powers, and responsibilities, such as rights to
   political participation and freedom of speech. Traditionally, political
   theorists have assumed that only cognitively unimpaired adult humans are
   political agents, and thus that only those humans can be the bearers of
   these rights, powers, and responsibilities. However, recent work in
   animal rights theory has extended the concept of political agency to
   nonhuman animals. In this article, I develop an account of political
   agency that identifies the capacities that one must possess to be a
   political agent and captures the fact that political action is a
   distinctive type of action. Crucially, this account makes sense of the
   standard assumption that only some humans count as political agents, and
   explains why few nonhuman animals, human infants, and severely
   cognitively impaired humans are likely to possess the capacity for
   political agency. I go on to reject the view, recently advanced by Sue
   Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, that nonhuman animals can be
   `nonintentional political agents'. I conclude by suggesting that most
   nonhuman animals, as well as human infants and humans with severe
   cognitive impairments, cannot straightforwardly be assigned rights to
   political participation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses from a cultural perspective why, despite
   exacerbating income inequality, Chinese people are not in favour of
   income equality. I argue that the patriotic education campaign initiated
   in the 1990s encouraged citizens to sacrifice for the greater good of
   China and caused the Chinese to accept and adapt to a decrease in
   governmental welfare as well as lessening the demand for it, thus
   reducing the government's financial burden of welfare provision. I then
   test the hypothesis against the Asian Barometer Survey data. The
   statistical results support my assertion, suggesting that strong
   patriotic beliefs reduce the preference for social equality, and that
   private income and economic perspectives do not significantly stimulate
   the public demand for redistributive policies in China.},

   Associated with Increased Investments in Schools, Street and Traffic

Abstract = {In participatory budgeting (PB), residents instead of public officials
   decide how public money is spent. PB may reveal that residents
   prioritize different investments than public officials, which could lead
   to more socially just spending. However, little research has examined
   whether and how PB shifts spending priorities. This study leverages
   publicly available records on New York City council districts' capital
   project allocations over ten years (2009 through 2018), comparing
   spending within and across PB and non-PB districts. Multi-level
   regression models show that, on average, when council districts adopted
   PB, greater proportions of their discretionary capital budgets were
   allocated to schools, streets and traffic improvements, and public
   housing. PB was associated with decreases in spending on parks and
   recreation projects and housing preservation and development projects.
   The article shows that priorities shift when residents are directly
   involved in budgeting. Implications for equity and community well-being,
   and directions for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The EU offers a variety of access points through which interest groups
   can attempt to influence policy-making. In this paper, we analyze
   differences in the use of these access points, or venues, by interest
   groups. Considering the roles played by different EU institutions along
   the policy cycle, we argue that the venues differ by the extent to which
   they encourage lobbying from different interest groups. Analyzing survey
   responses by more than 700 European interest associations, we find that
   the distribution of access-seeking by business and non-business actors
   differs across venues. Reflecting its pivotal role at the pre-proposal
   stage, the Commission encourages non-business organizations to spend
   much of their finite lobbying resources. In the context of the European
   Parliament, non-business groups are not only interested in influencing
   its decisions, but also in connecting to ordinary Members of the
   European Parliament. Business groups, for their part, apply greater
   resources to the rapporteurs. Finally, we show that business groups also
   allocate their resources to regulatory agencies at the implementation
   stage in the policy process, where incomplete legislative contracts are
   finalized and non-business groups' resources are depleted.},

Title = {Allocation of teachers among public schools and minimization of cost:
   The case of public education in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Overall, in Sri Lankan public schools, the student-teacher ratio is very
   low. The number of teachers is considerably greater than the number of
   classes; sometimes the former is double or more than double the latter.
   In a school in which all the teachers are individually deployed in each
   class, many teachers have to remain idle. Thus, every day a certain
   number of teachers remain idle. This situation points to two issues.
   Firstly, in Sri Lankan public schools, resources are underutilized and
   hence costs are not minimized. Secondly, since there is an excess of
   teachers in schools, a formal and logical method is required to
   determine the optimal number of teachers. This article tries to develop
   a formula to determine the required number of teachers for a school, and
   thereby to find ways to minimize costs when employing teachers. Primary
   data on classes, teachers and subjects offered with respect to 40 public
   schools in the North Central Province were collected. When empirical
   data on the number of teachers in sampled schools were compared with
   calculated teacher requirements in terms of the developed formula, it
   was found that school authorities are underutilizing teachers. The
   article concludes that (a) based on the developed formula to determine
   the required number of teachers, many public schools have an excess of
   teachers and hence current transfer policy for school teachers is not
   logical, (b) teacher requirement can be decided according to the
   developed formula and (c) by adopting one teacher-two subjects-one
   school and one teacher-one subject-more schools models, government
   authorities can minimize costs further.},

   Latin America},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Contexts outside the advanced developed democracies present a challenge
   to assessing how well party systems reflect voter preferences across
   over-arching policy dimensions because not all electorates readily
   interpret political conflict in dimensional terms. In this contribution,
   I advocate an approach suited for such contexts that combines deductive
   and inductive elements: It starts out with what observers consider the
   most important dividing lines in a party system, and then goes on to
   operationalize these dimensions in an inductive fashion by drawing on
   all theoretically relevant items that are available in mass and elite
   surveys. I devise arelative-fitmeasure of responsiveness that can be
   compared across space and time, even if positions at the elite and mass
   levels are measured on different scales. To illustrate the usefulness of
   the strategy, I show how it leads to novel contrasts in terms of
   programmatic responsiveness among four Latin American countries, namely
   Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, and Bolivia.},

Abstract = {The extensive scholarship devoted to the congruence of mass-elite policy
   preferences lacks consensus about the meaning, comparison, and
   measurement across political settings. This makes comparisons difficult
   and raises obstacles to advancing the debates. This symposium aims to
   identify the diversity of methodological choices and to reflect
   systematically on several key choices of particular importance in
   understanding the congruence. The contributions to the symposium compare
   and contrast how several types of measurement fare in diverse political
   contexts in Eastern Europe, Latin America, North Africa, and East Asia,
   and what we can learn from those methodological choices.},

Abstract = {Courts' legal-constitutional authority, strategic interactions with
   elected branches, and ideational factors are acknowledged as rival
   theoretical frameworks of judicial power, i.e. courts' legal and
   practical power to make and enforce decisions, including politically
   assertive ones. This article presents an alternative explanation for
   judicial power and assertiveness, arguing that judicial power can be
   endogenous to judicial processes, as legal-constitutional authority,
   strategic interactions, and ideational shifts are rooted in the
   unfolding of a judicialized political conflict. The article assesses the
   sources of judicial power by examining the Colombian Supreme Court's
   rulings and off-bench activism during the parapolitics scandal, in the
   course of which the Court investigated about one-third of Congress. It
   finds the parapolitics process itself redefined the justices' interests,
   self-perceptions, and, consequently, limits of jurisdiction.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the forms and results related to the instruments
   of participatory democracy in the National Constitutional Assembly and
   in the 1988 Constitution. For this purpose, the main documents that
   report this participation are examined. It is a qualitative approach,
   formalized in two strategies: (i) selective review of the material
   available in the Brazilian literature and in the Congress database (ii)
   case study of bills resulting from popular initiative presented since
   the creation of the Institution in 1988 and 2013 with the verification
   of how many proposed bills were converted into law and how this process
   occurs. The main results reveal a very insignificant application of the
   instruments of right judgment, with a total of 07 bills presented where
   only 05 were converted into law. As a main conclusion, the instruments
   of popular initiative to amend the Constitution, the plebiscite and the
   referendum are participatory instruments almost unknown to Brazilian
   voters, whose practice would strengthen our young democracy. We point
   lege ferenda to the need for a constitutional reform that removes the
   obstacles that currently hinder the exercise of participatory democracy.

Abstract = {Parliamentary governments often use their powers opportunistically to
   enhance their reelection chances. Yet, how they combine the two most
   commonly available strategies-economic manipulation prior to elections
   and opportunistic election timing-remains poorly understood. Do
   incumbents employ these powers jointly, or does the power to time
   elections temper incentives to engage in distortive economic
   manipulation? Previous research gives contradictory answers to these
   questions. We advance the debate by presenting the first cross-national
   comparative analysis of the effects of opportunistic election timing on
   economic manipulation, drawing on data from 20 developed parliamentary
   democracies. Our results demonstrate a powerful substitution effect:
   when leaders can time elections, they are significantly less likely to
   manipulate the economy. This finding not only clarifies the theoretical
   debate, it also has practical implications for political reforms that
   aim to prevent incumbents from distorting elections in their favor.},

Title = {Are electoral autocracies better for the poor? Evidence from social
   assistance programs},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Autocratic elections occur on uneven playing fields, yet their regular
   contestation compels ruling parties to pay attention to citizens'
   demands. This claim is at the heart of research linking multiparty
   elections in autocracies to improvements in human development. Recent
   work, however, casts doubt on the theoretical and empirical basis of
   such claims. This paper addresses this debate by focusing specifically
   on the adoption of social assistance programs, an often theorized but
   seldom examined link in the chain connecting electoral autocracy with
   improvements in human development. I demonstrate that electoral
   autocracies are more likely to adopt these programs than closed
   autocracies and that the impact largely works through within-country
   changes in the presence of electoral authoritarianism. The results are
   consistent with the argument that such regimes are more responsive to
   citizens' demands. However, they also remind researchers that the goal
   of such regimes is to win elections; there is little preventing them
   from crafting targeted social policies that secure the loyalty of the
   voting public but without the attendant improvements in broad measures
   of human development. I conclude with suggestions for how future
   research can better understand how authoritarian governance shapes
   development outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new, monthly updated dataset on organized
   violence-the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Candidate Events Dataset. It
   contains recent observations of candidate events, a majority of which

   Georeferenced Event Dataset as part of its annual update after a careful
   vetting process. We describe the definitions, sources and procedures
   employed to code the candidate events, and a set of issues that emerge
   when coding data on organized violence in near-real time. Together, the
   Uppsala Conflict Data Program Candidate and Georeferenced Event Datasets
   minimize an inherent trade-off between update speed and quality control.
   Having monthly updated conflict data is advantageous for users needing
   near-real time monitoring of violent situations and aiming to anticipate
   future developments. To demonstrate this, we show that including them in
   a conflict forecasting system yields distinct improvements in terms of
   predictive performance: Average precision increases by 20-40\% relative
   to using the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset
   only. We also show that to ensure quality and consistency, revisiting
   the initial coding making use of sources that become available later is
   absolutely necessary.},

Abstract = {Judicial protection of disfavored minorities against oppressive
   legislation in majoritarian separation-of-power systems raises a puzzle:
   Why don't legislative majorities enacting discriminatory legislation
   curb judicial power when judges use their power to protect minorities
   and stymie the legislation? We answer this question by showing that
   judicial protection of disfavored minorities can emerge as an unintended
   by-product of majoritarian politics. We develop a model that includes
   the two aspects of judicial review Alexander Hamilton discusses inThe
   FederalistNo. 78: Judicial protection of disfavored minorities against
   hostile popular majorities, and judicial protection of majority
   interests against legislative depredation. It is the institutional
   linkage between these functions that induces popular majorities, within
   limits, to side with judges against legislatures even when those judges
   protect minorities that popular majorities want to oppress.},

Abstract = {The 2014 European Parliament election and the 2016 Constitutional
   Referendum in Italy occurred in the middle of two general elections.
   These votes, taking place respectively at the beginning and the end of
   the government led by Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party (PD),
   represented a public test of the PD leadership. The election results
   were diverse in many respects, but they replicate social, economic,
   political, and cultural differences. In particular, between the two
   electoral exercises the differential electoral behaviour of South
   compared with the rest of the country is deepened. Moreover, the results
   can be interpreted as the outcome of differences in age, educational
   levels, social, and economic unrest; all these variables are synthesized
   by the territorial distribution of the vote and this helps in
   interpreting the evolution of political sentiment in Italy. A spatial
   statistics methodology is utilized to analyse votes by means of their
   territorial distributions. The outcomes indicate that referendum result
   was influenced by the economic vote. Apart from the substance of the
   constitutional reform, the referendum result can be traced back to
   economic factors: the absence of perceived economic improvements and the
   persistence of high unemployment.},

Abstract = {Using both a cross-national data set on parties' accountability
   strategies and public opinion survey data, this article provides a
   systematic analysis of how parties' reliance on clientelistic strategies
   correlates with citizen evaluations of regime performance. Our analyses
   suggest that in systems where parties in general rely more heavily on
   clientelism, principles of democratic equality are undermined, and
   citizens on average express a lower level of satisfaction. In addition
   to democratic norms, material benefits are also closely related to
   citizens' regime evaluations. Within countries, supporters of parties
   that make substantial clientelistic efforts are more satisfied than
   other citizens, because they are likely to be beneficiaries of this
   accountability mode. This within-country gap between clientelistic and
   non-clientelistic parties' supporters widens where the clientelistic
   parties deliver benefits more effectively and in countries with lower
   overall democratic quality.},

Abstract = {Bandura is a unique Ukrainian national folk instrument. The analysis of
   the history of the bandura shows that bandura art appeared in the
   sixteenth century among Cossacks who struggled for freedom, independence
   and unity of the Ukrainian nation. The repertoire of Cossack bandurists
   who later became professional bandura players, reflected not only
   important historical events but also all the aspects of Ukrainian life.
   At all times bandurists songs answered the most important question for
   every nation - who are we? Bandurists songs formed self-consciousness of
   the Ukrainian people and contributed to the transformation of Ukrainian
   ethnos into a nation. Thus, the bandura art has become an important
   feature of the Ukrainian national identity and the bandura itself - the
   musical symbol of - Ukrainian nation.},

Abstract = {Conventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter
   adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through
   the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The
   imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the
   establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by
   problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a
   diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these
   challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success
   in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening
   retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an
   alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary
   states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of
   altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and
   works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that
   disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.},

Abstract = {The Liberal-National Coalition success in the 2019 Australian federal
   election surprised many observers, with the opinion polls consistently
   predicting a Labor victory. The election was notable for Labor's
   proposals for wide-ranging tax changes, a historically unpopular Labor
   leader, and the fourth change of prime minister outside an election
   since 2010. Using the 2019 Australian Election Study, we test the
   influence of two models of voting, the first based on ideology together
   with an emphasis on policy, and the second on performance. The results
   show that performance was the dominant explanation for the result, with
   evaluations of party competence and leader popularity playing a major
   role in explaining voting behaviour in the election, both of which
   benefitted the Coalition.},

Abstract = {Contemporary and retrospective evaluation of Theresa May's premiership
   inevitably focuses on the division, drift and indecision which
   characterized it. However, this article argues that although such
   narratives have considerable validity, they miss an important aspect of
   the May `project', namely, its attempt to shift the contemporary
   Conservative Party's ideology in a `One Nation' direction in rhetoric if
   not necessarily in deed. The article begins with a conceptual and
   historical analysis of One Nation Conservatism and then places May
   within this tradition, principally through consideration of key
   statements she made as Prime Minister. It, therefore, adds an original
   perspective both on May's government and on the ideological analysis of
   One Nation Conservatism, building on the existing literature.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {American political parties frequently advance contradictory arguments in
   policy debates, but scholars know relatively little about where these
   arguments originate. Outside research-producing institutions are likely
   culprits. Have the research and advocacy efforts of these groups helped
   structure policy discussions along party lines, thereby contributing to
   partisan polarization? I answer this question by tracing the diffusion
   of policy language related to cap-and-trade regulations across actors
   and over time. Utilizing quantitative network and text analysis
   techniques, as well as qualitative textual analysis, I find that outside
   groups inform policy discussions through their early research. First,
   prominent organizations develop ideas and talking points that then
   spread to other groups. Second, members of Congress adopt these talking
   points and use them to justify their views to their constituents.
   Importantly, the diffusion of arguments is most likely among actors with
   shared partisan commitments, resulting in two relatively cohesive and
   distinct partisan communities that advance partisan policy narratives.
   These findings have important implications for our understanding of
   partisan polarization, outside group influence, and the capacity for
   Congress to address meaningful public problems.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes NATO's digital public activities during the
   COVID-19 crisis. Results demonstrate that NATO promoted a coherent
   narrative online that highlighted solidarity among Alliance members and
   showcased NATO's contribution to national COVID-19 efforts. Moreover,
   results demonstrate that messages which projected a reassuring emotional
   tone were well received by digital publics. However, findings also
   suggest that NATO has proved less successful in creatively leveraging
   digital technologies toward public engagement. As virtual events are
   likely to become more important in the future, NATO's public diplomacy
   needs to adapt and identify identify innovative methods for facilitating

Abstract = {The political underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in
   Canadian politics is well documented. One political arena that has yet
   to be examined in this respect, however, is school boards. Using data
   from a candidate survey conducted during the course of the 2018 Ontario
   school board elections, as well as demographic data collected on the
   entire population of school board candidates, we explore the unique
   characteristics of school board elections. The research note begins by
   describing the gender and racial composition of candidates and trustees
   in Canada's most populous province. It then considers the ways in which
   school board elections may serve as a launchpad to higher office for
   either of these two traditionally underrepresented groups, as we explore
   the features of progressive political ambition, recruitment into school
   board campaigns and the relative electoral success of racialized
   candidates and women in this local office. While women do very well in
   school board elections, they are significantly less likely than their
   male counterparts to have the desire to move up to provincial or federal
   politics. Meanwhile, racialized candidates contest school board election
   in significant numbers and report similar levels of progressive ambition
   relative to their white counterparts, but they fare exceptionally poorly
   in school board elections.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the weak points of the Manifesto Project's
   methodology, such as its emphasis on issue salience, instead of issue
   positions; bringing the content of manifestos under too broad categories
   formulated at the beginning of the project; not quite the appropriate
   technique of factor analysis etc. An alternative methodology is proposed
   that focuses on party positions on issues which generate the largest
   polarization in the political space. It also enriches the empirical base
   of the studies and adjusts the technique of factor analysis. In order to
   reveal political cleavages inside these dimensions, the so called
   electoral cleavages (factors of territorial differences in voting for
   various parties) are taken as a starting point: factor loadings of
   parties in the electoral and political spaces are compared through
   correlation and regression analyses. The proposed methodology is applied
   to an analysis of election results in Russia (2016) and Germany (2017).},

Abstract = {Legislatures are complex institutions that serve many purposes. While
   their overall roles vary in different political systems, they typically
   serve multiple functions, including representation, law making, scrutiny
   of government, public symbolism, and others. These inevitably overlap
   and sometimes collide; similarly, individual legislators must balance
   party, constituency, and personal factors in their decision making. Now,
   in a time of sudden and unexpected disruption amid the COVID-19
   pandemic, the Parliament of Canada has been forced to rethink its
   complex activities under urgent and unexpected new conditions.},

Abstract = {There is abounding literature on nationalism and the state that deals
   with the tensions between the primordial and the civic. The bordered
   state or the legal `power container' more often than not is the
   container of a people/s who refuse to be contained within the
   geographical and cultural borders imposed by the state. The legality of
   the legal indeed remains a big question. The geographical boundaries of
   the post-colonial states often do not match the cultural boundaries of
   the newly created states. South Asia carried this colonial legacy of
   boundary mismatch through its state crafting process. Borders and
   boundaries are often looked upon as this side and that side; rather than
   a sanctified territory. Borders also become conduits of passage to
   safety when a group of people living within a bordered land called a
   nation-state find themselves borderless within those borders, since the
   state's ethno-cultural borders or frontiers refuse to accommodate the
   frontiers of the former. This article is an examination of the hopes,
   aspirations and moving ahead of the Rohingya people through the voices
   of the Rohingya refugee women in Bangladesh as they carve out their
   spaces as a people both cognitive and physical in a land which is not
   theirs; for a land which they claim to be their own.},

Title = {A voter-centric explanation of the success of ideological candidates for
   the US house},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, ideological candidates for the U.S. House have become
   increasingly successful, to the point where their chances of being
   elected are indistinguishable from moderates. However, scholars have
   still not uncovered exactly why this is happening. Using survey data
   from the American National Election Studies, I find that voter-centric
   explanations of vote choice - a voter's partisanship, ideology, and
   presidential approval rating - have increasingly predicted their vote
   choice in U.S. House elections from 1980 to 2016. Using data on
   candidate ideology, I find that candidate ideology is an increasingly
   poor predictor of individual vote choice over time. Original
   experimental data supports these claims, finding only a small electoral
   advantage for moderates, compared to ideologues of their own party, and
   evidence suggesting that, at least among Democrats, ideological
   candidates are rated more favorably than moderates. Taken together,
   these results suggest that the increased electoral success of
   ideological candidates can be attributed to changes in voters' decision
   calculus, rather than structural or candidate-centric explanations.},

Abstract = {Much like Brexit, the Greek bailout referendum of 2015 could have been a
   watershed event that significantly affected the European Economic and
   Monetary Union and possibly the European Union as a whole. While the
   referendum did not live up to the hype, the fact remains that the Greek
   people decided to risk `exit' and reject their international creditors'
   bailout terms. In this article, we explore how the cycle of sovereign
   debt crisis, the externally imposed austerity and the resulting
   recession affected the outcome of that referendum. We further provide a
   limited test for the `left-behind' hypothesis, which has been a
   prominent explanation for recent `unexpected' or `surprising' choices
   that have been made at the polls. Using municipality data and novel data
   sources, such as night-time light transmission, we provide
   aggregate-level support for our expectations.},

Abstract = {In light of growing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Saudi
   Arabia, the search for a formula of security in the five small Gulf
   States-Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates
   (UAE)-has become a complex issue. The question that arises is how these
   small Gulf States can maintain security and stability in the prevailing
   scenario. As the weaknesses of the small Gulf States tends to polarize
   the region even more, it is argued that a hedging strategy can best
   capture the security dilemma that the small Gulf States are facing. This
   article examines how the five small Gulf States are facing the current
   security dilemma by following (or not) a hedging strategy. The results
   of a qualitative content analysis of news articles, official
   government's documents, and academic literature show that the Gulf
   States vary in warmth toward Iran or Saudi Arabia. Oman, and to a lesser
   extent Kuwait, seem to have good relations with both sides. Qatar
   currently enjoys relatively warm relations with Iran, while the UAE and
   Bahrain lean more toward the Saudi side.},

Abstract = {Ebola emerged on U.S. soil during the 2014 midterm election campaign,
   and the threat of infectious disease became prominent in political
   rhetoric. African immigrant communities experienced stigma and suspicion
   during the outbreak. This study investigates the implications of this
   epidemic on immigration attitudes. We fielded a survey experiment during
   the Ebola crisis with a sample of 3881 adults in the United States to
   examine the conditions under which global health threats affect domestic
   attitudes on immigration. Contrary to expectations, we find that the
   mere mention of Ebola has no effect on immigration attitudes, even when
   the identity of the Ebola carrier is described as an African traveler
   into the United States. Our results show, however, that politicizing the
   crisis can lead to more exclusionary attitudes toward immigrants. This
   finding is driven by partisanship: views of immigration were
   significantly more negative when Republican participants read a
   statement by a Republican politician critical of President Obama's Ebola
   response. The study has implications for future epidemics, including the
   important role political entrepreneurs can play in shaping public
   perceptions during a disease outbreak. The results raise concerns about
   how political rhetoric surrounding disease can have both short-term and
   longer term consequences for vulnerable populations.},

Abstract = {How does engagement with markets affect socioeconomic values and
   political preferences? A long line of thinkers has debated the nature
   and direction of such effects, but claims are difficult to assess
   empirically because market engagement is endogenous. We designed a large
   field experiment to evaluate the impact of financial markets, which have
   grown dramatically in recent decades. Participants from a national
   sample in England received substantial sums they could invest over a
   6-week period. We assigned them into several treatments designed to
   distinguish between different theoretical channels of influence. Results
   show that investment in stocks led to a more right-leaning outlook on
   issues such as merit and deservingness, personal responsibility, and
   equality. Subjects also shifted to the right on policy questions. These
   results appear to be driven by growing familiarity with, and decreasing
   distrust of markets. The spread of financial markets thus has important
   and underappreciated political ramifications.},

Abstract = {Despite secularisation, there is growing recognition that some religious
   parties continue to influence elections and the formation of policy in
   several countries. What explains why religious parties persist in some
   countries but not others? This study tests an argument holding that
   religious diversification promotes political cooperation and therefore
   reduces the number of religious parties. Using a data set of religious
   parties across advanced industrial democracies between 1945 and 2011,
   this paper analyses this argument and finds that religious diversity
   puts downward pressure on the number of religious parties over time.},

Abstract = {The February 2020 general election will be remembered as the
   ``change{''} election, when the two dominant parties of Irish politics,
   Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, trailed behind Sinn Fein in voters'
   preferences for the first time. However, for the gender balance of Irish
   politics, much remained unchanged. While the number of women elected to
   Dail eireann increased by one, this marginal growth since the 2016
   general election was deemed a disappointment by analysts and advocates
   alike. A review of candidacy reveals that Fianna Fail and Fine Gael lag
   behind other parties in terms of the proportion of women selected and
   rely on the `add-on' route to shore up their female candidacy base. The
   success rates of female candidates were markedly lower than those of
   their male counterparts in the Labour party, Greens, Fianna Fail and
   Fine Gael. However, the election was a good outing for women in the
   Social Democrats and Sinn Fein, and especially for Mary Lou McDonald,
   who became the first woman to lead a party to top-spot in an Irish
   general election. The legislative gender quota continued to play an
   integral role in ensuring a critical mass of women were selected to
   contest the general election. In many respects, 2020 was a consolidation
   election for the gender quota as it fits-in and integrates into party
   candidate selection processes. Yet, with just 22.5\% of the seats in
   Dail eireann occupied by women, the legislative gender quota should be
   viewed as the start rather than the culmination of efforts to support
   women's candidacy and election.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the relationship between time and the figure of
   the citizen, where the citizen is understood in relational terms to the
   migrant. The article examines a stalled or interrupted flow of time that
   characterises the experience of certain migrants and citizens alike.
   This is time experienced as waiting for the fulfillment of citizenship.
   The article goes on to show how a progressive temporal narrative of
   citizenship-to-come obscures the effective denial of citizenship. While
   citizenship remains a key aspiration for those who lack its full or
   partial protections, it may not represent the ultimate horizon for
   struggles concerned with questions of border justice. With this
   proposition in mind, the article speculates on alternative horizons that
   may be emerging organically within struggles that refuse the
   citizen/migrant divide as a basis for imagining collective political
   futures.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to bridge the gap between social and religious
   explanations for Islamist radicalisation in the West by understanding
   the role of religion through the under-utilised perspective of sociology
   of religious emotions and Wiktorowicz's concept of cognitive openness.
   The article draws on interviews with 23 different actors with first-hand
   knowledge of Islamist radicalisation, and analyses five in-depth
   interviews with former so-called radicals, four of whom were converts to
   Islam. The analysis thus has a special focus on the narratives and
   experiences of converts to radical Islamist worldviews. The
   radicalisation process of the formers was characterised by an interplay
   between context specific experiences and individual religiosity. There
   are social causes for seeking religion as it can provide an emotional
   meaningfulness in a state of cognitive openness connected to personal
   family social background, which can stretch over a long period. However,
   the interviews also show that religiosity affects the social: the
   religious emotions within radical Islamist groups create a tight-knit
   community of self-perceived righteous believers, tied to an emotional

Abstract = {After the 2016 presidential election, there has been a wave of increased
   interest in running for office that has been anecdotally associated with
   anger and fear about the election outcome. Although there is a growing
   literature that seeks to understand how emotion matters for political
   action, particularly as it pertains to voting behavior, we do not know
   how emotions factor into one's interest in running for office. In this
   study, we use data from the Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election
   Survey to examine the relationship between political ambition and
   feelings surrounding the 2016 election season. In accordance with
   previous literature, we expect that resources still matter for political
   participation, but that emotions like anger and fear will also have an
   impact on political behavior.},

Abstract = {Analysis of primary survey data collected among university students in
   Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan shows that China's
   surging influence is felt by locals in Greater Central Asia (GCA). If
   China continues to interact more through the bazaars and road
   constructions, it will embed itself deeper into the local imaginations.
   The future elites of GCA might not necessarily see the rising influence
   of China in the framework of ``great game{''} competition between Russia
   and China. Rather, China's relations with GCA is just back to a kind of
   ``new normal{''} which both regions had enjoyed back in the 19th
   century.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author approaches one of the tension points within
   the problematics of Islam and liberal understanding of human rights -
   freedom of religion in opposition to the death penalty for apostasy in
   Islam. The author critically approaches the extreme interpretation of
   Islam - within which the death penalty for apostasy is practiced as one
   of the characteristics of Medina ideal - and, by adopting Tibi's term,
   dismisses their attempts of revival of Prophet Muhammad's time as ``the
   invention of tradition{''}. Relying on progressive Islamic thought, the
   author approaches this problematics from two directions: first, through
   examination of the death penalty sources in Islam: Qur'an and the
   tradition of Prophet Muhammad, and second, through dismissal of the
   death penalty for apostasy as a practice which is contradictory to the
   idea of human rights.},

Abstract = {Despite the growth of scholarship on Chinese outward foreign direct
   investment, we still know little about the determinants of it at the
   subnational level within developing countries. This article seeks to
   fill that gap in the literature through a study of Chinese investment
   across 31 Mexican states and Mexico City (formerly the Federal
   District). Focusing on the period of 2004 to 2014, the analysis employs
   a two-part estimation method to understand why Chinese firms select some
   Mexican states for investment, and what drives the level of investment
   among states selected. The first part is estimated with pooled logistic
   and Firth logistic regression with adjustments for serial correlation.
   The second stage equations are estimated with pooled OLS with
   panel-corrected and Driscoll-Kray standard errors, and adjustments for
   serial correlation. We find that market size, education, and partisan
   control in state government exhibit an influence on both the selection
   stage and the level of foreign direct investment. The presence of
   deep-water ports in a state is also important in the selection stage.
   After controlling for these influences, the models suggest that mining
   resources, homicides, unionization, state taxes, and other factors have
   no significant effect in either stage.},

Abstract = {A factor that may account for the largely unanticipated victory of
   Brexit in 2016 is the difference in engagement, mobilization, and,
   ultimately, turnout between those for whom the question of Brexit was a
   valence issue (a dry and almost technical question of determining the
   policies by which uncontroversial shared ends can be achieved) and those
   for whom it was a positional issue (a question of raw, almost visceral,
   political preference). The declining appeal of valence politics may
   reveal a phenomenon that goes beyond Brexit and Britain: a change in the
   nature and character of contemporary electoral competition that may help
   to explain the newly resurgent populism characteristic of Western
   liberal democracies.},

Abstract = {Gender inequality as a phenomenon is also present in academic writing
   and publishing. In this article, we review the gender imbalance in the
   percentage of authors and reviewers in EPS from 2015 to 2019. At the
   submissions stage, male authors submit approximately twice as many
   manuscripts compared to female authors. At the publication stage, there
   is less of a gender difference due to a higher success rate for female
   authors. For reviewers, however, the gender discrepancies are even
   wider. At the invitation stage, we invited only roughly four women to
   review for every ten men. When it comes to completed reviews, the gap
   widens to roughly three women for ten men. Our findings show that we
   still have a long way to go to achieve parity in the review process. We
   suggest that parity in the review process is not independent of more
   women scholars being promoted to higher level academic positions.},

Abstract = {Candidate-selection methods (CSM) crucially affect the behavior of
   Members of Parliament (MPs). Extant research investigates the
   consequentiality of the selectorate, but is neglecting the candidacy
   dimension of CSM. But what are the behavioral implications of minimal
   candidacy-eligibility criteria (CEC)? I theorize that parties adopt
   closed CEC in safe districts to ensure nominating loyalist candidates,
   while they use open CEC in contested districts to attract entrepreneur
   candidates able to woo decisive swing voters. Using survey and
   observational data from Japan, where parties have concurrently been
   nominating candidates through open and more closed CEC, I show that
   entrepreneur candidates are more responsive to their districts but less
   active in the legislature, measured by different types of activities.
   These findings corroborate my expectations that entrepreneur candidates
   lack political experience and are sidelined by their more traditional
   colleagues. Moreover, the results broaden our understanding of how CSM
   affect MPs' behavior.},

Abstract = {Using low information rationality, citizens can compensate for their
   lack of political knowledge by turning to experts to help interpret and
   economize information. However, citizens must navigate a political media
   environment that is oversaturated with unqualified sources and competing
   cues, leading some scholars to question whether individuals are willing
   or able to utilize low-information rationality effectively. Much prior
   work focuses on partisan motivated reasoning, asserting that the
   influence of partisanship overwhelms that of other relevant
   informational cues. This is refuted by a relatively smaller subset of
   works, finding that the influence of partisanship is often diminished by
   contextual cues. I address this debate with two experimental designs
   that place source cues in a competing context by simultaneously
   manipulating expertise-related cues and partisan cues. I find that
   individuals do take source expertise and credibility into account, even
   when confronted with competing partisan source cues, helping to somewhat
   mitigate partisan biases.},

Abstract = {Gatekeepers are those in a position to recognize, in others, potentially
   problematic presenting issues, and who are willing and able to connect
   those persons to relevant service providers. In the domain of violence
   prevention, they represent a network of those who can serve as `first
   responders' with respect to helping those in need. Therefore, it is
   important to understand both the facilitators and inhibitors of
   gatekeeper intervention, or what has been termed `vicarious
   help-seeking:' the intent to help others who appear in need of help, but
   who are not actively seeking help. The present set of studies
   demonstrated both an expansion of the theory of vicarious help-seeking
   and a replication of its original four tenets (Part 1). Part 2 examined
   how gatekeepers would prefer to intervene in a violence prevention
   context: their natural inclinations with respect to doing so. Part 3
   examined reasons preventing gatekeepers from reaching out to a
   third-party for assistance. Part 4 further examined who - in addition to
   friends - might be most influential/effective, as gatekeepers.},

Title = {Violence, Empathy and Altruism: Evidence from the Ivorian Refugee Crisis
   in Liberia},

Abstract = {In regions plagued by reoccurring periods of war, violence and
   displacement, how does past exposure to violence affect altruism toward
   members of different ethnic or religious groups? Drawing on theories of
   empathy-driven altruism in psychology, this article proposes that
   violence can increase individuals' capacity to empathize with others,
   and that empathy born of violence can in turn motivate helping behavior
   across group boundaries. This hypothesis is tested using data on the
   hosting behavior of roughly 1,500 Liberians during the 2010-11 Ivorian
   refugee crisis in eastern Liberia, a region with a long history of
   cross-border, inter-ethnic violence. Consistent with its theoretical
   predictions, the study finds that those who experienced violence during
   the Liberian civil war host greater numbers of refugees, exhibit
   stronger preferences for distressed refugees and less bias against
   outgroup refugees, and host a higher proportion of non-coethnic,
   non-coreligious and distressed refugees. These findings suggest that
   violence does not necessarily lead to greater antagonism toward
   outgroups, as is often assumed, and that in some circumstances it can
   actually promote inter-group co-operation.},

Abstract = {To understand May `68 (in Paris, but not only), context is necessary. As
   it happens I was there, during, before and after. This life experience
   has been marked by the emergence of a ``new left{''} in the US and in
   France and, to a lesser degree, similarly motivated movements in Germany
   and in Czechoslovakia. This article revisits my experience through a
   discussion of the concept of a ``new left,{''} which while intuitively
   evident is conceptually slippery: it does not refer to the immediate
   experience of a generation born into the emerging prosperity of the
   postwar West; and it assumes that a left will always and necessarily
   exist in modern societies. Here I describe my own experiences as a
   participant in that movement prior to the breche that took place in May
   `68, and suggest some of the implications of the new possibilities that
   it opened.},

Title = {An Analysis on Changing Security Policies of Turkey after the July 15th
   Coup Attempt},

Abstract = {Turkey's security policies have been largely a result of its historical
   and political experiences. The July 15th (2016) coup attempt indicates a
   turning point in Turkey's security policies as it has been strategically
   important in shaping the political, structural, and bureaucratic
   structure of the country. A number of reasons would be mentioned in this
   account. The failed attempt reiterated the need for making swift reforms
   in its institutionalization and capacity-building with regard to
   security priorities. As a result, Turkey has got to make certain reforms
   on its security strategies and state structure. Elimination of the
   members and elements of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETO)
   initiating the coup attempt have become the first priority at the list.
   Secondly, dismissal of the personnel from nearly every state and
   government agency has been the second measure. Finally, certain reforms
   have been implemented in re-structuring the state, the army, and
   security organizations alike. This paper aims to present and eventually
   interpret the changes on the security policies of Turkey after the July
   15th coup attempt; then the policies are analyzed through the reports
   produced by think tank organizations. Among these, the relevant reports
   of Istanbul Policy Center (IPC) and SETA are examined in order to
   analyze possible effects of the changes, and a contingency analysis is
   done through those reports. The main purpose of the study is to analyze
   how Turkey changed its security policies and what are the concurrent
   results of these changes. Having done so, this study purposes to reveal
   pros and cons of the changes together with pertinent solutions and
   suggestions. Consequently, the findings of Turkey would have the
   prospect to draw lessons for other nations and systems to learn.},

Abstract = {Political realism is frequently criticised as a theoretical tradition
   that amounts to little more than a rationalisation of the status quo and
   an apology for power. This paper responds to this criticism by defending
   three connected claims. First, it acknowledges the moral seriousness of
   rationalisation, but argues that the problem is hardly particular to
   political realists. Second, it argues that classical International
   Relations realists like EH Carr and Hans Morgenthau have a profound
   awareness of the corrupting effects of rationalisation and see realism
   as an antidote to this problem. Third, it proposes that Carr and
   Morgenthau can help us to recognise the particular ways in which realist
   arguments may nonetheless rationalise existing power relations and
   affirm the status quo by default, if not by design.},

Abstract = {This paper applies statistical analysis techniques on the 574 royal
   decree laws approved in Spain between 1979 and 2018. It studies the
   frequency of their use, their extension, complexity and impact on the
   legal system, as well as the subsequent parliamentary procedure and the
   level of litigiousness before the Constitutional Court. Correlations are
   sought between these elements and the economic and
   political-institutional context in which decree laws are issued. The
   results clearly show an impact of the financial crisis in the approval
   of decree-laws in given matters, in their length and in their impact on
   the legal system. It is also observed that a greater parliamentary
   fragmentation moderately favours decrees law to be introduced as bills
   and, on the contrary, decree laws approved by governments with absolute
   majority are more frequently challenged in court. The results of the
   analysis are the basis for raising critical concerns and proposals for
   improvement.},

Abstract = {An insider threat can take on many forms and fall under different
   categories. This includes malicious insider,
   careless/unaware/uneducated/naive employee, and the third-party
   contractor. Machine learning techniques have been studied in published
   literature as a promising solution for such threats. However, they can
   be biased and/or inaccurate when the associated dataset is hugely
   imbalanced. Therefore, this article addresses the insider threat
   detection on an extremely imbalanced dataset which includes employing a
   popular balancing technique known as spread subsample. The results show
   that although balancing the dataset using this technique did not improve
   performance metrics, it did improve the time taken to build the model
   and the time taken to test the model. Additionally, the authors realised
   that running the chosen classifiers with parameters other than the
   default ones has an impact on both balanced and imbalanced scenarios,
   but the impact is significantly stronger when using the imbalanced
   dataset.},

Abstract = {What connects the political thinker and historian Alexis de Tocqueville
   (1805-1859) to China? Hitherto, scholars have answered this question by
   looking into references to China in his Democracy in America and The Old
   Regime and the Revolution or by applying insights from his works to
   issues of democratization. This article seeks to move beyond these
   ``Tocquevillian perspectives on China{''} and instead foregrounds
   ``Chinese perspectives on Tocqueville{''}: How did Chinese thinkers
   understand Tocqueville in reform China (post-1978)? Building on existing
   research that has analyzed Tocqueville as a thinker concerned with
   transition rather than with democratization per se, this article posits
   that Chinese intellectuals interpreted Tocqueville to warn against the
   dangers of ``failed transition{''} after the suppression of the
   Tiananmen demonstrations and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
   Swayed by the Tocquevillian paradox of reform, they identified the
   French and Anglo-American ``models{''} as ``cases{''} from which general
   lessons could be drawn. The article further posits that the renewed
   interest in Tocqueville in the 2010s was also marked by the specter of
   failed transition. Later, readers and officials pinpointed the rise of
   social inequality as a potentially destabilizing factor. Finally, the
   article sheds light on these contemporary readings of Tocqueville
   against the broader background of the history of liberalism in China.},

Abstract = {This article explores empirically how different types of labor market
   inequality affect policy preferences in post-industrial societies. I
   argue that the two main conceptualizations of labor market vulnerability
   identified in the insider-outsider literature are complementary: labor
   market risks are shaped by both labor market status-whether an
   individual is unemployed, in a temporary or permanent contract-and
   occupational unemployment-whether an individual is in an occupation with
   high or low unemployment. As a result, both status and occupation are
   important determinants of individual labor market policy preferences. In
   this paper, I first briefly conceptualize the link between labor market
   divides, risks and policy preferences, and then use cross-national
   survey data to investigate the determinants of preferences.},

Abstract = {Analyzing data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (N =
   4573; August-September 2017), the study considers the influence of
   experience with gender discrimination, perceptions of gender differences
   between men and women, and the personal importance of gender conformity
   on support for transgender identity and societal acceptance of
   transgender individuals. While controlling for demographics, political
   and religious predispositions, values, and social contact, the results
   suggest that those who have experienced gender discrimination are more
   likely to support transgender identity and the argument that society has
   not gone far enough in terms of transgender acceptance. These
   individuals exhibit group empathy and express solidarity and a shared
   experience with their transgender counterparts. In contrast, those who
   perceive that men and women are significantly different with respect to
   gender and those who indicate that gender conformity is personally
   important to them are less likely to accept transgender identity and
   also less likely to support further acceptance of transgender
   individuals in society. The implications of these findings and the
   importance of strategic messaging are discussed in light of the
   increasingly polarized political climate surrounding transgender rights

Title = {Too Immature to Have a Sense of Duty? Civic Duty in Youths Aged 16 and
   17},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {511-531},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {An increasing number of studies investigated whether citizens under 18
   are mature enough to vote. While this research addresses the level of
   political interest and knowledge in young citizens, and the quality of
   their voting decision, it does not explore their sense of civic duty to
   vote and its role for their participation in elections. This is
   surprising, as the sense of civic duty to vote is one of the main
   drivers of electoral turnout. Looking at the Austrian case, where voting
   is possible from the age of 16, we contribute to closing this gap. In
   particular, we investigate (1) the role of civic duty for the
   participation of young citizens in elections and (2) what constitutes
   differences in the sense of civic duty between 16- and 17-year-old
   citizens and those aged 18 and older. We show that the young citizens'
   sense of duty to vote affects their decision to turn out, but that they
   display a lower sense of duty than those aged 21 and above. These
   differences seem to be connected to the young citizens' level of
   political interest and knowledge, and their involvement in discussion
   networks. The results have important implications for academics,
   educators, and policymakers.},

Abstract = {This contribution offers an evaluation of subnational governance change
   in the Czech Republic in the context of a domestic response to
   Europeanization dynamics employing both the top-down and bottom-up
   approach. We do not find much evidence of a substantial empowerment of
   the regional level, but that the central government is still a
   gatekeeper. The regions have experienced both centralized and
   decentralized forms (temporal empowerment) of EU's structural funds
   management. The effect of EU was not constant, but conditioned in time
   by the mediating factors such as domestic politics and administrative
   capacity. On the local level, the weak fragmented municipalities have
   taken advantage of the European opportunity structure and have thus
   empowered themselves. EU's structural funds have accelerated
   intermunicipal cooperation. The partnership principle has become more
   embedded in regional policy, and some signs of multilevel governance
   (MLG) have emerged. As a result, the fragmented municipalities have
   become stronger partners with the state.},

Abstract = {One of the key factors distinguishing democracies from non-democracies
   is the process by which political decisions are made. Central to
   democratic thought is the idea that policy made in a procedurally fair
   manner is more legitimate than policy that violates central tenets of
   procedural fairness. A large number of studies from social psychology
   show that procedural fairness matters in citizens' evaluations of the
   success and legitimacy of various outcomes. Despite this observation,
   most political science literature focuses on the outcomes rather than
   the process of policy-making. Using survey experiments we find that
   procedural arrangements are an important factor in citizens' judgement
   of policy outcomes. Specifically, we find that fair procedural
   arrangements increase outcome legitimacy to the extent that citizens
   perceive them to be fairer. Our findings suggest that policy-makers need
   to pay more attention to procedural arrangements when designing
   policies.},

Abstract = {Discriminatory attitudes towards ethnic minorities are widespread, and a
   common presumption is that ethnic minority candidates suffer electorally
   as a result. However, some research has shown that little electoral
   discrimination occurs, because ethnic minority candidates tend to run
   for parties of the left, while voters with negative attitudes towards
   minorities are concentrated on the right. This study shows that when
   ethnic minority candidates do run for right-wing parties they suffer the
   brunt of electoral discrimination, while those on the left are
   insulated. To do so it leverages two methods: a candidate experiment and
   a difference-in-difference analysis of candidate demographic data and
   aggregate election results. An ideological stereotyping mechanism is
   also tested, but there is little evidence that right-wing voters reject
   ethnic minority candidates because they are viewed as left-leaning.},

Abstract = {Debates over the stripping of citizenship have been rekindled in many
   countries in recent years. Radical right populist parties (RRPPs) are
   often perceived to have played a significant role in these resurging
   debates, even when they do not possess executive power and are often
   marginalised by mainstream parties. Thus, RRPPs' real influence on
   policy-making remains unclear and the way RRPPs intervene in the
   policy-making process to influence it has not yet been satisfactorily
   determined. By focusing on policy-making, this study asks the question:
   how do RRPPs influence resurging debates over the stripping of
   citizenship? Using process-tracing and evidence from archives, memoirs
   and 67 interviews with policy-makers and party leaders, this research
   aims to determine if and how RRPPs intervene in the process in France
   and Belgium. The results indicate that RRPPs matter but that their
   influence is strongly curtailed. Their influence is not exercised
   directly and through institutional arenas, but indirectly: based on a
   provocative style, in a specific context, and through public opinion and
   the media.},

Abstract = {Beijing has elevated Africa's position in its foreign policy planning
   and increasingly regards the continent as a proving ground for its
   vision of humanity as a community with a shared future. The Xi Jinping
   administration has laid out a number of principles, for example,
   sincerity, pragmatism, affinity, and good faith, as well as major
   economic and financial initiatives - the Belt and Road Initiative and
   the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - to step up engagement with
   Africa in a more comprehensive and targeted manner. China's development
   and governance model represents an alternative to the hitherto
   under-delivering Western approach that has been practiced by many
   African nations over the past decades. Beijing respects Africans'
   political and economic choices, but also stands ready to help the
   continent try new development approaches and amplify its voices on the
   world stage. Fostering political convergence, building mutual trust,
   promoting local industrialization, increasing financial support for
   small and medium businesses, and ensuring infrastructure sustainability
   are the priorities for future China-African cooperation.},

Abstract = {In October 2010, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace
   Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The Chinese Government responded
   by freezing political and economic relations with Norway, introducing
   sanctions on imports of fish and other products, and limiting diplomatic
   interaction. Using a synthetic control approach, we estimate the effect
   of Chinese sanctions on Norwegian exports to China and on Norwegian
   foreign policy. We find that the sanctions reduced direct exports of
   fish to China by between 125 and 176 million US\$ in the period
   2011-2013, and direct total exports from Norway to China by between 780
   and 1300 million US\$. Moreover, immediately following the peace prize,
   Norwegian agreement with Chinese voting on UN human rights resolutions
   increased. The results suggest that the Chinese Government can
   effectively use economic sanctions to affect the foreign policy
   positions of democratic governments, with potentially chilling effects
   for international progress on human rights.},

Abstract = {All Canadian governments say that Canada must look to its friends and
   allies and like-minded partners to achieve greater cooperation on global
   issues. But who are these countries exactly? To gain a better
   understanding of where Ottawa stands in the world, with whom and under
   what conditions, we analyze Canada's voting patterns in the United
   Nations General Assembly from 1980 to 2017. We find that Canada's
   overall record tends toward that of Western European states. We find no
   evidence of greater affinity with US positions either when the Democrats
   are in power in Washington or when the conservative parties are in power
   in Ottawa. We identify a sharp pro-US turn in the Harper years and also
   confirm that the government of Justin Trudeau started off by maintaining
   rather than reversing this trend.},

Abstract = {European far-right parties have enjoyed mixed success in the past few
   years. The primary elements in many of these parties' policy platforms
   centre on security, terrorism, and foreign persons. Naturally, these
   platforms are designed to attract electoral support that these actors
   can parlay into governing positions. Our study offers an important test
   to ascertain how voters respond to terrorist attacks with respect to
   centre- and far-right parties. We contend that far-right parties are to
   likely benefit from terrorist attacks more than centre-right parties.
   The results from more than 30 European countries, spanning 1975-2013,
   affirm our hypothesis. The implications for partisanship, governance,
   and terrorism are explored in this paper as well.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new measure to understand policy connections
   between the states. For decades, diffusion scholars have relied on the
   largely untested assumption that contiguous states are more similar than
   noncontiguous states, despite evidence that similarity is more complex
   than geographic proximity. We use a unique survey of citizens'
   perceptions of other states to construct a national network of
   similarity ties between the states. We apply this new measure with a
   data set of state policy adoptions in a dyadic and monadic event history
   analysis and find that similar state adoptions are a reliable predictor
   of policy innovation. We argue that perceived state similarity is a more
   complete measure of how states look to each other than contiguity.},

Abstract = {The state courts of last resort are vital components of American
   judicial system, disposing of many important legal matters. The chief
   justices of these courts serve consequential roles in these
   institutions. Although scholars have examined the selection and duties
   of states' chief justices, their interactions with the elected branches
   are understudied. We focus on how chief justices on state high courts
   use their roles to encourage judicial reform. Specifically, we examine
   the determinants of chief justices' successes or failures as advocates
   for their justice systems. To analyze why chief justices succeed or fail
   as reform advocates, we analyze the fate of reform proposals offered in
   state of the judiciary addresses. Our results indicate that greater
   ideological similarity between the state legislature and chief justice
   or state supreme court median increases the odds of an agenda item being
   enacted. We also find that the scope of a policy request influences the
   likelihood it will be granted.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-187},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {One of the potentially most significant objections to a cosmopolitan
   moral approach charges an essential arrogance: cosmopolitanism disdains
   particularist moral insights even while - in what is said to be its most
   coherent form - it seeks to bind all persons within global political
   institutions. It is argued here that adopting a form of institutional
   cosmopolitanism actually helps to meet this sort of objection. An
   appropriately configured such approach will have a conception of equal
   global citizenship at its core. It will seek to place individuals in
   relations of political humility, understood not as plain deference to
   competing moral claims, but as concrete recognition of the equal moral
   status of others. It will seek to progressively empower as actual
   citizen equals those whose interests are often `arrogantly' neglected in
   the current system, and to multiply mechanisms of input and challenge
   for them over time.},

Abstract = {In Westminster parliamentary systems there was once a clear separation
   between the careers of public servants and of elected politicians.
   Politicians decided what policies they wanted to pursue, while public
   servants advised, devised and delivered the policies. This separation
   ensured that policy ideas were developed by a professional elite with
   experience and knowledge. Politicians came from a variety of
   backgrounds, entering politics for a variety of reasons. Over time, the
   source of policy advice for ministers has shifted from the professional
   public servant to political advisers lacking experience and with
   different career ambitions than public service. Increasingly, elected
   politicians are becoming `professionalised'-emerging from similar party
   and adviser backgrounds. The de-separation of what were once distinct
   career paths has led to poorer policy development, increasing public
   malfeasance, a lower-quality civil service, and democratic
   disenchantment. We need to separate the career paths once more.},

Abstract = {The article refers to debates inside realism on rationality of
   international processes. It reveals that even a basic assumption of
   states calculating their interests and choosing optimal political
   strategies provoked contradictions among realist theories. Both
   prominent Cold War realists, Morgenthau and Waltz, differed in their
   views on the role of leaders, the impact of the international system and
   states' rational response to systemic constraints. The hegemonic rivalry
   stream of realism took the ``middle ground{''} in this debate. Yet, the
   complex international reality after the fall of the bipolar order makes
   the realist considerations even more difficult. It encourages a wider
   openness to domestic nuances of foreign policymaking but reduces a
   chance for more general and rational schemes of states' international
   behavior. Post-Cold War realists declare a need of systemic and rational
   frames of their analysis but differ in their views on how much of the
   domestic context should be absorbed to comprehend contemporary
   international processes. The integration of miscalculations and
   misperceptions in leaders' political decisions and the rational frames
   of a state's foreign policy is a clear problem for realism.},

Abstract = {Inspired by impossibility theorems of social choice theory, many
   democratic theorists have argued that aggregative forms of democracy
   cannot lend full democratic justification for the collective decisions
   reached. Hence, democratic theorists have turned their attention to
   deliberative democracy, according to which ``outcomes are democratically
   legitimate if and only if they could be the object of a free and
   reasoned agreement among equals{''} (Cohen 1997a, 73). However,
   relatively little work has been done to offer a formal theory of
   democratic deliberation. This article helps fill that gap by offering a
   formal theory of three different modes of democratic deliberation:
   myopic discussion, constructive discussion, and debate. We show that
   myopic discussion suffers from indeterminacy of long run outcomes, while
   constructive discussion and debate are conclusive. Finally, unlike the
   other two modes of deliberation, debate is path independent and
   converges to a unique compromise position, irrespective of the initial
   status quo.},

Abstract = {Over recent years, Europe has experienced a series of Islamic terrorist
   attacks. In this article, conflicting theoretical expectations are
   derived on whether such attacks increase populist Euroscepticism in the
   form of anti-immigration, anti-refugee and anti-European Union
   sentiment. Empirically, plausible exogenous variation in the exposure to
   the 2016 Berlin attack is exploited in two nationally representative
   surveys covering multiple European countries. No evidence is found for a
   populist response to the terrorist attack in any of the surveyed
   countries. On the contrary, people in Germany became more positive
   towards the EU in the wake of the Berlin attack. Moreover, little
   evidence is found that ideology shaped the response to the attack. The
   findings suggest that terrorist attacks are not met by an immediate
   public populist response.},

Abstract = {Due especially to the work of Friedrich Hayek, ``spontaneous order{''}
   has become an influential concept in social theory. It seeks to explain
   how human practices and institutions emerge as unintended consequences
   of myriad individual actions, and points to the limits of rationalism
   and conscious design in social life. The political implications of
   spontaneous order theory explain both the enthusiasm and the skepticism
   it has elicited, but its basic mechanisms remain elusive and
   underexamined. This article teases out the internal logic of the
   concept, arguing that it can be taken to mean several different things.
   Some are forward-looking (defining it in terms of present-day
   functioning), whereas others are backward-looking (defining it in terms
   of historical origins). Yet none of these possibilities prove fully
   coherent or satisfactory, suggesting that spontaneous order cannot bear
   the analytical weight that has been placed on it.},

Abstract = {Free movement of people can be considered as a contested issue. While
   the European Commission stimulates a further `harmonization' of citizen
   `mobility', some member-states question the `burdens' of `EU migration'.
   To understand these differences, it contains a multi-level focus on the
   meaning-making practices of policy actors at the European Commission and
   in the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a European legal discourse
   legitimated by expert authorization which differs with a Dutch national
   discourse legitimated by mythopoesis. As such, it displays the
   significance of a discursive approach since it shows the contested
   meaning-making practices and its policy consequences around
   intra-European movement.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the role of decentralization and participation
   in democratic countries. Decentralization is a significant political
   process that enhances society's enjoyment of the fruits of democracy and
   helps in developing basic infrastructure, and many regions accept these
   concepts. Statistical techniques were employed through SPSS on data
   collected yearly between 2001 and 2005 to draw the outcomes. The
   findings showed a significant and positive impact of decentralization
   and participation on rural and urban communities and infrastructure
   development. This study has great importance for the policy making of
   district, provincial and central governments.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {333-354},

Abstract = {Interest groups do not only attempt to influence European legislation by
   devising and executing their own strategies, or relying on their allies.
   Almost 50\% have also experience in hiring political consultants. Using
   novel survey data from the policy formulation stage, this study shows
   that business interest groups are more likely to hire consultancies than
   non-business interest groups. It suggests that business associations'
   higher likelihood of hiring consultancies is linked to membership
   promotion. For firms, it likely relates to their need for specialised
   lobbying tools and trust-building measures when seeking private goods
   from policy-makers. Furthermore, the results indicate that consultancy
   hiring by business interest groups becomes less likely the more they
   focus on lobbying. This moderation effect highlights that business
   interest groups show awareness of principal-agent problems and take
   mitigating action.},

Abstract = {Most research on issue ownership examines the topic as an independent
   variable that may shape campaign strategy or voter behavior. In
   contrast, our study looks at ownership as a dependent variable.
   Specifically, we employ a national Internet survey of registered U.S.
   voters to gauge the extent to which such judgments are influenced by
   individual-level factors other than partisan identity. We find that
   while partisanship shapes ownership beliefs to a considerable degree,
   policy preferences and performance evaluations have significant effects
   across a range of valence and position issues. While feelings of
   ambivalence toward the in- or out-party do not have a consistent effect
   on ownership beliefs, higher out-party ambivalence reduces the
   probability that citizens will identify their own party as owning most
   issues. It is therefore premature, and probably incorrect, to assume
   that perceived ownership is little more than an expression of a person's
   partisan attachment or intended vote.},

Abstract = {Open governance requirements are designed to improve accountability,
   which implies that transparent governments are more trustworthy stewards
   of their publicly invested power. However, transparency may also reduce
   institutional effectiveness and inhibit political compromise,
   diminishing the capacity to manage resources responsibly. We assess
   empirical support for these competing perspectives in the context of
   American state legislatures, many of which have become exempt from state
   sunshine laws in recent decades. We leverage variation in the timing of
   these legislative exemptions to identify the effect of removing
   transparency in a crucial governing institution on investors' risk
   perceptions of states' general obligation bonds. Our analysis of these
   data during the period 1995-2010 suggests that removing legislative
   transparency reduces state credit risk. We conclude that while openness
   in government may be normatively desirable, shielding legislative
   proceedings from public view may actually be better for states' debt
   repayment capacity, improving their overall fiscal health.},

Abstract = {Clientelistic vote mobilization is a prominent electoral strategy in
   many of the world's democracies and electoral authoritarian regimes. Yet
   the comparative study of this practice, which involves exchanging
   personal favours for electoral support, remains strikingly
   underdeveloped. This special issue makes the case that clientelistic
   politics takes different forms in different countries, and that this
   variation matters for understanding democracy, elections, and
   governance. By comparing clientelistic vote mobilization in several
   countries - Mexico, Ghana, Sudan to Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines,
   Caribbean and Pacific Islands states, and Malaysia - we unpack the
   concept of political clientelism and show that it is possible to
   identify different types of patronage democracies. In this introductory
   essay, we develop a comparative framework for this endeavour, showing
   that clientelism can be fruitfully compared in terms of the character of
   the networks that facilitate clientelistic exchange, the benefits that
   politicians offer in exchange for votes, and the degree to which
   politicians, and especially parties, control the distribution of state
   resources. These comparisons lead to the identification of different
   types of patronage democracies, notably community-centred and
   party-centred varieties. Building on this framework, this special issue
   shows that the comparative study of clientelistic politics offers
   analytical promise for scholars of democracy and democratization.},

Abstract = {Although CTS can be described as a broad church, scholars working within
   this approach want to produce knowledge which can help shape, improve,
   change, or replace contemporary counterterrorism. Guided by Marx's
   mantra that the point of theory is not only to interpret the world but
   to change it, CTS has since its inception challenged the status quo of
   contemporary counterterrorism on the basis that it is possible to
   conduct counterterrorism differently, more humanly, and, put plainly,
   better. The concept of emancipation was identified early on as the
   foundation and basis for knowledge. However, a deeper debate on
   emancipation has largely been absent since 2010. Could it be that CTS
   exhausted the debate on one of its core commitments only five years into
   its existence? Have we reached the end of emancipation? Or could it be
   that emancipation is not that attractive at all for CTS and its
   normative projects? This article begins with a review and a
   state-of-the-art discussion of emancipation within CTS. While it might
   be the end of emancipation in its traditional conceptualisation, the
   article argues that emancipation can be retained as the basis for
   normative theorising and action within CTS when reconceptualised as a
   Weberian value-axiom. The article concludes by exploring a
   transfiguration of the concept of emancipation itself.},

   Posts to Military Officials},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-96},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Sometimes democratic political leaders voluntarily cede the armed forces
   too much authority, assigning them positions that should have gone to
   civilians. The over-delegation of posts to soldiers can invite problems
   of dependency, as civilians grow accustomed to the military handling
   defense policy. This study investigates the delegation of leadership
   positions in six advanced democracies: Israel, Taiwan, Spain, the US,
   the UK, and France. It finds that in the first three countries officers
   dominate many top-tier positions within the defense ministries, while in
   the latter three, civilians do. Deficiencies in civilian control are
   unexpected since these countries either face serious external threats or
   are members of NATO. It is argued that what links the three countries
   with civilian deficiencies is the presence of wide and longstanding gaps
   between military and civilian expertise and an absence of incentives to
   close them. Where civilians suffer from serious knowledge deficits,
   there is often a temptation to defer to the generals by delegating key
   ministerial posts to them.},

Title = {ACTOR MODELS OF GLOBAL EDUCATIONAL POLICY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {3},
Pages = {158-168},
Abstract = {The relevance of a global educational policy is determined by the new
   realities of the modern digital-global world, with traditional
   technologies rapidly changing in many areas. It is shown that the
   transformation of education (both in terms of education and in terms of
   the formation of a new global competence with personality) is in the
   interest of the entire global community, not merely individual states.
   The notion of a global education policy is clarified, and the promising
   use of actor approach in the framework of neoliberalism is confirmed. We
   identified five actor models in the educational sphere (models with a
   single actor (government); models complemented by the activities of
   non-governmental actors; models that consider the development of the
   role and status of non-governmental actors; models that reflect the
   progress of technological innovation; model-building in the status of
   actors in educational ecosystems, wearing a supranational character). It
   is hypothesized that the model with the greatest prospects is the model
   consisting only of educational ecosystems as actors on a global level.
   It is shown that the establishment of actor models is not enough to form
   a holistic view of a global educational policy; without specifying a
   single methodological design, the causes of changes in the type and
   composition of actors and the value of innovations in the future
   educational agenda. The author identifies the driving forces influencing
   global educational policy: scientific and technological progress and the
   transformation of the world economic system; communications
   developments; and the dynamism of foreign policy strategies, which makes
   it possible to implement the concept of ``competition through
   cooperation{''}. It is shown that the set of possible actions actors can
   perform is realized through a sequence of scenarios (economic,
   institutional, and social scenarios), leading to the formation of the
   globalization scenario being integral. The paper presents suggestions
   for refining the actor approach, enabling movement away from declarative
   and subjective justifications of actors, and combining the assessment of
   possible actions, policies, and scripts which allows for the
   methodologically meaningful identification of actors within the
   available body of knowledge in their chosen field of education.},

Abstract = {The increasing wealth inequality is one of the main challenges of the
   21st century. The gap between the poorest and the richest people on the
   planet is growing steadily. Obviously, such trend could not escape
   attention of social thinkers. One of the responses to the unfolding
   processes is the increasing popularity of the topic of the ethics of
   wealth. Within this framework the concept of limitarianism elaborated by
   Ingrid Robeyns, Professor at the University of Utrecht, is of particular
   interest.
   Limitarianism, being a political and ethical doctrine, postulates the
   inadmissibility of possessing wealth in excess of a certain threshold.
   According to Robeyns, any material wealth that goes beyond what is
   necessary for a fulfilling life is both redundant and ethically
   unacceptable, and must be redistributed. Not surprisingly, such a
   radical idea has been met with a wave of a wellgrounded criticism.
   The article examines the theoretical basis of limitarianism, analyzes
   the main arguments in favor and against this concept, and also attempts
   to answer the question about the possibility of practical implementation
   of Robeyns' ideas. According to the author's conclusion, limitarianism
   as a political concept has a number of serious flaws and bears a clear
   imprint of utopianism. However, since the concept has a very promising
   moral dimension, it would be wrong to write it off completely. Since
   limitarianism aims at the broad participation of individuals in the fate
   of other people and solution to the problems of humanity as a whole, it
   is able to gain wide public support, developing as a form of a personal
   ethics.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that voters rarely punish politicians for
   involvement in sex scandals. Yet, we argue that some voters are likely
   to hold politicians accountable for their moral transgressions. We
   theorize that both hostile and benevolent sexists are more likely than
   nonsexists to punish women for involvement in a sex scandal - but each
   for different reasons. We posit that women politicians involved in sex
   scandals activate traditional gender norms and challenge men's dominant
   position in the society, thus provoking hostile sexists to punish women
   more severely than men. Benevolent sexists are likely to punish women
   who fail to comply with stereotypical expectations of being pure and
   moral, and the men who fail to safeguard those virtues. To test our
   theory, we rely on a survey experiment that manipulates politician sex
   and scandal type. We find strong support for our expectations,
   indicating that sexism continues to structure evaluations of women
   politicians and shapes voter reactions to political scandal.},

Abstract = {In this work we have reconstructed the process of gestation and
   constitution of the General Union of Workers (UGT). This workers central
   has been relegated in historiographic studies. There are three
   objectives of this article. Firstly, we examine the reasons that led to
   the formation of the UGT, highlighting the importance of the newspaper
   La Organizacion in this process. Secondly, we establish that the UGT was
   not a worker central designed and controlled by the Socialist Party
   (PS), correcting a common misunderstanding. Thirdly, we point out the
   existence of a working-class and anti-political current within the
   workers' movement and its impact on the formation process of the UGT. To
   carry out this research, we have surveyed party, union, neighborhood and
   commercial sources. In addition, we accessed unpublished documents that
   have allowed us to delve into the main debates that took place at the
   founding congress of the UGT. With this work, we intend to contribute to
   the general knowledge of the working class of the period and contribute
   to the study of the UGT, an institution little known but key in the
   social struggles of the first decade of the 20th century. Finally, we
   suggest that the presence of this anti-political and workerist current,
   in the formation of the UGT, may explain the facilities that the
   revolutionary unionists had, those who quickly conquered the leadership
   of the workers' union.},

Abstract = {The Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) emerged as a major player in the
   country's transition from authoritarianism. Existing
   explanations-focusing on authoritarian legacies, the degree of trade
   union autonomy from the state, and labor's material incentives to
   support democratization-do not sufficiently account for the high-profile
   nature of the union's political role in Tunisia's transition. Instead,
   as this article argues, the importance of unions' pre-authoritarian
   legacy is key to understanding the role of unions in the transition from
   authoritarian rule. If unions enter the regime formation stage with a
   history of political struggle and with strong organizational capacities,
   they are more likely to develop a degree of internal autonomy that makes
   it difficult for authoritarian incumbents to disempower them. The
   article employs a historical institutional approach and draws on
   fieldwork and interviews with labor activists in Tunisia.},

Abstract = {The main argument is that the contemporary manifestations of right-wing
   populism in Europe ought to be understood, at least in part, as
   reactions to a distinctive form of postwar European society, which I
   will call here embedded constitutional democracy. The argument is that
   the populist reaction to embedded constitutional democracy generally
   takes a conservative form. This conservatism is expressed in rather
   different ways (ranging from ethnoreligious views to `illiberal liberal'
   ones), but at the same time populism displays a shared core of
   criticisms on liberalism, and in particular regarding the
   internationalized or global version of liberalism. In the article, I
   will start with a brief analysis of the emergence of postwar society in
   the form of embedded constitutional democracy, used as a backcloth for
   the subsequent discussion of critical views of liberal understandings of
   the law in conservative populist thinking. I will, then, focus on
   populists' critical views of liberalism and `globalism', analyzed in the
   form of contemporary articulations of (conservative) populism in both
   East-Central Europe (Hungary and Poland), and Western Europe (France,
   Italy, the Netherlands). In order to identify ideological affinities and
   critical positions, I discuss four themes: abstractness and
   inauthenticity, identity threat, domination, and legal fundamentalism.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the results of the 2019 Moscow
   City Duma election campaign and the impact of the ``smart voting{''}
   strategy proposed by A.Navalny. The authors suggest that a high
   assessment of this strategy, which is often associated with the relative
   success of the opposition in Moscow elections, is emotional rather than
   scientific, and test the validity of this strategy using statistical and
   correlation analysis. They interpret ``smart voting{''} as a kind of
   tactical voting, which has a completely different nature than a protest
   vote.
   The authors measure a quantitative effect of protest and tactical voting
   by comparing the level of support for candidates in the 2019 Moscow City
   Duma and its previous elections, examine significant correlations
   between various indicators and evaluate possible effects of voter
   turnout, level of competition and the electoral potential of the
   district on voting outcomes. After that they conclude that the success
   of the opposition can be explained by the combination of two factors:
   the increase in protest sentiments, which reduced the electoral base of
   the pro-government nominees, and the decrease in the level of
   competition inside the opposition, due to both the ``smart voting{''}
   strategy and disqualification of candidates. These factors largely
   ensured the flow of votes away from the administrative candidates and
   weak opposition members to the most powerful opposition candidates,
   thereby contributing to their victory. ``Smart voting{''} contributed to
   this victory, but did not determine the overall outcome of the
   elections. Its quantitative effect amounted to 5.6\% of the vote, while
   the effect of the protest vote was 9.7\%. Moreover, while ``smart
   voting{''} played a decisive role in the victory of several candidates,
   it deprived of victory approximately the same number of opposition
   representatives who were not able to confront two competitors
   simultaneously.},

Pages = {126-142},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to find out how the European Union operates from an
   administrative point of view and what set of tools has become necessary
   to implement the policy objectives of the European Union. The first part
   of the paper presents the specific features of the European Union in
   relation to the Member State administrative systems, and what the common
   organizing principles are that ensure the functioning. In the two-tier
   administrative system, the Commission should provide for the proper
   application and implementation of the Treaties and other measures.
   However, the actual implementers thereof are mostly the Member States,
   therefore, the administrative bodies are of special importance in
   actually enforcing EU law at local and member state level. The EU needs
   different tools in order to operate this huge mechanism. The first part
   of our study intends to present this set of tools, in this context, the
   infringement procedure, the complaint procedures and petition cases that
   can be initiated by EU citizens and businesses, and the so-called other
   problem-solving tools such as SOLVIT or the European Consumer Centres
   Network will also be analysed. The second part of the study deals with
   the way of EU implementation, i.e. the EU administrative procedure: the
   complex EU administrative system currently operates under heterogeneous
   procedural rules and there is no uniform procedural law. Given the a
   priori complex EU administrative structure and the diverse regulatory
   environment, it is not surprising that the demand for changes and
   unification has emerged in this area in recent years. The second part of
   the study presents the objectives and challenges of this task. The third
   part of the study summarizes the area covered within the framework of
   the compilation and makes proposals on the relevant issues of the Member
   States' administrative systems affecting the European Union.},

Abstract = {In 2019, Russia's Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov,
   presented a `strategy of active defence', a possible prelude to the
   forthcoming Russian military doctrine. This article examines this
   strategy with particular emphasis on the role of precision-guided
   missiles, tactical nuclear weapons and the role of the navy. It provides
   insights on the shape of new Russian military doctrine and the military
   threat Russia might represent to the West. Maren Garberg Bredesen and
   Karsten Friis conclude that the active defence concept may imply a
   lowering of the use-of-force threshold. Russia's continued build-up of
   tactical nuclear weapons integrated into the conventional forces
   reinforces this concern.},

Abstract = {In this paper I adopt a framework of public sphere (with its related
   deliberative approach) to highlight the several ways in which European
   Public Sphere is usually depicted. After discussing the relationship
   among the already existing European Public Sphere models (e.g. the
   Monolithic view, the Europeanization of public spheres and the Agonistic
   model of the public sphere), I try to illustrate a different way to
   understand what a public sphere is. In order to achieve so, I start from
   the consideration that criticism and engagement are the pivotal element
   for any public debate to start. As a consequence, I aim to argue that
   the public sphere is always a critical one, and that Euroscepticism can
   be read as the starting point of a Europeanized public debate.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the last year of the Mauricio Macri's
   administration in Argentina, and the accession of Alberto Fernandez to
   power. We present a survey of the economic situation in 2019, the most
   important issues in the political agenda, and the political developments
   around the presidential election. We argue that the inability of the
   government to deliver on the economic front, and a realignment in the
   opposition, marked by Cristina Fernandez unexpectedly stepping down as
   presidential candidate, explain why Mauricio Macri was unable to get
   reelected.},

Abstract = {During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. conservative news
   downplayed the threat of the virus. Perceived risks of COVID-19 are an
   important factor in influencing citizens' willingness to comply with
   risk prevention measures. An online survey (N=269) of U.S. residents was
   conducted March 30 - April 1, 2020. We found that those who used
   partisan conservative news sources as their primary source of
   information about the virus were significantly less likely to view it as
   a threat, compared to those who cited Far Left, Center Left, and Center
   Right news sources. Politically conservative Far Right news audiences
   reported significantly lower estimates of their own COVID-19 risk, as
   well as that of their age group peers, the average person in the U.S.,
   and the average senior citizen in the U.S.},

   Consolidation},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {185-206},
Abstract = {In the twenty-six years that characterize the last six Italian
   legislatures (1994-2020) Italy has seen, from the
   political-institutional point of view, an intense activity that was
   accompanied by a very similar vitality of the political party system. In
   this context, the electoral system and its continuous modifications with
   new electoral laws has strongly influenced the form of government,
   marking, by the decisive conditioning factor that represents the party
   system, its dynamics, both directly and indirectly. However, the rapid
   change of the different electoral systems in recent years has not been
   accompanied by an equal change in the constitutional text, so there has
   been an asymmetry in the functioning of the new electoral systems that
   were being adopted gradually, making them substantially incomplete,
   inconsistent and ultimately fragile. Faced with an immutability of the
   constitutional system, this continuous mutability in the electoral
   system has not only made the whole political-institutional system very
   weak, but also degraded it in its function in the eyes of the voters, as
   it seemed a clearly inefficient tool with respect to the needs of the
   constitutional system. Therefore, the present contribution aims to
   highlight the transformations that have taken place on the electoral
   system, trying to underline the difficulties of its consolidation,
   within the framework of the so-called Second Republic (1994-2020) and
   its new system of political parties.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world have privatized public services in the name
   of efficiency and citizen empowerment, but some argue that privatization
   could also affect citizen participation in democratic governance. We
   explore this possibility by estimating the impact of charter schools
   (which are publicly funded but privately operated) on school district
   elections. The analysis indicates that the enrollment of district
   students in charter schools reduced the number of votes cast in district
   school board contests and, correspondingly, reduced turnout in the
   odd-year elections in which those contests are held. This impact is
   concentrated in districts that serve low-achieving, impoverished, and
   minority students, leading to a modest decline in the share of voters in
   those districts who are black and who have children. There is little
   evidence that charter school expansion affected the outcomes of school
   board elections or turnout in other elections.},

Abstract = {The article reconstructs the events of the Suvignano farm, in the
   Sienese area, confiscated in 1996 to an entrepreneur from Palermo
   considered close to Cosa nostra and assigned in 2018 to a company owned
   by the Tuscany Region. Unlike other studies on confiscated assets,
   mainly focusing on quantitative aspects or their management, the paper
   proposes a case study based on an integration of techniques and sources,
   from interviews with qualified witnesses to the consultation of
   institutional documents. The analysis aims to explore the social and
   political significance that Suvignano assumes for the local community
   and the political class. After the definitive confiscation in 2007,
   Suvignano becomes a political resource disputed between different
   actors, local and national. Around this political resource take place
   two challenges, led and won by a Tuscan leftist institutional network,
   distant heir of the red subculture. The first challenge is against a
   similar Sicilian institutional network. The second is against local
   political actors: the traditional (Forza Italia) and the new
   (Salvini-Lega) centre-right, as well as the emerging 5 Stars Movement.
   The article shows how these two challenges are won thanks also to the
   Tuscan civil society, ready to mobilize against a ``public evil{''}, as
   the mafia is usually represented. In a phase in which the political
   consensus becomes uncertain, the centre-left parties find in the fight
   against the mafia a powerful source of political legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Marketization and quantification have become ingrained in academia over
   the past few decades. The trust in numbers and incentives has led to a
   proliferation of devices that individualize, induce, benchmark, and rank
   academic performance. As an instantiation of that trend, this article
   focuses on the establishment and contestation of `algorithmic
   allocation' at a Dutch university medical centre. Algorithmic allocation
   is a form of data-driven automated reasoning that enables university
   administrators to calculate the overall research budget of a department
   without engaging in a detailed qualitative assessment of the current
   content and future potential of its research activities. It consists of
   a range of quantitative performance indicators covering scientific
   publications, peer recognition, PhD supervision, and grant acquisition.
   Drawing on semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and document
   analysis, we contrast the attempt to build a rationale for algorithmic
   allocation-citing unfair advantage, competitive achievement, incentives,
   and exchange-with the attempt to challenge that rationale based on
   existing epistemic differences between departments. From the specifics
   of the case, we extrapolate to considerations of epistemic and market
   fairness that might equally be at stake in other attempts to govern the
   production of scientific knowledge in a quantitative and market-oriented
   way.},

Abstract = {Why do some government formation periods end after a few days, while
   others last for several weeks or even months? Despite the rich
   literature on government formation, surprisingly little is known about
   the underlying bargaining processes. This article introduces a new
   dataset on 303 bargaining attempts in nineteen European democracies to
   analyse the duration of individual bargaining rounds. The study
   hypothesizes that (1) preference tangentiality, (2) ideological
   proximity, (3) incumbency and (4) party leadership tenure decrease the
   duration of coalition bargaining. Employing a copula approach to account
   for the non-random selection process of the observations, it shows that
   these actor-specific factors matter in addition to systemic context
   factors such as post-election bargaining and party system complexity.
   These findings highlight the need to consider both actor-specific and
   systemic factors of the bargaining context to explain government
   formation.},

Abstract = {For some extraordinary reason, many people in the world place their
   faith in a voting procedure which is ancient, primitive and, in a word,
   blunt: majority voting. It is usually divisive, often imprecise and, at
   worst, a provocation to violence. Accordingly, this chapter looks at
   voting theory and proves that this binary voting can indeed be
   hopelessly inaccurate if not, on occasions, plain wrong (while Chaps.
   4-6 show that in many instances in practice, it is also at best
   inappropriate); the text then talks of various forms of multi-option
   voting; and finally, it describes a preferential points system which can
   be not only more accurate but actually, in certain circumstances, a very
   exact measure of the general will.},

Abstract = {This article is a comparative analysis of two internationally awarded
   cases of Participatory Budgets in Canoas (Brazil) and Cascais
   (Portugal). Our main argument is that the success of these PBs relies on
   political/administrative, societal, and geographic drivers. This
   conceptual model has been adopted to analysel and discuss the success of
   the two case studies. The provision of an original conceptual model for
   comparative analysis and the empirical knowledge from the two cities are
   supported by the review of main literature in this field of study, and
   aim to contribute, with original findings, to the international debate
   on participatory budgeting.},

Abstract = {This research offers a post-mortem on political advertising in 2018,
   providing important context for 2018's ``blue wave.{''} In a majority of
   US House of Representatives races, there were more pro-Democratic than
   pro-Republican ads, including in the most competitive contests. The one
   theme that united pro-Democratic advertising was health care, which was
   mentioned in nearly three of every five Democratic ads in the fall
   campaign. Contrary to the narrative that television is declining, a
   record number of television ads aired in the 2018 midterms, whereas
   digital spending still constituted a small percentage of overall
   advertising spending for most candidate campaigns. Finally, there was a
   healthy volume of outside-group spending in 2018, with ``dark-money{''}
   groups increasing their involvement-especially in support of Democratic
   candidates.},

Abstract = {Russia is Lilliputian compared with China. The gross domestic product of
   the most economically powerful country in the world is six times higher
   than that of Russia. This chasm will widen further, since China's labour
   productivity continues to grow and its investment quota is double that
   of Russia. China not only produces the largest quantities of important
   raw materials and foodstuffs worldwide, but also the highest amount of
   industrial products. By contrast, the only areas where Russia overtakes
   China are agricultural products, mineral resources, iron and steel. When
   it comes to non-military industrial products, it falls well below its
   GDP ranking. While Russia's growth is currently already slow, the
   Chinese gross domestic product will continue to grow less strongly in
   future due to the decline in the potential labour force. In addition,
   greater importance will be given to environmental standards in both
   states.},

Pages = {313-326},
Abstract = {Traditionally, environmental crimes have been difficult to penalize both
   in Russia and abroad. Russian environmental legislation is not codified,
   it is a complex conglomerate of a wide variety of legal acts that are
   condemned to take into account the classification of environmental
   crimes and their delimitation of related crimes. Accordingly, the
   article examines the status, causes and some measures to prevent
   environmental crimes. The general methodological basis of the research
   was formed by the basic provisions of the dialectical method of the
   study of the phenomenon of legal in its text-context relationship. All
   the evidence can be concluded that the reasons for the production of
   environmental crimes include the ineffectiveness of the activities of
   law enforcement agencies, economic determinants and reasons in the field
   of legal awareness. In addition, the analysis of the statistical table
   of environmental crimes recorded a clear disproportion between the real
   situation in the field of ecology and the fight against such crimes. At
   the same time, the most significant factor that distorts the real image
   of environmental crimes is there and recursion latency in the concrete.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-484},
Abstract = {Populism and technocracy reject vertical accountability and horizontal
   accountability. Populism and technocracy can combine to form
   `technocratic populism.' The study assesses the extent to which
   democratic decay can be traced to the actions of technocratic populists
   as opposed to institutional factors, civil society, fragmentation and
   polarization. The main findings of this article are that technocratic
   populism has illiberal tendencies expressed best in its efforts at
   executive aggrandizement (cf. Bermeo, 2016). Without an effective
   bulwark against democratic erosion (cf. Bernhard, 2015), technocratic
   populism tends to undermine electoral competition (vertical
   accountability), judiciary independence, legislative oversight
   (horizontal accountability), and freedom of the press (diagonal
   accountability). The most effective checks on technocratic populist in
   power, this study finds, are the courts, free media, and civil society.
   This article highlights the mechanisms of democratic decay and
   democratic resilience beyond electoral politics. It indicates that a
   combination of institutional veto points and civil society agency is
   necessary to prevent democratic erosion (cf. Weyland, 2020). While
   active civil society can prevent democratic erosion, it cannot reverse
   it. Ultimately, the future of liberal democracy depends on the people's
   willingness to defend it in the streets AND at the ballot box.},

Abstract = {In July, 1920 the ``most powerful workers' organization of Latin
   America{''}, as Luis Emilio Recabarren defined it, was attacked. Some
   members were killed, the press was destroyed and the local burned. The
   attacks took place also in other Chilean cities, in the framework of the
   ``Guerra de Don Ladislao{''}, a conjuncture when the government
   associated a fake menace of war agsint Peru with an also purported
   complicity of anarchists and socialists. Less than five months later a
   nationwide oligarchic caravan commemorated in Punta Arenas the IV
   centenary of Magellan's crossing of the Strait. This article analyzes
   the relation between both events, arguing that the invention of that
   commoration in the peak of the social conflict allowed to the local
   oligarchy to project itself nationally and internationally, through the
   erecting its new tradition over the ashes of another and strengthening
   its power, associated to the State, in front of the transnational labor
   insurgency.},

Abstract = {In recent years Slovakia witnessed a dynamic development with crucial
   consequences for its domestic politics. Vast civic mobilization, the
   emergence of new parties and decline of a long-term hegemon - all these
   features culminated in the 2020 general election. We first introduce the
   results and discuss them from a longitudinal perspective of Slovak
   politics. Most importantly, despite a considerably large portion of
   correctly carted ballots for parties which failed to pass the
   institutional thresholds, the outcomes do not suggest that the
   representativity or proportionality of the Slovak political system is
   about to suffer. Second, we focus on the rise and ideological appeals of
   populist political parties. Although similar in many ways, we show
   important differences in their ideological platforms.},

Abstract = {This essay explores a creative argument that Cicero offers to answer a
   fundamental question: how are we to judge among different ways of life?
   Is there a natural hierarchy of human types? In response to this
   problem, Cicero gives an account of a person's possessing two natures.
   All of us participate in a general human nature, the characteristics of
   which provide us with certain universal duties and a natural moral
   hierarchy. But, we also each possess an individual nature, qualities
   that make us unique and which we have an obligation to cultivate. By
   employing different concepts of natura to refer either to common human
   nature or to particular individual nature, Cicero establishes a basis
   for a normative standard that manages to affirm the superiority of
   certain especially valuable types of life, such as the philosopher and
   the statesman. At the same time, he advances a coherent account of
   individuality that places high value on natural human diversity.},

Abstract = {The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the climate-crisis and
   Coronavirus-pandemic are the 3 most important events that are milestones
   of orientation for modern people. The year 2020 has been dominated on
   all possible levels by the first pandemic in almost a hundred years.
   COVID-19 has changed the economic, social, academic, political, and
   everyday lives of billions of people. The lockdown phenomenon, i.e. the
   order for citizens to stay in a certain place, the prohibition of
   performing certain activities, for example temporary closing of churches
   in some countries, caused various reactions from authorities, leaders,
   individual persons, and public organisations. In the dialogue they built
   up the common identity of humanity. The voices of the Christian churches
   still play an important role in this multidimensional exchange of
   thoughts. One of the most significant activities of the global Christian
   communities on the front of pandemic belongs to the Lutheran World
   Federation. This community of Lutherans worldwide has published a number
   of statements and, what is much more important, creates a space for
   building a global community of faith of people suffering during the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {What makes a leader worthy of support? The article uses novel survey and
   experimental data from Indonesia to test the proposition that identity
   trumps performance for citizens perceptions of their political leaders.
   The results confirm theories of `prototypicality'-leaders that best
   reflect and represent the identity of the group tend to be more trusted
   and have a licence to fail. We argue and show that the dimensions of
   identity that matter most varies and is context specific. In the
   Indonesian context religious identity is most important. But the data
   also suggest that this varies across space, time, and follower identity:
   We show that gender matters, as women are less easily persuaded by
   prototypicality. We conclude by reflecting on the implications for
   leaders, politics and support for leadership development.},

Abstract = {In the context of the constituent process taking place in Chile, this
   paper studies one of the main constitutional debates that has developed
   throughout the country's history: the debate over the right to
   education. We analyse this debate between 1990 and 2016 to explore how
   elite discourse and citizens' opinions regarding the right to education
   are related. We first propose a periodization of the discussions of the
   elite, determined by the irruption of the Chilean student movement in
   2006 and 2011, and the gradual constitutionalisation of the debate. We
   then carry out a discourse analysis of the citizen dialogues,
   specifically the Encuentros Locales Autoconvocados (ELA), or
   Self-convened Local Meetings, developed within the framework of the
   constitutional process that took place in 2016. Finally, by comparing
   both discourses, we conclude that although there is receptivity to the
   ideas of the elites in the ELA discourses, they do not constitute a
   complete reflection of these ideas. This questions the notion that
   citizen discourses only reaffirm the discourses of the elite without
   contributing anything new.},

Title = {Barriers to Enhancing Disaster Risk Reduction and Community Resilience:
   Evidence from the L'Aquila Disaster},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {232-243},
Abstract = {Building sustainable and resilient societies is a multidimensional
   challenge that affects achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development. In crises and disasters, civil protection authorities
   typically use emergency powers and a command-and-control approach to
   manage resources and to design and implement disaster management
   interventions. They centralise knowledge, technologies and
   responsibilities for prevention, mitigation and monitoring, while
   stifling the capacities of local communities to reduce disaster risks
   and impacts. The mechanism they enact leads to a poor understanding of
   the capacities of local people to learn and transform, and of how
   community wellbeing, vulnerabilities, and resilience influence disaster
   risks. The mechanism does not strengthen the role of local communities
   in disaster risk reduction. Instead, it facilitates disaster capitalism
   at all levels of society. Drawing on the disaster risk reduction and
   resilience paradigm and on our analysis of the disaster management
   interventions conducted before and after the 6 April 2009 earthquake in
   L'Aquila, Italy, we discuss the main constraints to implementing the
   four Priority Areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction:
   (1) Understanding risk in its multiple dimensions; (2) strengthening
   disaster risk governance; (3) investing in disaster risk reduction for
   resilience; and (4) enhancing preparedness and build back better in
   response, recovery and reconstruction. We discuss how top-down,
   emergency-centred civil protection approaches create second disasters,
   and fail in all four priorities. We suggest that shifts in paradigm and
   investment are required in disaster management and development practice
   from centralised civil protection systems to decentralised, socially
   sustainable community empowerment systems.},

Abstract = {Our paper reconstructs the way in which opera creators, both theorists
   and practitioners, conceive the relationship between words and gestures,
   by comparing texts that set down stage gestures in writing, between
   instruction and reception. It seems that they attribute to stage
   gestures an auxiliary function of communication, semantic clarification
   and pathetic amplification of affetti and ideas conveyed by words - as
   the recitar cantando is based on the primacy of the poetic text. We will
   then question in what way these concepts may condition the very genesis
   of poetic-dramatic writing. By analysing the stage direction and the
   relationship between narration and the direct mimesis of movement and
   gesture in librettos of Ottavio Rinuccini, we will question the notion
   of theatrical visibility, and its implication in terms of the hierarchy
   between verbal, musical and corporeal eloquence.},

Abstract = {We argue that asymmetric information can cause long wars. We present a
   bargaining model of war between unequal opponents: the stronger side
   ({''}government{''}) is uncertain about the strength of the weaker side
   ({''}rebels{''}), which deteriorates during fighting. The model predicts
   that wars may be lengthy, as fighting alternates with settlement offers.
   Surprisingly, increasing the government's commitment ability or reducing
   uncertainty may make war more likely. The government may choose to
   continue fighting after early failures: it may become more optimistic
   that the rebels are about to collapse even as the collapse does not
   arrive, and it can increase its expected payoff ex ante by committing to
   continue a wasteful war. Our analysis helps to explain, for example, the
   U.S. experience in Vietnam.},

Title = {The Evolving Role of the Human Rights Factor within the State of
   Necessity Test in Investment Arbitration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {12-18},
Abstract = {The discussion on increasing the legitimacy of international investment
   law largely overlooks the potential of the state of necessity, as a
   circumstance precluding wrongfulness of States' conduct under general
   international law, for the protection of human rights. The present
   article deals with the practice of international investment arbitration
   in cases involving Argentina in connection with its economic crisis of
   1998-2001, in which it raised the necessity defense and appealed, inter
   alia, to human rights. The article concludes that, as a rule, the human
   rights factor did not play a noticeable role for resolving the relevant
   disputes. The human rights discourse either had no adequate place within
   the merits of the disputes, or the tribunals did not take the relevant
   arguments seriously. The human rights argumentation tried itself within
   different parts of the Argentina's defense, including various elements
   of the necessity test, but without meaningful effect. The Award in the
   case of Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao
   Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. The Argentine Republic has demonstrated the
   perspective of recognizing the significance of the human rights factor
   in the context of ``the only way{''} element of the necessity test: this
   element can unleash the potential of human rights in the disputes
   involving the necessity-based defense and provide the tribunals with
   tools capable of taking human rights more seriously in the context of
   investment disputes concerning emergencies. The Urbaser Tribunal
   position is an evidence of the evolving and expanding role of the human
   rights factor within the necessity test but substantial clarification of
   this test at the doctrinal, practical and political level is still
   needed to increase the legitimacy of international investment dispute
   resolution system.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the issues outlined in the article is due to the
   peculiarities of the legislative regulation of the participation of
   representatives and other actors in the civil process of Ukraine. In
   this vein, the purpose of the article is to scientifically prove that
   procedural representation differs significantly from representation in
   civil law, among other things, in the object and nature of the
   relationship that exists between the representative and the principal,
   thus as well as the legal grounds and consequences of both processes.
   Furthermore, it is observed that the specialist, unlike the expert, acts
   as an assistant and consultant to the court and does not carry out an
   independent investigation aimed at clarifying the relevant circumstances
   of the case. The main method of research on this topic was modeling,
   which allowed, among other things, to consider the civil process as the
   only organizational lawsuit that serves to resolve the life situation.
   It is concluded that the legislative participation model of
   representatives and other people aims to improve their professional
   skills aimed at strengthening the work of the judiciary, while managing
   and resolving various conflicts of different nature to guarantee social
   order.},

Abstract = {This article argues that China's current industrial development after
   four decades of capitalist ``reform and opening{''}, as well as the
   profound social reversal following the rise of Deng Xiaoping in 1978,
   would be unthinkable without the industrialization of the socialist
   period. This process was a two-pronged struggle: the modernization of an
   economy that had been gripped by feudal backwardness and the domination
   of the great powers, and the foundation and development of new and more
   egalitarian modes of organization and of labour and social motivation.
   The new industrial ``great leap{''} after the reversal of 1978 would
   have very different social bases, with other managers and other
   beneficiaries.},

Abstract = {Currently, studies on collectively organized and confrontational
   resistance tend to dominate the field of resistance studies. In a
   different vein, this paper argues that the most powerful practice of
   dissent works as a form of constructive resistance that produce a slow
   transformation of values. The paper discusses strategies used by civil
   society organizations in Japan in order to establish alternative truths
   and thereby mobilize against poverty and pesticides. In the paper it is
   revealed how knowledge, which previously has remained invisible to
   mainstream perspectives, is more easily diffused if understood to
   represent `the real' and, by this, provoke emotions.},

Abstract = {Based on a set of criminal trials that took place in the Caribbean and
   other contextual ones, this article aims to analyze couple conflicts in
   New Granada in the colonial period and its criticism by the glimpse of
   enlightened ideas. The text recovers the main conclusions of a doctoral
   dissertation prepared with 144 files sent on appeal to the Royal Court
   of Santa Fe for injury, abuse, mistreatment, homicide, abandonment,
   separation and divorce during the eighteenth century and the first years
   of the nineteenth century, which were contrasted with
   seventeenth-century corpus. This is a research carried out from a gender
   perspective and based on the configurational theory of Norbert Elias,
   which attempts to demonstrate long-term transformations regarding the
   way of approaching and prosecuting violence between spouses.},

Abstract = {How does the circle of inner elites evolve over time in dictatorships?
   We draw on theories of authoritarian power-sharing to shed light on the
   evolution of politics in North Korea. Given challenges in collecting
   individual-level data in this context, we employ web-scraping techniques
   that capture inspection visits by the dictator as reported by state-run
   media to assemble network data on elite public co-occurrences. We test
   the durability of this network since Kim Jong-un's rise to power in
   December 2011 to find suggestive evidence of elite purging. Our findings
   contribute to the broader literature on authoritarian elite dynamics and
   to subnational studies on power-sharing in communist states.
   Importantly, our approach helps bring the study of North Korean politics
   more firmly in the mainstream of political science inquiry.},

   Parliament's electoral procedure is clear reflection of the European
   integration process evolution and the different views with regard to it
   (intergovernmentalism vs. supranationalism) Process where the reach of
   consensus is not always easy and, therefore, requires progress to be
   made stepwise. Consensus that is even more difficult to attain when
   talking about the essential elements of an electoral procedure and, in
   particular, of the electoral system to adopt. Elements in which the
   different constitutional traditions and understandings of the Member
   States have a great influence, as the British case clearly exemplifies
   with the strong opposition that arose against the abandonment of their
   traditional majoritarian system.},

Title = {SOCIO-POLITICAL MEANINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SPAIN-CATALAN CONFLICT
   THROUGH THE PRISM OF TWITTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {151-169},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze the social meanings of the
   network communicative activity of the parties of the Spanish-Catalan
   conflict in a specific direction - in discussions about tweets of
   leading EU politicians. The relevance of the presented study is
   determined, on the one hand, by the increased influence of social media
   on political life, and, on the other hand, by the need to understand
   political conflicts not only as conflicts of interest, but also as
   conflicts of social meanings and ideas. The article discusses and
   interprets the meanings of two social communities - supporters of the
   independence of Catalonia and supporters of the unity of Spain, implied
   in the communication carried out using the social network Twitter. The
   analysis is based on an empirical study of twitter messages by the
   method of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The main
   socio-political attitudes of the parties to the conflict, expressed in
   remarks on tweets of representatives of the EU leadership, are examined.
   The time interval of the study covers two years - from May 2017 to June
   2019. Based on an analysis of the level of communication activity of
   network users, it was revealed that the supporters of the independence
   of Catalonia act as a more active and cohesive social community,
   compared with the supporters of the unity of Spain. They have clear
   ideas about the political situation in the country and the region, as
   well as expressed ideological principles. This allows us to conclude
   that there is a narrative of independent Catalonia formed in public
   opinion. However, the meanings concerning the problems of social
   relations in the country and the region, arising in the light of the
   requirements of independence, remain in the shadow of communication. The
   passive nature of the participation of supporters of the unity of Spain
   in network communication in this area, as well as the content of their
   remarks, indicates the absence of a formed social base of supporters of
   unity, both among the inhabitants of Catalonia and among the rest of the
   Spanish citizens. This may be due to ideological lag, in which
   supporters of the country's unity are guided by outdated ideological
   stereotypes that are not able to unite them into a real social community
   with a certain political worldview. According to the findings of the
   study, it is precisely the ideas of the parties to the conflict about
   social relations in the country that are their weak link that does not
   allow reaching a new level of political compromise or consensus.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to examine and analyze the articles
   that address public tourism policies in specialized magazines at a
   global level, with the aim of knowing through comparative public
   policies, alternative solutions in a post-pandemic scenario. Regarding
   the methodology, articles were selected whose titles presented one or
   more keywords that referred to the disease ``Covid-19{''} and ``public
   tourism policies{''} in Spanish and English. To process the information,
   the content analysis technique was used. The results showed that the
   place and space occupied by tourism public policies in the main tourism
   magazines is scarce and not seen as a management tool for the sector.
   The conclusion emphasized the lack of clarity regarding the methodology
   used in the articles and the scarce proposal of public policies that
   were implemented in situations of health crises, epidemics, wars, etc.
   For the rest, the following questions served as a guide for the
   analysis: 1) What is the role of governments in the tourism sector? and,
   2) What public policies did governments implement in similar situations
   such as the current health crisis?},

Abstract = {The principle of respecting the separation of political forces in a
   society gives the legal system the right to issue orders on people's
   complaints based on the laws approved by the legislative power. There is
   no question that laws, like other man-made things, have shortcomings.
   These decisions include the rupture and even the conflict between two or
   more articles of the law that provoke the creation of different policies
   in the court of justice and the punitive court of Iran. With a
   documentary methodology, this article attempts to study the conflicts
   between different punitive laws and their effect on the creation of
   different policies in the courts of Iran. It is concluded that, in many
   cases, due to different reasons there may be defects in the law or in
   the interpretation of the law that generate defect, ambiguity, clash
   between laws and contradiction. The existence of all these failures in
   different cases will cause conflicts between the judges of the criminal
   courts and these conflicts are the source of the creation of different
   legal procedures in the criminal courts and in the short time analyzed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to examine the Trump administration's
   asylum policy applied to Central American and Latino applicants. The
   United States has grappled with refugee problems in recent decades, and
   in 2018 Trump signed an executive order to detain families seeking to
   immigrate to the United States without separating from one another. With
   this decree, a new approach was formed in the policy of the United
   States government, which emphasizes the severe restrictions on the entry
   of asylum seekers and immigrants. In the methodological, it is a
   documentary research close to hermeneutics. It is concluded that,
   although the United States government has cited security concerns as an
   excuse to restrict the entry of asylum seekers, especially Latinos from
   Central American countries, this political approach is in conflict with
   the national legislation of the United States that stipulates that any
   citizen Foreigner arriving at any point along the US border, or at
   official exit points, has the right to apply for asylum. Furthermore,
   the implementation of such a policy is contrary to the end of the 1951
   Convention, which focuses on the protection of refugees without
   distinction.},

Abstract = {Despite their centrality to modern democracy, until recently political
   parties were relegated to the margins of normative democratic theory,
   taking a back seat to social movements, civil society associations,
   deliberative experiments, spaces for local participatory government, and
   direct popular participation. Yet, in the past 15 years, a burgeoning
   literature has emerged in democratic theory focused directly on parties
   and partisanship; that is our focus in this review. We locate three main
   normative defenses of parties: one centered in the special role parties
   can play in political justification as agents of public reason, a second
   that looks to the way parties contribute to deliberation, and a third
   that focuses on the partisan commitment to regulated political rivalry
   and peaceful rotation in office. In this last connection, we survey work
   on the constitutional status of parties and reasons for banning parties.
   We then consider the relation of partisanship to citizenship, and in a
   fourth section we turn to the ethics of partisanship. Parties and
   partisanship are interwoven but separable: If partisans are necessary to
   realize the value of parties, the reverse holds as well, and parties are
   necessary to realize the value of partisanship.},

Abstract = {In Malaysia, there is no one institution that can outdo the supremacy of
   the Federal Constitution. Even the three government bodies that refer to
   the power separation doctrine which is the legislative, judiciary and
   executive bodies even the Yang di-Pertuan Agong are under this Federal
   Constitution. The constitution can be divided into two, written and
   non-written constitution. The written constitution is the form of
   constitution that is gathered and arranged in one document. The
   non-written counterpart encompasses all of the constitutional principles
   not compiled in one document such as the law endorsed by the Parliament
   and the verdicts of the court such as in the United Kingdom. Other than
   the constitution, there are certain practices that are thought to be
   part of the principles of the constitution. This is known as the
   Constitutional Convention or the customary practice of the Constitution.
   Constitutional convention is a non-legislative practice and it is
   similar to the political ethics and not enforced in court. Although it
   seems trivial, it is important for this practice to be complied with,
   otherwise it is difficult for the constitution to work successfully as
   the constitutional convention cannot be brought to court and forced to
   be obeyed. Thus, the discussion of this article rests on the
   constitutional convention in terms of the social contract, the
   appointment of the Prime Minister, the appointment of the country's main
   positions and collective responsibility.},

Title = {The Effect of Parties on Voters' Satisfaction with Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {59-70},
Abstract = {Electoral `winners' (i.e., voters casting a ballot for a party included
   in the post-electoral government) are acknowledged to be more satisfied
   with democracy than supporters of opposition parties. However, little is
   known about the influence of parties and their specifics on the boost in
   satisfaction with democracy experienced by their voters. To address this
   question, the research utilizes 17 surveys from 12 countries included in
   the European Social Survey rounds 1-8, for which a government
   replacement took place during the survey period. This allows this
   research to employ discontinuity design and examine the effect of two
   attributes related to parties-differences in party vote shares, and
   voters' feeling of closeness to a party. The findings suggest that these
   factors have a negligible influence on voters' satisfaction with
   democracy and only scant evidence is found that closeness to a party
   tends to increase their satisfaction. When voters' attitudes from before
   and after a government replacement are compared, changes in government
   do not seem to strike voters as a surprise and thus they do not cause
   any sudden and lasting changes in the general attitudes of electorates.
   Nevertheless, this indicates a novel contribution to the literature: the
   effect of losing needs some time to fully develop until it results in a
   decrease in satisfaction level. Based on these findings, the research
   concludes that when it comes to parties' characteristics, it is
   primarily the government/opposition status which determines voters'
   degree of satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {Conflict is inevitable in any human relationship. The situation is the
   same in the university system where several groups with diverse
   interests exist. While scholarly attention has focused on conflict and
   conflict resolution in the larger human society, less attention has been
   directed towards conflict and its resolution between and among various
   groups within a university. This article empirically examines the
   relations between the Students' Union (the body representing the
   students) and the management of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), and
   the conflict resolution mechanisms available to the groups. The article
   adopts secondary and primary data sourced from semi-structured
   interviews, and analyses the data using descriptive and content analysis
   methods. Findings show that the relations between the Students' Union
   and the management of OAU are mixed, largely depending on the strategies
   adopted by the union leaders and the university administrators; that
   conflicts are mostly triggered by issues bordering on students' welfare;
   and that mechanisms such as mediation, negotiation, and consultation are
   some of the conflict resolution mechanisms between OAU students and
   management. The article concludes that the central issue between the
   Students' Union and management of OAU is student welfare, and that to
   avert future conflicts, student welfare must be management's priority at
   all times.},

   however, this end will last only a few months,due to the activation of
   the guerrilla war of the nationalist movements after the breakdown of
   the peace agreement between the MLPA and UNITA. The work of the Angolan
   writer reflects the beginnings of action of the different political
   movements of Angola since 1961 until the dispersion of their ideals and
   national projects in 1991, focusing on a decadent Angola that seeks new
   conceptions to give a definition always in conflict of identity national

Abstract = {2019 was a significant year for Colombian politics and the country's
   political debate was dominated by four intertwined issues: (a) the
   implementation of the historic peace agreement between the Colombian
   government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC)
   and all its economic, judicial, and political ramifications, (b) the
   ongoing presence of illicit crops and the impact of the drug trade on
   domestic and international security, (c) the tense bilateral relation
   between Colombia and Venezuela, and, similar to other Latin American
   countries, (d) social unrest caused by multiple and widespread
   frustration about public education, health, corruption, governance, and
   the environment. At the same time, the country was marked by steady
   economic growth, above the Latin American average. In addition, much of
   the political debate took place within and among the institutions of
   Colombian state and society, illustrating growing state capacity and a
   mature civil society. In this article, I describe the different aspects
   of this Colombian paradox- high levels of domestic unrest and political
   polarization surrounding unsolved structural issues and pending
   expectations about peace combined with superior economic performance and
   growing institutional strength-in an effort to provide an overview of
   the challenges overcome as well as those lying ahead.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the appeal of populist radical right (PRR)
   politics in the US after the election of Donald Trump. Specifically, I
   seek to explain how new media helps politicians representing the PRR
   secure support in Republican primaries. Using an online survey of 1052
   Arizona Republicans in the lead-up to the August 2018 Senate primary, I
   evaluate support for three candidates: Rep. Martha McSally, former
   Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and Kelli Ward, a physician. The
   findings highlight a bifurcation in the drivers for support of PRR
   candidacies: Skepticism of immigration drives the Arpaio vote, while use
   of social media news and belief in party convergence mobilize Ward's
   support. The results demonstrate that support for PRR politicians in the
   Arizona primary is concentrated in two groups, anti-immigrant and
   anti-establishment, and that the anti-establishment voters are more
   likely to access news on social media. These findings indicate that
   social media news consumption does shape voter perceptions about
   mainstream parties favorably for the PRR.},

Abstract = {For decades, military assistance in southern Somalia focused on building
   up a central state army. This reflects standard patterns of Western
   assistance worldwide. Yet the nature of Somali society and clan, greatly
   affected by the winnowing process of more than 30 years of conflict,
   means that most sub-clan groupings are more militarily effective than
   centralised forces deployed to unfamiliar areas. The centralised Somali
   National Army remains riven by clan itself, thoroughly politicised, and
   ineffective (with the exception of the Danab special forces). Based on
   fieldwork and interviews with military personnel who work in Somalia,
   Colin D Robinson and Jahara Matisek argue that these locally appropriate
   forces deserve assistance, albeit with some caveats, in the continuing
   struggle against Al-Shabaab.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the problems of application of the decisions of
   the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the selection of
   precautionary measures in criminal cases in accordance with Ukrainian
   law. Since the procedural legislation of Ukraine is currently not
   perfect in the framework of the establishment and regulation of the
   application of precautionary measures, the decisions of the ECHR serve
   as an indispensable regulator of this issue. The objective of the work
   is to study the peculiarities of the application of the jurisprudence of
   the European Court of Human Rights in the selection of precautionary
   measures in criminal proceedings. The subject of the investigation is
   the jurisprudence of the ECHR in the context of the choice of
   precautionary measures in the criminal process. The research methodology
   included and combined the dialectical method, logical and legal method,
   analysis, synthesis. By way of conclusion, the study shows that the
   practice of the ECHR is mandatory to take into account not only the
   courts but also the investigators and prosecutors, who legally have the
   right to request the court to apply such precautionary measures.},

Abstract = {Negativity is common in political rhetoric and advertising, but its
   effects are variable. One important moderator may be the specific
   emotions communicated by the messages and potentially in recipients.
   Contempt may be the emotion often conveyed by uncivil ads, which have
   attracted considerable interest, particularly in light of increased
   partisan polarization. Using data from web-based surveys in New Jersey
   and Iowa, we examine the role contempt played in two U.S. Senate races
   in 2014. We find respondents perceived contempt-more than anxiety or
   anger-in four televised negative campaign ads and in candidates'
   statements about opponents. Moreover, respondents' feelings of contempt
   toward candidates, though less intense than feelings of anger, were of
   equal or greater significance than anger or anxiety in predicting voting
   intentions regarding three of the four Senate candidates across the two
   elections.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the history of the emergence and formation of
   the institution of trust property in relation to various legal systems.
   The purpose of such a historical analysis of the institution of trust
   property is to find a possible place of this legal institution in
   domestic law, because trust property is a relatively new legal construct
   for Ukrainian law. The relevance of the article is to study the
   possibility of using the Anglo-American Trust Institute in Ukraine. The
   object of the study of this article is the legal relations arising from
   the institute of trust property. Methods of historicism, method of
   logic, method of analysis, method of synthesis, method of systematic
   research, and comparative-legal method were used in the study. The
   authors concluded that the institution of trust property goes back to
   one of the branches of English law. At the same time, the institution of
   trust is not inherent in the domestic legal system. However, since the
   1990s, the domestic legislator has tried several times to introduce the
   relevant institution into Ukrainian legislation. So far, all of these
   attempts have failed.},

   the Colombian and Ecuadorian States to exercise national sovereignty in
   the archipelagos of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, and the
   Galapagos Islands. The questions we seek to solve inquire about the
   conditions of the emergence of tourism in these areas: How it became the
   main economic activity of its inhabitants, the role played by States in
   their emergence and development, and the strategies historically
   employed to exercise the sovereignty in these sections of national
   territories. In the end, we hope to show some initial ideas to think the

Title = {FORMING A SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. A CONSOLIDATED PORTRAIT OF RESEARCHERS
   OF RUSSIAN ISLAM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-136},
Abstract = {Based on the survey conducted among Russian scientists who specialize in
   studying Islam in Russia, the first attempt to characterize the
   formation of this scientific community has been made. The Soviet era
   suppressed studying Islam in the USSR, although scientists had an
   opportunity to carry out research on Islam abroad. Consequently,
   post-Soviet communities of Islamic scholars in Russia emerged from
   Soviet Research Centers of Oriental Studies and include ``Soviet{''}
   orientalists. Islamic schools, which have appeared in the last decade,
   also play a significant role in their formation. Many clergy have
   secular academic degrees. Secular educational and scientific
   institutions, in their turn, contribute to the establishment of Islamic
   universities, as Islamic education in Russia synthesizes religious and
   secular knowledge. Researchers into Islam often have a diverse
   education, and do not necessarily specialize in one sphere. A scientific
   background can be accompanied by a thesis on Islamic studies. Since
   2008, an increase in academic activity on Islamic topics has taken
   place, as a result of the government's decision to train specialists
   with a deep knowledge of Islamic history and culture who could work in
   Islamic religious organizations. This primarily refers to publications
   in journals, since the number of monographs, as well as works in
   English, does not increase. The majority of scholars questioned studying
   local Muslim communities and Islam at a regional level due to the
   diversity of Muslim communities in the country. Studying Russian
   traditions in Islamic theology, especially Jadidism, also has attracted
   scientists' attention. For a number of years, the Muslim community has
   been involved in a discussion on the nature of ``traditional{''} and
   ``non-traditional{''} Islam in Russia. Theological and philosophical
   issues are raised in connection with those of political Islam,
   extremism, and terrorism. There are virtually no works on Islamic
   finance and economy, as well as there being a lack of research related
   to the interaction between the state and Islam and the activities of
   religious Muslim organizations. There are also no studies of Russian
   Muslims and Muslim migrants' interaction. Remaining very mosaic, Islam
   in Russia is changing dynamically. The authors believe that the
   currently prevailing regional research paradigm inhibits understanding
   of the processes occurring in the Russian Islamic community. It is
   necessary to provide an extensive insight into Islam development in
   Russia. In order to create a holistic picture, field research should be
   conducted in different regions of the country. This should be done
   taking into account the global situation, primarily the situation in the
   Middle East, and also considering the existence of informal Islamic
   networks. Deep cooperation with scholars in Arabic studies is needed.},

Abstract = {By adopting a multilevel system perspective, we derive three insights
   from the analyses on regional elections presented in this third annual
   review of regional elections. First, we argue that Poland, South Korea
   and the USA can be conceived as aggregated bipolar party systems where
   competition at the nationwide level revolves around two parties whereas
   single parties dominate in the regions. Second, drawing on the cases of
   Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Kenya, and Nigeria, we claim that the
   integration of multilevel party systems (also) depends on the extent of
   collaboration between parties from the national and regional electoral
   arenas. Third, significant vote-switching revealed by election surveys
   held in Denmark and Sweden poses a significant challenge for theories on
   regional voting. We conclude by considering the wider implications of
   these three insights for multilevel democracy.},

Abstract = {In the Soviet Union, Martin Heidegger was ostracised. His writings were
   not translated into Russian, and academic philosophers were forbidden
   from studying him. However, as early as the 1980s, an intense wave of
   appreciation for Heidegger took hold in Russia, where there was
   particular enthusiasm for the extended opportunities for expression
   provided by German existential philosophy. Today, most of the authors
   who draw on Heidegger's work are of a conservative mindset. In the
   Russian history of philosophy, there are also numerous points of
   reference to Heidegger's thought, particularly in the conceptualisation
   of the terms ``being{''}, ``language{''}, ``people{''} and ``God{''}.},

Abstract = {The truth is that 19th Century Spanish society began to integrate - with
   its unique socio-cultural particularities and somewhat later than other
   countries - into what we might call the world system of Western
   capitalist modernity, to the extent that it could - and indeed did -
   create the conditions for governing its own reproduction. Spanish
   society, with its differences and its ``traditional way of being,{''}
   could not remain oblivious for any longer to a new order, a paradigmatic
   configuration of reality that, in turn, shaped the order of things,
   events, and categories. Indeed, well into the 19th Century, Spain had
   not yet embarked fully on the processes of Western modernity
   (secularisation and democratisation). The role modern legal science has
   carried out a crucial part in the Spanish contemporary history. It was
   essential in the arrival to Spain of the process of the Age of
   Enlightenment, linked to the principles of secularization and
   democratization.},

   the protection of migrants' labour rights, identifying a specific range
   of category-related regulations and their main provisions. The theme of
   the study is the analysis of the legal basis for the protection of
   migrants' labour rights. The research methodology includes and agreed on
   the following general and special and legal methods: dialectical,
   logical, systematic, and legal, normative and canine, comparative and
   legal and legal method. The results of the study are identified by key
   regulations, including documents of international importance and the
   Ukrainian legal system, whose rules are dedicated to the regulation of
   social relations arising in the labour field of migrants. In terms of
   its practical implications, based on scientists' analyses, the focus is
   on the meaning of the term ``migrant{''}. An alternative definition is
   proposed. Finally, attention is paid to the declaratory nature of
   international law in the field of the protection of the labour rights of
   migrants and is part of the importance of acts of national law in
   regulating this matter.},

Abstract = {The article examines contemporary political relations between Russia and
   Ukraine and Belarus from the perspective of analyzing relations between
   the former imperial center and the periphery. The theoretical and
   methodological framework of the article consists of studies dealing with
   the post-imperial political development of the periphery its relation
   with the former imperial center and political processes in the
   post-Soviet area. Of significance were the studies on the politics of
   memory to solve the problems posed in the article.
   The paper raises and considers the question to what extent the relations
   between Russia and the former Soviet states as post-imperial in the
   general context of the collapse of empires are reasonable characterized.
   It presents the analysis of the Russian integration policy in the
   post-Soviet area from the perspective of building relations in the
   postimperial period, its results in regarding to Ukraine and Belarus.
   The modern Russian policy toward to Ukraine and Belarus is considered,
   its analysis is carried out, including the economic and financial
   component of the relationship between Russia and these states.
   Particular attention is paid to the factor of cultural and historical
   proximity and the Russian policy of memory in toward to these
   post-Soviet countries, it also analyzed the reasons for its limited
   effectiveness in terms of national identity development of the of
   Ukrainian and Belarusian societies are analyzed.
   The reported conclusions give characteristic of the political relations
   between Russia and Ukraine and Belarus as post-imperial in the context
   of the continuation of the acquisition of political and
   national-cultural independence by these states, the processes that began
   in the Soviet period. Such development leads to a decrease in the
   influence of Russia, while economic factors have limited effectiveness
   for its preservation. Moscow's positions are increasingly being replaced
   by the influence of centers of power external to the post-Soviet space.
   The results of the study may be used for refining Russian policy in the
   post-Soviet area.},

   Europeanisation on the nature protection system in the countries of
   Southeast Europe. Europeanisation is presented in the research through
   legislative and institutional changes due to the adoption of the
   European ecological network - Natura 2000. Comparative analyses were
   made in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Data collection
   was primarily done through participant interviews in the establishment
   of Natura 2000 and secondary through all available relevant literature.
   After that, a policy analysis was carried out through a thesis and
   subthesis based on the main goal. The conclusion was presented as a
   confirmation of the main thesis that Europeanisation led to changes in
   Southeastern Europe's nature protection system.},

Abstract = {Examining the dynamics underpinning the evolution of trans norms in the
   Netherlands, from their emergence there in 1952 up until 2019, this
   article traces their development through four historical phases, each
   marked by notable milestones and supported by different sets of frames,
   actors, and norm-change mechanisms. My analysis shows that the normative
   profile of trans issues in the Netherlands has long been ruled by
   medical frames, but the last decades have also witnessed the emergence
   and establishment of a new set of frames rooted in human-rights
   discourses. By tracing the trajectory of trans norms in the Netherlands
   and examining the mechanisms underlying the emergence and changes of
   frames, this article contributes to the theoretical body of studies on
   norm diffusion by introducing the role of hybrid entrepreneurs, the
   dynamic co-assembling of medical and legal domains and the self-lead
   trans emancipation as a social entrepreneurial strategy.},

Title = {SYSTEMS APPROACH IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH: ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE
   THEORETICAL HERITAGE OF ALEXANDER BOGDANOV},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {4},
Pages = {112-123},
Abstract = {Systems Approach came to prominence in International Relations studies
   during the second half of the last century. However, now, any
   traditional perspective of the interstate system of International
   Relations has become obsolete. In this article, the organizational
   science (tectology) of Alexander Bogdanov is presented from the
   perspective of its sui generis systems research methodology, which, when
   first published, was vastly ahead of its time. The current virtue of
   Bogdanov's tectology lies in the epistemological influence the
   principles he formulated have on the organization of systems complexes
   (such as conjugation, ingression and disingression), common for any
   objects. Detecting the dialectics of national and global processes
   remains an ongoing problem in international studies. Bogdanov's
   scientific heritage seems relevant for approaching this problem now. In
   this article, the roots of his system-based vision and special aspects
   of these systems theories are analysed, allowing an all-important niche
   for Bogdanov's science of organizations in such a context to be carved.
   As an example of relationism, tectology is juxtaposed with
   substantialism, and such International Relations theories are aligned
   with substantialism as structural realism, neoliberal institutionalism
   and sociological constructivism. Ontology and phenomenologism are
   considered in depth as characteristics of Bogdanov's empiriomonistic
   theory; however, it is acknowledged that Cartesianism is more typical
   for key International Relations theories, as this can explain
   rationalism and dualism, matching principles of nature with rules of
   traditional mechanics. This article pays particular attention to
   Bogdanov's notion of bi-regulation in multicomponent complexes, which
   have no use for external governance (as they are self-regulated). This
   notion might be helpful when trying to specify the pivotal role a
   territorial state might play despite the strengthening or weakening of
   power which institutions of multilevel global governance perennially
   undergo. The article is focused on Bogdanov's methodology, which regards
   any human activity as a totality of collective experience, with the most
   significant aspect being social culture. When taking territorial aspects
   of contemporary global policy and its transnational features together,
   with the help of his system-tectological conception, we shall
   predominantly see features including ``normal{''} conjunctions of
   organizational forms, which are undergoing constant processes of
   conjunction/disjunction, devoid of any unnecessary elements of
   high-stakes drama.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of Chinese enterprises and citizens are going
   abroad, which exposes them to risks threatening their personal safety
   and security of their property. With the expansion of Chinese overseas
   interests, traditional protection methods fall short of a demand for
   diverse services, revealing a major shortfall in the Chinese
   government's capability to provide overseas security protection for its
   citizens. New service providers are therefore urgently needed, and
   private security company are becoming an increasingly popular choice. As
   this is a fairly new demand, only a small number of Chinese private
   security companies are operating overseas at present. Difficulties
   abound for them, such as absence of regulatory clarity on business
   operation and gun control. The presence of private security providers
   could also pose a challenge to host nation authority and trigger
   conflicts. To serve as true protectors of overseas Chinese interests,
   Chinese private security companies have a long way to go.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the confrontation between influential groups
   i.e., coalitions of actors who possess access to urban institutional
   resources, and residents of the areas that fall under development
   programs of built-up territories, in the media space of Irkutsk and
   Krasnoyarsk. The author views the development programs of the built-up
   territories as attempts by influential groups to appropriate vast urban
   spaces in order to profit from it. At the same time, influential groups
   construct an image of the city and its certain parts in such a way that
   justifies the expansion, while residents who uphold their own ideas
   about disputed territories tend to disagree with this image. The
   positions of the opposing parties are reflected in public statements
   that ascribe to the disputed areas certain social and spatial meanings.
   The article analyzes the arguments made by the parties when they try to
   define a symbolic space of disputed territories, speech techniques that
   influential groups use in order to claim their right for the city, and
   how residents perceive these claims. The purpose of the article is to
   document values that influential groups and residents attach to the
   disputed territories, narratives that justify actions to design their
   future. Toponyms that denote disputed territories are interpreted as
   ``empty signs{''}, the content of which is set by the participants of
   the media discussion, who link them to various spatial, emotional or
   social categories. The image of the disputed territories of Irkutsk and
   Krasnoyarsk, transmitted by influential groups, is examined through the
   metaphor of the frontier: the position of the authorities is compared to
   the position of a colonizer, who acquires territories via forced
   redistribution of the resources available to the local population. In
   their legitimizing narratives, the authorities justify seizure of this
   resource by the immaturity and deviance of its former owners, as well as
   through the imperatives of ``progress{''}. At the same time, in some
   cases, the expansion of influential groups stimulates consolidation of
   residents, who in the future can turn into a significant player in the
   political scene of the post-Soviet cities.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to explore selective activism in order to seize the
   reasons lying beneath activist commitment to a cause instead of another
   requiring defense, concomitant and similar to the one ultimately chosen.
   The attempt to understand how activists' decision-making process and
   subsequent activity are structured is grounded on a field research
   conducted among pro-refugee activists in Athens from 2015 to 2017. The
   findings of the research show that the emergence and expansion from 2015
   onwards of many different pro-refugee activist initiatives are largely
   influenced by imaginary constructs that are related to three
   superimposed but distinct levels of imaginary identification games. This
   case study reveals that pro refugee activism is certainly fuelled by
   political facts, but at the same time it is detached both from reality
   and politics, since it reflects the way in which they are combined with
   imaginary universes predominant in activist circles, which have little
   or no political relevance.},

Abstract = {The following article explains the main criticisms of the Belgian
   philosopher Marc Maesschalck to the notion of emancipatory social
   transformation gestated from the fall of real socialisms and the
   necessary epochal update and expansion of critical thinking. Within
   this, their questions about the notion of class struggle are analyzed
   and its interpretation of the normativity as an ethical-political anchor
   of the emancipatory social transformation, proposing the perspective of
   a legal struggle and its assimilation by all social actors concerned in
   reference to the worlds of life.},

Abstract = {This investigation proposes that corruption scandals damage the
   center-left sectors with greater force, both around the world and in
   Latin America. However, the progressive electorate, when it has plural
   options in proportional electoral systems - like the new Chilean
   electoral system like the Colombian one - punishes the parties with the
   greatest link to corruption and rewards the self-employed of the big
   companies. In this way, it is postulated that the leftist electorate is
   more strict with its leaders in matters of corruption and manages to
   differentiate when the movements and parties have naturalized
   corruption.},

Abstract = {The Horn of Africa (HoA) is on the threshold of a long-term
   transformation as the result of a confluence of political, economic, and
   social changes, namely, generational political leadership turnover as a
   reflection of the rise of a younger population; a palpable shift in
   governance approach from a ``security-first{''} model to a
   ``development-centered{''} one; and the return of geopolitics across the
   Red Sea, following global and regional political realignments. To steer
   the transformation in a sustainable and peaceful direction, the HoA has
   to enlist the assistance of external actors both as a source of trade
   and investment and as guarantors of regional peace and stability. This
   region-wide transformation presents challenges and opportunities for the
   implementation of the Chinese-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
   Beijing should better align the economic connectivity-focused BRI with
   the development-centered approach of regional states, build national and
   regional capacity for HoA security governance, and join local and
   external actors in a multilateral effort to ensure a peaceful, secure,
   and economically dynamic HoA.},

Abstract = {U.S. undergraduates often hold ill-informed and stereotypical
   perceptions about the Middle East. While theories of comparative
   politics can help undergraduates gain a more nuanced view of the region,
   these theories often strike students as extremely abstract and unrelated
   to actual experience. The use of novels from the Middle East can help
   instructors overcome both problems. This paper demonstrates how one such
   work, In the Country of Men by Hisham Matar, can illustrate different
   comparative politics theories while challenging preexisting biases about
   the region that students may hold.},

Abstract = {Leftist governments with strong links to organized labor are expected to
   increase the number of people protected by job security rules. But do
   they? I explore whether the Left in power at the local level in Brazil
   cracks down on enterprises that employ noncontract, informal-sector
   workers, and implements policies aimed at reducing the size of the
   informal sector. With a close-election regression-discontinuity design,
   I show that mayors from the Workers' Party (PT) in fact slow down
   enforcement and improve conditions in the informal sector, rather than
   encouraging a shift to formal jobs. This reflects a challenge that
   leftist parties face across the world: how to simultaneously improve the
   employment prospects and conditions of workers in precarious employment
   and those in full-time jobs in the context of increased global
   competition, segmented labor markets and, in Latin America, truncated
   welfare states.},

Abstract = {We claim that the overall effect of district magnitude on female
   representation is ambiguous because district magnitude increases both
   (a) party magnitude-which promotes the election of women, and (b) the
   number of lists getting seats-which hampers it, as marginal lists are
   usually headed by men. For identification, we exploit the fact that the
   Argentine Chamber of Deputies and the Buenos Aires legislature elect
   half of their members every two years, and thus some districts have
   varying magnitudes in concurrent and midterm elections. We find a
   positive but weak effect of district magnitude on female representation,
   which can be decomposed into a positive effect driven by party magnitude
   and a negative one channeled by the number of lists getting seats. We
   find similar results in a sample of seven Latin American countries.},

Abstract = {Who defends democracy? This is a question central to the literature on
   democratic development, and a new generation of scholars has integrated
   structural- and actor-centric approaches to democratization to produce
   generalizable insights. However, their theoretical arguments lack
   sufficient empirical evidence from non-Western countries. From late
   October 2016 to April 2017, seven million Koreans (14\% of the
   population) raised candles and participated in anti-government rallies,
   which eventually halted the deconsolidation of Korean democracy. The
   candlelight protest is a useful case for testing the expectations of
   these actor-centric theories. Analysing the latest World Values Survey,
   this study finds that many of the protest participants were young and
   attentive middle-class citizens and opposition party supporters in the
   capital areas. Their motivations were democratically defensive and
   reformative rather than transformative and postmodern but differed
   across economic classes. These results shed fresh light on these
   actor-centric theories of democratization and make significant
   implications regarding new democracies.},

Abstract = {Why are women and people of color under-represented in U.S. politics? I
   offer a new explanation: strategic discrimination. Strategic
   discrimination occurs when an individual hesitates to support a
   candidate out of concern that others will object to the candidate's
   identity. In a series of three experiments, I find that strategic
   discrimination exists, it matters for real-world politics, and it can be
   hard to overcome. The first experiment shows that Americans consider
   white male candidates more electable than equally qualified Black and
   white women, and to a lesser extent, Black men. These results are
   strongly intersectional, with Black women rated less electable than
   either Black men or white women. The second experiment demonstrates that
   anti-Trump voters weigh Democratic candidates' racial and gender
   identities when deciding who is most capable of beating Donald Trump in
   2020. The third experiment finds that while some messages intended to
   combat strategic discrimination have no effect, diverse candidates can
   increase their perceived electability by showing that they have a path
   to victory. I conclude by arguing that strategic discrimination is
   especially salient in contemporary U.S. politics due to three parallel
   trends: increasing diversity among candidates, growing awareness of
   sexism and racism, and high levels of political polarization.},

Abstract = {The vicious circle that combines ecosystem degradation at the global
   level, climate change, zoonoses, pandemics, modes of production and
   consumption, as well as the accumulation and development model, has left
   its level of potentiality and warning to become a forceful and expensive
   reality. This cost has a correlation in the society, in politics and in
   the economy, as they continue to make the environmental dimension
   invisible and promote a dichotomous view of society and nature, as well
   as, development and environment. The current political cycle in
   Argentina and the international context provide a new opportunity to
   promote models of development, consumption, production and life that
   challenge and deconstruct the invisibilities of this supposedly
   successful recipe for extractivist capitalism.},

   Mind the Queue ! (MdQ) a ete menee de mars a mai 2020 dans le but de
   savoir dans quelle mesure la COVID-19 a impacte les societes de huit
   pays, de l'est a l'ouest du monde, huit pays representant differentes
   formes gouvernementales et economiques : Cuba, Haiti, l'Irak, l'Italie,
   la Cote d'Ivoire, le Mexique, les Etats-Unis d'Amerique et le Venezuela.
   Les gouvernements de ces pays ont eu recours a des strategies
   differentes, mais ces derniers temps, ces dernieres apparaissent toutes
   tres proches et similaires dans leur politique d'aplatissement de la
   courbe, d'arret et de verrouillage du virus, trois expressions qui sont
   devenues les mots de passe mondiaux a l'epoque du coronavirus. Nous
   trouvons des preuves de baisses drastiques de la mobilite du virus a
   l'echelle federale ou locale avant l'adoption de toute decision a
   l'echelle de l'Etat. La recherche MdQ valorise la tension entre liberte
   et controle, entre liberation et repression. Des exemples montrent des

Title = {Cross-pressures and the European lavender vote: Testing the
   conditionality of the sexuality gap},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Emerging evidence points towards the existence of a ``sexuality gap{''}
   in the political preferences and behaviour of lesbian, gay and bisexual
   (LGB) voters and that of heterosexuals in Western Europe. Very little is
   known, however, about how this gap is moderated by socio-economic
   status. This paper tests the conditionality of the sexuality gap by
   analysing how the effect of LGB status is conditioned by income and
   education. Empirically, we rely on data from the European Social Survey
   (2002-2017) to analyse the marginal effect of sexuality in determining
   ideological placement, vote choice and support for economic
   redistribution across different income and education levels. The results
   demonstrate that the divergence between LGBs' and heterosexuals'
   preferences only emerges amongst those with higher income and education.
   The findings also suggest that the sexuality gap may be the result of
   the asymmetric effect of these socio-economic variables for LGBs and
   heterosexuals.},

Abstract = {By the standards of historical and anthropological scholarship, Israel
   constitutes a colonial settler regime whose certain features may differ
   from those exhibited by other European settler regimes. Yet, in the
   larger scheme of things it shares with other such regimes the
   displacement of the indigenous population, seizure of their territory,
   the passing of racially biased laws that discriminate against the native
   population, and reliance on violence to further its methods of control.
   Originally, the Zionist movement and later the state of Israel have
   frustrated the aspirations of the Palestinian people towards statehood.
   Ultimately, the state of Israel has codified its new Citizenship Law
   that defines Israel as the state of the Jewish people, thus ignoring the
   status of the original Palestinian population.},

Abstract = {During the current pandemic, forest loss in 2020 has dwarfed the
   devastation of the previous year. The scale of environmental crimes and
   aggression towards indigenous peoples and people of African-descendent
   has been a characteristic of the Bolsonaro administration in the Amazon
   region. As cases of COVID-19 rise daily in remote areas of the Amazon, a
   recent study indicates that indigenous lands that aren't formally
   demarcated are more vulnerable to intrusion and hence disease: indeed
   illegal loggers have emerged as a key vector of Covid-19 transmission in
   a region with Brazil's lowest number of intensive care units. The
   weakening of environmental protection in the Amazon has been systematic
   and a feature of the Brazilian shift from neo-liberalism to
   neo-developmentalism which can be characterised politically as
   neo-liberal authoritarianism. If Covid-19 also is now becoming a
   metaphor for the poisonous spread of neo-liberal globalisation, plunder
   and land grabs in the Brazilian rainforest can be seen to represent the
   most egregious of many egregious cases on the ground zero of
   neo-liberalism unchained. With the rise of Bolsonaro, we can see that
   the previous conjuncture characterised by the hegemony of PT and Lula
   was the exception to Brazil's long embrace of the caudillo going back to
   the 1930s. Even then, a look at the mechanism of Lula's rule raises
   questions as to precisely what changed under Lula when it came to the
   state and the rule of big capital.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {When do radical parties gain support? Previous studies cite the economy
   and mainstream party ideological convergence as important. Responding to
   earlier inconsistent findings, I provide evidence for an interactive
   approach. Anti-system parties succeed when mainstream parties are
   simultaneously presiding over an ailing economy and failing to provide
   the diversity of political opinion for the electorate to meaningfully
   challenge the policies associated with this malaise, through which
   dissatisfaction with the status quo could otherwise be channeled. Two
   studies support this ``crisis and convergence{''} model. At the
   aggregate-level, the anti-system vote is strongest during times of
   negative economic growth and widespread mainstream party ideological
   de-polarization. At the voter-level, the link between negative economic
   evaluations and radical party voting is stronger during establishment
   convergence and, vice versa, personal perceptions of convergence are
   themselves more closely related to support for these parties when the
   macroeconomy is sickly. Mainstream party homogeneity radicalizes the
   economic vote and strengthens anti-system challengers.},

Abstract = {The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, in India was widely contested
   by both political parties and various civil society formations. Shaheen
   Bagh, a sit-in protest demonstration which continued for over a hundred
   days in the nation's capital from mid-December 2019 to late March 2020,
   occupied the central position within the corpus of these protest
   demonstrations. The protests at Shaheen Bagh were led by poor, Muslim
   working-class women, who had come out on the streets protesting and
   asserting their rights amidst the dominant ruling-class communal
   politics. The Shaheen Bagh protests were a potent force of the
   working-class and oppressed minorities of the country. The paper brings
   in Marxist and Gramscian perspectives to explain how Shaheen Bagh has
   contributed to Indian left-wing politics. The paper argues that the
   women in Shaheen Bagh have been successful in bridging the gap between
   the civil society and political society in the country and has to an
   extent, altered the very nature of Indian politics. Moreover, the
   assertive nature of the Muslim women regarding their religion and the
   support which they garnered from the Indian left, widely accused by many
   of being Islamophobic in nature, has wide repercussions as far as
   political and social alliances between the left and Muslim politics in
   India is concerned. The present paper locates the protest within the
   notion of subaltern unity and tries to analyse the possible impacts of
   the support for the protests, within and beyond the anti-CAA protest
   movement, from the Indian left.},

Abstract = {For decades, critics of pluralism have argued that the American interest
   group system exhibits a significantly biased distribution of policy
   preferences. We evaluate this argument by measuring groups' revealed
   preferences directly, developing a set of ideal point estimates,
   IGscores, for over 2,600 interest groups and 950 members of Congress on
   a common scale. We generate the scores by jointly scaling a large
   dataset of interest groups' positions on congressional bills with
   roll-call votes on those same bills. Analyses of the scores uncover
   significant heterogeneity in the interest group system, with little
   conservative skew and notable inter-party differences in preference
   correspondence between legislators and ideologically similar groups.
   Conservative bias and homogeneity reappear, however, when weighting
   IGscores by groups' PAC contributions and lobbying expenditures. These
   findings suggest that bias among interest groups depends on the extent
   to which activities like PAC contributions and lobbying influence
   policymakers' perceptions about the preferences of organized interests.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The Syrian mediation process has repeatedly been characterized by its
   fragility. This fragility does not only stem from its inability to
   produce tangible results but it also rests on other dimensions such as
   its instability, the lack of impartiality of its mediation structure, or
   its lack of representativeness and capacity for action, all of which
   have been studied more tangentially. The purpose of this article is to
   determine the explanatory factors of these other dimensions of the
   fragility of the process. In order to do so, and based on the spoiler
   literature, it first operationalizes the spoiling behavior,
   distinguishing violent acts from non-violent ones. In the second place,
   their impact on the process is analyzed, identifying the relationship
   between them and fragility. In the third place, the mandates of the four
   Special Envoys assigned by UN to date (January 2020) are evaluated from
   this perspective. The results of this research show that the violent
   spoiling behavior in the Syrian mediation process explains the drastic
   reactions both by the mediating activity itself (suspension of the
   observation mission, withdrawal of the mediator or postponement of the
   opening of talks) and by the intervening parties (withdrawal or
   suspension of conversations), while non-violent behavior tends to attack
   the process in a more subtle way, threatening its relevance or
   impartiality. The most evident consequence is a weak mediation process,
   that may raise doubts on the ability of international mediation in the
   face of intractable armed conflicts.},

Abstract = {The economic decline of Italy between the mid-1990s and the outset of
   the financial crisis is a critical case in European political economy
   because its model of capitalism was deeply reformed at the time when its
   decline commenced. This paper argues that the Italian economic
   stagnation cannot be attributed to the lack of market-friendly reforms
   in a globalized economic context, as argued by previous literature.
   Instead, Italian economic decline is a consequence of institutional
   change which on the one hand has destroyed previous institutional
   complementarities, and on the other hand has led to an incoherent, or
   `hybrid,' capitalist setting. Under the lenses of the Varieties of
   Capitalism approach, this paper reviews the main reforms in the fields
   of corporate governance and finance as well as in the labor market. It
   shows that such reforms established new institutions alternatively apt
   to support both strategic coordination and market coordination,
   resulting in institutional incoherence, and mixed incentives. In the
   short-run, incoherent reforms have reduced the availability of capital
   to SMEs; in the longer-run, they failed to give actors incentives to
   pursue innovation. This paper contributes theories of economic
   growth/decline focused on the supply-side of the economy and it is
   compatible with other - non-rival - explanations focused on the
   demand-side.},

Abstract = {The application of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in public policy
   and practice ignore the structural circumstances in which children and
   their families live; the majority of studies on ACEs do not take
   socioeconomic position into account. Poverty and ACEs are often
   conflated, which can lead to unintended consequences for children and
   families and for the implementation of policy and practice. Using some
   of the COVID-19 crisis response measures in Scotland, in particular the
   example of the hubs for `vulnerable' children and receipt of free school
   meals (FSMs), this paper explores how poverty and adversity become
   conflated and how this can impede children's access to support and even
   to their legal entitlements. The sole criterion for eligibility to FSMs,
   outwith the universal entitlement for P1-P3s, is low income and the
   dignified response to an eligibility based exclusively on low income is
   to provide cash. Yet, many local authorities have imposed a nonmonetary
   approach to FSM eligibility, even when this has proved difficult, e.g.
   in sourcing food. By assuming that parents living in poverty will
   misspend monies meant for children they conflate poverty with adversity.
   The policy focus in Scotland should prioritise poverty, using a
   cash-first approach, and trust the majority of parents to prioritise
   their children. This would also free up resources to provide dedicated
   services to children who do in fact experience high levels of adversity.},

Abstract = {In her 2013 paper, Lee Ann Fujii proposes the concept of ``extra-lethal
   violence,{''} which explores the ways that actors use violence over and
   above a standard of lethality to achieve group goals, like in-group
   cohesion. This paper, in an extension of Fujii's work on
   extra-lethality, looks at the multiple audiences that such violence
   engages. Utilizing cases of rural violence in South Africa, this paper
   argues that the brutality of extra lethal violence provides an
   opportunity for mobilization not only by perpetrating populations, but
   also victim populations, even when it is infrequent. Organizations
   representing those who perceive themselves to be connected to the
   victims of such violence - White, mostly rural, and largely conservative
   South Africans - stand to benefit from focusing on the brutality of such
   violence. Victim groups benefit from exaggerating the scope and
   frequency of extra-lethality of such violence, not least because
   organizations representing White farmers draw more members and funds in
   increased threat environments. Activist groups overcome the barrier to
   mobilization presented by the rarity of extralethal violence by focusing
   on a small number of cases, and through repetition of the details.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The logic of French mental health policy-which already stands out
   against that of other countries-also appears at odds with the usual
   logic of French social policy. ``La sectorisation psychiatrique{''}
   rejected the liberalism prominent in the rest of the health system,
   adopted Beveridgean principles decades in advance of other policy areas,
   and began to centralize precisely during the period ofdeconcentration.
   This article explains these puzzles by pointing to the role of public
   sector trade unions. Archival sources document how the historical
   advocacy of unions representing public psychiatric workers shaped public
   policy in mental health. Examining their political activity can revise
   standard interpretations of the French welfare state and illuminate a
   generalizable theoretical relationship for comparative analysis.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {36-54},

Abstract = {Political consumerism is currently one of the most prevalent forms of
   non-institutionalized political engagement in Western democracies. This
   article aims to understand its psychological roots. We expect
   interindividual differences in psychological dispositions to be
   particularly relevant for political consumerism due to the
   individualized and cause-oriented nature of this form of political
   action. Our empirical evidence supports this claim: Open people favour,
   and conscientious people avoid, boycotting and buycotting. Agreeable
   persons tend to avoid boycotting in particular. These relationships
   persist even when political and social attitudes are controlled for.
   Thus, we show that psychological factors play an important role in
   shaping politically conscious consumption behaviour. At the same time,
   our study points out that personality profiles vary across different
   forms of political consumerism and modes of political action more
   generally. The characteristics of the diverse modes may help to
   understand this variation.},

Abstract = {What attracts voters to far-right parties? Emphasizing the repercussions
   of far-right parties' past achievements on the mobilization of voters'
   electoral demand, this paper develops an argument of context-dependent
   strategic far-right voting. Far-right parties seek to mobilize on a
   combination of demand for nativist policies and anti-establishment
   protest sentiment. Their capacity of doing so, however, critically
   depends on the strategic incentives they supply. My findings from a
   comparative analysis based on six waves of the European Election Study
   show that far-right parties' past attainment of legislative strength
   boosts the credibility of their policy appeal and broadens the scope of
   their protest appeal whereas their participation in government
   jeopardizes their capacity to mobilize on popular discontent.},

Abstract = {Party youth wings are common all over the world. They are expected to
   play an important role in linking young people to political parties.
   However, empirical research on the performance of party youth wings is
   scarce and political youth participation is seen as problematic. To what
   extent have party youth wings actually succeeded in attracting members
   over the last decade? And how can variations in party youth wing
   membership levels be explained? In order to answer these questions, this
   article develops and tests organization-based explanations on a unique
   dataset that contains data for nine party youth wings and the
   corresponding mother parties in the Netherlands over a period from 2001
   to 2016. It is found that youth wings are still a popular form of
   organizational linkage for parties. While the total party youth wing
   membership in the Netherlands is on the rise, large variations between
   party youth wings and their mother parties exist. Youth wing membership
   levels appear to be affected by the membership levels of the mother
   party. Other party-related characteristics, such as ideology and
   electoral success, do not seem to play a role.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the early 2000s, some observers predicted that the US parties'
   overseas association would play an increasing role in US politics (Dark
   2003). Changes since then, including the growth of the expatriate
   population, would seem to make such developments more likely. Yet many
   features of the US political system mitigate against party efforts to
   mobilise expatriate supporters, including single-member district
   elections and candidate-centred contests (Van Haute and Kernalegenn,
   2020). What, then, has been the 21st century trajectory of US party
   abroad activity? This article investigates this question, comparing the
   recent evolution Democrat and Republican party abroad efforts. It shows
   that the parties have taken different paths, with the Democrats'
   organisation focussing more on electoral mobilisation, while the
   Republicans' organisation has focussed more on issue advocacy and
   non-electoral representation. These different operational modes reflect
   the opportunities for, and constraints on, mobilising US expatriates for
   partisan purposes.},

Abstract = {I offer a critique of Weber's two ethics. The first layer is internal
   and concerned with their logics. The second layer considers the external
   knowledge necessary to apply them appropriately and argues that it is
   extremely difficult to come by. The third layer connects Weber's ethics
   to his politics because the choice of either ethic in almost any context
   is a value choice. This is apparent in Weber's application of these
   ethics to Germany foreign policy. He used his ethics in a rhetorical way
   to justify his values rather than using these values as a guide to
   policy assessment. This reversal is endemic to politics. One response
   might be to stipulate beforehand the kinds of policies that are
   unacceptable in democracies regardless of their expected outcomes.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic many states have resorted to proclaiming a
   state of emergency (SOE), expanding executive powers and curtailing
   civil liberties. Why have some states have declared SOEs when others
   have not? Our legal analysis suggests that although international law
   provides states with the option of declaring an SOE and derogating from
   human rights obligations to ensure the life of the nation, other ways to
   handle the pandemic without declaring an SOE do exist. Our theoretical
   analysis leads to three main propositions centred on the impact of
   regional diffusion, democratic institutions, and pandemic preparedness.
   Our empirical analysis combines a range of quantitative data sources to
   analyse the SOE decisions of 180 states during the first half of 2020.
   The results suggest that states' declarations of SOEs are driven by both
   external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment,
   characterised by many simultaneously declared SOEs, may reduce the
   reputational and political costs of emergency powers, making their
   employment more palatable. At the same time, internal characteristics,
   specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, have
   shaped governments' decisions. Weak democracies with poor preparedness
   have been considerably more likely to opt for an SOE than dictatorships
   and robust democracies with higher preparedness.},

Abstract = {Defying predictions of radical liberalization, labour market
   institutions in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe are
   characterized by relatively protective employment legislation, sometimes
   combined with collective bargaining rights. However, not all protective
   employment regimes survived political attack by neoliberal reformers.
   Existing theories in comparative political economy suggest that
   employment regimes reflect the relative political power of producer
   groups. Others have suggested that in Central and Eastern Europe the
   content of labour market reform was determined by the coercive influence
   of transnational actors. Through a comparative analysis of labour market
   reform in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, this article
   finds that trade unions played a key role in early institutional
   settlements over labour markets. However, in Romania and Slovakia, these
   institutional settlements were subsequently undermined by attacks by
   ideologically motivated domestic elites in episodes of disembedded
   politics. The article develops the concept of disembedded politics and
   demonstrates its importance in post-socialist institutional change.},

Abstract = {The following work has as its main objective to reflect on the current
   scenario of violence that occurs in Colombia after the signing of the
   Peace Agreement signed between the FARC-EP and the Colombian Government,
   in November 2016. First, the paper reviews the existing literature on
   the risks and possibilities offered by an agreement like this one in the
   disciplinary field of conflict resolution and peace research. Later, the
   article contrasts the structural and institutional reality presented by
   the Colombian State with the implications of the commitments agreed
   between the extinct guerrilla and the government of Juan Manuel Santos.
   Only in this way is possible to understand the contradictions and
   difficulties that the country is going through. In this way, an
   irresolute scenario of violence is shown that, in many places, after the
   Agreement, seems to intensify},

Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article reads Hobbes's social contract through a monster genre
   lens, revealing the presence of an ancient narrative structure that
   deploys powerful symbolic forces. It argues that Hobbes creatively
   utilizes the monster genre's mythic spatiality, linear trajectory, and
   subject positions-monster, victim, and hero-to compellingly present a
   fundamental problem plaguing humanity (wolfishness), as well as his
   political-theoretical solution (Leviathan). In this political monster
   tale, Leviathan, a heroic sovereign, conquers the wolf-man of the
   nightmarish state of nature, thereby making civil society possible.
   However, Hobbes potentially undercuts the success of his own political
   theory by framing his fellow citizens as monstrous wolf-men, and by
   associating his sovereign with a figure that, read mythically and
   symbolically, appears to be a complex hybrid that devours its subjects.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to identify the discourses of the
   political and social stakeholders that integrate the political filed,
   about the migratory policy. To address this aim the study inquires in
   the elements that compose the discourse, rather than in the position of
   the different actors in the field. The work is based on the analysis of
   55 interviews with government authorities, parliamentarians, think
   tanks, and social leaders linked to migrant communities. The discourses
   analysis was organized in the two dimensions of the migration policy,
   the first referring to the conditions for the admissibility of migrants
   and the second to the conditionality associated with the access to
   rights once migrants have been admitted. It concludes with a typology of
   four discursive models on the he conception of the migration policy in
   each of these axes.},

Abstract = {Previous work has shown public opinion toward immigrants is malleable
   based on how immigrants are described in media and elite rhetoric. In a
   survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of American
   adults, we extend this research to test for possible priming effects
   that occur based on how salient documentation status is when respondents
   proffer opinions on Latino immigrants. Our findings show that when
   subjects are first asked about ``undocumented Latino immigrants,{''}
   their attitudes toward ``Latino immigrants,{''} appear more negative,
   relative to when they are first asked about ``Latino immigrants{''}
   without invoking the legal modifier. Respondents channel their negative
   associations with ``illegal{''} or ``undocumented{''} immigration into
   their opinions of Latino immigrants writ large. The results have
   implications for political communication, media reporting on
   immigration, and policy debates, which frequently discuss both
   ``legal{''} and ``undocumented{''} immigration in the same context.},

Abstract = {Why do parties form pre-electoral coalitions (PECs) in executive
   elections? The party of the executive candidate may welcome coalition
   partners because of the votes that they can deliver. However, PECs often
   include parties that bring few votes to the coalition. I theorize that
   parties with a candidate in the executive election welcome small parties
   because of the campaign resources that they bring to the PEC. I test
   this argument using data from mayoral elections in Brazil, where parties
   do not control access to advertisement on radio/TV. The results indicate
   that campaign resources increase the likelihood of being admitted to a
   PEC when the party without an executive candidate has few votes to
   offer.},

Abstract = {Covid-19 has highlighted our fragile relationship with the planet. But
   it represents a minor challenge compared to the permanent havoc that
   runaway climate change threatens. Politicians and governments-some at
   least-are beginning to recognise the scale of the danger. In this
   article we assess the evolution of policy thinking on how to make
   climate transitions happen; the potential of the European Green Deal;
   and how progressives need to shape it and any UK counterpart to meet the
   challenges of modern society. The European initiative arises from a
   broad coalition spanning the political spectrum. Yet, its central thrust
   of active government offers the prospect of reviving a battered social
   democracy. We indicate the openings here for a pluralist, ecological
   left. The run-up to the next global climate conference-COP26-will be a
   vital period which will show whether parties and governments across the
   world are prepared to meet the climate change challenge.},

Abstract = {This article reconsiders the debate over the alleged embourgeoisement of
   the British working classes after Second World War. `Bourgeois affluence
   and proletarian apathy' examines why members of the New Left concluded
   that a `bourgeois' proletariat was incapable of revolutionary activity.
   `Washing machines and proletarian persistence' takes up the midcentury
   social scientific literature with an eye for the ways in which empirical
   research falsified key elements of that thesis. `Visible consumption and
   invisible debt' draws attention to the ways in which both liberal
   advocates for and Marxist critics of embourgeoisement overemphasized
   spending and underemphasized debt. Finally, I close by calling attention
   to some of the anecdotal and empirical evidence that suggests household
   indebtedness perpetuates working-class dependence upon capital.},

Abstract = {Violent movements in different parts of the world have employed large
   numbers of women fighters. I address the question of how and why so many
   women from diverse backgrounds join an ethnic insurgency. Informed by an
   intersectional approach, I suggest that when gender and ethnic
   inequalities overlap, an ethnic insurgency promising gender emancipation
   would have strong appeal among women. At the same time, the intersection
   of class and gender shapes distinctive patterns of mobilization among
   women of an ethnic minority. In particular, uneducated women with lower
   class backgrounds join the movement because it provides them with the
   most viable way out of patriarchal relations. I employ a multi-method
   research design to study a paradigmatic case of women in arms, the
   Kurdish insurgency. I use an original large dataset containing
   information about more than 9,000 militants, from extensive fieldwork
   entailing dozens of in-depth interviews, and an archival study of
   sources in primary languages. My findings reveal the effects of unequal
   relationships based on ethnicity, gender, and class on violent political
   mobilization and the ambivalent relationship between women's political
   agency and empowerment.},

Abstract = {Prevailing theories of public opinion toward immigration posit that
   responses to immigration are partially a function of local area
   demographics. However, evaluations of these theories suffer from the
   critique that local immigration patterns and attitudes toward immigrants
   are endogenous due to residential self-selection. Recent efforts attempt
   to address this problem by using experimental designs that reduce the
   possibility of selection bias. Instead of viewing residential mobility
   as a source of bias, I develop a theory that treats residential mobility
   and political behavior as interconnected strategies for responding to
   demographic change. Across two large sample studies, I find that
   residents who live in diversifying communities and face residential
   mobility constraints are more likely to express dissatisfaction with
   immigration and less likely to report desires to move than those who
   reside in more exit-friendly destinations.},

   national elites and state legislatures. Yet the debate is far more muted
   among members of the public, with over three quarters of Americans
   supporting a photo identification requirement to vote, including
   majorities of both Democrats and Republicans. Research points to several
   factors that affect opinion on VID; however, these studies have not led
   to a theoretical framework for understanding the broad consensus of
   public support. We propose that the public generally views policies
   requiring ID to vote as commonsensical, uncontroversial, and essentially
   costless insofar as most people (likely) possess the necessary ID. These
   perceptions, we argue, undergird the sizable public consensus on VID. If
   true, then when presented with dissonant information cueing controversy
   and increasing the costs of compliance with the law, we should expect
   support to substantially decline. We test these hypotheses using
   observational and experimental data. We find that citizens are
   significantly less supportive of an ID requirement upon learning of
   lower public support, and become dramatically less supportive when
   obtaining such identification involves some degree of cost. This latter
   result also holds among Republicans-a group that has long-been
   exceptionally supportive of VID. We conclude that the strong public
   consensus on voter ID is, in large part, a result of its costlessness to
   most citizens combined with limited familiarity with the policy, its
   controversial nature, and the costs potentially incurred by other
   citizens to comply with the law.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has claimed that peacekeepers are more likely to
   mutiny or attempt military coups against their governments after
   returning home. These trends stand in contrast to the case of Ghana,
   which witnessed a perhaps unprecedented transition out of the ``coup
   trap{''} to stable democratic rule, including multiple transfers of
   power to the political opposition while providing substantial and
   ongoing peacekeeping manpower. This is especially interesting given
   Ghana's infamous mutiny in the Congo and the coup against Kwame Nkrumah,
   had their roots in peacekeeping. Potentially seen as a deviant case
   through the lens of recent scholarship, as evaluation of Ghana's
   experience illustrate that different leaders under various regime types
   deliberately utilized peacekeeping deployments as a coup avoidance
   strategy. This experience has also acted as a tool to gain military
   resources from foreign donors, while the government has deliberately
   made efforts to avoid mission hardships and perceptions of victimization
   seen in other contingents.},

Abstract = {Rural-to-urban migration is reshaping the economic and social landscape
   of the Global South. Yet migrants often struggle to integrate into
   cities. We conduct countrywide audit experiments in India to test
   whether urban politicians discriminate against internal migrants in
   providing constituency services. Signaling that a citizen is a city
   newcomer, as opposed to a long-term resident, causes incumbent
   politicians to be significantly less likely to respond to requests for
   help. Standard ``nativist{''} concerns do not appear to explain this
   representation gap. We theorize that migrants are structurally disposed
   to participate in destination-area elections at lower rates than
   long-term residents. Knowing this, reelection-minded politicians decline
   to cater to migrant interests. Follow-up experiments support the
   hypothesis. We expect our findings to generalize to fast-urbanizing
   democracies, with implications for international immigration too.
   Policywise, mitigating migrants' de facto disenfranchisement should
   improve their welfare.},

Abstract = {There are two ways to approach political representation. We can view
   each type of representation or each site of representation - namely a
   representative actor or institution - on an individual basis and study
   its internal dynamics. Alternatively, we can look at how different forms
   of representation and representative actors and institutions interact in
   asystem of representation. In this article, I develop the second view. I
   make three contributions to the theory of representation from systemic
   thinking. Methodologically, I explain the contours of a systemic
   approach to political representation. Descriptively, I propose a
   definition of a system of representation that captures representative
   pluralism, distribution of representative work and different levels of
   representation. Normatively, I set criteria for judging the system of
   representation and its individual components with systemic criteria.},

Abstract = {The article examines the latest exhibition commemorating Indigenous
   soldiers produced by the Australian War Memorial titledFor Country, For
   Nation. It suggests that the exhibited material maps and visualises a
   neglected aspect of Indigenous history and as such expresses Indigenous
   resurgence and sovereignty. And yet, these artworks are not outside of
   colonial structures of power. While the article views the artworks ofFor
   Country, For Nationas an expression of Indigenous visual sovereignty, it
   also examines how they operate within setter colonial mentalities that
   disavow Indigenous sovereignty to legitimise settler authority. The
   Australian War Memorial operates in this order by refusing to
   commemorate the Frontier Wars. The article argues that despite the
   inclusion of Indigenous soldiers in official war commemorations is a
   sign of Indigenous recognition, as long as the Memorial refuses to
   include the Frontier Wars, this recognition legitimises colonial
   authority and contributes to ongoing settler colonialism.},

Abstract = {As a common feature of Nordic countries, the Finnish landscape of thinks
   tanks has been populated by large corporatist interest organisations and
   government-funded research organisations. In addition to this, since
   2005, party-affiliated think tanks form a notable part of the picture.
   Recently, several small think tanks that are oriented towards specific
   themes, such as international relations, the environment and feminism,
   have been founded. This article examines Finnish developments in the
   field of think tanks with two objectives. First, it gives a general
   overview of the Finnish think tank landscape. Second, by using interview
   data and public mission statements of the most prominent think tanks, it
   explores how these organisations see their role in Finnish society. What
   is their relationship with media and the political machinery, and how
   does this relate to their position and activities as either consensual
   or adversarial actors? It is concluded that redeeming the place of think
   tanks in the Finnish polity is a continuing challenge, and resorting to
   adversarial tactics is not a favourable way to do so. This approach has
   mostly been attempted by neoliberal think tanks that, in the past, have
   also profited from corporatist structures to enhance their objectives.},

Abstract = {This paper adds to existing literature by reassessing the racial
   participation gap after placing online activity within the repertoire of
   minorities' political actions. Even though Asian Americans are the most
   resourced in terms of Internet access, I theorize about how individual
   and structural-level impediments uniquely disadvantage this group from
   participating in politics online-widening overall participation
   disparities. Using data from the 2016 National Asian American Survey, I
   find that while the racial participation gap is similar for Latina/os
   and African Americans compared to whites, regardless of the activity's
   platform either offline or online, disparities magnify solely for Asian
   Americans when considering digital modes of political behavior. The
   paper ends by noting how the Internet may contribute to rather than
   solve issues of political inequality across race and discusses
   distortions in which political voices are heard or muted offline and
   online.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article argues that new governance spaces evidence a paradigm shift
   that has irretrievably changed how formal governmental relations with
   Britain's Muslim communities are established, facilitated and
   maintained. It is a paradigm shift that is driven by the ideology of
   neoliberalism and the efficacy of the market. Having begun under New
   Labour, this shift was further catalysed by the election of the
   Conservative-led Coalition government in 2010 and successive
   Conservative-majority governments since premised on the basis of the
   `problematisation' of Muslims and the religion of Islam. This article
   evidences that in addition to transforming the nature of formal
   governmental relations, so too has it transformed who `represents'
   Britain's Muslims as indeed the issues engaged. Drawing on participatory
   approaches that afford unprecedented access to the political spaces and
   mechanisms within which formal governmental relations with Britain's
   Muslims were facilitated, this article uses critical analyses of three
   social issues-counter extremism, Islamophobia and child sexual
   exploitation-to illustrate the article's overarching narrative.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's takeover of Crimea in 2014 Russian public rallied around
   the flag and public opinion entered a relatively static state often
   called the ``Crimean consensus{''}. The presidential elections of 2018
   became a turning point in the dynamics of public opinion. Sociological
   data from that period reveals growing anti-establishment sentiments,
   demand for change, social justice, a peaceful foreign policy, and civic
   activism. To analyze these changes the study combines data from four
   rounds of focus groups with sociological surveys on the maturity of
   moral values and the perception of institutional injustice, conducted
   during 2018-2020. All sources of our sociological data demonstrate, that
   the main changes are associated with post-materialist values: demand for
   the rule of law, political rights and civic engagement prevails over
   concerns about basic consumption and material inequality. The data also
   reveals a value related rift between the ruling elites and the
   population. Whereas the population increasingly demands the rule of law
   and/or social contract, the ruling class, as the respondents perceive
   it, remains guided by interpersonal dealings and conformism. The
   essential role of postmaterialist values in defining the new social
   agenda implies that the ongoing changes are not temporary and reversible
   but reflect a more fundamental process of transition to postmaterialist
   value system. However, given a short period of observations the
   available evidence is not fully conclusive. Data from the new round of
   European values study expected to be released before the end of 2020 can
   help clarify the dynamics of value change in Russia and its possible
   influence on the recent evolution of public opinion.},

Abstract = {Why did Uruguay become the first country in the world to legalise
   marijuana in 2013? Based on extensive original research and
   unprecedented review of secondary sources, the article assesses
   alternative explanatory accounts through a unique combination of process
   tracing and counterfactual analysis. By tracing cannabis reform in
   Uruguay both as it was and was not but could have been in the absence of
   hypothesised explanatory factors, the article assesses the role of these
   factors in the causal story. Specifically, the article shows how and why
   political will and social mobilisation influenced both the reform
   process and outcome. In doing so, the article cuts through the haze of
   rival explanations to present the clearest picture of drug policy reform
   in Uruguay to date.},

Abstract = {Charismatic leaders are often assumed to drive the electoral success of
   populist radical right parties. Yet, little attention is given to how
   voter evaluations of leaders influence individual voting behavior. To
   our knowledge, no systematic and comparative tests of this empirical
   question exist. In this paper, we test to what extent voters' support
   for populist radical right parties is fueled by leaders' appreciation.
   In order to examine leader effects on the populist radical right vote,
   we rely on an original dataset pooling 29 National Election Studies from
   ten established West European parliamentary democracies (1985-2018). Our
   analysis finds that: (1) voters' evaluation of party leaders is
   significantly associated with voting for populist radical right parties;
   (2) leader evaluations are more important than left-right self-placement
   when it comes to voting for the populist radical right, and (3) leader
   effects are more important for populist radical right voters than for
   other voters.},

Abstract = {This article is about two ideologies.Welfare-consequentialismholds that
   government should adopt the policies that can rationally be expected to
   maximise aggregate welfare.Populismholds that society is divided into a
   pure people and a corrupt elite, and asserts that public policy should
   express the general will of the people. The responses of world
   governments to the coronavirus pandemic have clearly illustrated the
   contrast between these ideologies, and the danger that populist
   government poses to human wellbeing. The article argues that
   welfare-consequentialism offers a vaccine for populism. First, it rebuts
   populism's claims about who government is for and what it should do.
   Second, the pessimism and distrust that make people crave populism can
   be satiated by successful welfare-consequentialist government. Finally,
   welfare-consequentialism's sunny narrative of progress can be just as
   compelling to people as populism's dark story has proven to be.},

Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {166-186},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Warren Harding's administration was not, as is widely perceived, a
   failed experiment in executive whiggism but a surprisingly spirited
   defense of presidential authority against the strongest anti-executive
   backlash since Reconstruction. His support for active-interventionist
   conservatism and a modified style of ``steward{''} leadership separated
   him from his traditionalist Republican predecessors-William McKinley and
   William H. Taft-and successor-Calvin Coolidge. Ambitiously, Harding
   sought to fuse elements of the Roosevelt-Wilson experiments in
   presidential leadership with his own, less egocentric view of
   ``balanced{''} constitutional government. His adaptability helped
   maintain the expansion of the administrative state and of the
   ``institutional{''} and ``rhetorical{''} aspects of presidential power,
   albeit at more modest rates than under Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
   Wilson. By initiating, or further enabling, growth trends in cabinet
   government, media influence, and institutional reform, he developed
   operational templates used by later Republican presidents, notably,
   Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Rather than being dismissed as
   irrelevant, therefore, Harding's tenure should be credited both for its
   innovation and flexibility at a time of institutional crisis and for its
   contribution to the development of post-1930s Republican presidential
   leadership.},

Abstract = {Scholars and pundits fear that the American public's commitment to
   democracy is declining and that citizens are willing to embrace
   candidates who would trample democratic principles. We examine whether
   violations of those principles generate resistance from voters and/or
   top campaign donors and whether such resistance extends across partisan
   lines. In a conjoint survey experiment, we investigate how regular
   Americans and donor elites trade off partisanship, policy positions, and
   support for democratic values when choosing between hypothetical
   political candidates. Our findings indicate that both citizens and
   donors punish candidates who endorse violations of democratic principles
   irrespective of the candidate's party. However, partisans react very
   differently to candidates who support voter identification laws that
   threaten access to the franchise. This polarized response is especially
   strong among donors. These results suggest that the public and donors
   may sometimes be willing to forgive transgressions against democratic
   norms that align with their partisan and policy preferences.},

Abstract = {Does exposure to activist political art influence citizens' beliefs
   about solitary confinement? This research uniquely assesses the impact
   of exposure to an art exhibition on support for solitary confinement. It
   utilizes an experimental research design that involved randomly
   assigning half of the participants to enter a public art installment
   replicating a solitary confinement prison cell prior to completing a
   survey that measured opinions about the use of this practice. We find
   that participants who entered the art exhibition for a short amount of
   time were less likely to support solitary confinement. We also analyze
   how the political, demographic, and attitudinal characteristics of
   respondents, influence the impact of the artistic intervention on
   attitudes about solitary confinement. We find evidence that gender,
   race, political ideology, and pre-existing attitudes about government
   and the criminal justice system are strongly associated with opinions
   about the use of solitary confinement.},

Abstract = {The end of the social democratic century has marked the beginning of a
   new era of political and economic imbalance in Europe. These dynamics
   are visible even in Germany, despite its reputation for stability. This
   article proposes reorienting the paradigm for research on Germany's
   political economy from stability to imbalance in order to help
   illuminate central causal processes within the country and across the
   rich democracies. As our review of prominent approaches to the German
   Model reveals, recent developments have unseated the mechanisms that
   once balanced competing social forces. Putting contemporary tensions
   centre stage, we outline three vantage points from which to study
   political and economic imbalance: the systemic properties of capitalism,
   multivalent policy feedback, and the organisational foundations of
   creative adjustment. This conceptual reorientation should equip scholars
   to use Germany not merely for theorising the roots of stability in the
   past, but also to employ it as a powerful prism to explain the dynamics
   of imbalance in the current era.},

Abstract = {Drawing on evidence from the 2011 Egyptian uprising, this article
   demonstrates how the use of two social media platforms - Facebook and
   Twitter - contributed to a discrete mobilizational outcome: the staging
   of a successful first protest in a revolutionary cascade, referred to
   here as `first-mover mobilization'. Specifically, it argues that these
   two platforms facilitated the staging of a large, nationwide and
   seemingly leaderless protest on 25 January 2011, which signaled to
   hesitant but sympathetic Egyptians that a revolution might be in the
   making. It draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence, including
   interviews, social media data and surveys, to analyze three mechanisms
   that linked these platforms to the success of the January 25 protest:
   (1) protester recruitment, (2) protest planning and coordination, and
   (3) live updating about protest logistics. The article not only
   contributes to debates about the role of the Internet in the Arab Spring
   and other recent waves of mobilization, but also demonstrates how
   scholarship on the Internet in politics might move toward making more
   discrete, empirically grounded causal claims.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does peacekeeping reduce one-sided violence in
   civil wars? This article argues that local sources of violence,
   particularly ethnic geography, affect peacekeeping effectiveness.
   Existing studies focus on the features of individual missions, yet
   curbing one-sided violence also depends on peacekeepers' capacity to
   reduce the opportunities and incentives for violence. Moving from the
   idea that territorial control is a function of ethnic polarization, the
   article posits that peacekeepers are less effective against one-sided
   violence where power asymmetries are large (low polarization) because
   they (1) create incentives for escalation against civilians and (2) are
   less effective at separating/monitoring combatants. The UN mission in
   Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2001 is examined to show that UN troops reduce
   one-sided violence, but their effectiveness decreases as power
   asymmetries grow.},

Abstract = {When does increasing mobilization effort increase turnout? Recent
   experiments find second calls containing a reminder to vote increase
   turnout beyond an initial contact. We argue existing studies cannot
   explain why reminder calls are effective because they test bundled
   treatments including a late mobilization attempt, a late mobilization
   attempt given earlier contact, and potentially activating reciprocity
   established in earlier contact. We report results from a two-round voter
   mobilization field experiment that allows us to isolate these different
   mechanisms. We find that reminder calls increase turnout by 1.2\% points
   among subjects contacted in an earlier attempt, but that enhancing
   reciprocity by providing a reminder call offer during an early call does
   not increase turnout beyond a second call. Additionally, we fail to find
   heterogeneous effects of reminder calls by stated preference for a
   reminder or by stated vote intention, suggesting certain mechanisms do
   not explain the effects of reminder calls.},

Abstract = {This article asks about the relationship between innovation and
   education in a post-humanist context. For this purpose, biopolitics is
   assumed as an interpretive and critical key through the concept of
   dispositive (understood here as an explanatory mechanism), which will
   allow evaluating the dynamics of the exercise of power, control and
   normalization of education through the discourse of innovation. In this
   way, it is intended to understand innovation in education as a discourse
   that establishes concrete practices to cope, govern and live reality.
   Finally, the forms of integration between innovation and education in a
   specific context, that of post-humanism, are referred to in order to
   reflect on the functions of the school in this new human habitat and to
   propose the possibilities of post-human education, in this case, from
   some postulates of critical pedagogy.},

Abstract = {The document analyzes the legislation of the Russian Federation and the
   member states of the European Union on extradition from the point of
   view of its compliance with the current European Convention on
   Extradition. It also makes proposals to improve the rules of the
   Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation that regulates the
   extradition procedure. Methodologically, the work uses scientific
   methods of analysis and synthesis, as well as the historical,
   comparative method, all in an integrated approach. Among the
   conclusions, the fact that for the previous legal provisions to work,
   its consolidation only in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian
   Federation is insufficient. The first step to put them into practice
   could be to discuss the issue of making the necessary amendments to the
   Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil Matters, as
   well as in the Family and Criminal Affairs regulations of January 22,
   1993, of which the countries of the European Convention on Extradition
   are parties.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, Mazatlan has experienced unprecedented economic
   growth dynamics in the real estate industry, which has translated into
   significant increases in urban expansion. With the above, it is expected
   that there will be an indirect effect on an increase in local income,
   particularly in taxes on land, such is the case of the property
   acquisition tax (ISAI). In this sense, the present work seeks to measure
   the correlation between the urban expansion of Mazatlan and the ISAI,
   the methodology used is a quantitative approach through econometric
   techniques and construction of indices to capture the effect of urban
   expansion for later correlate them with the ISAI. The data collected are
   directly from official sources such as the Municipal Database System, H.
   Ayuntamiento de Mazatlan through the Directorate of Income and the
   Council for the Economic Development of Sinaloa. Among the results
   found, it can be mentioned that Mazatlan has been involved in a process
   of land speculation and land use directed at large complexes and
   residential tourism developments, segregating the local population
   towards the outskirts of the city. On the other hand, despite the fact
   that urban growth has been accelerated, the income from the property
   acquisition tax does not show a significant correlation.},

Abstract = {The idea that there might be democratic forms of non-participation has
   been largely overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on
   democracy. Non-participation has variously been seen as a threat to the
   proper functioning of democracy, as a rational choice, or (more rarely)
   as potentially beneficial at the systems level. We argue that there are
   forms of non-participation that may be justified on democratic grounds.
   Our main theoretical move is to distinguish between reflectivity (or
   thoughtfulness) and participation. We argue that the normative value of
   both participation and non-participation is conditioned by reflectivity,
   such that there may be democratically desirable forms of reflective
   non-participation. To support our claims, we provide examples of how
   non-participation can help support democratic goods-such as inclusion,
   influence, and legitimacy-that are normally associated only with
   democratic participation.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Pages = {1160-1171},

Abstract = {Several scholars suggest that religion is on the rise in party
   competition due to the upswing of radical right parties presenting
   themselves as defender of Christianity against a Muslim threat. The lack
   of comparative and longitudinal studies calls for a systematic
   investigation of parties' religious references in order to know whether
   religion indeed is on the rise in party politics. Conducting a partially
   computer-based quantitative content analysis of 71 election manifestos
   in five countries since the 1980s, we provide empirical evidence that
   religion is recently gaining salience in party competition. The study
   reveals that we are experiencing the evolution of a new religious
   cleavage originating from the exclusion of Islam and resulting in an
   emphasis on Christian roots and values and in a strategic use of secular
   arguments by the radical right. The findings further suggest that
   mainstream parties responded to these religious discourses by
   incorporating religious elements in their own election manifestos.},

Abstract = {The work analysis the position of the Catholic Church as a political
   actor in Latin America after the Second World War until the eighties,
   with a specific focus on Liberation Theology. It is a documentary-based
   critical analytical investigation, where the theological and
   philosophical elements that have engendered this political theology are
   considered. In it, a narrative of the Christian sacred texts is produced
   from the concrete man in a situation of poverty in this region, with an
   approach called ``anthropological re-centering{''}. Its political
   character in general is expressed in the ``preferential option for the
   poor{''} framed in the Second Vatican Council and in the Populorum
   Progressio of Paul VI. There are moderate branches such as People's
   Theology and other more radical ones that are based on the Marxist
   method of the ``class struggle{''} and the ``violent way{''}, as means
   to solve the social cause. The result is a confrontation between the
   Marxist method and the method of the Social Doctrine of the Church for
   the solution of the problems of poverty and indirectly of dependency,
   where the ``epistemological irreconcilability{''} between Marxist
   doctrine and Christian doctrine is evidenced.},

Abstract = {This article revisits a principle of distributive justice accepted by
   most, if not all, scholars of climate justice. The principle at
   stake,the limit, protects those who are very badly off from bearing the
   costs of climate change mitigation. The persistent noncompliance of
   developed states with their obligations toward burden sharing, however,
   means that this principle is increasingly in tension with successful
   climate change mitigation, given it seems to require that those in
   poverty have continued access to emissions in cases where alternative
   forms of energy are not provided. In the first half of the paper I
   outline this tension and show how the dominant expression of the limit
   in the literature, advanced by Henry Shue, must be abandoned. I argue
   that any attempt to articulate the limit in current circumstance, where
   the carbon budget is very scarce, must consider the climate harm
   associated with continued subsistence emissions. The second half of the
   article defends a principle,the exemption, which is best able to
   maintain the strong commitment to shielding those below the minimal
   threshold from the costs of mitigation, even in light of the potential
   harm that will result if they require emissions to fuel their energy
   needs.},

Abstract = {Once an exclusively white enterprise, the last forty-five years have
   witnessed the emergence of a disproportionately Latinx immigration law
   enforcement workforce. This article addresses the question of why
   Latinxs elect to work for agencies that have systematically targeted the
   ethnic communities to which they belong. Where existing scholarship has
   often implied Latinxs may self-select into immigration law enforcement
   due to a lack of identification with the immigrant-experience, a
   dissociation with ethnic identity, and generally restrictionist
   immigration attitudes, this article finds little empirical evidence to
   support such an assumption. Analysis of interviews with sixty-one Latinx
   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents across Arizona,
   California, and Texas reveals, instead, Latinxs elect to work in
   immigration law enforcement in service of economic self-interest and
   survival, with ``money,{''} ``a good job,{''} and ``benefits{''} cited
   as the primary motivation(s) behind applying for and accepting a job in
   immigration. This pattern holds irrespective of individual agents'
   levels of identification with the immigrant-experience and particular
   attitudes toward immigration, and suggests a diversity in the
   demographics of immigration law enforcement agencies that extends beyond
   mere race and ethnicity, to include a diversity of perspective and
   potential for empathy.},

Abstract = {The literature oncorrectandconsistentvoting has focused on
   issue-opinions and argument-positions when examining whether vote
   decisions correspond to individual political preferences. However, the
   question whether vote decisions align with basic political values has
   largely been neglected so far. This paper introduces a novel measure
   namedvalue consistent voting. It finds that, in Switzerland, around 25\%
   jettison their basic political values when deciding on proposals. Using
   multilevel regression analysis of survey data, this paper investigates
   the determinants of value consistent voting. Three theoretical
   approaches are tested; the sophistication, identification and
   ambivalence hypotheses. The results show that political sophistication
   and identification foster value consistent voting. Moreover, there is an
   interaction between education and adhering to the preferred party's vote
   recommendation. This finding supports the thesis that highly educated
   citizens use heuristics most efficiently. However, the more ambivalent
   people are, the more often they vote against their basic political
   values.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},

Abstract = {Hegemony is one of the most widely diffused concepts in the contemporary
   social sciences and humanities internationally, interpreted in a variety
   of ways in different disciplinary and national contexts. However, its
   contemporary relevance and conceptual coherence has recently been
   challenged by various theories of `posthegemony'. This article offers a
   critical assessment of this theoretical initiative. In the first part of
   the article, I distinguish between three main versions of posthegemony -
   temporal, foundational and expansive - characterized by different
   understandings of the temporal and logical implications of hegemony. I
   then offer a critical assessment of the shared presuppositions of these
   theories, including their `pre-Gramscianism', their indebtedness to
   Laclau and Mouffe's formulation of hegemony, and their characterization
   of hegemony in terms compatible with modern theories of sovereignty. I
   conclude by arguing that the contradictions and oversights of the debate
   on posthegemony encourage us to undertake a reassessment of the real
   historical complexity of hegemonic politics and its different traditions
   of conceptualization.},

Abstract = {The world is in flux, both in terms of the changing global distribution
   of power and the declining commitment of the United States to the
   international order. This article argues that, unlike many other major
   powers, India is well positioned to benefit from the contemporary
   disorder. The U.S. has courted India as a strategic partner since the
   early 2000s, supporting India's grand strategy of developing hard-power
   capabilities while addressing regional threats and eventually attaining
   great-power status. In return, India has supported Washington's
   overarching goal of securing the Indo-Pacific region. Although
   significant challenges remain in the management of U.S.-India relations,
   the Trump presidency has on balance benefited India's grand strategy.
   New Delhi views the decline of U.S. leadership in the international
   order - a phenomenon whose origins precede Trump - as an opportunity to
   play a leading global role. However, India's predisposition toward
   strategic autonomy may complicate the process.},

Abstract = {To what extent is populist rule associated with a decline in press
   freedom and freedom of expression? Populist rule refers to government
   headed by charismatic leaders who seek to gain and retain power by
   mobilizing mass constituencies that are typically free of other
   political attachments. Populism in this sense matters for two reasons:
   (1) controlling the media is a core objective of populists compared with
   other types of political leaders, who can rely on other organizational
   links to supporters; and (2) the interests of populist parties are
   virtually equivalent to the interests of party leaders, which means that
   populists face different time horizons and constraints on their behavior
   than the leaders of more deeply institutionalized parties. Using
   cross-national data on up to ninety-one countries from 1980 to 2014,
   this paper tests whether populist rule is associated with the erosion of
   press freedom and freedom of expression relative to other types of
   government and whether any effect is conditional on the ideology of the
   populist government in question. It finds that populist rule is
   associated with a decline in most measures of media freedom relative to
   programmatic party rule. However, this effect is lessened for
   right-leaning populist governments.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the formulation, adoption, implementation and
   evaluation of the Elder Care Allowance (APA) since 2001 at the national
   and departmental levels, with a fine-grained case study of
   implementation in one department. We show that despite elder care being
   highly feminized, this policy instrument was gender blind when it was
   put on the agenda and adopted. When it was implemented at the
   departmental level, the room for manoeuvre has not been used to reduce
   gender inequality, and at the national level, a recent movement to
   gender policy evaluation has not yet produced significant effects with
   regard to elder care. Thus, rather than transforming gender norms, it
   has led to a kind of gender accommodation that reflects existing gender
   relations.},

Abstract = {Should materials aimed at increasing Latino voter turnout be in English
   or bilingual? Credible, theoretical arguments can be made both ways:
   bilingual materials may be more effective if signaling cultural
   awareness or less effective if seen as pandering. We tested these
   competing hypotheses with two rounds of randomized field experiments in
   New Jersey and Virginia in 2015, and North Carolina in 2016. While some
   GOTV experiments have used bilingual mailers, previous scholarship has
   not tested whether bilingual mailers are more effective than
   English-language materials. In the 2015 elections, both treatments
   increased turnout, and the monolingual English version was more
   effective at increasing turnout than the bilingual version. These
   results are replicated in the high salience 2016 election in North
   Carolina. These results indicate that further research is needed about
   bilingual communication across political and demographic contexts and
   about how household composition may condition the effects of bilingual
   communication.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how candidate experience in previous
   elections, measured by the number of prior candidacies, affects ballot
   placement in list PR systems. The central argument is that selectorates
   find experienced candidates attractive because of proven loyalty and
   higher voter recognition. Moreover, prior candidacies strengthen
   candidates' familiarity with intra-party selection processes. Returning
   candidates, however, also risk becoming victims of a seniority trap:
   after not succeeding to access realistic positions after a number of
   elections, additional candidacies become harmful as selectorates lose
   interest. Using data on 18,393 candidacies by 9,905 candidates of
   parties in Flanders (Belgium) (1987-2019), a set of logit and Cox models
   test the hypothesised curvilinear effect of prior candidacies on access
   to realistic positions. Both approaches lead to similar outcomes,
   confirming that experience positively affects ballot placement but with
   decreasing marginal utility. These findings have important implications
   for career strategies and contribute to knowledge on nomination
   processes and candidate turnover.},

Abstract = {Does the Early Warning System alert the European Commission about the
   prospects of passing new policy? We present a model of European Union
   policymaking in which the Early Warning System plays an important
   signalling role. In our model, the Commission uses signals from the
   Early Warning System to update its belief about governments' voting
   strategies in the Council. The Commission may then anticipate difficult
   negotiations by withdrawing its proposal early. We find empirical
   evidence for our theory: (1) reasoned opinions submitted by national
   parliaments strongly predict opposition from their governments and (2)
   the Commission is more likely to withdraw proposals that receive
   reasoned opinions, even in the absence of a yellow card. Our results run
   counter to the dominant view in the literature that the Early Warning
   System is not a very relevant aspect of EU decision-making. Instead,
   reasoned opinions constitute a clear signal that negotiations are more
   likely to fail.},

   Bundestag during the 18th legislative period and shows the dynamics of
   parliamentary party competition during the European refugee crisis using
   the quantitative text analysis tool Wordfish and a comprehensive
   qualitative validation. The dynamic field of refugee and migration
   policy puts parties and in particular the Social Democratic Party of
   Germany (SPD) under pressure against the background of the ``liberal
   dilemma{''} as well as through changing thematic emphasis and the
   resulting logic of competition. The position of the SPD varied
   considerably in the otherwise stable parliamentary competition as the
   party found itself in a balancing act between its formal government
   responsibility and its ideological position.},

Abstract = {Legislatures worldwide are dominated by wealthy elites, who are often
   out of touch with the needs and problems of citizens. Research shows
   that the underrepresentation of the working class matters in terms of
   policy processes and outcomes. Yet the research on class has largely
   focused on blue-collar representatives, who are primarily men.
   Working-class women are more likely to hold pink-collar jobs, or
   low-status occupations dominated by women. We argue that pink-collar
   legislators are uniquely positioned to legislate over education and
   social service policy. To test our argument, we combine a new coding of
   working-class backgrounds that accounts for pink-collar representation
   with state spending data on education and social services from US states
   over time. Modeling compositional budget data, we find that class and
   gender intersect to shape policy outcomes via state budget allocations,
   with women's pink-collar representation associated with increased
   spending on both education and social services.},

Abstract = {Scholars of comparative constitution-making and direct democracy agree
   that economic conditions affect public support for constitutional reform
   but disagree as to how. Prospect theory suggests both approaches may be
   correct, depending on the political and economic context in which voters
   operate. Fourteen states periodically ask their citizens whether to call
   a state constitutional convention, making this the oldest form of direct
   democracy in the United States. We test our theory in pre-election polls
   in two of these states and a survey experiment. According to the
   results, negative perceptions of economic and government performance
   increase support for conventions when voters view them as opportunities
   to correct problems. On the other hand, if a convention represents a
   chance to improve on an acceptable status quo, voters with positive
   performance evaluations become more supportive. Our findings contribute
   to the heuristics literature and inform normative debates over direct
   democracy and popular constitutionalism.},

Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, urban policy in Brazil has undergone a major
   transformation, both in terms of regulatory frameworks and the
   involvement of citizens in the process of policy-making. As an intense
   process of institutional innovation and mobilisation for decent public
   services took place, academics started to consider the impact of
   institutionalisation on the autonomy of social movements. Using
   empirical evidence from a city in the northeast of Brazil, this article
   addresses the wider literature on citizen participation and social
   movements to examine specifically the problem with co-optation. I
   examine the risks linked to co-optation, risks that can undermine the
   credibility of social movements as agents of change, and explore the
   tensions that go beyond the `co-optation versus autonomy' divide, an
   issue frequently found in the practices of social movements, in their
   dealings with those in power. In particular, this article explores the
   learning processes and contentious relationships between mainly
   institutionally oriented urban movements and local government. This
   study found that the learning of deliberative skills not only led to
   changes in the objectives and repertoires of housing movements, but also
   to the inclusion of new components in their objectives that provide room
   for creative agency and which, in some cases, might allow them to
   maintain their autonomy from the state.},

Abstract = {Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) aim to increase voters' political
   competence by providing them with the closest political party according
   to their preferences. To do this, VAAs usually compare and aggregate the
   positions of users and political parties on a set of policy issues by
   defining a conceptual space and some distance metric on it. In this
   paper, we argue that the main method for performing the comparison
   adapts to users' preferences unsatisfactorily because 1) they use
   unjustified a priori decisions for weighting policy issues and 2) they
   employ the same issue-voting space on all policy issues. Some
   exceptional cases address these issues by providing a community-based
   recommendation, but often come with lack of interpretability. To fill
   these gaps, we propose an adaptive algorithm that learns the
   configuration of the conceptual space from users' answers. We employ a
   hybrid VAA that uses expert coding for the party positions and users'
   data to adjust the calculation of the distance between users and
   parties. This new matching method, the Learning VAA, innovates by
   adjusting the saliency and issue-voting space for every policy issue. We
   argue and empirically demonstrate that our model fits better the users'
   preferences while providing a higher degree of interpretability.},

Abstract = {Why is there so much variation in the ethnic composition of cabinets?
   Previous work has focused on cabinet policy alignment, largely
   overlooking the role of identity-based characteristics like ethnicity. I
   theorize that country leaders make ethnic cabinet appointments to gain
   political support, both when country-level ethnic diversity is high and
   when ethnic groups rely on leader decisions in order to receive
   resources. Cabinet appointments offer leaders a way to distribute
   resources while creating a credible commitment to remove these resources
   if ethnic group support wanes. I introduce a new cross-national
   time-series dataset of cabinet minister names from 149 countries from
   1967 to 2017. Using novel methods from computer science, I code the
   ethnicity of cabinet ministers' names and construct a cabinet diversity
   index for each country-year. After validating this measure, I find
   support for my hypothesis. Country leaders in reliant societies increase
   ethnic cabinet appointments seven to twenty-five percent over leaders in
   non-reliant societies. The results provide the first large-scale
   cross-national analysis of the strategic ways in which leaders use
   cabinet seats to manage the distribution of resources.},

Abstract = {We present data on the proportions and seniority of female and male
   political scientists working in the UK. Comparing the results with
   previous research from 2011, we find that progress has been made.
   However, progress has been incremental and we find no qualitative
   changes in the status of female political scientists: they continue to
   be outnumbered by their male counterparts; they are overrepresented in
   the least senior job groups and underrepresented in the most senior; and
   the average female political scientist occupies a less senior position
   than the average male counterpart. We also run regression analyses to
   explore the impact of broader contextual factors on the proportion of
   female political scientists within a unit and that unit's `gender
   seniority gap'. We find evidence that gender equality kitemarks,
   university mission group membership, the gender of the Head of Unit and
   Vice-Chancellor and the proportion of female members of university
   governance bodies appear to matter for one or both of these measures but
   not always in the direction that might be expected. These results, then,
   raise questions about what strategies might be pursued by those who wish
   to improve the status of women in the profession.},

Abstract = {Right-wing Eurosceptic political groups gained ground in the elections
   for the European Parliament in May 2014. The electoral victory of
   right-wing Euroscepticism was accompanied by a concern that populism is
   (once again) spreading in Europe. Associating right-wing Eurosceptics
   with populism raises the question of whether critiques of populism can
   be directly extended to right-wing Euroscepticism. By reconstructing the
   right-wing Eurosceptic concept of `the people,' this article
   demonstrates that the Eurosceptic concept of the people has a dual
   meaning that encompasses both a transnational and a national concept of
   the people. The article concludes that while Euroscepticism shares
   ideological features with populism, it is problematic, due to the
   internal structure of the promoted concept of the people and the
   European political environment, directly to extend recent critiques of
   populism to right-wing Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {We explore the long-term political consequences of the Third Reich and
   show that current political intolerance, xenophobia, and voting for
   radical right-wing parties are associated with proximity to former Nazi
   concentration camps in Germany. This relationship is not explained by
   contemporary attitudes, the location of the camps, geographic sorting,
   the economic impact of the camps, or their current use. We argue that
   cognitive dissonance led those more directly exposed to Nazi
   institutions to conform with the belief system of the regime. These
   attitudes were then transmitted across generations. The evidence
   provided here contributes both to our understanding of the legacies of
   historical institutions and the sources of political intolerance.},

Abstract = {The South African Parliament has since 1994 actively participated in
   formal, informal, and ad hoc bilateral parliamentary diplomacy. Through
   the analysis of this form of diplomacy, this article explores practical
   examples of Parliament's bilateral international participation to
   ascertain the impact thereof on the state's soft power capacity.Joseph
   Nye (2008; 2011)'s soft power tool of attraction is used as the
   theoretical lens through which these examples are assessed.
   Supplementary insights from parliamentary officials and confidential
   interviews with selected Members of Parliament who consistently
   participate internationally enriched the analysis. The article presents
   evidence of parliament's soft power of attraction among foreign
   legislative and executive actors, but also identifies challenges that
   hinder strategic soft power successes. As South Africa's bilateral
   parliamentary diplomacy continues to evolve, these findings provide
   insights on the role of Parliament as an international actor, as well as
   the need for the strategic positioning of bilateral parliamentary
   diplomacy within the state's overall diplomatic practice for
   policymakers and foreign policy stakeholders to consider.},

   types of criminal regimes-Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and
   Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or
   collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and
   hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police
   interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and
   are associated with markedly different local security outcomes. We
   provide evidence of this theory by using a multimethod research design
   combining quasi-experimental statistical analyses, automated text
   analysis, extensive qualitative research, and a large-N survey in the
   context of Rio de Janeiro's ``Pacifying Police Units{''} (UPPs), which
   sought to reclaim control of the favelas from criminal organizations.},

Abstract = {Deleuze in his book on Foucault defines government as the power to
   affect in all its aspects. The article follows Deleuze's reading of
   Foucault in order to clarify this definition. This concept of government
   opens a new perspective for political theory because it allows to see
   that governmental actions are operated not only by the State or big
   institutions, but also by social forces and actors. In order to
   understand what it means ``power to affect{''} in this contest, we will
   reconstruct Deleuze's relation with the molecular ontology of Gabriel
   Tarde. Moreover, we will analyze the notion of institution that is
   crucial to explain the efficacy of government's affections. This will
   give us the opportunity to show the breaking point between Deleuze's
   micropolitics and Foucault microphysics of power. Foucault understands
   institutions only as limiting practices that normalize the social; on
   the contrary, Deleuze discovers the positive and productive character of
   institutions: they are able to satisfy desire and imagine new types of
   social assemblages.},

Abstract = {In this article, we ask whether the presence of populist parties
   influences the negative effect of income inequality on voter turnout. A
   number of studies have shown that voter turnout is lower in unequal
   countries. In particular, citizens with fewer resources abstain at
   higher rates. Since populist parties seek to mobilize these groups,
   their success could lead to higher and less unequal turnout rates. To
   assess empirically whether this holds true, we analyzed a dataset
   encompassing data on 296 national parliamentary elections in 31 European
   countries between 1970 and 2016. The results show that there is neither
   a direct nor an indirect effect of populism on voter turnout. In
   elections with more successful populist parties, voter turnout was not
   significantly higher than in other elections. Higher vote shares of
   populist parties also do not mitigate the negative impact of income
   inequality on voter turnout. Finally, there does not seem to be a
   difference between elections with high left-wing or right-wing populist
   parties' success. Neither variant of populism alters the relationship
   between inequality and turnout.},

Abstract = {This paper tests the explanatory power of exposure to English on
   nationalist attitudes in the 2018 Quebec general elections, during which
   all major political parties exceptionally excluded holding a referendum
   on Quebec independence. Data emanate from an exit poll conducted in
   Quebec City and in Montreal on October 1, 2018 (N = 122). Results from a
   population-based survey experiment demonstrate that exposure to written
   English through a bilingual survey is a positive predictor of support
   for independence for French-speaking Quebecers who encounter spoken
   English frequently in their daily lives. This suggests that exposure to
   written English bolsters nationalist attitudes as real-life out-group
   contact increases. These results reinforce causal claims on the
   contextual determinants of political attitudes.},

Abstract = {Interest groups depend on visibility for political influence and
   organizational growth. The current hybrid media landscape presents both
   opportunities and constraints for visibility and influence. For
   organized interests, if, when and how to use established media involves
   a continuous evaluation of different media strategies, as well as
   evaluations of how to best combine media and non-media platforms for
   efficient, multi-platform advocacy campaigns. Through qualitative
   interviews with 39 health interest organizations, representing a broad
   spectrum of group types, resources and access to decision-makers, this
   study analyses evaluations of the perceived gains and risks associated
   with media strategies. Although all interviewees value media visibility,
   their actual access to the established news media varies significantly.
   In the current media landscape, which is characterized by
   hyper-competition and hybridity, we find that it is primarily the
   well-resourced organizations, with storytelling expertise, which gain
   and prioritize visibility in the established media. Other organizations,
   independent of other group characteristics, seek visibility by
   increasingly becoming networked content distributors to bypass
   established media and target specific publics to promote organizational
   aims.},

Abstract = {In the literature on member state position-taking in the eurozone
   crisis, the debate has mainly centred on whether national preferences
   are shaped exclusively within the domestic setting or influenced by
   shared EU-level norms or interaction within EU institutions. This
   article goes beyond this discussion. Drawing on original data collected
   by the authors, it uses the UK's experience to test the claims both of
   society-centred approaches, including liberal intergovernmentalism, and
   perspectives that emphasise the importance of shared EU norms or
   interaction. It argues that while the first overlook the role of
   institutions as both actors and mediating variables in preference
   formation, the second have so far focused on the experience of eurozone
   members, thereby raising the possibility of selection bias. Treating
   eurozone form as a series of processes rather than a single event, it
   contests the claim that preference formation is always driven by
   societal interests, highlights instances where government acts in the
   absence of or contrary to expressed societal interests, and reveals
   limitations of the shared norms critique of liberal
   intergovernmentalism. It shows that the UK government was driven by a
   scholars concern to protect the UK economy from financial contagion
   rather than solidarity with its European partners.},

Abstract = {Being labeled as terrorists has been one of the primary negative
   stereotypes used against Muslims in the USA. Muslim Americans are very
   diverse coming from different ethnic, historical, and cultural
   backgrounds. They belong to various religious schools of thought and
   practice, as well as branches of Islam. Differences among this diverse
   group stipulate different perceptions of being stereotyped as
   terrorists, which was at large ignored by previous research. I use data
   from the 2011 Pew Religion and Public Life Survey (N = 806), to analyze
   differences among various Muslim American racial/ethnic groups in
   perceptions of being stereotyped as terrorists. Black, Asian, and
   Hispanic Muslims report a few times lower odds of being viewed as
   terrorists than white Muslims (respondents having origins primarily in
   the Middle East or North Africa). Compared to conservatives, moderates
   and liberal Muslims are more likely to name `viewed as terrorists' among
   the most important problem facing Muslims living in the USA today. Among
   acculturation and socio-demographic correlates, nativity was associated
   with being viewed as terrorists. Using the Muslim case, the study
   identifies different positions in perceptions of stereotypes and
   challenges the stereotypical approach of constructing a population
   identity as homogeneous.},

Abstract = {In this special issue on ``Democratization beyond the Post-Democratic
   Turn. Political Participation between Empowerment and Abuse{''}, we have
   explored changing understandings of participation in contemporary
   Western representative democracies through the analytical lens of the
   concept of the post-democratic-turn. We have investigated
   technology-based, market-based, and expert-led innovations that claim to
   enhance democratic participation and to provide policy legitimation. In
   this concluding article, I revisit the cases made by the individual
   contributors and analyse how shifting notions of participation alter
   dominant understandings of democracy. I carve out how new and emerging
   ideas of participation are based on different understandings of
   political subjectivity; furthermore, how constantly rising democratic
   expectations and simultaneously increasing scepticism with regard to
   democratic processes and institutions point to a growing democratic
   ambivalence within Western societies. Making use of Dahl's
   conceptualization of democracy, in this article, I review changing
   understandings of participation in light of their contribution to
   further democratization. The article shows how under post-democratic
   conditions the simulative performance of autonomy and subjectivity has
   become central to democratic participation. It emphasizes that what in
   established perspectives on democratization might appear as an abuse of
   participation, through the lens of a post-democratic-turn might be
   perceived as emancipatory and liberating.},

Abstract = {``Active learning{''} strategies-peer instruction, simulations, hands-on
   activities, and the like-improve student performance and engagement.
   However, instructors often struggle to incorporate these techniques into
   their courses. Doing so can be especially difficult in large lecture
   courses, where the number of students makes activities time-consuming
   and unwieldy. Student response systems (SRS, or ``clickers{''}) provide
   useful tools for incorporating active learning techniques into political
   science courses regardless of size. While prior research has shown that
   clickers improve student engagement and mastery of course content, these
   tools remain underutilized in the political science classroom. Drawing
   on existing research, an original survey of faculty who use clickers,
   and our experience using clickers in multiple undergraduate courses,
   this article aims to provide a ``toolbox{''} of clicker-based techniques
   and activities that political science faculty can use to align their
   courses with educational best practices. We offer suggestions for using
   clickers to implement these best practices, as well as to teach some of
   the specific concepts and skills that political science courses
   frequently cover. Finally, we describe some of the challenges that
   faculty face when they incorporate student response systems, and provide
   suggestions for addressing them.},

Abstract = {The revival of realism in political theory has included efforts to
   challenge realism's conservative reputation and argue that radical forms
   are possible. Nonetheless these efforts have been criticised as
   insufficient to overcome realism's inherent conservatism. This article
   argues that radical forms of realism can be better appreciated by
   considering the application of the realist perspective within an
   existing radical ideology: anarchism. This may seem an unusual choice,
   considering anarchism's standard representation as naively idealistic
   and paradigmatically non-realist. However, attention to the breadth of
   diversity in anarchist theory reveals a collection of positions that
   together represent a `realist anarchism' which not only challenges
   anarchism's reputation as uniformly committed to unrealistic and
   idealistic utopianism but also demonstrates the existence of genuinely
   radical forms of realism.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the American Political Science Association stated that
   integrating issues of diversity, inclusiveness, and equality into
   political science curriculum and pedagogy was crucial to the success of
   the discipline in the twenty-first century. Although consensus is
   forming about the need to teach diversity, the question of how to do
   this effectively remains open. This article describes an archives-based
   assignment in an introduction to American government course created by
   the authors of this article-a professor of political science and the
   college archivist-that includes greater understanding of diversity and
   engaged citizenship as learning objectives. For this assignment,
   students are immersed in archival material about their own college and
   tasked with analyzing the political actions of previous generations of
   students as the civil rights and women's movements emerged, as the
   student population became more diverse, and as the campus reacted to
   national and local events relating to racial intolerance and injustice.
   By examining their college's political past-both the conflicts that
   animated the community and the student-led efforts to make the campus
   more inclusive-current students engage with issues of diversity and
   political activism in a way that helps them better understand themselves
   and their role as citizens in a democratic nation.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the relations of sociability between the civic
   and business leadership of Pereira and her political leadership,
   following the process of creating the department of Risaralda, which
   took place between 1965 to 1967. The analysis was carried out from the
   documentary review of the reports compiled by the Congress of the
   Republic on the three debates that took place in said legislative body
   on the occasion of this bill, the load press of Preira and the memories
   of several protagonists of the separatist cause, and so, complete a
   kaleidoscopic vision that accounts for the interaction of two power
   groups in search of a greater degree of political and administrative
   autonomy based on their own interests, so that a critical conception of
   the confirmation of Risaralda and its separation from Caldas becomes
   visible, instead of the apologetic and haughty tone with which this
   event is remembered as a civic feat.},

Abstract = {Widening, asymmetric polarization is evident in both the U.S. Congress
   and state legislatures. Recent work unveils a new dimension to this
   polarization story: newly elected Republican women are driving this
   polarization. Women are more likely to legislate on women's issues than
   men, yet women's shared interest in representing women doesn't preclude
   their identity as partisans. In this article, we explore the effect of
   today's political climate on state legislators' policy representation of
   women's issues. Weask what effect does gendered polarization have on
   women's issues? To test this, we evaluate bill sponsorship in the states
   on the quintessential ``women's issue{''} of abortion. Our research
   design focuses on bill introductions and uses on an original dataset of
   pro- and anti-abortion rights bill introductions, which we analyze using
   an event count model. We find that overall polarization leads to the
   introduction of fewer restrictive abortion bills, but as polarization
   between women lawmakers grows, legislators are more likely to introduce
   anti-abortion rights legislation. Gender polarization has consequences
   on the types of bills legislators introduce and for how scholars should
   study polarization.},

Abstract = {The ultimate goal of utopias is the reflexive idea of a better world;
   more supportive and less selfish. It is the relentless pursuit of a
   social order open to moral sympathy, a place where the exploitation of
   man by man does not prevail. The purpose of this research essay is to
   show what the relationship is and what are the social contributions that
   underlie the ethical approaches of Thomas More, Tommaso Campanella, Paul
   Lafargue, Aldous Huxley and Yuval Noah Harari, on the contemporary
   debate of city administrations Following an analysis, logical-deductive,
   the essay concludes that there is no utopia that is utopian, there are
   new social efforts, maybe utopian but not impossible, that seek to build
   a public ethic in the design of cities of learning, knowledge and
   innovation.},

Abstract = {The article develops a typology of revolutions based upon women's roles
   over the course of revolutionary struggle. In addition to the
   patriarchal and the emancipatory models, the study proposes a hybrid
   model of women's participation in a revolution, characterized by the
   diversity and fluidity of women's roles. According to the hybrid model,
   women's involvement in a revolution can follow three different
   strategies: (1) acquiescence to a traditional gender-based division of
   labor, (2) appropriation of the masculine forms of resistance, and (3)
   mixing of diverse modes of action. Using the case of the 2013-2014
   Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, the empirical analysis demonstrates
   multifaceted forms of women's activism. The study contributes to the
   literature by broadening the conceptualization of women's participation
   in a contemporary urban revolution.},

Abstract = {While scholars and practitioners have extensively analyzed the causes,
   the consequences and, more generally, the correlates of good governance,
   little-to-no attention has been paid to whether the institutionalization
   of political parties-as evidenced by the stability of the party
   system-is in any way related to good governance. The purpose of this
   article is to explore the relationship between party system change, good
   governance, and its dividends. The analyses reveal three main
   conclusions. First, the stability of a party system is strongly and
   significantly related to each of the good governance indicators
   identified by Kaufmann and his colleagues. Second, that while party
   system instability is not significantly related to a country's wealth,
   it has a positive impact on economic growth even when we control for the
   effects of good governance. Third, that good enough governance is a
   better predictor of economic performance than good governance.},

Abstract = {A growing literature documents that public policy in modern democracies
   fails to represent the preferences of traditionally marginalized
   subconstituencies. By dissecting party agendas, I show that inequality
   already permeates the very politicization of issues before democratic
   decision-making even begins. Election platforms worldwide predominantly
   reflect the concerns of male, educated and affluent citizens. That
   parties disregard large voter groups at this early stage seems
   surprising given that campaign agendas are inherently public. My
   analysis reveals that looming electoral backlash is anticipated by a
   strategy of ``discreet{''} inequality. In particular, agendas are
   designed to appear inconspicuous and agreeable by exempting issues from
   unequal responsiveness that voters perceive as divisive or threatening.
   Discreet inequality thus appeases marginalized groups while ignoring
   their views on the large majority of more ordinary issues. The article
   demonstrates these patterns for gender, education, and income using
   comparative survey and manifesto data covering 42 countries.},

Abstract = {Lived citizenship has emerged as a key concept in citizenship studies
   over the last two decades. A growing number of authors have applied
   ideas of lived citizenship as a generative approach to recognise the
   embodied, relational and lived experiences of being a citizen in
   everyday life. However, lived citizenship currently lacks conceptual
   clarity and framing which weakens its analytical power and potential. In
   this paper we consider the theoretical origins, current applications and
   development of lived citizenship in order to clarify it as a concept and
   consider possibilities for its future. We propose a conceptual framing
   underpinned by four dimensions of lived citizenship (spatial,
   intersubjective, performed and affective) to serve as a starting point
   to sharpen and define this emerging field. We then explore these
   dimensions through three domains of scholarship, of children and youth,
   asylum seekers, and city-regional dwellers to illustrate the potential
   of a lived citizenship approach. We conclude by examining some of the
   implications of this concept as well as its limitations, with the aim of
   opening a dialogue with inter-disciplinary scholars to help us to
   further conceptualise this emerging field and widen its future
   possibilities.},

Abstract = {After a short period of transition to democracy, Greece joined EC in
   1981, in spite of its obvious misfit. Europeanization exercised strong
   adaptation pressure. Being one of the most centralist countries in
   Europe, Greece introduced decentralization reforms as part of a wider
   democratization endeavour. New policy fields were introduced and the
   domestic governance system became more complex and inclusive, especially
   through the introduction of the regional meso-level, even though the
   primacy of central government was not really challenged. Europeanization
   changed the structure of constraints and opportunities, the orientation,
   the beliefs and the priorities of actors. The EU became an important
   frame both for rescaling various interests as well as for the
   transformation of public administration. The crisis marked the shift
   from adaptation to conditionality and the revival of centralization and
   exclusive intra-state politics, while at the same time the central
   government is accountable for policy implementation to supra-national
   institutions.},

Abstract = {In a study of social identities and people's participation in local
   neighborhood associations, collective identities based on gender and/or
   race seldom emerged. Although neighborhood associations provide an
   opportunity for citizens to gain civic skills, they can also serve as
   sites of what I call everyday exclusions. Women are not denied
   membership or leadership positions. Rather, women occupy more leadership
   positions than men. Because of gender stereotypes and gendered
   assumptions about power, however, women are sometimes seen by other
   women as less effective leaders. Findings are based on participant
   observation of association meetings in St. Louis, Missouri and 31
   semi-structured interviews.},

Abstract = {One would be hard-pressed to name an edifice that has dominated the
   academic imagination as thoroughly and exhaustively as Jeremy Bentham's
   Panopticon. This somewhat monomaniacal fixation on one of Bentham's many
   penal contraptions is rooted, to no small degree, in Michel Foucault's
   now voguish theory of power, as expounded upon in his seminal work
   Discipline and Punish. Foucault's understanding of Bentham's penal
   thought, particularly the Panopticon, forms one of the key linchpins
   which his broad historical claims hinge upon. But to what extent does
   Foucault's representation of Bentham's penal theories, in particular,
   his views on the prison and the Panopticon, converge with how Bentham
   himself gave expression to his own penal philosophy? This question is
   examined in this article by taking a closer look at The Rationale of
   Punishment, a compilation of a vast mass of Bentham's manuscripts, which
   were first published in English in 1830.},

Abstract = {Responding to recent debates, this article challenges the presentation
   of Corbynism and Blue Labour as competing philosophical tendencies in
   the contemporary British Labour Party. It does so with reference to
   their shared mobilisation around post-liberal and national-populist
   notions of the relationship between nations, states, society, citizens
   and the outside world, and critiques of capitalism and liberal democracy
   that they hold in common. Uncovering a largely subterranean `critical
   Marxist' counterpoint that seeks to `hold the centre' rather than
   rhetorically or theoretically endorse its destabilisation, the article
   outlines the other paths available from within the intellectual
   traditions of the Labour Party and wider left, concluding that there is
   a real philosophical alternative to both Corbynism and Blue Labour.},

   and policy around peace and development? Drawing from research on
   neoliberalism, celebrities, and ethical consumption, I build an
   interpretive analysis of two case studies of Brand Aid initiatives to
   argue first, that celebrities mobilize financial and political capital
   to create partnerships across businesses, NGOs, and the government in
   ways that embody neoliberal politics by ushering in new private actors;
   and second, that celebrities reinforce these neoliberal politics by
   promoting these partnerships to popular and elite audiences. I discuss
   how this paper contributes to unmasking neoliberal trends by showing how
   celebrities are deepening their engagement in ways that hold
   implications for democratic politics.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing popular and media attention to the preemption of
   local policymaking by state governments, the empirical political science
   literature on preemption remains relatively scarce. After first
   identifying and discussing state preemption laws across twenty-one
   diverse public policies, we investigate how political, institutional,
   and demographic factors predict the implementation of these laws. Our
   empirical analysis reveals that states where Republicans control both
   legislative chambers and the governorship, with more politically
   conservative citizens, a higher percentage of African Americans, and a
   stronger conservative interest group presence passes more laws that
   preempt local policymaking. Our results demonstrate that state
   preemption efforts are more closely associated with political and
   demographic factors and less associated with institutional forces.},

Abstract = {Despite widespread concern over false beliefs about politically-relevant
   facts, little is known about how strongly Americans believe their
   answers to poll questions. I propose a conceptual framework for
   characterizing survey responses about facts: self-awareness, or how well
   people can assess their own knowledge. I measure self-awareness of
   political knowledge by eliciting respondent certainty about answers to
   24 factual questions about politics. Even on ``unfavorable{''} facts
   that are inconvenient to the respondent's political party, more-certain
   respondents are more likely to answer correctly. Because people are
   somewhat aware of their ignorance, respondents usually describe their
   incorrect responses as low-certainty guesses, not high-certainty
   beliefs. Where misperceptions exist, they tend to be bipartisan:
   Democrats and Republicans perform poorly on the same questions and
   explain their answers using similar points of reference.},

Abstract = {Public support for protection is typically attributed to economic
   self-interest. Beyond pocketbook anxieties, a competing approach,
   however, contends that sociotropic attitudes dictate foreign policy
   preferences. Researchers, however, have faced difficulty in
   disentangling sociotropic attitudes from pocketbook concerns in
   observational studies. This article addresses this problem by utilizing
   a priming experiment to examine the relationship between socio and
   egotropic attitudes. In line with the predictions of the sociotropic
   framework, individuals are less certain about the egotropic effects of
   trade and sociotropic attitudes are found to influence egotropic
   perceptions by reducing uncertainty about the pocketbook effects of
   trade. In contrast, the study fails to find support for the hypothesis
   that individuals project egotropic concerns onto societal evaluations.
   The results of the study suggest that future research should pay careful
   consideration to the relationship between socio and egotropic attitudes
   when modeling and analyzing trade-policy preferences.},

Abstract = {Studies on the representation of women usually focus on the descriptive
   and substantive representation of women. Early studies underlined the
   importance of a ``critical mass{''}, meaning that women need to acquire
   a certain level of representation in the parliament, in order to be able
   to influence policy outcomes in their favor. Whether this `descriptive
   representation' of women leads to `substantive representation' forms
   another important question in the gender and politics literature.
   Although an increasing number of studies is exploring this question,
   they are heavily focused on developed Western democracies, with a few
   exceptions. This study investigates the substantive representation of
   women in a developing and Muslim majority country: Turkey. By content
   coding and analyzing 4500 parliamentary bills submitted to the Turkish
   Grand National Assembly (TGNA), this study aims to answer the following
   questions: Which parties take a prominent role in terms of the
   substantive representation of women? How do gender and party ideology
   affect these outcomes? Our results have significant implications for the
   representation of women in Turkey as well as in the developing world.},

Abstract = {American environmental thought has long been driven by competing views
   that nature's value is determined by human valuation and that nature is
   intrinsically valuable. I turn to the renowned conservationist and
   environmental writer Aldo Leopold for a way forward that, perhaps
   counterintuitively, roots nature's intrinsic value in human
   exceptionalism. Leopold bases his claim of human exceptionalism on our
   species' apparently unique capacity to recognize and value the broader
   ecological community as such. To effect the necessary shift in American
   perception and policy, Leopold offers a civic education in ecological
   perception centered on outdoor recreation that might inspire the
   adoption of what I call the ``stewardship vocation,{''} a conscious
   civic mission to protect the ecological community in which we are at
   once ``plain members{''} and guests. Leopold's vision of ``harmony
   between men and land{''} represents not just an environmental ethic but
   also a call to a national mission of environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {The verdict of 2019 indicates that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not
   only managed to retain its support base which it built in 2014, but also
   expanded it both geographically and socially. It managed to win seats in
   states where it had not performed well in earlier elections, and to get
   more votes amongst communities which had not voted for it earlier. The
   Congress could not improve upon its 2014 performance, but it is
   important to note that neither its votes nor its tally of seats
   decreased. The BJP improved upon its performance of 2014 largely at the
   cost of regional parties. The combined vote share of the regional
   parties witnessed a decline. Some regional parties did manage to hold
   onto their support base but others could not secure the support base
   they had held in 2014. In states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh
   (UP), Karnataka and Maharashtra, the regional parties performed badly
   despite some of them having formed an anti-BJP alliance. The BJP's gain
   in terms of vote share and seats, largely at the expense of regional
   parties in many states, begins a new debate about whether this is the
   beginning of the end of the dominance of regional parties in the North
   Indians states, or if it is a passing phase in Indian elections. If this
   decline in the importance of the regional parties is largely in respect
   of national elections, could there be a reversal in the trend during
   state assembly elections?},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The Republic, which was launched with a revolutionary and modernist
   initiative, has been in a tense relationship with the conservative
   thinking. This tension, formed under conditions peculiar to Turkey, has
   shaped both systems of thought in different periods with regard to the
   dynamics of the conditions peculiar to the period. During the struggle
   between republicanism and conservatism, at the first half of the period
   between 1923-1960, which includes the transition from establishment of
   the Republic to the multi-party system and comes to the fore as one of
   the most critical periods, in order to bring the modernist world view
   into action, beyond the administrative and legal regulations, the
   Republic shaped the space with a revolutionary attitude to make these
   initiatives dominant over the daily life. The duration between 1945-1960
   has been a period which the conservative ideology became apparent again
   by gaining strength and continued its opposition. Space has been
   strategically important in ideological terms in both periods and it was
   actively used in the campaign of both ideological wings against each
   other. Accordingly, in the struggle between republicanism and
   conservatism, whose effects are still apparent, the 1923-1960 period,
   being the most critical time range, has been a period in which
   ideological and practical turning points occurred and left their traces
   on the space. In this context, the course of the struggle between
   conservatism and republicanism and the strategic role of the space in
   this struggle within the determined time period was tried to be
   analysed.},

Abstract = {Populism is often viewed as a national-level phenomenon that pits a
   declining periphery against a cosmopolitan, economically successful
   metropolis. Our analysis of Rob Ford's 2010 campaign and mayoralty in
   Toronto reveals the potential for the emergence of populist politics
   within the metropolis. To comprehend his appeal, principally within the
   city's ethnically diverse postwar peripheral areas, we apply Brubaker's
   conceptualization of populism as a discursive repertoire. Drawing on
   qualitative information and analysis of survey research, we first
   describe how Ford constructed electorally salient protagonists and
   antagonists. Second, we discuss how his emergence was enabled by
   institutional, economic, and demographic change. Finally, we explain
   Ford's appeal to a diverse electorate in terms of the sincerity and
   coherence of his performance as the collective representation of
   suburban grievance. We conclude by arguing that populism may emerge in
   metropolitan settings with strong, spatially manifest internal social,
   economic, and cultural divisions.},

Abstract = {Conflict-sensitive social impact assessment (CSSIA) is to predict and
   analyze social risks triggered by public decision-making to realize
   source governance. Based on decision-making theories, this paper aims to
   explore the relationship between decision-making and risk source. Based
   on the field research of the policy-making process in contemporary
   China, this paper elaborates on the relationship between decision-making
   and risk accumulation in five aspects: the bounded rationality of
   decision makers, the deformation of decision structure, the
   fragmentation of decision-making process, the unduly frequency of policy
   change, and the excessively big size of policy gap. Promoting the
   transformation of the decision-making process is the key to dealing with
   the large-scale and high-risk social instability in the socioeconomic
   transition period. In the framework of developing countries, further
   research is needed to delve into the institutional arrangement of public
   decision-making to guarantee a well-ordered society. In the practices of
   CSSIA, the focus should not be simply put on the prediction and
   assessment of risks and emergency response, but more importantly on the
   analysis of contributing factors of risk evolution. This paper reveals
   that social instability occurs when the balance of social interests is
   broken and its root lies in the institutional arrangement of public
   decision-making. Therefore, promoting the transformation of
   decision-making system is the gist of CSSIA in the Chinese context and
   it can help make the source governance come true.},

Abstract = {Agenda setting is central to the study of legislatures and has profound
   implications for policy outcomes-yet little is known about how the
   public reacts to agenda setting and to majority-party decisions to
   ignore alternative proposals. We hypothesize that voters will be less
   satisfied with policy decisions when they are made aware of ignored
   alternatives. Drawing on literature on procedural fairness and partisan
   identity, we offer competing predictions for whether all respondents or
   only minority-party voters will oppose agenda setting and whether the
   strongest negative reaction will be elicited when bipartisan
   alternatives or minority-party proposals are ignored. Through a series
   of experiments, we show that information about agenda setting can drive
   down public support for legislation and for Congress as a whole and
   reduce the perceived fairness of the legislative process. Importantly,
   these effects are not confined to cases where popular policy
   alternatives are ignored or where one's own party loses out.},

   Capital July 2016-July 2018},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Theresa May's first 2 years in office illustrate King's (1991)
   observation that premierships can vary within themselves. Her
   premiership divides into two distinct phases, before and after the snap
   general election of June 2017, with a final coda after July 2017 when
   her premiership unravelled. Whilst the disastrous election looked like
   the crucial event, analysis using the Leadership Capital Index (LCI)
   suggests that, contrary to popular assumptions, before the election May
   was weaker than she appeared and afterwards not quite as diminished as
   assumed. The LCI analysis we present here (focusing on the year before
   and the year after the 2017 general election) shows that May's capital
   fell, but not as far as presented by prevailing narratives. May went
   from being, in LCI terms, an `exceptional leader' to a `medium capital
   leader' facing obstacles, but still capable of action. May's resilience
   after 2017 was a result of Brexit, the poor polling of her opponents and
   her unexpected poll strength, bolstered by the weakness of her internal
   challengers. Even a poorly positioned prime minister has considerable
   resources to call upon.},

Abstract = {Puerto Ricans are a growing population on the U.S. mainland. They hold a
   distinctive position in the hierarchy of American citizenship because
   they are disenfranchised in national elections on the island but
   immediately become eligible to vote if they move to the mainland. How
   can Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland be mobilized to participate in
   politics? This paper explores whether campaign contact increases Puerto
   Rican political participation. Using observational data, we establish
   that campaign contact is associated with political participation among
   mainland Puerto Ricans. We also conduct a survey experiment, testing the
   mobilizing effects of positive and negative campaign messages that prime
   Puerto Ricans to think about their group's distinctive political
   experiences. These messages convey the enfranchised status of Puerto
   Ricans on the U.S. mainland and their disenfranchised status on the
   island. While the negative treatment has limited effects, the positive
   treatment increases intentions to vote, to participate in non-electoral
   political activities, and feelings of political efficacy relative to a
   pure control. We observe heterogenous treatment effects across electoral
   contexts and levels of linked fate with other Puerto Ricans.},

Abstract = {Why do EU actors promote secluded fora of decision making even as they
   have committed themselves to open and public lawmaking? How do they
   perceive and reconcile the ensuing tensions in practice? These
   questions, arising amidst growing public controversy, point to a blind
   spot in the scholarly agenda on EU lawmaking, which has overwhelmingly
   focused on the games institutions play. From an interpretivist
   perspective, we argue that rules are `made' not by detached officials,
   but by practitioners puzzling out the meaning of their actions in their
   everyday experiences. Based on extensive interview material, the article
   captures trilogues as `politicised diplomacy' and shows how they have
   become a `permeable institution', shaped by dense flows of exchange
   between `insiders' and `outsiders'. The article helps pinpoint to what
   extent and how trilogues challenge democratic norms; and it punctures
   the myth of trilogues as quiet politics dominated by producer interests.},

   Impede the Descriptive and Substantive Representation of Ethnic Minority

Abstract = {Research shows that ethnic minority candidates often face an electoral
   penalty at the ballot box. In this study, we argue that this penalty
   depends on both candidate and voter characteristics, and that
   pro-minority policy positions incur a greater penalty than a candidate's
   ethnic background itself. Using a conjoint experiment embedded in a
   panel study of British voters, we investigate the relative contributions
   of candidate ethnicity, policy positions, affirmative action, and voter
   attitudes to this electoral penalty. We find that although Pakistani
   (Muslim) candidates are penalized directly for their ethnicity, black
   Caribbean candidates receive on average the same levels of support as
   white British ones. However, black Caribbean candidates suffer
   conditional discrimination where they are penalized if they express
   support for pro-minority policies, and all candidates are penalized for
   having been selected through an affirmative action initiative. We also
   find that some white British voters are more inclined to support a black
   Caribbean candidate than a white British one, all else being equal.
   These voters (one quarter of our sample) have cosmopolitan views on
   immigration, and a strong commitment to anti-prejudice norms. However,
   despite efforts across parties to increase the ethnic diversity of
   candidates for office, many voters' preferences continue to pose
   barriers toward descriptive and substantive representation of ethnic
   minority groups.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the transformations and innovations in public
   diplomacy introduced by the Obama administration, crucial elements of
   which include political marketing, political advocacy, strategic
   communication, and digital diplomacy. President Obama used Internet
   technologies as a means to establish direct dialogue with ordinary
   people abroad, thereby bypassing the control of local authoritarian
   governments, which revolutionized a vector of public diplomacy around
   the world. The Obama administration has elaborated new ways to maintain
   liberal sentiments in Russia and among the Russian-speaking population.
   Finally, the Obama administration hired tech experts from Google,
   Facebook, and Twitter to blockade the activity coming from extremists'
   profiles and created a community loyal bloggers from countries around
   the world to disseminate anti-ISIL messages on the behalf of the US
   government.},

Abstract = {The absence of an internationally-mandated peace process for Syria has
   allowed the Syrian regime to embark on a post-conflict reconstruction
   process unperturbed by international norms and actors. The emergent
   illiberal peace in Syria extends the conditions of war and violence into
   the post-conflict period through the creation of new citizenship regimes
   that bifurcate Syrian society into the reconciled and settled, on the
   one hand, and the unsettled and cast out, on the other. The
   post-conflict citizenship regimes in Syria are generated through a
   series of new laws around property ownership, military desertion,
   absenteeism, and political amnesty that are informed by a discourse of
   abandonment, betrayal, and desertion that casts some Syrians as loyal
   and worthy of citizenship, and others as disloyal and worthy of being
   cast out of citizenship. The bifurcation of Syrian society into the
   loyal and disloyal occurs through government-led processes of
   `reconciling' with former rebel fighters and `settlement' with
   civilians. In both cases, fighters and civilians have to prove their
   loyalty to the homeland in order to secure an albeit precarious return
   to citizenship and rights. Those denied settlement or reconciliation are
   simply denied citizenship rights and legal identity in Syria.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to problematise the historical significance of the EU
   for British governing strategy with reference to immigration policy and
   the concept of depoliticisation. Situating British governing strategy in
   terms of the crisis-prone nature of capitalist society, this paper
   argues that British immigration policy has been depoliticised through,
   initially, the invocation of globalisation and, more recently, the EU.
   Through this strategy, the British state has been able to repeatedly
   claim that immigration policy is largely out of its hands, as they have
   no control over workers wishing to enter Britain looking for work. This
   paper makes three claims: firstly, immigration policy has been used as a
   means by both Conservative and Labour governments to manage inflation
   and labour; secondly, successive governments have sought to depoliticise
   immigration policy through reference to external forces; thirdly, this
   strategy of depoliticisation ultimately failed, politicising Britain's
   relationship with the EU and creating conditions for Britain's exit from
   the EU.},

Abstract = {The 2019 Austrian snap election, held on 29 September 2019, was preceded
   by a series of scandals. Most prominent among them was the so-called
   `Ibizagate' involving the former Vice-Chancellor and FPo party leader,
   Heinz-Christian Strache. The scandal eventually led to the collapse of
   the oVP-FPo coalition in May 2019 and the formation of a caretaker
   government. The election day in September brought a clear victory for
   the oVP with an increase of almost six percentage points, compared to
   its vote share in the 2017 election. The second big winner was the Green
   party which scored the best result in the party history with 13.9 per
   cent of the vote. Amid scandals, the FPo saw its support fall to only
   16.2 per cent; the election also resulted in an all-time low for the SPo
   achieving only 21.2 per cent. The article presents the background, the
   election campaign and the results of the 2019 Austrian election,
   discussing the wide range of `firsts' that characterized them, including
   the formation of the first oVP-Green coalition government in Austria.},

   Poland},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {How do external economic shocks influence domestic politics? We argue
   that those materially exposed to the shock will display systematic
   differences in policy preferences and voting behavior compared to the
   unexposed, and political parties can exploit these circumstances.
   Empirically, we take advantage of the 2015 surprise revaluation of the
   Swiss franc to identify the Polish citizens with direct economic
   exposure to this exogenous event. Using an original survey fielded prior
   to the 2015 elections and an embedded survey experiment, we show that
   exposed individuals were more likely to demand government support and
   more likely to desert the government and vote for the largest opposition
   party, which was able to use the shock to expand its electoral coalition
   without alienating its core voters. Our article clarifies the connection
   between international shocks, voters' policy preferences, partisan
   policy responses, and, ultimately, voting decisions.},

Abstract = {How do voters react to information about aggregate turnout? Do high
   turnout levels mobilize or discourage citizens to vote? We argue that it
   depends on individuals' degree of conformity. We argue that in addition
   to the classic calculus of voting, conformist voters have an added
   incentive to `follow the pack' and vote when turnout is high while
   abstain when turnout is low. We conduct two separate experiments, the
   first a survey experiment with a representative sample of the UK
   population and the second a lab experiment in Canada. Both studies
   confirm our hypothesis. These findings highlight the importance of
   taking individuals' level of conformity into account when explaining
   their decision to vote or abstain.},

   the United States},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recording of crimes as terror incidents often falls in an unclear/fuzzy
   area due to overlaps with other crimes such as hate crimes, drug or
   mental health-related crimes, etc. This paper addresses the recording of
   crimes as terror crimes across US states, alternately considering both
   the prevalence and intensity of such crimes. Placing the explanatory
   variables under institutional, economic, social, political and
   enforcement categories, results show that weak institutions, ceteris
   paribus, undermine the recording of terror crimes. In other significant
   influences, states with greater ethnic homogeneity were less likely to
   have recorded terror crimes and more populous states had greater
   incidence (but not greater intensity) of recorded terror activity. Some
   implications for policy are discussed.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-46},

Abstract = {John Rawls's case for a duty of assistance is partially premised on the
   assumption that liberal societies have an interest in assisting burdened
   societies to become well-ordered: Not only are well-ordered peoples
   inherently peaceful, but negative spillover effects would also disappear
   where peoples have a just or decent institutional order. Drawing on
   relative deprivation theory, this article argues that the kind of
   limited assistance that Rawls proposes to help burdened societies to
   become well-ordered would not reduce but actually increase international
   terrorism and unwanted immigration by raising unwarranted expectations
   and enhancing the resources that are needed to emigrate. Thus, if Rawls
   is concerned about negative externalities, he should argue for either
   more extensive assistance or no assistance at all.},

Abstract = {Collective memories of totalitarianism and the industrialized slaughter
   of the Holocaust have exerted a profound influence on postwar European
   politics and philosophy. Two of the most prominent political theorists
   and public intellectuals to take up the legacy of total war are Hannah
   Arendt and Jurgen Habermas. However, their prescriptions seem to pull in
   opposite directions. While Arendt draws on remembrance to recover
   politics on a smaller scale by advocating for the empowerment of local
   councils, Habermas draws on the past to justify his search for
   postnational forms of political community that can overcome the bloody
   legacy of nationalism. My argument brings these two perspectives
   together by examining their mutual support for European integration as a
   way of preserving the lessons of totalitarianism. I argue that both
   Arendt and Habermas reject the technocratic tendencies of the European
   Union while maintaining hope that it can develop a truly postnational
   form of politics.},

Abstract = {This article investigates persistence (or hysteresis) in weapons using a
   panel of 163 countries for the period 2010-15. The following are some
   main findings: (1) compared to countries that are landlocked,
   persistence in heavy weapons is more apparent in nations that are open
   to the sea; (2) relative to the Middle East and North Africa, heavy
   weapons are more persistent in the East Asia and the Pacific countries.
   This tendency is consistent with ``weapons imports;{''} (3) evidence of
   persistence is not very apparent in ``weapons imports{''} with the
   exception of the fact that it is higher in low-income countries,
   compared to their high-income counterparts. Hence, there is less
   hysteresis in weapons exports when compared with heavy weapons exports;
   and (4) the determinants of persistence employed in the conditioning
   information set are contingent on fundamental characteristics and
   panels. Policy implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democratic theorists have argued that effective
   deliberation is central to democracy. Does Hong Kong possess a viable
   public sphere for deliberating important public issues, as the city has
   been striving for a full democracy since the 1980s? This article
   addresses this significant question by examining the quality of
   deliberation on the 2014 Umbrella Movement by the editorials and
   commentaries in an elite print Chinese newspaper - the Hong Kong
   Economic Journal - based on the ``Discourse Quality Index{''} and other
   criteria used by major works on mediated deliberation. This article
   argues that the Journal has served as a viable public sphere for
   deliberating important public concerns in Hong Kong. The Journal's
   editorials and commentaries performed well in terms of offering reasoned
   arguments and engaging in dialogue with opposing viewpoints. Regarding
   respect for the actors which were involved in the Umbrella Movement, the
   Journal as a whole had maintained a civilized tone. However, there was
   an indication that commentary authors had less tolerance toward actors
   from the opposite camps.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {624-642},

Abstract = {Hybrid political systems, which are neither rigorously liberal nor
   authoritarian, create ambiguous political environments for protests and
   social movements. We argue in this study that the power-resistance
   dynamics become more sophisticated within the ambiguous context of
   hybrid systems, such as the one in Turkey, where democratic channels are
   not totally suspended, but significantly weakened. Examining an episode
   of contention between an anti-mining movement and the Justice and
   Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, AKP) government on the
   issue of gold mining in Artvin, a city in the Northeastern Black Sea
   region, we demonstrate that in the electoral authoritarian context of
   Turkey the anti-mining movement gained a political role and significance
   well beyond its original specific aims, transforming into a conflict
   between those discontented with the authoritarian features of the
   existing system and the incumbents of that very system. Our study
   implies that social movements in hybrid political systems may turn into
   broader struggles not only because they open up political avenues for
   various groups to express their resentment with the prevailing
   undemocratic system, but also because the hegemonic forces attempt to
   consolidate the existing regime by mobilizing a popular support for the
   repression of these mobilizations.},

Abstract = {Cultural debates over gay rights have prompted a great deal of
   scholarship assessing the nature and resiliency of citizen attitudes
   toward homosexuality in American political life. We posit, however, that
   more attention should be devoted to LGBT individuals themselves as
   potential office holders. Specifically, we argue that in an era of
   increased affective polarization and partisan sorting, party
   identification of candidates, as well as affectual and ideological
   attitudes of voters, must be integrated into analyses of the effects of
   sexuality as a voting heuristic. Drawing on social identity and
   subtyping theories, we contend that candidate sexuality will influence
   attitudes about some candidates, but not others. We then present the
   results of an original survey experiment in which candidate partisanship
   and sexuality are both manipulated. The data reveal substantial support
   of our theory: while sexuality is a relevant consideration in the
   candidate evaluation process, both partisanship of candidates and
   political attributes of voters can severely condition its effects.},

Abstract = {Trust in the European Union is strongly related to trust in national
   political institutions through extrapolation, i.e. cues from national
   politics. Most evidence for this mechanism, however, is based on surveys
   using question blocks that present several institutions at once in
   non-randomized order. We conducted six split-ballot survey experiments
   in five European countries, asking about trust in national and European
   Union institutions (a) separately or in the same question block and (b)
   in different question orders. Our findings demonstrate survey context
   effects: asking about two institutions within the same question block
   increases the correlation of reported levels of trust in these
   institutions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that national primes
   decrease reported trust in the European Union, providing novel
   micro-level evidence for extrapolation and cue-taking from national
   politics in the formation of public opinion about the European Union.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of foreign aid on the survival of autocratic regimes?
   Extant work about the effect of foreign aid on the recipient's political
   regime has come to contradictory conclusions. Current findings display
   the full spectrum of possibilities from a democratizing effect to the
   enhancement of authoritarian survival. While some studies suggest that
   foreign aid strengthen autocrats and their incentives to cling to power,
   others have focused on specific periods and donors, thus finding a
   democratizing effect of foreign aid. In this article, we argue that the
   effect of foreign aid on autocratic survival does not operate in a
   direct way, but it is conditional on the levels of political leverage
   exerted by democratic donors vis-a-vis the autocratic leaders. This
   leverage, we find, is defined by the capability of democratic donors to
   back conditionality with effective political pressure. More
   specifically, we find that given similar levels of aid, autocratic
   recipients that are highly dependent on the United States-a
   quintessential democratic donor with extensive political influence-have
   a shorter survival rate when compared to those with which the United
   States has weaker ties and thus lower leverage.},

Abstract = {Starting from Polanyi's notion of a `counter movement' that becomes
   necessary due to the damaging of the social fabric by economic
   recklessness in a competitive market society, this article reveals a
   shift from an institutional towards a processual governance of the South
   African consumer credit market. During two critical moments of market
   development, responsible actors placed themselves in quasi-neutral
   positions of technical administrators. Between 1999 and 2006, they
   established large-scale institutions, which proved to be inapt for
   preventing over-indebtedness and rising inequality. Hence, they changed
   their strategy to precisely regulating the credit granting process on a
   local level after 2012. This did not reverse the tendency of increasing
   social inequality, but it shifted the focus of attention towards the
   individual decision-making of borrowers. It, therefore, contributed to
   securing a liberal market against interventionist economic ambitions.},

Abstract = {One of the themes that recurrently emerges in contemporary management
   discourses is the issue of the personality of the worker. In the current
   context of a global knowledge economy with boisterous markets, companies
   seem to have the need to fmd out workers who stand above the average,
   and they actually strive to identify them and hire them. Therefore,
   firms seem to be obsessed about one specific signifier, talent, which
   will define these extraordinary employees vis-a-vis less skilled workers
   who cannot meet the increasing demands of the market. The search for
   such talent by firms will have, as a counterpoint, the need for the
   workers themselves to try to stand out by building their own personal
   brand in order to attract attention and enhance their professional
   reputation, forcing them to market themselves constantly. In this
   article, our goal is to decipher those discourses on talent and personal
   branding in order to promote a wider reflection on the construction of a
   neoliberal personality. We will also discuss the implications of these
   discourses in the emergence of new justifications of social inequality.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {305-321},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the 2001 reform on indigenous rights and culture,
   undertaken in Mexico by the government of Vicente Fox Quesada. For this
   purpose, ILO Convention 169 is used as a comparative point of view to
   analyze the advances and setbacks of the constitutional modifications.
   The analysis is distributed in the four most relevant axes: the
   multicultural nature of the Mexican nation, the configuration of the
   land property regime, the right to self-determination, and the
   recognition of indigenous customary law. The reform was limited and
   conditioned by the structural deficiencies that impede the effective
   reception of indigenous guarantees in the Mexican State.},

Abstract = {Bankruptcy is the legitimate procedure by which monetarily troubled
   firms, people, and sporadically governments settle their obligations.
   The insolvency procedure for firms assumes a focal job in financial
   aspects, since rivalry drives the most wasteful firms bankrupt,
   subsequently raising the normal proficiency level of those remaining.
   This study provides a comparative analysis of the most significant
   aspects of bankruptcy for individuals in Russia and the United States.
   The objective of the study was to determine the conditions involved in
   declaring a citizen insolvent in US and Russian law, for which we
   studied the ways of filing applications in these countries, as well as
   some methods of abuse by creditors that reduce the effectiveness of the
   bankruptcy institution, and the ways to minimize them. Based on the
   results of the analysis, proposals were made to improve the legislation
   that governs people's bankruptcy. These proposals are based on the
   positive experience of the United States in the field of legal
   regulation of insolvency institutions.},

Title = {Discourse Networks and Dual Screening: Analyzing Roles, Content and
   Motivations in Political Twitter Conversations},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {311-325},
Abstract = {The increasing relevance of social networking platforms is accompanied
   by a growing number of studies using digital trace data. However, most
   studies still lack further understanding of the data-generating process.
   This analytical gap can be directly attributed to the prevalence of
   quantitative approaches, as only qualitative work is able to generate
   these insights. The broad methodological toolset of discourse network
   analysis addresses this shortcoming as it combines both qualitative and
   quantitative approaches. The present study therefore employs discourse
   network analysis in order to (1) determine different user groups'
   varying role as senders and recipients of targeted online conversations,
   (2) identify and compare Twitter users' (simultaneous) reference to
   different forms of conversational Twitter content, and to (3) asses the
   motivation of @message authors to direct particular Tweets at particular
   user groups. To this end, this study analyzes @messages during the BBC
   program `Question Time' on 2nd of June 2017-the final media encounter of
   Prime Minister Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn in the context of the 2017
   UK election campaign. We draw on the theoretical background of Maarten
   Hajer's discourse coalitions approach in order to investigate the
   preconditions for the formation of discourse coalitions in new and
   emerging virtual discourse arenas. Thus, our work not only mirrors the
   focus in existing literature on Twitter usage during high-profile
   political media events, but also emphasizes Twitter's unique features
   for interactive exchange. This article identifies different forms of
   meta-talk and policy issues, which vary in both their general popularity
   with Twitter users as well as their interconnectedness. Furthermore, our
   analysis uncovers the motivation behind the decisions of @message
   authors to send particular @messages to certain groups of Twitter users.
   Finally, we could establish that media events only temporarily affect
   the topical foci of @message authors.},

Abstract = {Slovakia as the small and very open economy with relatively limited
   scope of domestic market, insufficient raw materials and low
   agricultural potential is predestined for a further development of
   international trade and relations. One of the most important issues in
   open economies is to determine the effects of income and relative prices
   on the international trade. The purpose of this paper is the estimation
   of the price and income elasticities of the international trade in the
   case of the Slovak Republic. We use panel data regression for the Slovak
   economy in the period 1995-2018 for estimation import and export demand
   functions. Furthermore, these elasticities are re-estimated for
   different sub-periods in order to verify whether they are stable over
   time or they are changing with respect on the type of the exchange rate
   mechanism and adopting the euro by the Slovak Republic. We suppose that
   the income export elasticity will be high and the price elasticities
   will be low due to the participation of the Slovak Republic in the
   Eurozone and the high share of the EMU countries in the Slovak trade.},

Abstract = {Peron's speech on November 11, 1953 is a watershed for at least two
   historical paths: that of Peronism in Argentina, and that of
   geopolitical thought in South America. The then Argentine president, who
   also played the role of the main ideologue of the political movement he
   led, explains the reasons for his regional integration project, the
   South American ABC, exposes his viewpoint on the causes of its failure,
   and proposes a change in strategy, which is the appeal to the people. At
   that moment, a change occurs in his geopolitical vision: he calls for a
   break with categories and concepts from the past, and for the adoption
   of a national-popular (geo)strategy for achieving geographic and social
   transformations. This change has been analyzed historically, considering
   the Cold War context that affected South American governments, but also
   a theory of South American regionalism has been built around it. On this
   second dimension, we argue that Peron's innovation was not the decision
   to practice classical (ratzelian) geopolitics from the South, as Methol
   Ferre and his disciples argued, but his turn towards what we now
   understand as critical geopolitics: in addition to dissent with the
   hegemonic order, he discovers the ``territorial trap{''}, the end of
   conventional geopolitics and the limits of the foreign policy of
   nation-states.},

Pages = {279+},
Abstract = {One of the most serious environmental problems in Russia is the
   contamination of soil and water through crude oil and crude oil
   products. The main cause is corrosion damage to oilfield pipes that have
   outlasted their permitted period of operation. Significant sums of money
   are needed in order to repair and replace them sums that the oil
   companies are not willing to pay. The current standards are not enough
   to fundamentally reduce the number of breakages in oilfield pipes. As
   long as Russia fails to make it mandatory for the oil companies to
   replace the oil pipelines that have reached the end of their operational
   life, there is no improvement in sight.},

Title = {Mixed competences and `second generation' trade agreements: a
   consideration of EU disintegration},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper considers recent developments in EU trade policy in the
   context of the theoretical framework of `disintegration'. The events
   surrounding the conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade
   Agreement (CETA) with Canada, as well as the CJEU's opinion on the
   EU-Singapore free trade agreement, underscore the limits to centralized
   decision-making in trade policy for newer `second generation' trade
   agreements. The argument is that recent political developments with EU
   trade agreements have complicated the possibility for further exclusive
   competence at the supranational level, and in doing so have indirectly
   illustrated some potential limits to further economic integration. This
   examination is helpful when considering if (or to what degree) the logic
   of European integration has been weakened in the aftermath of various
   crises, and whether the federal structure of EU governance is able to
   accommodate changes in the allocation of competences in trade policy.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {353-378},
Abstract = {In many African states, park rangers perform a variety of roles as armed
   state actors. Facing the overlapping challenges of wildlife management
   and regime security, many have become increasingly militarized, with
   significant degree of variation. Using case studies from Uganda, Rwanda,
   Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan, this article provides an
   expanded conceptualization of militarization that configures two
   characteristics of Africa's park rangers: 1) their integration into or
   insulation from the state security apparatus, and 2) their coercive
   roles of either law enforcement or combat. The article builds an
   argument that takes into account colonial institutions and
   civil-military relations.},

Abstract = {The legislative consent convention forms one of a number of conventions
   that underpin the UK's uncodified constitution and has been an important
   facet of the UK's territorial governance post-devolution. It provides
   that the UK government will not normally seek to legislate on devolved
   matters, and the devolution settlements, without the consent of the
   respective devolved legislatures. Commonly referred to as the `Sewel
   Convention', the convention's roots are often traced to the commitments
   made by Lord Sewel during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998. This
   article demonstrates, however, that the convention has a far deeper
   history that long predated Lord Sewel's comments and goes back to the
   dawn of devolution in the United Kingdom, namely, the Northern Ireland
   Parliament that existed between 1921 and 1972. The article charts the
   development of the legislative consent convention from its roots in the
   failure of the UK government to challenge directly the Northern Ireland
   government over local government franchise reform in 1921, to its
   continued survival, even when Stormont collapsed in 1972, and argues
   that the convention survived owing to its role as a device of
   convenience and pragmatism for politicians in Westminster.},

   Some writings from diplomatic practice are also used to provide examples

Abstract = {How did Donald Trump, whom most Republican leaders believed was wrong on
   many key issues and dangerously unelectable, win the 2016 nomination?
   Trump was helped by press coverage that did not treat him as a serious
   candidate, by a large field of opponents who spent more time attacking
   each other than they did him, by a lack of clear signals from party
   leaders, and a series of strategic blunders by his opponents.
   Additionally, Trump's issue positions allowed him to appeal to both
   hardline conservatives and the moderate primary voters who play an
   outsized role in Republican presidential nomination contests.},

Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the consideration of factors influencing the
   state of the situation in Russia in the field of detection and
   repression of the smuggling of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances,
   their precursors, and analogues. In the methodological field it is an
   analytical research based on documentary, close to legal hermeneutics.
   Specifically, the article analyses Russian legislation, offers options
   to solve problems in the field of smuggling narcotic drugs, psychotropic
   substances, their precursors, and analogues. The authors consider the
   real problems of countering the drug threat, which is currently a
   serious obstacle to the development of the state. By way of concluding
   the nature and magnitude of the negative consequences, illicit
   trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, their
   precursors, and analogues can be classified as direct threats to
   national security. Today, the issues of countering the illegal
   circulation of narcotic drugs, using modern information technologies,
   improving mechanisms to convert goods obtained from illicit drug
   trafficking into state revenue are relevant.},

Pages = {35+},
Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus followed a separate
   path. Nowhere else in post-socialist Eastern Europe did the state play
   such an important role in the economy. From 2007 onwards, this model
   reached the limits of its capacity, not least because Russia increased
   the price of crude oil and natural gas supplies to Belarus. The
   government in Minsk took out an increasing number of foreign loans. In
   2015, the decision was made to pursue a new monetary and fiscal policy:
   the exchange rate was deregulated and the deficit in the state budget
   was reduced. However, all the large enterprises remained under state
   control. The country is more dependent on the preferential rates for
   energy imports from Russia, and for this reason, Belarusian economists
   are becoming increasingly vociferous in their demands for a
   restructuring or the closure of the large number of loss-making
   state-owned businesses. In the medium term, the emigration of qualified
   workers due to the political conflict within the country will curb
   economic growth.},

Title = {SCIENCE POLICY PROGRAMS: A PARADIGM-BASED ANALYSIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-21},
Abstract = {The article offers an analysis of the conceptual sources of science
   policy, and the modem dynamics of its changes in program documents
   adopted by Russian executive authorities in the period from 1996 to
   2016. The theoretical basis for the analysis is Kuhn's methodology, with
   particular emphasis placed on components such as distinguishing
   paradigms based on their incommensurability, and identifying
   paradigmatic documents that serve to form a common vision of reality as
   shared by a particular community. In relation to the formation period of
   modem science policy of the 1940-60s, two paradigms stand out - liberal
   and Marxist. The origin of the first is associated with support for
   research and development in the United States during and after the
   Second World War; the second is instead associated with the policies of
   the Soviet Union in the 1920s-1960s. The evolution of Soviet science
   policy starting from the 1960s followed the path of adopting the systems
   theory; this is the reason why it is more accurate to characterize it as
   a systems paradigm. This line of development was cut short in the early
   1990s in connection with a sharp turn to the liberal paradigm, clearly
   manifested in documents of this period. However, in the 2000s, there was
   a return to systems vision. Now, the documents of the current decade are
   shifting to a new neoliberal paradigm, which is based on the notion of
   market organization as the main mechanism of governmental management,
   and within which autonomy for the scientific community is replaced by
   its organization according to market principles. At the same time, the
   2016 Strategy for Scientific and Technological Development once again
   addresses the elements of the systems paradigm, trying to combine both
   elements of contractual organization of scientific research, which is
   one of the main components of the neoliberal vision, and direct
   management, which naturally follows from the systems approach. Paradigm
   analysis thus points to an internal contradiction inherent in Russian
   science policy, which complicates its implementation.},

Title = {Politicized Transnationalism: The Visegrad Countries in the Refugee
   Crisis},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-106},
Abstract = {Existing research on the evolution of European integration has pitted
   economic against identity issues. In the economic sphere, governments
   are arguably able to pursue their preferences more independently. If,
   however, identity issues become politicized this is supposed to suggest
   that governments lose their dominant position in integration and
   gradually become agents of Eurosceptic parties and/or electorates. This
   article looks at a phenomenon neither the intergovernmentalist nor the
   postfunctionalist perspective can fully explain: the emergence of the
   Visegrad Group (V4) as a collective actor in European politics in early
   2016. This emergence occurred in the wake of the refugee crisis during
   which the identity issue of migration was politicized. However, there
   was no coherent partisan composition uniting V4 governments. Based on a
   sequence elaboration of all press statements of meetings of the V4 Prime
   Ministers since their EU-accession in 2004, we show that what at first
   sight appears to be informed by anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic
   sentiments may in fact display a more ambivalent position towards
   regional integration. The post-refugee crisis V4 appears as a case of
   politicized transnationalism-that is, cooperation to achieve
   transnational interests under the condition of politicization. This
   transnational interest not only comprised opposition to a relocation of
   migrants, but also the maintenance of a core transnational freedom
   within the EU, namely free movement under the Schengen acquis. We
   conclude that, under the condition of increasing politicization,
   identity issues help to forge government alliances of governments
   pursuing economic preferences.},

Title = {Boundary Standoff and China-India Relations A Chinese Scholar's
   Perspective},
Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-248},
Abstract = {The China-Indian boundary and territorial dispute is one of the major
   issues affecting Sino-Indian bilateral relations. This issue was a
   legacy of the British colonialists, but unfortunately, it has been fully
   inherited by the Indian ruling class. Over the past 60 years, China and
   India have missed three opportunities to resolve this issue. The Indian
   ruling class wanted to achieve ``absolute security{''} and therefore
   introduced a ``forward policy{''}, which led to the 1962 conflict. After
   the war, India occupied almost all of the strategic commanding heights
   in the border area between the two countries by continuously encroaching
   on Chinese territory and pushing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) toward
   the Chinese side. After Prime Minister Modi came to power in 2014, he
   adopted the Doval Doctrine and ``offensive defense{''} policy in the
   border area, with a view to continuing the encroachment on Chinese
   territory and occupying the strategic commanding heights. The aim was to
   force China to resolve the border issue in accordance with India's
   intentions, so that India can then shift its strategic focus to the
   Indian Ocean. China-U.S. strategic rivalry and Hindu nationalism have
   fueled India's behavior in the border region, and the peaceful
   resolution of the 2017 Donglang/Doklam standoff has emboldened India,
   making the bloodshed in Galwan Valley an inevitable incident. That
   India's Home Minister Amit Shah categorically declared in August 2019 in
   Parliament that Aksai Chin was part of new Ladakh Union Territory shows
   that the Indian government has restored its position on the western
   sector boundary that the Vajpayee Administration had abandoned in 2003.
   India is using the Galwan conflict as an excuse to pursue its policy of
   economic de-Sinicization and strategic alliance with the U.S. and other
   Western countries. In the future, China-Indian border conflict is likely
   to become commonplace due to India's expansionism.},

Pages = {693-717},
Abstract = {The analysis aims to understand the reasons why 15\% of voters decided
   to support VOX on November 10, 2019. The main conditions to the
   emergence of said party are addressed. The evolution of their intention
   to vote and their relationship with the chain of significant events that
   occurred during 2018 and 2019, resulting in the concern for Catalan
   secessionism being the main trigger for take-off. Finally, a survey
   analysis is presented to explain the reasons and characteristics
   associated with VOX. It is found that the main explanatory variable is
   in self-placement on the left-right scale. Concerns about Catalan
   secessionism, age (due to the weight of the young vote) and
   authoritarianism remain in the background. On a third level of
   importance, the explanatory importance of immigration, being male,
   identifying oneself as a nationalist, having a Spanish feeling,
   pessimism about the political and economic situation, and the departure
   of Franco's bones from Valley of the Fallen. From the comparison with
   other right-wing parties, it was found that the sensitivities are shared
   with other right-wing voters but more pronounced and radical. What
   mainly differentiates them is, in this order: age (youth),
   authoritarianism, concern for immigration, and higher score on the
   left-right scale.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of the Revolutionary Left Movement played
   in the conflict that involved a series of land seizures in the foothills
   of Valdivia. From our perspective, the structural possibilities for the
   emergence of the land seizures were associated with the irregular
   possession of land and the concentration of these in forest estates,
   which were not intervened until the government of Salvador Allende. The
   MIR fulfilled the function of hegemonically articulating the demands of
   those who participated in the land seizures, regarding the formation of
   a single productive unit, foreshadowing the creation of the ``Complejo
   Forestal y Maderero Panguipulli{''}.},

Abstract = {Maly Trostenets was one of the largest death camps of the National
   Socialist regime in Eastern Europe. It hardly featured at all in the
   European commemoration of the war in recent decades. Now, it is the site
   of a large memorial. However, it does not fulfil the role of either a
   commemoration site or a place of learning, and Trostenets is also not a
   European, transnational place of remembrance of the Holocaust. The
   original concept and the result are too far apart, and the engagement
   with the past is too strongly dominated by political factors and the
   ideology of ``Belarusian statehood{''}. The singularity of the Holocaust
   becomes lost in the representation of the suffering of the ``peaceful
   civilian population{''}. The commemorative landscape of Maly Trostenets
   mirrors the Belarusian culture of remembrance.},

Abstract = {This research work examines the movement of opposition to fracking in
   The Basque Country, studying the construction of environmental conflict
   and discourse by its actors and the context in which it was developed.
   For this, this case study has employed a methodology based on
   interviews, and analysis of discourse and context. The rapid creation,
   and the solid but dynamic organization of the movement, together with
   the profound documentation work of its spokespersons, contributed to the
   creation of a credible interlocutor. The combination of valuation
   languages, from the dispute of scientific and economic data, to the
   development of alternative valuation languages based on environmental
   and health arguments, not limiting their argument to social alarm,
   filled the movement with legitimacy and effectiveness before society.
   The platforms against fracking reminded social mobilization as a
   strategy of pressure, a mobilization that was in crescendo both
   quantitatively and qualitatively. The study, in short, helps to document
   and better understand the history and dynamics of environmental
   movements.},

Abstract = {The paper intends to investigate the sources of the very concept of
   charisma in Max Weber, starting from some polemical readings made by
   Carl Schmitt. Aside from theologian Karl Holl, particular attention is
   devoted to Protestant jurist Rudolf Sohm and to his masterwork
   Kirchenrecht(1892). Weber started to read it attentively in 1909, at the
   beginning of his project called Economy and Society, In the writings
   that make the most of this posthumous work that he never really ended,
   charisma is meant as the non-juridical key for official and hierarchic
   organizations - Roman Church may not be the only good example: charisma
   creates concrete social associations elsewhere. Gradually, such
   organizations get more and more legal, as long as they lose their
   `extraordinary' traits. The analysis will show how obedience and
   recognition are originally created by charisma and how they structure
   the ties that bind the followers to their leader, a hero, a prophet, or
   similar charismatic personalities. Being originally anti-economic,
   anti-institutional, charisma gets to be gradually objectified in a legal
   order provided with specific economical traits. In its last part, the
   paper analyses the famous conference Max Weber held in Munich in 1919,
   Politics as Vocation. Politics is identified as the intersection between
   charisma and bureaucracy, in the handling of the relationship between
   the two elements of devotion to the leader and the cause (what he calls
   the `demon') and the party machine.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the article is to analyze the Alto al SIMCE (Stop
   the SIMCE) campaign in Chile through an analytical framework that
   combines different heuristic tools from social movement theories.
   Specifically, the article explores the discursive frames present in the
   narratives of the movement, as well as aspects related to the formation
   and trajectory of the campaign, collective identity, alliances and
   repertoires of collective action used by activists to influence
   educational policies. At the methodological level, the article is based
   on a case study with a qualitative approach and combines documentary and
   press analysis with semi-structured interviews. The results offer
   reflections and novel insights about external and internal factors that
   can favor and/or hinder the success of collective action against
   test-based accountability in the educational field.},

Abstract = {The process of formation of the working class in the city of Vitoria
   (province of Alava) is investigated starting from the industrial pole
   that was implanted since the 50s. We focus attention on eight life
   stories, exposed in interviews with workers and workers who lived in
   that city. The study includes the bibliographical and journalistic
   sources. The industrialization project built a ``new Vitoria{''}, and
   the immigrants who arrived there were, mostly, day laborers or small
   landowners who escaped from extremely difficult living conditions. The
   article covers the process of construction of this ``new{''} working
   class, from the development of a common experience that consolidated the
   workers' struggle, changing the history of Spain forever.},

Abstract = {This article aims to investigate levels of migrants and second
   generations' engagement in country-of-origin political activities and in
   domestic political activities. Using data from a population survey of
   individuals of migrant origin in ten European cities undertaken in
   2004-2010, we examine both individual and contextual characteristics
   shaping engagement in one and in the other scope of action. Findings
   show that migrants and second generations tend to engage in an equal
   number of domestic and country-of-origin political activities.
   Engagement in country-of-origin political activities only is fully
   compatible with a trajectory of political integration in the countries
   of settlement, opposing the view that migrants may contribute to build
   or live in a ``separate{''} society. Finally, the results show that
   contextual opportunities affect chances to engage in one or in the other
   scope of action. In particular, easy access to residence permits favours
   engagement in domestic political activities and discourages engagement
   in country-of-origin political activities. This suggests that migrants
   and second generations' engagement in country-of-origin political
   activities may be a reaction to the limited opportunities of integration
   offered by the residence countries.},

Title = {BALKAN BREATH OF BEIJING STRATEGY AND TACTICS OF CHINESE PRESENCE IN THE

Abstract = {The Western Balkans represent a strategically important area of world
   politics. Despite the geographical, historical, cultural and economic
   inevitability of the European integration, the final choice by the
   Balkan countries of EU as an ``empire by invitation{''} is complicated
   by the continuing uncertainty about the common future, as well as
   Brussels's high institutional and fiscal requirements. Under these
   conditions, the emergence of a new powerful player - China - is fraught
   not only with economic, but also with political transformation of the
   Balkan space.
   The institutional basis for China's penetration into greater Europe was
   the 16 + 1 format that the country initiated in 2012, uniting a group of
   post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe under the
   auspices of Beijing. Two events - Greece joining the initiative in April
   2019 and the transfer of a controlling stake in the port of Piraeus to
   the Chinese company COSCO - have seriously changed the economic balance
   in the European south. The efficiency of the Chinese presence in the
   region is based on a set of measures, including large-scale lending,
   accompanied by an increased debt in the recipient countries; an increase
   in the volume of bilateral trade; creation of special economic and
   technological zones, currency swaps, mechanisms of paying in local
   currency for cross-border trade. Due to the weak institutions, lack of
   available funds, and low regulatory barriers, Beijing, through financing
   infrastructure projects that connect different parts of the region, is
   creating a new version of the Balkan Federation, which is able to
   provide a reliable access for Chinese goods to Europe and European goods
   to China. The analysis carried out by the authors shows that, using
   exclusively economic leverages, China is slowly, but consistently,
   occupying the Balkan space and thereby solves the strategic tasks of
   penetrating the EU countries.},

Abstract = {An emerging trend in studies proves how young people are engaged in
   post-conflict initiatives, yet minimal studies were conducted on how do
   youth enhance their peacebuilding agency when access to formal training
   and formal institutions are unavailable. Especially for youth-led
   organizations in developing and conflict-driven regions, the
   inaccessibility of proper training and the inability to establish
   strategic directions is a challenge. This research examined the
   peacebuilding project management of two youth-led and arts-based
   peacebuilding organizations in Mindanao. Both organizations have
   strategies that are developed through experience gained by their key
   stakeholders. Its goals and peacebuilding programs are inclined to bring
   impact to its beneficiaries at the individual, interpersonal, and
   community levels. Especially for non-profit literature, the empirical
   data from this study contributes particularly to developing and
   conflict-driven regions where proper training is scarce, that
   experience-based strategies can be effective in enhancing staff and
   members' capacity.},

Abstract = {For a long time, Belarus was considered an exemplary case of a stable
   authoritarian regime. For 26 years, the country has been ruled by
   Aliaksandr Lukashenka. The central organisational principle of the
   ruling elite is a single-pyramid network, with Lukashenka at the top.
   From this position, he was able to prevent rival factions from gaining
   access to power resources. Despite a major political crisis in the
   country and ongoing protests after the disputed presidential election in
   August 2020, Lukashenka has maintained control of the security organs
   and state institutions, but the crisis will become permanent. Although
   the authorities have succeeded in preventing the institutionalisation of
   the opposition inside the country, the mobilisation of society with its
   horizontal networks is continuing. For the Lukashenka regime, there is
   no going back, since any legitimacy it had claimed on the basis of the
   country's performance capacity and the elections has now been quashed.
   Popular support of the autocrat and international recognition have been
   lost. As a result, the most important supporting pillars of Belarusian
   authoritarianism are starting to show cracks.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to identify the groups that operated within
   the PSCh during the 80s and, secondly-with that information- to outline
   a fractional map as complete as possible. The idea is to go beyond the
   two fractions traditionally recognized by literature: almeydistas and
   altamiranistas. The description of each identified fraction will be made
   through small sections (main leaders, structure, dissemination organs,
   internal breaks and organic continuity) in order to check basically
   which groups effectively formed fractions. Therefore, we will parallely
   define what a fraction is and its difference, for example, with a
   tendency.},

Title = {Expert-Led Securitization: The Case of the 2009 Pandemic in Denmark and
   Sweden},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-330},
Abstract = {This article goes beyond the study of speech acts to investigate the
   process of securitization during a health crisis. The article introduces
   the concept of `expert-led securitization' to account for situations
   when experts dominate the administrative process that translates a
   securitizing speech act into extraordinary public policy. Expert-led
   securitization was particularly salient during the 2009 pandemic flu in
   Denmark and Sweden. Autonomous public health expert agencies led the
   national securitization processes, and these never included intense
   political battles or extensive public debates. In turn, the respective
   processes resulted in different policies: Sweden's main response to the
   pandemic was an extraordinary push to vaccinate its whole population,
   while Denmark's was a one-off offer of vaccination to about twenty
   percent of its people. Hence, the 2009 pandemic example illustrates the
   added value of investigating the administrative dynamics of
   securitization when seeking to understand differences in extraordinary
   policies.},

Abstract = {The research aims to analyze due process in the Constitutions of Latin
   America, specifically in Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru. Due
   process is a constant in the Constitutions of some countries because its
   importance breaks borders and is established as a necessity, the
   reflections contained in the manuscript about this institution were made
   with an analytical methodology, the main sources were the National
   Constitutions of the countries mentioned, in addition to jurisprudence
   and doctrinal opinions. The central conclusion is that there are
   international parameters about due process, and, it is assumed, as a
   fundamental human right that seeks the respect and dignity of people at
   each stage of legal situations that may arise, encloses rights,
   guarantees and principles with constitutional significance.},

Abstract = {In a complex world, politicians are in constant need of valid
   information and knowledge in order to identify problems, develop
   solutions and make decisions. During decision-making processes,
   politicians and civil servants draw on information provided by
   scientists and academics. However, the transfer of knowledge is a
   difficult process, and only succeeds under specific conditions. A
   subjective reflection, based on participant observation and personal
   experience, shows that the contribution made by academic political
   consultancy to German foreign policy visa-vis Russia is extremely
   limited, as demonstrated during the war in Chechnya, the eastward
   expansion of NATO, in debates about a modernisation partnership with
   Russia and a new security architecture in Europe. The principles that
   drive academic research and those who drive politics diverge too widely.},

Abstract = {This article analyses emergence and development of the Common Security
   and Defence Policy of the European Union and the role of key countries
   (Berlin-Paris-London axis) in that process. The aim of the paper is to
   detect the internal and external obstacles and challenges to the
   integration of this policy with specific focus on the Brexit and
   ``new{''} transatlantic relations. In this regard, the authors aim to
   explore how withdrawal of the United Kingdom of the Great Britain and
   Northern Ireland, as Europe's strongest military country, from the
   European Union will reflect on the future development and integration of
   the Common Security and Defence Policy of European Union and ``new{''}
   transatlantic partnership that had begun by Donald Trump's election for
   the President of the United States of America. Authors hold that these
   two challenges set the future integration of the Common Security and
   Defence Policy into the limbo and further consider that French German
   partnership and relationships with the countries of the ``New Europe{''}
   will be crucial to the new strategic positioning of this policy and in
   eliminating negative implications of the aforementioned challenges.},

Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {With an increasing share of voting-age residents without Austrian
   citizenship, Vienna is a striking example of a boundary problem of
   electoral participation. Without Austrian citizenship comes an exclusion
   from electoral rights at national, regional and, for some, also at
   European elections. The paper examines turnout rates and their
   socio-demographic covariates for II elections on the aggregate level of
   districts in Vienna, Austria, from 2004 to 2019. The analysis shows that
   aggregate turnout is statistically associated with socio-economic
   district characteristics, diversity within the electorate and the
   proportion of individuals not eligible to vote. To conclude, the paper
   discusses possible mechanisms behind the correlation of electoral
   exclusion and turnout and provides perspectives for further empirical
   tests of such mechanisms.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {40-69},
Abstract = {This article seeks to understand the relaunch of the European defence
   project in the 2010s through the use of different theoretical
   approaches. While at first sight New intergovernmentalism, focusing on
   the Member States and the context of crisis, has the greatest

   ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL SECTOR},

Abstract = {Both Russian and foreign researchers have done much to study U.S.
   sanctions policy. Many focus on ``initiator-target{''} relations, i.e.
   on state vs. state dyads. However, the U.S. government runs a proactive
   policy to enforce compliance from both business at home and abroad with
   the U.S. sanctions regimes. Literature often omits this state vs.
   business relationship, although business behavior may be crucial to
   promote or block the isolation of target-states. For business itself,
   sanctions pose a considerable political risk, fraught with material and
   reputational loses; the financial sector is under special risk. The
   article studies the U.S. Department of Treasury's enforcement actions
   against financial companies. It raises the following questions: Why is
   the financial sector the most vulnerable to enforcement? What is the
   nature of risk for these companies - is it a result of the ``special
   approach{''} of the government, or a consequence of structural features
   of the financial sector itself? Why do financial companies violate
   sanctions regimes? What are the strategies these companies have to deal
   with the U.S. government and to manage the risk? The research tests
   three hypotheses. (1) The financial sector suffers due to structural
   reasons; (2) Companies violate sanctions regimes due to reckless, rather
   than willful behavior; (3) They prefer to cooperate with the government
   and improve compliance rather than further conceal violations and repeat
   them. This rather shows how efficient the U.S. enforcement actions are
   at changing the behavior of business in financial sector. Testing these
   assumptions implies analysing 54 cases of enforcement actions against
   financial companies in 2009-2020, in comparison with a wider sample of
   215 cases of other sectors of economy.},

Abstract = {The content of universal and European regional international instruments
   on protection of labor rights of persons with disabilities is analyzed
   in the paper. The conclusion is made that Ukraine should take into
   account the positive foreign experience of the leading countries in the
   field of state policy of support for persons with disabilities and its
   implementation. It is justified that the world experience in the field
   of employment for persons with disabilities will facilitate the
   practical implementation not only of government programs but also of
   measures to protect the interests of persons with disabilities. A number
   of scholarly publications on the subject have been investigated,
   containing suggestions by scientists to improve promising labor law
   regarding the manifestations of discrimination on the basis of
   disability in the field of work. Some theoretically sound
   recommendations for improving the legal regulation of the protection of
   the labor rights of persons with disabilities and ensuring that they
   fulfill their responsibilities were developed. General conclusions have
   been drawn that the problem of the legal mechanism for the protection of
   the labor rights of persons with disabilities needs reforming and
   improvement. Some proposals for improving the legal regulation in this
   field were given.},

Abstract = {Are ideologically moderate candidates more electable than ideologically
   extreme candidates? Historically, both research in political science and
   conventional wisdom answer yes to this question. However, given the rise
   of ideologues on both the right and the left in recent years, it is
   important to consider whether this assumption is still accurate. I find
   that, while moderates have historically enjoyed an advantage over
   ideologically extreme candidates in congressional elections, this gap
   has disappeared in recent years, where moderates and ideologically
   extreme candidates are equally likely to be elected. This change
   persists for both Democratic and Republican candidates.},

Abstract = {Are self-interest or presumably stable value orientations and other
   predispositions the main drivers behind social policy attitudes? This
   article contributes to this debate by moving away from its binary
   discussion. It differentiates between attitude changes driven by
   self-interest that are in line with pre-existing predispositions and
   those that are not. Empirically, this article focuses on changes of
   labour market policy attitudes after employment transitions and job
   insecurity changes. More precisely, this article differentiates between
   attitude changes within three subgroups. (A) People whose self-interest
   after the employment transitions reinforces their prior predispositions.
   (B) People without strong prior predispositions, who are thus
   unconstrained by them. And (C) people whose self-interest after the
   employment transitions contradicts their prior predispositions. Panel
   analyses with fixed effects use German SOEP waves from 1997 and 2002.
   Main effects suggest an important role for self-interest as they show
   significant attitudinal reactions after most of the transitions and
   perception changes. However, subgroup analyses result in a somewhat
   mixed picture. They show attitude changes within different subgroups
   after different transitions and perception changes. This mixed empirical
   picture suggests caution when interpreting attitudinal change or
   stability after changing material circumstances as a sign for the
   relative importance of self-interest or predispositions.},

Abstract = {The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and China's
   governance system have their own prominent advantages and features.
   Together, they are able to focus concentrated efforts on key large-scale
   projects, achieving great feats and securing popular benefits that are
   welcomed by the broad masses. This people-centered system is able to
   meet the ever-growing need of the population for a better life, and
   enjoys essentially universal support. The system of socialism with
   Chinese characteristics aims to unify the immediate and long-term
   interests of the people, and to combine the overall interests of the
   overwhelming majority of the people with the special interests of
   certain popular sectors. It also reduces the consumption of social
   resources and realizes greater social benefits. The system of socialism
   with Chinese characteristics and China's governance system are
   characterized by continuity and stability. They feature an internal
   unity of ``success will come whether I see it achieved or not{''} and
   ``success requires my participation and effort,{''} and are therefore
   capable of consistently executing each of the major strategic tasks that
   have been formulated.},

Title = {Counterspeech and Ordinary Citizens: How? When?},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1-27},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Central to the still-nascent normative literature on counterspeech is
   the widespread belief that citizens should engage discursively with
   haters and the effects of hate speech. It is also increasingly clear
   that discursive engagement with intolerant members of society should be
   understood as a continuous and extended series of different and
   connected actions. Much less has been said about the ways that attempts
   in persuasion and direct responses to hate speech relate to one another
   and about when specific counterspeech actions should happen. This essay
   advances a more expansive and refined account of counterspeech, which is
   understood as a combination of continuous discursive engagement with
   intolerant members of society and acts of distancing from haters
   (shaming, correcting falsehoods, ``Not in my name{''} campaigns,
   protests, and forms of discursive exit). After reconsidering discursive
   agency distribution (that is, who is an active participant, how, and
   when) around public hate speech, I show that continuous discursive
   engagement with intolerant members of society should be interrupted by
   visible acts of distancing when haters make hateful representative
   claims.},

Abstract = {While a long history of Black feminist thought grapples with the
   relationship between gender and racial oppression, both historical and
   present-day examples showcase how white feminists often struggle to make
   this connection. In this study, we examine the relationship between
   white Americans' feminist identification and perceiving discrimination
   toward other groups. Specifically, we investigate how identifying in
   feminist terms, together with the clarity of cues regarding racial bias
   in decision-making, influence white Americans' ability to see gender and
   racial discrimination as interconnected phenomena and react accordingly.
   Results of both correlational and experimental analyses suggest that
   white respondents who identify strongly as feminists are more likely
   than their non- and weak feminist counterparts to perceive racial
   discrimination both when racial bias is a clearly defined factor in
   decision-making as well as in cases where the influence of race is more
   ambiguous. These findings suggest that adopting subgroup identities may,
   in some cases, heighten awareness about the discrimination faced by
   racial and ethnic minorities among racially advantaged group members.
   Recognizing discrimination is a necessary precursor to forming broad,
   diverse coalitions around racial injustice and inequality. Our results
   suggest that some white feminists may be well-suited to join the
   coalition.},

Abstract = {This note describes how research on the link between economic openness
   and government size has changed over time. Early interpretations
   suggested that countries develop welfare states to compensate for
   volatility caused by economic openness (the compensation hypothesis).
   Recent findings have cast doubts on this interpretation. For example,
   more open economies are on average not more volatile, and economic
   openness does not unambiguously increase the social security demands
   from voters. Some recent studies suggest that economic openness is
   particularly beneficial for countries with high taxes and high-income
   equality. A re-interpretation of the compensation hypothesis is thus
   possible: Through trade, the citizens in large welfare states enjoy some
   of the benefits associated with cheap labour and high wage dispersion
   despite their domestic economy being characterized by high real wages,
   high taxes and a compressed wage distribution.},

Title = {Are human rights associative rights? The debate between humanist and
   political conceptions of human rights revisited},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Humanist and political conceptions of human rights disagree about
   whether human rights are best conceived as either general or associative
   rights. According to humanist conceptions human rights are those
   (general) rights that human beings have in virtue of their humanity.
   According to political conceptions, human rights are those (associative)
   rights that individuals have against the state (or some such agent) in
   virtue of being subject to its authority. In this essay I defend the
   humanist claim against the view that human rights are best understood as
   associative rights. Political conceptions are correct in claiming that
   human rights practice does not merely try to identify those rights that
   human beings have in virtue of their humanity. Instead, the practice
   also tries `to secure universal and effective recognition and
   observance' of these rights (UN Charter, UDHR, etc.). This means that
   the practice must also identify agents (such as states) who have duties
   to protect and to fulfill human rights. However, even if this allocation
   of duties is justified on the basis of special relationships this does
   not turn human rights into associative rights. I defend this claim in
   two steps. First, I offer a detailed analysis of Beitz's and Macklem's
   versions of the political approach in order to show how their respective
   conceptual strategies each run into internal difficulties. Second, I
   analyze the tripartite structure of human rights obligations to respect,
   to protect, and to fulfill rights, as it has been adopted in human
   rights practice. Disaggregating these obligations and analyzing their
   distinctive features helps explain why human rights are universal rights
   from within human rights practice itself.},

Abstract = {A hypothesized benefit of decentralization is that it will promote
   policy experimentation, yet there have been few studies examining this
   link. In this article, I identify three pathways through which
   decentralization could plausibly lead to greater experimentation and
   empirically assess their presence through an analysis of California's
   Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), a policy that enhanced the fiscal
   autonomy of local school districts. I find mixed results; even though
   there was some evidence to suggest greater policy activity, most new
   actions taken by school districts were incremental changes. Further,
   there was little ideological differentiation in adopted policies despite
   variation in districts' partisan composition. Small districts were
   slightly more likely to experiment than larger ones, supporting the
   hypothesis that smaller jurisdictions are more nimble and flexible and
   thus more likely to enact policy change. I conclude by exploring how the
   incentives and preferences of local officials mediate the causal
   connection between decentralization and policy experimentation.},

   learning environments to online environments. Thus, the first months of
   the teaching experience story is articulated with some thoughts raised

Abstract = {This article investigates if civic education can spur a sense of duty to
   vote and, in this way, help to augment the number of voters and diminish
   inequality in participation. I perform a systematic cross-country
   analysis of the link between different forms of civic education and
   civic duty, using the data from the 2016 International Civic and
   Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) that include 23 countries. The
   results show that three key civic education mechanisms-civics courses,
   active learning strategies and open classroom environment-exert an
   influence on civic duty but that civics courses have the strongest
   effect. Country-level analyses confirm that civics courses are more
   influential on civic duty than the other types of civic education. This
   evidence elucidates which channels of school socialization may help to
   develop a sense of duty in adolescents, as well as the relative effect
   of each mechanism.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How do religious parties mobilize local support and what impact does
   different political strategies have on neighborhoods? Previous
   literature focuses on the social welfare benefits distributed by
   religious parties. In this paper, I analyze how religious political
   parties in Israel generate grassroots support among voters by allying
   with Jewish religious institutions. Using original data, I examine the
   association between the timing of entry of religious institutions into
   neighborhoods and local voting patterns for Israeli national elections.
   I find that religious institutions are associated with a 4-percentage
   point increase in the local vote share for religious parties, where this
   effect is larger for religious institutions with connections to
   political parties. My results suggest that the primary mechanism driving
   these results are that these institutions influence the vote choice of
   existing residents by distributing tangible goods. In contrast, changes
   to the composition of the neighborhood through in-migration has a more
   limited effect on voting patterns. These findings highlight the impact
   of religious institutions on the social and political fabric of local
   communities.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the perceptions of mining companies and their
   stakeholders in five Latin American countries. Through interviews, it
   addresses the dimensions of the analysis related to the companies' role
   in the communities, the relationships among actors and community
   involvement in decision-making. Results show different visions and
   relevant conclusions, among them the need for an effective
   implementation of the multi-actor model to improve Corporate Social
   Responsibility and reduce conflict.},

Abstract = {In the past 70 years, situations that featured a lack of solidarity were
   always followed by the communitization of structures in the European
   Union. This contribution reflects on possible consequences of the
   COVID-19 crisis for the European Union. Even though the initial response
   from the EU looked unpromising and was driven at the nation-state level,
   the crisis may lead to new forms of solidarity through communitization.
   We argue that the EU needs equality for all EU citizens as well as
   institutionalized solidarity in order to finally become a real European
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Competition in public procurement in Romania has declined sharply since
   2017.
   Romania's efforts toward transparency and anticorruption since becoming
   an EU member-state have been remarkable yet the results from over a
   decade of struggle do not seem to point in the direction of systemic
   improvement.
   On the contrary, over the recent years there have been more red flags of
   corruption in public procurement despite more access to information than
   ever before and despite years of sustained economic growth. The
   prevalence of red flags of corruption seems to depend on the person or
   the faction in power rather than the party. This is a sign that
   institutional checks and balances to guarantee fairness in public
   procurement are still lacking.Romania's efforts toward transparency and
   anticorruption since becoming an EU member-state have been remarkable
