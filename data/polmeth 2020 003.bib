Abstract = {The threat of emergency measures introduced in face of COVID-19 has
   largely been framed in terms of individual rights. We argue that it is
   not the protection of the sovereign individual that is most at stake,
   but the relations between political subjects and the institutions that
   enable their robust political participation. Drawing on Hannah Arendt's
   analysis of the ways in which isolation and the incapacity to discern
   truth or reality condition totalitarianism and are exacerbated by it, we
   argue that the dangers for the evacuation of democratic politics are
   stark in our era. We consider contemporary political action in concert
   in Germany to illustrate this critique of COVID-19 emergency measures.
   Drawing on the legal concept of ``appropriateness,{''} we explicate how
   the German critical response to the shutdown is founded on a concern for
   democratic principles and institutions, and aims to achieve two crucial
   goals: governmental transparency and social-political solidarity.},

Abstract = {High-profile controversies have created an impression that expressive
   freedom is imperilled on university campuses in North America. Analyses
   of this alleged campus crisis typically focus either on the negative
   psychosocial characteristics of those who oppose potentially harmful
   expression or on the cynical ways that expressive freedom can be invoked
   to normalize harmful expression. Conversely, I argue that theories of
   harm are key to understanding the contemporary discourse and politics of
   expressive freedom on campus. To shift the frame of analysis, I
   critically analyze three interrelated theoretical concepts that feature
   elastic conceptualizations of harm and are consequential for expressive
   limits in an academic environment: epistemic injustice, argumentational
   injustice and epistemic exploitation. I argue that all three concepts
   require a distinction between testimony and argumentation in order to
   better balance protection from harm, on the one hand, and expressive
   freedom and open inquiry, on the other.},

Abstract = {Presidential approval is a desirable commodity for US presidents, one
   that bolsters re-election chances and the prospects of legislative
   success. An important question, then, is what shapes citizens' approval
   of the executive. A large body of literature demonstrates that the
   president's handling of issues, particularly the economy, is an
   important component. A similarly large literature confirms that
   evaluations of the president, like most political objects, are filtered
   through partisan lenses. Due to changes in the US political environment
   in the last few decades, we suspect that the relative importance of
   these components has changed over time. In particular, we argue that
   polarization has increased partisan motivated reasoning when it comes to
   evaluations of the president. We support this empirically by
   disaggregating approval ratings from Reagan to Obama into in- and
   out-partisans, finding that approval is increasingly detached from
   economic assessments. This is true for members opposite the president's
   party earlier than it is for in-partisans. While the president has been
   over-attributed credit and blame for economic conditions, the increasing
   impact of partisanship on approval at the expense of economic sentiment
   has generally negative implications when it comes to electoral outcomes
   and democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {Political participation of former combatants is a central component of
   peace agreements. Similarly, people's acceptance of political parties
   derived from such agreements is a crucial element towards peace
   building. Considering the peace deal between the Colombian government
   and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas
   Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC), we ask ``What factors shape popular
   support for the FARC's political involvement?{''} We argue that
   attitudes towards the political integration of the former guerrilla are
   influenced by conflict experiences and partisan identities. Relying on
   survey data, our results indicate that conflict experiences and
   political identities alone are not correlated with attitudes towards the
   political integration of former insurgents. However, public support for
   former combatants having a political party is associated with conflict
   experiences only for those who feel close to parties that took a hawkish
   stance towards the agreement.},

Abstract = {Research on the link between health and political behavior has
   flourished, yet there have been no analyses regarding the political
   consequences of health inequalities. Using data from the 2012 CCES, we
   find that health is associated with representation. Healthy individuals
   are better represented compared to unhealthy citizens; this positive
   association is particularly true for individuals in the top third income
   group and when citizens are represented by Republicans. We explore two
   mechanisms that may account for this association. The participatory
   mechanism suggests that healthy individuals are better represented due
   to differences in political participation while the preferential
   mechanism suggests that differences are due to shifts in policy
   preferences. Overall, we find little evidence that either mechanism
   fully accounts for the association between health and representation.
   While the results clearly suggest that political clout is not just about
   income, but also health, scholars are encouraged to further explain this
   association.},

Abstract = {This article outlines the impact of the pressures caused by the current
   pandemic `crisis' on the nation's governance arrangements with
   particular reference to intergovernmental relations and their existing
   institutions and arrangements. Attention is given to the new
   institutional arrangements that have been developed to replace the
   Council of Australian Government (COAG) and related advisory bodies by
   the National Cabinet and other new processes. The issue is whether these
   new arrangements, announced as the pandemic crisis unfolded, have given
   further impetus to `executive federalism' and increased executive
   dominance within each jurisdiction. It is argued that the nature and
   extent of these new arrangements have been further amplified by the
   recently completed review of the COAG superstructure and ministerial
   councils. These changes may be extensive, but have not altered the
   fundamental intergovernmental processes and politics that have long
   dominated Australia's federalism.},

Abstract = {Raymond Boudon (1934-2013) developed his own general theory of
   rationality as an extension and original synthesis of the work already
   provided by classical sociology and rational choice theory. To achieve
   this, he had to interpret and reinterpret many classical authors and
   schools of thought. One classical author that inspired Boudon's theory
   was German sociologist Georg Simmel (1858-1918). The following article
   seeks to delineate the particular Simmelian influences that can be found
   in Raymond Boudon's theoretical work.},

Abstract = {Neighbors inhabit a distinct social sphere whose regulative ideal is the
   democracy of everyday life. Its chief elements are reciprocity and a
   practical disregard for the differences and inequalities that shape
   interactions in the broader society and in democratic politics. The
   democracy of everyday life has heightened significance during disasters.
   Neighbors hold our lives in their hands. But COVID-19 differs from
   physical disasters in ways that alter neighbor interactions.
   Contamination makes relations more fearful at the same time that
   isolation makes them more valuable. When the meaning attributed to the
   virus is not shared experience of disease and mortality but rabid
   partisanship, neighbor relations become distorted. This degradation of
   the democracy of everyday life signals that democracy itself is
   imperiled more deeply than political paralysis, corruption, and
   institutional failure suggest.},

Abstract = {The ideational power framework developed by Carstensen and Schmidt has
   sought to make explicit the manner in which ideas can exert an influence
   over policy outcomes. However, one key feature of this theoretical
   framework has not yet been adequately conceptualised: the communicative
   process through which policy entrepreneurs convey their ideas to the
   general public. This article focuses on one specific form of
   communicative discourse as a means of generating widespread public
   support for a given policy proposal: public discourse via the media - be
   it print, broadcast or social media. We argue that the ideational power
   literature should recognise the media as a powerful entity in its own
   right rather than merely depicting the media as an implement for
   political communication. We contend that the ideational power framework
   could usefully incorporate a characterisation of the media that has
   recently emerged from political communications research: the hybrid
   media system. In order to illustrate how the communicative process
   inherent in ideational power can be understood in terms of a hybrid
   media system, we undertake a comparative review of two empirical studies
   which assess political discourse during the 2016 US presidential
   election from the perspectives of ideational power and hybrid media
   systems.},

Abstract = {One central objection to philosophical defences of liberal neutrality is
   that many neutrally justified laws and policies are nonetheless
   discriminatory as they unilaterally impose costs or confer unearned
   privileges on the bearers of a particular conception of the good. Call
   this the false neutrality objection. While liberal neutralists seldom
   consider this objection to be a serious allegation, and often claim that
   it rests on a misunderstanding, I argue that it is a serious challenge
   for proponents of justificatory neutrality. Indeed, a careful
   examination of recent French and Canadian laws which impede the members
   of cultural minorities from freely practising their religion reveals
   that the state can hide its discriminatory aims by cloaking the policies
   it enacts in neutral language. In order to avoid the problem of false
   neutrality, I contend, liberal neutralists should defend a combination
   of neutrality of justification and neutrality of aim and operationalize
   neutrality of aim through a practical test that has been a defining
   feature of American jurisprudence on religious freedom in the last
   thirty years: the general applicability requirement.},

Abstract = {Scholars have often dismissed the effect of war on state formation in
   regions like Latin America, where mobilization for war is deemed
   insufficiently intense and international conflict fails to out-select
   weaker states. Against this conventional wisdom, I contend that wars can
   affect state-building trajectories in a postwar period through the
   different state institutions that result from victory and defeat. After
   reconsidering the role of war outcomes in classical bellicist theory I
   use difference-in-differences analysis to identify the effect of losing
   vis-a-vis winning a war on levels of state capacity in a panel of Latin
   America (1865-1913). I then illustrate my causal mechanisms in case
   studies of the Paraguayan War (1864-1870) and the War of the Pacific
   (1879-1883) and apply the synthetic control method to these cases.
   Although out-selection of losers obscures the effect of war outcomes in
   European history, Latin America illuminates their long-term
   consequences.},

Abstract = {Not long ago, it was accepted practice to `talk to whomever you need to
   talk to for peace'. Then the idea that you cannot talk to `terrorists'
   took hold. The article explores norm contestation, what happens when
   hard norms interact with softer norm even when they are settled and
   central to mediation practice. The article traces the emergence,
   development and interaction of these two contradictory norms in key
   United Nations documents and discussions since 1945. It also
   triangulates this content analysis with personal interviews with UN
   mediators and perspectives from international non-governmental
   mediators. The article argues that over the last 20 years the embedding
   of proscription regimes in the multilateral system has deeply re-shaped
   fundamental norms underlying mediation such as impartiality, inclusivity
   and the idea that mediators should be able to speak to everyone to
   protect human lives.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with various analyses by Croatian economists of the
   so-called process of transformation and privatization in the 1990s. In
   recent decades, especially since the first multi-party parliamentary
   elections in April 1990, the process of political-economic
   transformation has not only decisively changed the socio-economic
   structure of Croatia, but also influenced the Croatian polit-economic
   thought. By reviewing works by Croatian economists, political economists
   and sociologists, this paper has the ambition to make a contribution to
   a new approach of studying the process of transformation and
   privatization. This paper develops the thesis that the process of
   transformation and privatization was essentially a restoration of
   capitalism through primary accumulation of capital. What is also called
   wild capitalism, cronyism, and even tycoon capitalism - was in fact the
   usual course of the emergence and development of peripheral capitalism.
   Its specific feature is connected with the nation-state which had the
   role of system-maker as well as ruling-classmaker, rather than the other
   way around - that the ruling class had created its own state and
   economic system. At the same time, we reject as simplified various
   conclusions that the transformation and privatization process should
   have been and could have been more just and fair. In the end, one can
   better understand the paradox of Croatia starting the process of
   transformation and privatization as one of the countries with the best
   features and finishing as one of the most unsuccessful examples.},

Abstract = {Political leaders' willingness to use force is central to many
   explanations of foreign policy and interstate conflict. Unfortunately,
   existing indicators typically measure one aspect of this general
   concept, have limited coverage, and/or are not derived independently of
   leaders' participation in interstate conflicts. We develop a strategy
   for constructing measures of leaders' underlying willingness to use
   force with data on their background experiences, political orientations,
   and psychological traits in a Bayesian latent variable framework. Our
   approach produces measures of latent hawkishness for all national
   leaders between 1875 and 2004 that offer advantages over existing
   proxies along multiple dimensions, including construct validity,
   predictive validity, and measurement uncertainty. Importantly, our
   statistical framework allows scholars to build upon our measures by
   incorporating additional data and altering the assumptions underlying
   our models.},

Abstract = {Who governs? This is one of the most fundamental questions in political
   science. Despite its importance, there is currently no global dataset on
   governing elites over a long period. This article presents a novel
   dataset, WhoGov, which contains yearly data on members of cabinets in
   177 countries during the period 1966-2016, making it the largest of its
   kind. We first present how the dataset was created and validate it by
   matching this data against existing data. We then demonstrate how the
   data can be used to gain new insights into diverse fields such as the
   study of autocracies, gender studies, the study of regime types, and
   government formation. We expect that this dataset will be an invaluable
   resource for both comparativists and country experts.},

Abstract = {Spatial analogies are ubiquitous as a concept structuring political
   conversation. Assuming that political parties play an important role in
   shaping the make-up of the political space and that depending on their
   combination of issue emphases they give rise to more or fewer dimensions
   of political competition, this article tests whether party system
   dimensionality leads to a trade-off implied in the relevant literature:
   when parties constrict the political space too much, certain preferences
   may not be represented anymore, leaving citizens dissatisfied with the
   system. At the same time, multidimensional political spaces may become
   too difficult to navigate and leave citizens confused. Results from
   hierarchical regression models (based on European Social Survey and
   manifesto data), however, show that such a trade-off does not exist.
   Higher dimensionality does not confuse voters. At the same time, there
   is evidence that it increases satisfaction with the political system,
   albeit only for the most sophisticated citizens.},

Abstract = {``Dissident minorities{''} are members of marginalized groups who
   dissent from the consensus group position on matters seen as critical to
   their group's collective liberation. This paper articulates the
   distinctive political status-powers, vulnerabilities, and obligations-of
   dissident minorities. Dissident minorities may be especially vulnerable
   to slurs or ostracism as ``self-hating.{''} But they also can wield
   significant public influence by positioning themselves as exceptional
   and exemplary members of their group. Both the powers and
   vulnerabilities of dissident minorities, in turn, converge around the
   prospect of ``tokenization{''}-the use of the dissident minority's
   dissident opinion by majority group actors as a means of discharging a
   stipulated obligation to engage with the minority group writ large.
   While dissident minorities should be free to hold and advocate for their
   divergent positions in public spaces, they retain a distinctive
   obligation to not offer themselves out as adequate replacements for
   engagement with the broader group.},

Journal = {POPULISM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {148-164},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines the discourse of PiS party in Poland as a form of
   biopolitical populism. I view this phenomenon as a specific style of
   political discourse rather than an ideology, that, first, focuses on
   bodily issues, including family and gender policy, sexual behavior,
   etc., second-it is inherently performative and as such it appeals to
   emotions, and, third-it directly communicates with ``people{''} while
   circumventing the existing institutional framework of the state. Based
   on the cases of PiS rhetoric on the Smolensk catastrophe, and its
   narratives on gender and anti-lgbtq issues, I demonstrate how the latter
   could be used for political othering and for subverting the core
   democratic principles. My data includes publications in Polish media and
   on social platforms (Twitter and Facebook), mostly before and after
   elections to European and national parliaments in May and October 2019,
   as well as during the presidential election in spring 2020.},

Abstract = {This article shares the results of a bibliometric analysis of the
   literature on the economic and political relations between China and
   Latin America. This review resulted in the identification of the leading
   research themes, intellectual structure, and main trends in this
   academic field. It also proposes a research agenda for future studies.
   An analysis of 102 documents that included articles, books, and book
   chapters was carried out through a bibliometric analysis and
   bibliographic coupling. The analysis shows that this topic has been
   developed through three stages. The first stage was composed of articles
   that investigated mainly bilateral economic relations. The second
   evaluates a possible negative ``China effect{''} on Latin American
   countries, such as the reprimarization of the Latin American economy,
   the lost market share to China, and the increasing competitive pressures
   on the manufacturing sector. The third stage is an analysis of other
   dimensions, such as the implications of China-Latin America relations as
   part of the evolution of the world order, and Chinese investment as a
   political tool in Latin America. Finally, we found that, despite the
   research progress in these three stages, coverage of the topic is in a
   relatively incipient phase.},

Abstract = {This study explores how and why the citizenries of Japan, Korea, and
   Taiwan engage in deconsolidating the liberal democratic system in which
   they live. For this exploration, the study conceptualizes democratic
   deconsolidation as a two-phase psychological movement and analyses it as
   the realignment of system affiliation. The analysis of the Asian
   Barometer Survey recently conducted in these countries reveals that
   pluralities of their citizenries are psychologically disposed to realign
   themselves with a hybrid or autocratic system. It also reveals that
   democratic learning and socioeconomic modernization, two significant
   influences on democratic consolidation, do little to keep East Asians
   from joining in the deconsolidation movement. These findings suggest
   that the deconsolidation of democracy not be equated with a reversal of
   its consolidation.},

Abstract = {Between public debates about `hacking' elections, so-called `fake news'
   and online disinformation campaigns, it has become hard to imagine what
   free and fair elections in a digital environment could look like. This
   challenge is particularly pronounced for election observers who monitor
   free and fair elections. How should election observers fulfil this task
   when reliable data in online media campaigns are often not even
   available to media regulators? The following article provides a brief
   overview of existing challenges around online content regulation and how
   these apply to elections and election observation. It then considers
   where resources for digital electoral observation exist and how most
   effectively to build on these before, in conclusion, discussing next
   steps and potential opportunities to develop digital election
   observation further.},

Abstract = {This article introduces, describes, and evaluates a program designed to
   broaden the PhD pipeline in political science to achieve greater equity
   and inclusion. In its fifth year, the program brings undergraduate
   students from two Historically Black Colleges and Universities to an R-1
   political science PhD department for a seven-week summer program, in
   which they are paired with a faculty mentor to conduct research for,
   prepare, and present an original research project. Additionally,
   participants attend methods classes, GRE preparatory workshops, subfield
   presentations from graduate students and faculty in the host department,
   and social events. We describe key lessons drawn from our experience in
   piloting this program. We evaluate its success using data about the
   composition of the host institution's PhD program and exit surveys
   conducted with all participants from 2016 to 2018.},

Abstract = {The issue of executive power sharing in democratic countries with a
   monarch as head of state has received little scholarly attention. In
   many ways this make perfect sense; since there is no place for a
   powerful hereditary monarch in a democratic system, one could argue that
   systems with powerful monarchs do not qualify as democracies.
   Nevertheless, there are many examples of political systems, classified
   as democracies by most reputable categorizations or indices, where the
   monarch has, or has had, more or less the same position as a president
   in semi-presidential systems. The aim of the present study is to study
   to what extent the occurrence of semi-constitutional monarchies, i.e.
   democratic regimes in which power is shared between a prime minister and
   a monarch, can be explained by reference to Huntington's notion of the
   King's dilemma and the size of countries. The study is global and
   encompasses the time period 1800-2017.},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Social decisions are often imbued with biases that can lead to
   discrimination against certain groups of people. Racial minorities
   frequently find themselves on the receiving end of such discrimination.
   Recent work also reveals partisan bias such that members of one
   political party unfairly favor their copartisans or discriminate against
   members of the other party. In this article, we use an e-mail
   correspondence study to explore the impact of racial and partisan
   discrimination in higher education. We find no direct evidence of a
   racial or political bias; however, we do find that African Americans who
   reference politics in any way receive substantially fewer responses.
   This coheres with the theory of racial threat: members of a majority
   group are averse to minorities who might threaten their political,
   economic, or social status.},

Abstract = {In keeping with the demands of political philosophers, America's
   constitutional design harnesses elected officials to the mass public's
   prevailing views, but also provides avenues for the opinions of
   disenfranchised groups and numerical minorities to be reflected in
   policy. We seek to shed light on this constitutional balancing act by
   studying U.S. senators' decisions on thirty-six roll call votes related
   to the practice of slavery between 1835 and 1847. These voting decisions
   are modeled using the prevalence of antislavery petitions sent to
   Congress over the same period from each state's residents. We observe
   considerable and systematic senator representation of perceived majority
   opinion on antislavery petitions, despite the presence of
   nineteenth-century institutions buffering senators from the public. We
   also report evidence that the representation of disenfranchised women's
   views (as expressed in petitions) relative to those of men varied by
   party, and in ways that are predictable. Finally, we observe that
   senators sometimes represented perceived minority viewpoints, seemingly
   motivated by their political ambitions. These findings not only hold
   important implications for our understanding of democratic
   representation, but also for the processes of American political
   development.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {This article starts from the observation that most voters know
   relatively little about positions and plans of political parties,
   especially when European Union politics is concerned. One reason for
   this could be that the main sources for political information, party
   communication and mass media coverage, provide voters only little
   concrete information about positions and plans of political parties. We
   ask how concretely, respectively vaguely, political parties and mass
   media communicate political positions prior to the 2014 European
   Parliament elections. We conducted a quantitative content analysis of
   all European Union-related press releases from 46 national political
   parties and of all European Union-related articles of 14 national
   quality newspapers from 7 European countries 12 weeks before the 2014
   European Parliament elections. Our analysis shows that press releases as
   well as media coverage contain more concrete political positions on
   European Union issues than vague political statements. Other than
   expected, newspaper coverage provided the public with less concrete
   information than political actors did. Nevertheless, countries vary with
   regard to the extent to which party communication or newspaper coverage
   contain vague statements. We cannot find empirical support that the
   communication of concrete political positions depends on a party's
   ``extremity{''} of issue position or on the type of issue.},

Abstract = {Covid is a virus which has been dominated by medical experts offering
   different views on its causes and treatments. But the virus has economic
   dimensions which need to be explored. Specifically, trade-offs arise
   between population safety and prosperity. Protecting the population from
   the virus required the economy to be closed leading to job losses, plant
   closures and poverty for some groups in society.},

Title = {A Pandemic of Violence? The Impact of COVID-19 on Conflict},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {This article examines the impact and repercussions of the COVID-19
   pandemic on patterns of armed conflict around the world. It argues that
   there are two main ways in which the pandemic is likely to fuel, rather
   than mitigate, conflict and engender further violence in conflict-prone
   countries: (1) the exacerbating effect of COVID-19 on the underlying
   root causes of conflict and (2) the exploitation of the crisis by
   governments and non-state actors who have used the coronavirus to gain
   political advantage and territorial control. The article uses data
   collected in real-time by the Armed Conflict Location \& Event Data
   Project (ACLED) and the Johns Hopkins University to illustrate the
   unfolding and spatial distribution of conflict events before and during
   the pandemic and combine this with three brief case studies of
   Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Libya. Descriptive evidence shows how levels
   of violence have remained unabated or even escalated during the first
   five months of the pandemic and how COVID-19-related social unrest has
   spread beyond conflict-affected countries.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to reconcile competing positions in an important
   debate about the relationship between regime type and human development.
   We contend that this empirical relationship is contingent upon issues of
   conceptualization and measurement in democracy. First, the relationship
   is more likely to be perceived when democracy is measured in a nuanced
   fashion, taking account of gradations of democracy and autocracy.
   Second, some aspects of democracy - those associated with competitive
   elections - are more strongly associated with human development than
   others. Third, the components of electoral democracy interact in a
   reinforcing manner. Finally, the impact of democracy on human
   development is a distal relationship that depends upon a country's
   entire regime history. Our approach draws on several new datasets that
   interrogate change across a century, enhancing empirical leverage on
   this important question. To measure human development, we employ the
   Gapminder project, covering most sovereign countries from 1900 to 2012.
   To measure democracy, we draw on Varieties of Democracy data, which
   measure democracy in a highly differentiated fashion for most sovereign
   countries from 1900 to the present. An extensive set of analyses offer
   strong corroboration for the argument.},

Abstract = {I examine some political economy aspects of the capital-labor split. In
   a game-theoretic general equilibrium model, rent-seekers attempt to
   appropriate the output of manufacturing firms on the offensive end,
   while such firms safeguard their income on the defensive end. Then the
   presence of imperfect property rights is a breeding ground for social
   conflict and has two indirect consequences. First, it evens out changes
   in the gross (before-social-conflict) labor and capital shares of total
   output that are caused by changes in the aggregate factor endowments,
   leading to more rigid equilibrium factor shares. Second, if social
   conflict is more labor-intensive than manufacturing, weaker property
   rights lead to a larger equilibrium labor share.},

Abstract = {The study of representation is a major research field in quantitative
   political science. Since the early 2000s, it has been accompanied by a
   range of important conceptual innovations by political theorists working
   on the topic. Yet, although many quantitative scholars are familiar with
   the conceptual literature, even the most complex quantitative studies
   eschew engaging with the ``new wave{''} of more sophisticated concepts
   of representation that theorists have developed. We discuss what we take
   to be the main reasons for this gap between theory and empirics, and
   present four novel conceptions of representation that are both sensitive
   to theorists' conceptual impulses and operationalizable for quantitative
   scholars. In doing so, we advance an alternative research agenda on
   representation that moves significantly beyond the status quo of the
   field.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {For developing countries international remittances first started
   exceeding official aid in the mid-1990s and then overtook foreign direct
   investment in 2019, becoming the biggest source of external financing.
   National elections constitute a major source of redistribution of
   political power and policy changes thereafter. However, the effect that
   national elections in the immigrants' host country have on remittance
   transfers has been underexplored by the existing literature. This
   research was intended to bridge this gap. By analyzing the monthly
   remittance flows that entered Mexico between 1995 and 2018, it found a
   cyclical effect of the American presidential electoral process on
   remittance transfers to Mexico. The primary phase of the election, in
   particular, was associated with a greater flow of remittances.
   Interestingly, the effect was not significantly greater in elections
   involving anti-immigrant candidates such as Donald Trump in the 2016
   election. However, it found that remittance flows from the U.S. to
   Mexico have increased significantly during Trump's presidency.},

Abstract = {Until recently, presidential job approval has been positively correlated
   with a healthy economy. Despite pre-COVID-19 sanguine macroeconomic
   indicators, President Donald Trump's job approval numbers appear to be
   quite low relative to those of his predecessors. Using a Bayesian model
   to infer latent presidential approval, we regress approval on consumer
   sentiment, finding strong evidence of a structural break commencing with
   the inauguration of President Barack Obama. We also find that the
   positive associations between presidential approval and consumer
   sentiment have weakened. Finally, we posit that a polarized political
   landscape may contribute to the changing of the meaning of presidential
   approval, which now appears to be a proxy for partisanship.},

Abstract = {Although executives in many democracies have constitutional powers to
   circumvent the majoritarian legislative process to make policy,
   political scientists know relatively little about whether and when
   ordinary people hold executives accountable for the process they use. To
   study this issue beyond the American presidency, we conduct a series of
   large survey experiments in France, where the institution of the
   confidence procedure puts the government in a strong position relative
   to parliament. Our experiments highlight that public evaluations of the
   executive reflect a fundamental trade-off between policy and process. If
   they face significant opposition in the legislative process, executives
   either have to accept policy failure or risk punishment for the use of
   procedural force. People dislike both results, and the average
   popularity gain of using the confidence procedure over not delivering
   the policy is modest. Moreover, in some contexts, executives are
   strictly better off not legislating rather than applying force.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the ``Chinese ownership reforms in 2013{''} as a natural
   experiment to test how increased private ownership affects financial
   leverage, asset quality and profitability of SOEs (state-owned
   enterprises). The PSM-DID model is conducted using the panel data of
   SOEs from 2010 to 2018. Results show that the increased private
   ownership can decrease financial leverage, while increase asset quality
   and profitability of SOEs. Specifically, it affects financial leverage
   negatively in the eastern and the central regions, promotes
   profitability in the eastern region, and the asset quality in the
   western region. Besides, the negative effect on financial leverage and
   positive effect on profitability in the competitive industry is much
   higher as compared to the monopoly industry. Furthermore, an increase in
   private ownership enhances asset quality in the monopoly industry more
   than the competitive industry. The study concludes the positive nexus
   between increased private ownership and corporate performance of SOEs
   which provides an insight for the Chinese government to further
   ownership reforms and for SOEs to improve financial performance.},

Abstract = {We examine the extent to which relevant social identity traits shared
   between two individuals-what we term ``attribute affinity{''}-can
   moderate out-group hostility. We argue that in-group affinity is a
   powerful force in shaping preferences over potential immigrants. We
   focus on two closely related, yet distinct, dimensions of identity:
   religion and religiosity. Using evidence from three surveys that
   included two embedded experiments, we show that sharing strength in
   religious practice can diminish strong aversion to immigrants of
   different religious affiliations. We find that, among highly religious
   U.S. natives, anti-Muslim bias is lower toward very religious Muslims,
   compared to non-religious Muslims. This attenuating effect of attribute
   affinity with respect to religiosity on anti-Muslim bias presents the
   strongest evidence supporting our argument.},

Abstract = {This essay is aimed at illustrating the enduring value of Karl Polanyi's
   institutional approach for contemporary debates on the relationship
   between economics and law, as well as other social sciences. After
   having summarized the main tenets of Polanyi's thought, it contrasts his
   ideas on the economy as an `instituted process' (and related
   assumptions) with the different framework offered by Douglass North's
   economic neo-institutionalism. It argues that the latter suffers from
   the `economistic fallacy' criticized by Polanyi, negatively affecting
   the current dominant discourse on institutions and economic development,
   famously exemplified by the World Banks' Doing Business reports and the
   legal origins thesis. Polanyi's radical critique of systems of thought
   based on the generalization of market economy's conditions is proposed
   as a powerful counter-model, capable of neutralizing the risks of
   colonization of the law and related institutions by economic
   imperialism.},

Abstract = {The The research aims to identify Ecuador's strategic insertion in the
   Drug Trafficking Value Chain. Through qualitative research, remote
   sensing techniques, spatial geographic analysis, semi-structured
   interviews and analysis of information from primary and secondary
   sources, the rise of drug trafficking on the northern border is
   characterized. The study concludes that Ecuador went from being a
   transit country to a country that occupies a privileged position in the
   value chain of drug trafficking. The evidence generated from the
   discovery of 700 hectares of illicit coca leaf crops in Esmeraldas,
   Carchi and Sucumbios, the multiple supply routes from Colombia, as well
   as territorial disputes and the increase in violence from 2015 to 2019,
   make Ecuador an ideal territory for the global economy of organized
   crime.},

Abstract = {At the theoretical level, even if populism and democracy are not
   necessarily antithetical, the former challenges the liberal component of
   democracy, advocating for the majority rule and putting under stress the
   principles of the rule of law. To test the relationship between liberal
   democracy and populism, we created four new questions that measure the
   support for liberal democracy conceived as a trade-off with different
   policies. We tested our battery of questions in a pilot survey with
   educated young voters. The results show that those individuals who
   exhibit lower levels of support for liberal democracy are the ones with
   higher populist attitudes. This might be due to the fact that the
   original battery of questions grasps the level of support for liberal
   democracy better than the standard `Churchillian' question.},

Abstract = {Malaysia's National Front coalition, one of the world's most durable
   authoritarian governments, lost power in national elections held in
   2018. Although incumbent turnover represents a significant step toward
   democratization, the reform of institutions and practices associated
   with political domination by the country's Malay Muslim majority has
   been slowed in the face of challenges from a new configuration of
   opposition forces. The new opposition, which includes UMNO, the former
   dominant party of the National Front, has framed democratic reforms
   initiated by the new government - and the more multiethnic ruling
   government itself - as a threat to the rights of the country's largest
   ethnoreligious community. In turn, the new government, seeking to defuse
   the opposition's electoral threat, and in part propelled to power by its
   commitment to preserve Malay Muslim political domination, has responded
   by maintaining non-democratic institutions and practices. The case
   highlights the extent to which the scope and scale of democratic reform
   are curbed not only by remnants of the former regime but also by newly
   elected governments seeking to maintain their position in power.},

Abstract = {How do voters come to support new political parties? This article
   contends that new types of locally organized, participant-based societal
   organizations-such as neighborhood associations, informal sector unions,
   and indigenous movements-can play a crucial mediating role in securing
   electoral support for new parties. Drawing on social identity and
   self-categorization theory, I argue that endorsements of new parties by
   such organizations sway the vote preferences of organization members and
   people in their larger social networks. A discrete choice experiment,
   presenting voters in Bolivia with campaign posters, demonstrates that
   organizational endorsements are highly effective in mobilizing voters,
   especially when voters face a new party. Endorsements can even
   counteract policy and ethnic differences between candidates and voters.
   The findings suggest an important, understudied route to partisan
   support in new democracies and have important implications for research
   on political accountability.},

Abstract = {While standard histories of Western political thought represent women's
   rights as an offshoot of the earlier movement for the equal rights of
   men, this essay argues that the eighteenth-century push for democracy
   and equal rights was grounded in arguments first used to defend women's
   right to moral and religious self-determination, based on their rational
   and spiritual equality with men. In tandem with the rise of critiques of
   absolute monarchy, ideal marriage, which had previously involved
   lordship and subjection, was transformed into an equal companionate
   relationship based on inclination and affection. The essay argues that
   the transformation, by the time of the American and French revolutions,
   of neo-Roman republicanism-which had been aristocratic and
   oligarchic-into egalitarian, democratic republicanism had been mediated
   by the extension of arguments, widely distributed in the literature
   criticizing the slavery of marriage, into a general critique of slavery
   and support for the equal rights of men.},

Abstract = {What motivated national governments to join the Clean Energy Ministerial
   (CEM), a climate club founded in 2010? And to what extent have the club
   members participated in policy initiatives developed by the CEM? Our
   analysis shows that combinations of (a) the expected benefits of club
   membership and (b) the leadership of the USA induced the governments of
   Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to
   join the CEM. The importance of these two factors varied across
   countries. Participation levels in the CEM's policy initiatives varied
   over time. While this variation happened in a `proportionate' manner for
   Australia, Canada and China, we observed singular instances of
   `disproportionate' changes in levels of policy effort for the UAE and
   Brazil. Overall, our findings suggest that climate clubs constrain the
   behaviour of its members by discouraging them from engaging in sustained
   policy under-reactions.},

   economic order. In fact, institutional contestations among great powers
   includes contested access, multilateralism, and legitimacy, which
   represent dynamic changes rather than linear evolutions. Taking two key
   factors-power and legitimacy-as variables, this article constructs the
   Institutional Contestations Framework (ICF) to describe the conditions
   underlying shifts between different types of institutional
   contestations. The article posits that the driving factor behind the
   increasingly intense China-US institutional contestations since 2016 has
   been a rising China prompting the US to alter its secondary
   institutions, in turn squeezing the policy space for China. The liberal
   international order at the level of primary institutions remains
   attractive. Contested legitimacy between China and the US is optional,
   rather than inevitable.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to scholarship concerning the effects of the UK
   Referendum on EU membership and Brexit on EU citizen rights in the UK
   (Botterill, McCollum and Tyrrell, 2018; Burrell and Schweyher, 2019;
   Gawlewicz and Sotkasiira, 2019; Huber, 2019). The paper focuses on
   applications for, and meanings of, `settled status' among Polish
   nationals living in urban and rural Scotland. In particular we argue
   that the `simple' act of application produces diverse responses among
   Polish nationals, characterised by ambivalent and reluctant compliance,
   with longer term implications for ontological security and sustainable
   communities. In the paper we present empirical data from the
   perspectives of three differently positioned individuals to illustrate
   the heterogenous experience of Polish nationals in Scotland and to
   demonstrate how pre-existing vulnerabilities and conditions are
   compounded by the EU settlement scheme. First, we highlight a view of
   citizenship as `social contract' through the vignette of Marek who
   expresses ambivalence about Brexit and for whom the welfare system
   serves both as a safety net and a space of the undeserving. Second, we
   reflect on the complex bureaucratic process of gaining citizenship for a
   family, through the vignette of Monika. Finally, we consider how form
   filling is an anxious act of validating oneself and questioning one's
   belonging to place with longer term effects on ontological insecurity,
   through the vignette of Weronika. We conclude by offering a set of
   recommendations for Scottish policy on intercultural communication,
   integration and sustainable communities that, in the context of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, is ever more significant.},

Abstract = {Direct democracy (DD) - including initiatives and referendums - is
   increasingly used by citizens and governments to establish new policies
   around the world. Although framed as a tool that benefits citizens, it
   is also common for government actors, including parties, to utilise DD
   in initiating and pushing through new policies. To explain this puzzling
   development, existing research examines the regulative design of DD.
   Going a step further, this article explains how the design of DD
   originates. Using process tracing methodology, I examine the case of
   Mexico - the most recent adopter of DD in 2014 - and illustrate how,
   when, and how DD can be used and modified. I argue that DD is
   endogenous: we cannot conceive of it independently of the political
   forces that generated it. Other prominent cases, such as Uruguay,
   suggest that DD was adopted to pursue party goals or to shape a
   particular government structure. Legislatures certainly provide the
   masses the option of engaging in DD but they do so on their own terms.},

Abstract = {Retrospective voting is a crucial component of democratic
   accountability. A large literature on retrospective voting in the United
   States finds that the president's party is rewarded in presidential
   elections for strong economic performance and punished for weak
   performance. By contrast, there is no clear consensus about whether
   politicians are held accountable for the local economy at other levels
   of government, nor how voters react to the economy in a complex system
   of multilevel responsibility. In this study, we use administrative data
   on county-level economic conditions from 1969 to 2018 and election
   results across multiple levels of government to examine the effect of
   the local economy on elections for local, state, and federal offices in
   the United States. We find that the president's party is held
   accountable for economic performance across nearly all levels of
   government. We also find that incumbents are held accountable for the
   economy in U.S. House and gubernatorial elections. Our findings have
   broad implications for literatures on representation, accountability,
   and elections.},

Abstract = {The fact checking field has grown tremendously in the past decade, as
   has academic interest in the practice, with dozens of studies testing
   the effectiveness of corrections. However, research on fact checking is
   not yet optimised to help fact checkers address the global challenges of
   mis- and disinformation. In this paper, we review the literature on fact
   checking's effects and identify two key gaps. First, we discuss the
   limited diversity and external validity of existing studies, which have
   overwhelmingly been conducted in Western countries and under artificial,
   experimental conditions. Second, we argue that research has narrowly
   focussed on the short-term, corrective effects of individual fact
   checks, largely ignoring the multiple ways fact checkers conceive of
   their impact. Thus, research has overlooked the cultural and systemic
   changes that fact checkers pursue. We conclude by highlighting
   opportunities for further research and for improving communication
   between academics and fact checkers.},

Title = {Theoretically, yes, but also empirically? How the corruption-turnout
   link is marginally explained by civic duty to vote},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Corruption is generally associated with low electoral participation. A
   recurrent explanation of the negative correlation between corruption and
   electoral turnout involves the rational calculus of the costs and
   benefits of voting. More specifically, in a context of high corruption,
   citizens do not vote because they think that doing so will hardly affect
   policy decisions. A number of influential studies has argued that
   corruption affects citizens' electoral engagement in a different and
   more fundamental way as well: It erodes their sense of civic duty to
   vote in elections. Yet, a relation between corruption and civic duty and
   a mediation effect of the attitude remains empirically untested. This
   article examines empirically whether perceived corruption and sense of
   civic duty are correlated, as well as whether civic duty mediates the
   relation between perceived corruption and turnout. It does so with the
   pooled Making Electoral Democracy Work data, as these data contain
   measures on individuals' sense of civic duty to vote in four election
   levels, namely, national, regional, European, and municipal elections,
   as well as on their perception of corruption in each of these government
   levels, and on their participation in these four election levels as
   well. I find a weak relation between perceived corruption and civic
   duty, and a low mediation effect of the attitude (compared with rational
   factors), irrespective of the election level.},

Abstract = {While declining political trust has been given much attention, the
   behavioural implications of declining political trust have not yet been
   investigated extensively and the literature also shows the varying
   effects of political trust on support for extreme and populist parties
   across contexts. This article focuses on the decline of political trust
   in Australia from 1998 to 2016 and its effect on Australian voting
   behaviour. Multinomial logit estimations are performed using
   individual-level survey data from seven Australian federal elections.
   Our study provides evidence that political distrust can unite all
   successful right-wing populist parties and act as a moderating source to
   raise votes for right-wing populist parties in the elections. The study
   further demonstrates that right-wing populist parties can experience
   electoral success beyond mobilising anti-immigration sentiments.},

Abstract = {How does democracy emerge from authoritarian rule? Certain influential
   theories contend that incumbents deliberately choose to share or
   surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to
   fight wars, incentivize governments to provide public goods, outbid
   elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all
   democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate-choice
   arguments may help explain up to about one-third of the cases. In more
   than two-thirds, the evidence suggests that democratization occurred not
   because incumbents chose it but because, while trying to prevent it,
   they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Rather than being
   granted by farsighted elites or forced on them by the rise of new
   classes, democracy appears to have spread most often because of
   incumbents' missteps that triggered previously latent factors.},

   Presidential power. However, little attention has been paid to the role
   that White audiences play in this critical debate. In this article, I
   examine the relationship between Trump, the media, and White audiences.
   Using data taken from the American Trends Panel, I show that affect for
   Trump is conditional on Whites' selective partisan exposure to
   conservative news media. My analysis also shows that exposure to
   political and election news directly from Trump intensifies the
   relationship between Whites' perceptions of media bias and their
   distrust of national news organizations. The findings provide a novel
   and unique contribution to the existing scholarship by demonstrating the
   causal effect of selective exposure to conservative media outlets on
   affect for Trump.},

Abstract = {Recognition theory responds to political exclusion. It provides ways of
   thinking about the tension between universal liberal citizenship and the
   distinctive claims that indigenous peoples make with reference to prior
   occupancy and the universal right to self-determination. However, the
   complex and contested political questions that recognition theory
   examines are not easily answered. In this article, I propose Nancy
   Fraser's participatory parity as a transformative, and not simply
   distributive, approach to recognition, which offers scope for
   substantive indigenous voice in state policy making. I use participatory
   parity to contest arguments that the meaningful recognition of
   indigenous peoples is not possible in liberal democracies like Australia
   and New Zealand. I argue that, instead, participatory parity complements
   the extant authority that indigenous peoples claim over their own
   affairs. This kind of recognition, through differentiated citizenship,
   means that indigenous peoples are simultaneously inside and outside the
   state. Recognition through participatory parity provides a foundation
   for self-determination. However, its full potential and moral
   acceptability to indigenous peoples depend on it being the genuine
   recognition of equals and on its capacity to provide reasons to accept
   the moral legitimacy of the state which may, for many indigenous people,
   be an unrealistic and unreasonable expectation.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Hannah Arendt's controversial essay
   ``Reflections on Little Rock,{''} when situated within her analysis of
   Jewish assimilation, has an astute insight: racial integration and the
   decrease of the racial gaps in material inequality, without taking
   seriously the political project of building a world in common, only
   intensify racism in racist polities. This occurs because attempts to
   extend formal equality to the racially dominated give rise to the rule
   of racial common sense, a result of a clash between the political
   structures of equality and the racial inequality practiced in quotidian
   interracial exchanges occurring in civil society. Though Arendt's work
   on racism echoes criticisms of racial integration leveled by racial
   realist and pessimistic accounts of the Civil Rights struggle, her work
   points to a more expansive practice of ``the political{''} that calls
   for the institutional (re)design of formal politics as an important
   strategy against racism.},

Title = {The All-Affected Principle and the Question of Asymmetry},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {718-728},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As a solution to the boundary problem, the question of who should take
   part in making democratic decisions, the all-affected principle has
   gained widespread support. An unexplored issue in relation to the
   all-affected principle is whether there is an asymmetry between being
   affected negatively and positively. Is it the case that only being
   negatively affected, and not positively affected, by a decision
   generates a claim to inclusion under the all-affected principle? I call
   thisthe question of asymmetry. Some answer the question of asymmetry
   affirmatively. I believe they are wrong and argue, instead, that we must
   answer this question by looking at the reasons underlying the
   all-affected principle. I identify two main reasons that have been
   proposed to underlie the all-affected principle-(1) the opportunity for
   interest protection and (2) self-government-and show why both of them
   entail that answering the question of asymmetry affirmatively is
   unfounded. The upshot is that both being affected negatively and
   positively by a decision should generate a claim to inclusion on the

Abstract = {This article stiches together a conceptual discussion on `humanitarian
   infrastructure' with research amid Venezuelan migrants, asylum seekers,
   army personnel, governmental officers and envoys of humanitarian
   agencies responsible for implementing `Operation Shelter' - described by
   the Brazilian government as a large humanitarian task force offering
   assistance to Venezuelans entering Brazil's province of Roraima. The
   article's goal is to explore the material and normative renderings of
   humanitarian infrastructure that enables migrants' desire to move, while
   also governing and making sense of Venezuelan mobility. We suggest that
   the bureaucratic split of Venezuelans into two temporally different
   migration figures - asylum seeker and humanitarian migrant - is
   illustrative of an ambivalence of enacting control and freedom. We
   explore how such ambivalence is manifested in attempts to discipline
   migrants' bodies and movements along built, technological and logistical
   humanitarian infrastructure, with consequences for engagements between
   border authorities and migrants.},

Title = {The importance of personal vote intentions for the responsiveness of
   legislators: A field experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Individual legislators can be important agents of political
   representation. However, this is contingent upon their responsiveness to
   constituency requests. To study this topic, an increasing number of
   studies use field experiments in which the researcher sends a
   standardized email to legislators on behalf of a constituent. In this
   paper, we report the results of an original field experiment of this
   genre with the members of the GermanBundestag. Supplementing previous
   research, we explore whether constituency requests in which voters
   mention a personal vote intention (rather than a partisan vote
   intention) increase legislators' responsiveness, and how this treatment
   relates to electoral system's incentives. We find that legislators
   treated with a personal vote intention were more likely to respond (67
   per cent) and respond faster than those treated with a partisan vote
   intention (59 per cent). However, we also show that the treatment effect
   is moderated by electoral system incentives: it is larger for
   nominally-elected legislators than for those elected via a party list.
   Our results suggest that electoral system's incentives matter for
   legislators' responsiveness only when constituents explicitly signals an
   intention to cast a personal vote.},

Abstract = {I propose a unified explanation for parties' joint policy and emphasis
   decisions which bridges saliency theory and spatial analyses of party
   campaigns. Party platforms are anchored by the policy preferences of
   activists, core supporters and target voters, leading parties to
   disproportionately emphasize issues where their policies are popular
   with all key constituencies. However, which voters a party targets
   relates to its historical electoral performance ({''}party size{''}).
   Traditionally successful ({''}major{''}) parties emphasize issues where
   the policies preferred by activists and core supporters are generally
   popular, but smaller ({''}minor{''}) parties emphasize issues where
   their preferred policies may be unpopular but are distinctive. Using
   recent European data and various empirical strategies, I show that this
   account has significant explanatory power beyond existing party
   typologies and theories of issue selection.},

   challenge of Euroscepticism in the 2019 European elections},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of a decade of crisis, the 2019 European Parliament
   elections confirmed the results of the 2014 elections as voters turned
   away from the traditional political families to vote for parties with a
   strong message on Europe, including Eurosceptic parties. It further
   evidenced the normalization of Euroscepticism, which has become a stable
   component of European politics. But should one talk of Euroscepticism or
   rather of Euroscepticisms? This contribution focuses on 19 radical right
   and radical left parties, more specifically the parties from Western
   Europe belonging to the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL)
   and the Identity and Democracy (I/D) groups. Through an analysis of the
   electoral manifestos, it analyses how the European Union has been framed
   by the parties and whether we can speak of a `unified Eurosceptic
   narrative'. More specifically, this article concentrates on three issues
   that have been at the heart of the recent crises: the European Union's
   reform and how the regime itself is framed in a post-crisis context, the
   Economic and Monetary Union well as migration and free movement.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the bipolar era, the military activism of several
   Western powers has raised questions about parliamentary control,
   fostering growing research and analyses on the features, drivers and
   consequences of the different kinds of oversight exercised by
   legislative assemblies. Within this scholarly debate, this article
   focuses on the under-studied case of Italy. How did Italian parties vote
   on military operations abroad in the post-Cold War era? In order to
   answer this question, the article presents the first detailed and
   comprehensive set of data on parliamentary votes over the deployment of
   the Italian armed forces in the post-Cold War era (i.e. from the
   beginning of the 1990s to the recent operation against ISIL). Thanks to
   this extensive new empirical material, the article assesses selected
   arguments developed by the literature on political parties and foreign
   policy, paving the way for further research.},

Abstract = {The following article analyses the ideological dimension of Silvio
   Berlusconi's political party Popolo della Liberta (2008-2013). The focus
   on the ideological nature of the PdL is justified because its failure as
   a conservative party is a crucial factor, along with the transformation
   of the political party system in Italy, in understanding the
   metamorphosis of the Italian right between 2008 and 2018. The analysis
   concludes that the demise of the two-party system that characterized the
   Second Republic has contributed to reduce Berlusconi's traditional
   ability to mobilise the anti-left wing electorate through an
   anticommunist discourse.},

Abstract = {Political scientists agree that inequality harms the consolidation of
   democracy, raising fears that the erosion of public support for the
   political regime could lead to political instability, particularly when
   the distributive conflict is reinforced by ethnicity. Focussing on Latin
   America, the region with the world's largest indigenous population and
   most unequal income distribution, this paper analyses to what extend
   socioeconomic inequalities lessen levels of support for the political
   regime, especially among indigenous people. We found-by applying
   multilevel regression analyses to Latinobarometro survey databases for
   the years 2007-2017-that socioeconomic inequalities do affect citizens'
   levels of regime support. However, indigenous people are no less likely
   to be supportive of the political regime than non-indigenous people,
   even in those countries that are more unequal according to the Gini
   coefficient or the poverty rate. Furthermore, indigenous people tend to
   express levels of regime support that are similar to the rest of
   society's inclusive among those of lower socioeconomic status. These
   findings highlight the importance of moving towards a better
   understanding of how indigenous people see the political regime and its
   implications for democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, a contentious debate
   has ensued in the Democratic Party, and in the U.S. left more generally,
   about whether Trump's victory was the result of racist and white
   nationalist appeals or was powered by an economically anxious and
   forgotten white working class left behind by globalization. From a Latin
   American perspective, this U.S. debate about the relative salience of
   race and class is strikingly familiar. After decades of denying the
   existence of racism, Latin America experienced a historic expansion of
   rights for black and indigenous peoples during a ``left turn{''} that
   coincided with the expansion of social welfare policies, quickly
   followed by a ``right turn{''} fueled by racist backlash. Thus, taking a
   hemispheric vantage point reveals that it would be a mistake to believe
   that class appeals alone are sufficient to counter the current politics
   of right-wing racist backlash.},

Abstract = {The objective of the work is to review the implications of the
   implementation of state guardianship policy in the Primorsky territory
   of the Russian Federation. The institution of the family is the most
   important factor for the development of the child's personality; its
   role is constantly growing in the development and education of children.
   Without a doubt, the family is a natural educational environment for a
   child who leaves his mark on his behavior and character. A special place
   in the modern legal system is occupied by the aspect of the right of the
   child and the protection of the interest that is left without the care
   of the parents. Methodologically, use was made of the documentary
   research technique close to legal hermeneutics. It is concluded that the
   guardianship and guardianship bodies perform a series of important
   functions for any civilized state, namely: identification of people who
   need to establish one of the forms of guardianship (adoption); adoption
   of such persons, as well as increased supervision of the guardian, the
   activities of the adoptive parents and of persons authorized by the
   state to care for those who need their help.},

Abstract = {Based on the analytical and synthesis study of a wide range of published
   documentary sources, the article presents the authors' approach to the
   issue of self-restriction of state power. General theoretical aspects,
   historical and oriented to the current state of the problem were
   considered in order to analyze the self-limitation of the authority of
   the State in theory and in concrete reality. Methodologically, it is a
   study that uses in equal conditions the qualitative analysis of the
   systems and processes that emerge from the exercise of the authority of
   the State, with the hermeneutic reading of the legal doctrine that
   accounts for the matter. It is concluded that, in the considered context
   of the Russian Federation, the problem of the constant and continuous
   improvement of the system of separation of state power often seems to
   manifest itself satisfactorily. Theoretically, at first sight, once
   regulated, the corresponding system a priori acquires a constant and
   stable character, however, there is still a long way to go to achieve
   the foundation of a sustained dynamic of self-limitation and
   self-regulation of state power in in line with the principles of the
   rule of law.},

   9.637/1998 and governed by Management Contracts, aim to offer an
   alternative to efficiency, agility, and flexibility in health care. In
   the publicization decision phase, the Public Administration must carry
   out technical and legal studies about the partnership's benefits, with a
   motivated definition about the object of the agreement. In this context,
   the public manager must value the planning stage of these contracts with
   the adoption of his own methodologies, as eventual failures in this
   phase may cause inexplicable results or even a huge waste of public
   money. The provision of services by social organizations is only
   justified when it has proven to be more economical than direct

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Independence of Colombia period from a new
   perspective that goes beyond the tendency that has prevailed in
   traditional historiography of over-dimensioning war, battlefield events,
   and military tactics. The new bet aims, then, to examine this
   emancipation process taking into account its complexity and its scope on
   a regional scale, emphasizing the negotiation and research for peace
   explored during those years. The foregoing implies the review of
   mechanisms through which patriots and those who defended the monarchical
   cause sought these approaches: armistices, capitulations, pardons,
   humanitarian treatment, exchange of prisoners and the peace arrangement,
   conciliation options that, even with all the interferences, allowed to
   save the lives of hundreds of combatants, diminished the effects of
   military confrontation and meant a relief to the population.},

Abstract = {The article presents a subnational examination of democracy in Colombia
   with an adapted index. It provides conceptual and methodological
   elements that help to discuss the national bias. The analysis was
   comparative longitudinal and of democratic institutions, allowing to
   establish similarities and differences in the performance of these,
   which accounts for the quality of democracy. The results show that the
   quality of subnational democracy fluctuates over time and in the
   territory and that three patterns explain the low performance of the
   quality of subnational democracy in Colombia: (1) institutional
   dependencies, associated with a path dependency; (2) determining impact
   of an analysis dimension or (3) an aggregate of low values in the
   analysis dimensions. Finally, a relationship between national elections
   and low quality of democracy at the subnational level in Colombia was
   identified, which leads to questioning the functions of political
   parties.},

Abstract = {How should scholars recognize and respond to the complexities of
   positionality during the research process? Although there has been much
   theorizing on the intersectional and context-dependent nature of
   positionality, there remains a disjuncture between how positionality is
   understood theoretically and how it is applied. Ignoring the dynamism of
   positionality in practice has implications for the research process.
   This article theorizes one means of recognizing and responding to
   positionality in practice: a posture of ``active reflexivity.{''} It
   outlines how we can become actively reflexive by adopting a disposition
   toward both ongoing reflection about our own social location and ongoing
   reflection on our assumptions regarding others' perceptions. We then
   articulate four strategies for doing active reflexivity: recording
   assumptions around positionality; routinizing and systemizing
   reflexivity; bringing other actors into the process; and ``showing our
   work{''} in the publication process.},

   footsteps of Germany. A key roadblock lies in the lack of a deep

Title = {Strong Political Party and Its Social Basis: The Mechanism Analysis of
   the Chinese Communist Party Taking Root in Beijing, 1949-1952},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Based on the archival research, the authors take the experience of
   Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in urban governance (1949-1952) as the
   subject of research and select the city of Beijing as its case study.
   Focusing on the process of the CCP taking root in Beijing, the authors
   attempt to answer the following question: how the CCP achieved effective
   governance and orderly construction in the urban society where its power
   foundation was very weak at that time? The historical archives indicate
   that the CCP's process of taking root in the city from 1949 to 1952
   encompasses three mechanisms: (1) the Growing and Infiltrating
   Mechanism; (2) the Movement Embedding Mechanism; (3) the Interest
   Integrating Mechanism. Based on the analysis of those mechanisms and
   utilizing a Party-center perspective, this article draws inspiration
   from historical archives and argues that the CCP is a Strong Political
   Party. And the authors conclude that the sufficient condition for a
   Strong Political Party lies in three facets: (1) strong organizational
   network; (2) strong social mobilization; (3) strong social support.
   Investigating the CCP's process of taking root in Beijing from 1949 to
   1952 can help us to re-examine the governing logic of the CCP and
   reflect its uniqueness-maintaining independent superpower and gaining a
   consolidated social basis. This paper may provide a new interpretation
   of how the CCP could take root in Beijing, which may enrich our
   understanding of the CCP's nature.},

Abstract = {Do state politicians reward school districts that vote in favor of the
   party in power more than school districts that vote in favor of the
   opposing party? With large shares of money at the state level to
   transfer to local governments and the ability to target core voters, it
   would seem likely that politicians would take advantage of the ability
   to distribute education funds. However, in understanding how states
   distribute education funds, little emphasis is given to partisan
   influences, particularly the congruence between local school districts
   and the state level. To test this, I collected data at the precinct
   level within each state and, using mapping software, spatially joined
   precinct boundaries to school district boundaries. Once this
   relationship was established, I aggregated precinct-level information to
   school districts to understand the partisan voting patterns within each
   school district for elections from 2000 to 2010. This article finds
   evidence that funding formulas are susceptible to political influence
   and that parties are able to influence the geographic distribution of
   education funds to core voters.},

Abstract = {Monitoring is the formal instrument through which the Council of Europe
   imposes social sanctions on its member countries by publicly exposing
   their wrongdoings. As a soft governance tool, monitoring is argued to
   have a limited impact on state policies. Yet, in Turkey, Council of
   Europe monitoring worked to promote pro-democratic change and then
   backfired through the escalation of authoritarian practices. This
   article shows that being subjected to Council of Europe monitoring can
   lead to democratic change if and when its sanctioning requirements fit
   the political agenda of the incumbents and empower them against domestic
   opponents. In the case of misfit, the political costs of aligning with
   the Regional Organisations' sanctions increase for governments at home.
   Yet, as the Turkish case indicates, the outcome has not been inertia but
   rather the reverse as the government used the Council of Europe's social
   sanctions to legitimise its undemocratic measures until it regained
   power in internal political struggles.},

Abstract = {Empirical studies provide increasingly powerful evidence of solidarity
   in Europe, although attitudes and practices vary across States and
   policies, are often conditional and face problems of durability.
   Solidarity is strongest in national or local settings and typically
   manifests political activity, especially in relation to countering
   social inequalities. This article focuses on the implications of these
   findings for the EU, a transnational community seemingly disconnected
   from its citizens and now discussing its future orientation. It is
   argued that the `soft' power of transnational solidarity needs nurturing
   for the EU to enhance its relevance, legitimacy and resilience. Member
   State solidarity and EU institutional design have hitherto proved weak
   in delivering meaningful social measures or in elaborating European
   citizenship beyond market-related paradigms. Any sustainable
   transformative step requires refocusing upon a `horizontal' solidarity
   among citizens across borders to reboot and articulate `social
   integration'. This necessitates reframing the relationship between
   political and legal narratives. The legal paradigm has hitherto favoured
   top-down notions of rights-based EU citizenship over solidarity as a
   principle or standard. This article develops a notion of transnational
   solidarity by connecting the factual potency of solidarity as felt by
   citizens to the underpinning strategies of a resilient governance
   framework to capture it.},

Abstract = {The invasion of Iraq and the subsequent laws of regime change were
   directed at the `purification' of public sector employment. Such
   policies based upon removing transgressors from within the previous
   regime are commonly known as lustration. In Iraq, these were normatively
   presented as a required process for democracy building and victim
   recognition. However, in reality, lustration emerged problematically and
   essentially as a form of counter-insurgency aimed at removing those
   guilty of war crimes but also those opposed to neo-liberalism,
   federalism and the erosion of secularism. The misuse of laws of
   lustration was allied to external design and the relish of the new elite
   to use public resources to attempt state hegemony. Lustration, thus
   emerging as one of the few sites in which the new state could control
   and assert influence even if that led to new grievances and
   ethno-sectarian resentment.},

Abstract = {Using multiple large national surveys, we investigate how the
   relationship between policy-based ideology and vote choice in
   presidential elections differs across demographic groups. Specifically,
   we consider three key demographic characteristics: race, education, and
   gender. We find that large differences exist in the way ideology relates
   to presidential vote for voters from different racial groups. By
   contrast, we find quite small differences in this relationship when
   separating voters by education level. Perhaps most surprisingly, whereas
   men are on average more conservative than women, the relationship
   between ideology and presidential vote is estimated to be almost exactly
   the same for the two genders. The large sample sizes we employ allow for
   relatively precise estimation of these relationships even among our
   various demographic subsamples and these findings hold similarly across
   several recent presidential elections.},

Abstract = {Informed voting is costly: research shows that voters use heuristics
   such as party identification and retrospection to make choices that
   approximate enlightened decision-making. Most of this work, however,
   focuses on high-information races and ignores elections in which these
   cues are often unavailable (e.g. primary, local). In these cases,
   citizens are on their own to search for quality information and evaluate
   it efficiently. To assess how voters navigate this situation, we field
   three survey experiments asking respondents what information they want
   before voting. We evaluate respondents on their ability to both acquire
   and utilize information in a way that improves their chances of voting
   for quality candidates, and how this varies by the sophistication of
   respondents and the offices sought by candidates. We find strong
   evidence that voters use ``deal-breakers{''} to quickly eliminate
   undesirable candidates; however, the politically unsophisticated rely on
   unverifiable, vague, and irrelevant search considerations. Moreover,
   less sophisticated voters also rely on more personalistic
   considerations. The findings suggest that voters' search strategies may
   be ineffective at identifying the best candidates for office, especially
   at the local level.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 disease was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December
   2019, having since spread rapidly across the world. The infection and
   mortality rates of the disease have forced governments to implement a
   wave of public health measures. Depending on the context, these range
   from the implementation of simple hygienic rules to measures such as
   social distancing or lockdowns that cause major disruptions in citizens'
   daily lives. The success of these crucial public health measures rests
   on the public's willingness to comply. However, individual differences
   in following the official public health recommendations for stopping the
   spread of COVID-19 have not yet to our knowledge been assessed. This
   study aims to fill this gap by assessing the sociodemographic and
   psychological correlates of implementing public health recommendations
   that aim to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate these
   associations in the context of France, one of the countries that has
   been most severely affected by the pandemic, and which ended up under a
   nationwide lockdown on March 17. In the next sections we describe our
   theoretical expectations over the associations between
   sociodemographics, personality, ideology, and emotions with abiding by
   the COVID-19 public health measures. We then test these hypotheses using
   data from the French Election Study.},

Abstract = {This article describes the three-branch dynamics of the legislative veto
   before and after the 1983 Supreme Court case Immigration and
   Naturalization Services v. Chadha. This congressional authority had been
   used as a check against executive branch action since the 1850s and
   became more prevalent and controversial in the twentieth century.
   Decades after the Supreme Court invalidated the congressional power to
   use the legislative veto, Congress has found ways to get around the
   judicial ruling. Yet the Chadha precedent fundamentally changed power
   between the branches in many ways. In the years following the Supreme
   Court decision, the precedent was used to invalidate or alter a number
   of important pieces of legislation designed to oversee executive branch
   authority. Congress can still slip legislative veto-like provisions into
   some bills, but Chadha's effect on presidential war and emergency powers
   means Congress must somehow muster large supermajorities to get its way.},

Abstract = {How do active learning environments-by means of simulations-enhance
   political science students' learning outcomes regarding different levels
   of knowledge? This paper examines different UN simulations in political
   science courses to demonstrate their pedagogical value and provide
   empirical evidence for their effectiveness regarding three levels of
   knowledge (factual, procedural and soft skills). Despite comprehensive
   theoretical claims about the positive effects of active learning
   environments on learning outcomes, substantial empirical evidence is
   limited. Here, we focus on simulations to systematically test previous
   claims and demonstrate their pedagogical value. Model United Nations
   (MUNs) have been a popular teaching device in political science. To gain
   comprehensive data about the active learning effects of MUNs, we collect
   data and evaluate three simulations covering the whole range of
   simulation characteristics: a short in-class simulation of the UN
   Security Council, a regional MUN with different committees being
   simulated, and two delegations to the National Model United Nations, for
   which the students prepare for 1 year. Comparative results prove that
   simulations need to address certain characteristics in order to produce
   extensive learning outcomes. Only comprehensive simulations are able to
   achieve all envisioned learning outcomes regarding factual and
   procedural knowledge about the UN and soft skills.},

Abstract = {The article discusses defects of Russian elections, with emphasis on the
   fact that the electoral systems being used favour the regime. The system
   used for registration of candidates and party lists allows the state to
   deny access to strong candidates whose election would inconvenience the
   state bureaucracy. Pro-government candidates are advantaged during
   election campaigns, as segments of the population that are dependent
   upon the state find themselves pressured to participate, sometimes
   including outright control of their vote. Furthermore, many regions
   experience large-scale electoral fraud. The article suggests means to
   overcome these defects, including a comprehensive revision of electoral
   legislation.},

Abstract = {Policy diffusion studies often infer that learning occurs, but
   statistical analyses cannot demonstrate it definitively. The spread of
   medical marijuana offers the opportunity to take a closer look at
   whether policy and political learning occur during diffusion. An
   increasing number of states have adopted medical marijuana policies in
   defiance of federal prohibition and in the space created by federal
   inactivity. Furthermore, early adopting states have adapted their
   programs to account for changes in the industry and to coincide with
   recreational marijuana programs. This article sheds light on how the
   laws have evolved over time due to policy learning, political learning,
   and local adaptation. Specifically, we review how states have
   incorporated best practices from others (policy learning) and how the
   laws have been repackaged in more politically conservative states
   (political learning). Finally, we show how states adapt to medical
   marijuana laws by using precedents from the regulation of other
   industries.},

Abstract = {Ukraine has significantly deepened its relationship with NATO over the
   past 25 years. Kyiv's interest in joining NATO has especially
   intensified since Russia's seizure of Crimea and instigation of conflict
   in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas in 2014. Opinion polls now
   show public support for membership, and many elites regard Alliance
   membership as critical for Ukraine's security. Russia, on the other
   hand, portrays further NATO enlargement to the east as a major threat.
   The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia will affect attitudes
   within NATO toward Ukraine's membership prospects. For the near term,
   Kyiv will have to keep its expectations modest and focus on practical
   cooperation with the Alliance.},

Abstract = {Canonical theories posit that reelection-seeking legislators engage in
   advertising, position taking, and credit claiming, yet empirical studies
   reach largely mixed conclusions about the electoral returns from these
   behaviors. We argue that constituent evaluations are responsive to
   legislators' self-presentations through official communications. By
   emphasizing some components of their records over others, legislators
   prime the considerations constituents use to evaluate them. We present
   evidence from two studies to show how this process shapes partisan
   evaluations of U.S. Senators. In the first, we show that partisanship
   increases in importance for Senators' evaluations when Senators'
   communications place greater emphasis on their policy positions. In the
   second, experimental results confirm the causal effects of elite
   rhetoric and reveal substantially greater partisan differences in
   evaluations of officeholders who highlight their policy positions. Our
   results demonstrate that voters are responsive to how officeholders
   present their records and have important implications for how political
   communication affects democratic representation.},

Title = {The politics of vice-presidential selection in Latin America},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It has become common for presidential candidates in Latin America to
   pick running-mates from outside of their own political parties in the
   form of political independents or politicians from other parties. As
   witnessed in several recent cases, this has added a new dynamic to Latin
   American presidentialism, not least in situations of political crisis.
   Drawing on a new database, the present paper enquires into the factors
   that may lead prospective presidents to select such ``external
   vice-presidents{''}. The findings show that the logics behind selecting
   either a politician from another party or a political independent as
   running-mate differ. While the size of the presidential candidate's own
   party explains the decision to select vice-presidential candidate from
   another party, the choice of an independent is determined by the
   fragmentation of the party system. Furthermore, there is evidence that
   previous experiences of vice-presidential succession makes the selection
   of an independent running-mate more likely, possibly as a attempt to
   guard against challenges to the future presidency. Generally,
   presidential hopefuls tend to pick external running-mates who lack a
   strong political following, which also indicates that electoral logic is
   often mitigated by concern for the stability of the eventual presidency.},

Abstract = {Much work in care ethics and disability studies is concerned with the
   flourishing of human animals as an independent species. As a result, it
   focuses on how the built environments and the social structures that
   produce them restrict and exclude us. This paper addresses this problem
   and provides tentative first steps towards sketching an account of
   ethics that is structured around the interdependent nature of human and
   more than human life. I argue that our embodied existence places us in a
   shared condition of vulnerability with all forms of life on earth. This
   allows us to conceive of caring as an essential condition of the
   sustainability and well-being of social and ecological life systems. To
   this end, I discuss the notion of anthropocentrism - and the attendant
   notion of Anthropocene - and argue that the conception of human
   animality that underwrites it posits a disembodied and homogenous
   `anthropos' that is equally responsible for and equally affected by
   unsustainable social systems. Further, I examine the debate that opposes
   realist and constructivist accounts of nature, and I argue that it is
   inadequate to look at nature through the lenses of the predatory social
   systems that are responsible for ecological injustices in the first
   place.},

Title = {Secular citizens, pious MPs: why German attitudes about genetic testing
   are much more permissive than German laws},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Germany has lifted its total ban on Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis
   (PGD, a form of genetic testing), but the new rules are still much
   stricter than those in other European countries. Results from a
   large-scale survey experiment show that the general population holds
   more permissive views on this bio-ethical question than lawmakers. In a
   country seen as a paradigm for the `religious world' of morality
   politics, many citizens even support further liberalization along the
   lines of legislation in Belgium and the UK. Induced reflection on the
   arguments raised in parliament does not change this: arguments in favour
   of PGD are widely accepted by respondents, whereas many citizens reject
   the arguments against PGD. Citzens' and MPs' respective evaluations are
   affected strongly by religiosity, whose levels in the population are
   much lower than in parliament. Widespread secular views are not
   adequately represented in politics. This does not only concern the
   regulation of PGD but also other current and future bioethical issues.
   It is unlikely that this tension can be resolved through electoral
   politics. These findings have important ramifications not just for
   practical morality politics in Germany and other `religious world'
   countries but also for the two worlds framework itself.},

Abstract = {Australia's policy on foreign investment aims to achieve both the
   liberal goal of maximising capital inflows and the statist one of
   ensuring that those inflows are in `the national interest'. This article
   analyses the tensions between these goals through interviews with
   policymakers who have direct knowledge of the Foreign Investment Review
   Board (FIRB), which has functioned as an `offstage', pre-market
   regulator for capital inflows to Australia. The tensions between these
   policy goals were manageable because the FIRB exercised its powers
   rarely, decisively and quietly, and the government believed that foreign
   investment did not threaten the national interest. The emergence of
   state-owned enterprises as foreign investors, however, significantly
   altered this calculus, and the FIRB has been tasked with assessing the
   national security implications of proposed investments. Instead of
   working offstage, as in earlier decades, the FIRB has become central to
   debates about how Australia should respond to the rise of China.},

Abstract = {A common assumption within the migration ethics literature is that it is
   only states that have the power to admit foreigners to their territory.
   However, this assumption misses something important. While it is true
   that it is states that have the ultimate power to admit, other actors
   can possess a derivative power from the laws that states put in place.
   By establishing a system of work visas, for instance, states lend
   private corporations, and other employers, the power to nominate
   foreigners for admission by making job offers. For many foreigners, a
   job offer is what they require to start a new life in a new country. The
   question then arises how corporations should use this derivative power?
   One might assume that they should use it as they typically do: to pursue
   their business interests and by doing so (we hope) benefit their
   stakeholders including the state and its citizens. However, could there
   not be other reasons, besides profit seeking, to offer refugees a
   visa-conferring job? If hiring refugees does not greatly harm their
   business, it is arguable that corporations could be obliged to use their
   derivative power to do so on humanitarian grounds. Moreover, some
   corporations also seem to be obliged to use this power on grounds of
   corrective justice. This paper advances these possibilities. It has
   three sections. First, I will look at how much discretion corporations
   have in terms of employment and migration laws in some European
   countries. Second, I will present an argument for why corporations are
   morally permitted to facilitate admission for refugees by offering them
   a visa-conferring job. In the final section, I will then defend a
   stronger claim, namely that corporations are possibly obliged to do so
   on humanitarian grounds or on grounds of corrective justice.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Spanish-American War of 1898, the US strategic
   goal was to transform the Mexican Gulf and the Caribbean into an
   `American Mediterranean Sea', to ensure its military and commercial
   hegemony. The opening of the interoceanic canal of Panama, which
   coincided with the outbreak of the Great War, promoted among
   Ibero-American elites the development of a new continental
   pan-nationalism inspired by Hispanism, in combination with an increasing
   and heterogeneous anti-imperialism. Concentrating on the years from 1898
   to 1918, this paper will analyze the influence of those currents on
   Latin American intellectuals as a reaction to the transition from a
   traditional empire -Spain and its overseas colonies- to a new form of
   `imperialism' embodied by the USA.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a network approach to interorganizational
   cooperation in peace operations. It suggests that in addition to key
   organisational characteristics that are already established in the
   literature, such as organisational type, the nature of relationships
   among intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) drives the formation and
   evolution of inter-IGO networks in peace operations. To evaluate my
   hypotheses, I use the temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM).
   The empirical analysis provides evidence that the formation of
   interorganizational networks among IGOs in peace operations is largely
   driven by relational effects, e.g. network effects.},

Abstract = {Arming is puzzling for the same reason war is: it produces outcomes that
   could instead be realized through negotiation, without the costly
   diversion of resources arming entails. Despite this, arms control is
   exceedingly rare historically, so that arming is ubiquitous and its
   costs to humanity are large. We develop and test a theory that explains
   why arming is so common and its control so rare. The main impediment to
   arms control is the need for monitoring that renders a state's arming
   transparent enough to assure its compliance but not so much as to
   threaten its security. We present evidence that this trade-off has
   undermined arms control in three diverse contexts: Iraq's weapons
   programs after the Gulf War, great power competition in arms in the
   interwar period, and superpower military rivalry during the Cold War.
   These arms races account for almost 40\% of all global arming in the
   past two centuries.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to carry out a detailed analysis of the
   functioning of the faculties in Immanuel Kant's Analytic of the sublime
   in order to underline two aspects: firstly, the role of violence in the
   dynamics between sensibility, imagination, understanding and reason as a
   constitutive element of enlightened aesthetico-political subjectivation;
   secondly, the fact that Kant conceives of the relationship between
   different faculties in an eminently political manner, and more
   particularly, that what happens in the phenomenon of the sublime is the
   impossibility of the understanding's legislation over the real. Kant
   saves, however, the subjective sovereignty from the anarchy presented by
   the challenge of the sublime by means of an appeal to reason as a last
   resource that jumps over the expected mediations.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to highlight some distinctive
   epistemological, methodological and axiological guidelines of British
   linguist Norman Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) approach.
   The article seeks to contribute to the development of a materialistic
   linguistics project and for that it relieves the onto-epistemological
   foundations of this version of CDA, its normative - explanatory
   criticism of the relations between language and society, and the weapons
   it offers for the semiotic struggle in contemporary capitalism. In
   addition, a brief analytical exercise is presented in order to highlight
   the strategic and tactical value of the contributions of Norman
   Fairclough to confront the semiotic dimensions of the neoliberal
   ideology and, thus, orient the analytical work towards the
   transformation of degradation conditions of human life that
   neoliberalism has promoted as globalization administration project.
   Finally, some weapons, as means available for attack and defense, are
   discussed in order to develop a materialistic linguistics project that
   challenge the current order and that generate new and better conditions
   for human life in contemporary societies.},

Abstract = {Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is a complex state union composed of two
   entities and three constituent peoples. This fact is a consequence of
   the 1992-95 civil war, which changed the ethnic structure of BiH. From
   the institutional perspective, the two entities were given in Dayton a
   high level of political autonomy. The so-called ``entity veto{''} was
   created in Dayton, and it is implemented by many key political bodies -
   from the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives of the
   Parliamentary Assembly of BiH to the Presidency of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. Beside that, it is argued that BiH lacks the ``internal
   recognition{''} and many of the political actors advocate radical
   constitutional changes which would disrupt or even completely change the
   ``Dayton{''} architecture of BiH. Because of that it is not surprising
   that secessionist rhetoric exists in BiH's political sphere. The
   secessionist rhetoric in the Republic of Srpska (RS) will be analysed in
   this paper and possible secessionist strategy will be described. The aim
   of this paper is to determine whether secessionist arguments, rhetoric
   and possibly politics represent an integral strategy and coherent
   political platform, or whether they are just generated for daily
   political purposes. Authors will also try to determine whether this
   secessionist rhetoric is ``institutionalised{''}, i.e. whether it is
   present in official documents of RS institutions and/or major political
   parties, or just in the activities of social movements and/or individual
   political subjects.},

Abstract = {Public goods in the United States are largely funded and delivered at
   the local level. Local public goods are valuable, but their production
   requires overcoming several collective action problems including
   coordinating supply and minimizing congestion, free-riding, and peer
   effects. Land use regulations, promulgated by local governments, allow
   communities to solve the collective action problems inherent in the
   provision of local public goods and maintenance of property values. A
   consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities
   along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use
   regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve
   racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than
   their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land
   use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits
   to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use
   helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time.
   Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several
   California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive
   of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even
   facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial
   segregation.},

Abstract = {Scholars and the general public have been struck by the norm-shattering
   rhetoric of President Donald J. Trump. His ``rhetorical signature{''} is
   heavy with Manichean good-versus-evil messages, vilification of his
   opponents, and disdain for institutions and for evidence. But many
   politicians vilify their opponents and style themselves as uniquely able
   to solve their society's problems. In fact, Trump's Manichean discourse
   is typical of populist leaders, in the United States and around the
   world. Using text-as-data analysis of campaign rhetoric, we study the
   content and mood of presidential campaign speeches by a range of U.S.
   politicians, which allows a broader perspective not only on the
   uniqueness of Trump's rhetoric, but also its continuities with the
   rhetoric of others. This analysis allows us to define Trump as a
   right-wing populist. Right-wing populists, like left-leaning ones, are
   anti-elitist and Manichean in words and outlook. However, the two
   versions of populism differ in the nature of the anti-elitism, with
   right-wing populists targeting political elites and left-wing ones
   targeting economic elites. Right-wing populists also define the
   ``other{''} as ethnic out-groups, who threaten the ethnically pure
   ``people.{''}},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {In this article we investigate the electoral decline of the Flemish
   social democratic party sp.a by analysing the intraparty (in)congruence
   in opinion structure using a unique pooled dataset that contains party
   elites, members and voters in Flanders-Belgium. We combine two
   complementary approaches on incongruence: attitudinal and ideological
   congruence. A hypothesis derived from post-Marxism is formulated in
   terms of attitudinal congruence and tested using pairwise means
   comparisons, while hypotheses from cleavage theory are formulated in
   terms of ideological incongruence and tested empirically using Latent
   Class Analysis. Results show that party elites predominantly adhere to a
   left-universalistic ideology while left-particularists have left the
   party en masse, confirming the realignment thesis of cleavage theory and
   rejecting expectations from post-Marxist theory. We conclude that
   Flemish social democracy's left-universalistic elites have largely lost
   connection with their left-particularistic base while managing an
   insufficient appeal among (centre-)left-universalistic middle class
   voters.},

Abstract = {There has been a proliferating literature on postcapitalist and
   post-work futures in recent years, underpinned by policy proposals like
   the basic income and a reduction in working hours. It has gained
   increasing uptake within left electoral politics and policy making. The
   generational potency of these ideas require that we understand their
   theoretical roots. This article considers the interplay between the work
   of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri and the new postcapitalism
   exemplified by the likes of Paul Mason and Aaron Bastani, as well as its
   relationship with intellectual currents around Corbynism and the wider
   contemporary left. Through a discussion of their latest book, Assembly,
   it will be seen that Hardt and Negri both inform, and are increasingly
   informed by, the postcapitalist and post-work thinking popular on the
   left today-in particular at its `posthumanist' fringes. However, this
   recent work is characterised by a series of tactical redirections that,
   rather than indicating renewal, reflect the potential collapse of this
   utopian framework for the future in the face of a rapidly unravelling
   global political context. Whilst the determinist understanding of social
   transformation cannot permit these setbacks, this shines a light on more
   general shifts in left strategy and analysis.},

Abstract = {Every electoral cycle, thousands of canvassers knock on doors to
   encourage strangers to vote. Many volunteers come from communities with
   low levels of participation. Scholars have yet to explore how community
   organizations recruit and sustain their canvassing teams. This article
   explores that process using an in-depth study of canvasser training and
   administration by two grassroots community organizations in California
   in November 2014. We argue that these trainings and collective
   interactions should be conceptualized as educational spaces utilizing
   pedagogies that are designed to enhance canvassers' sense of political
   efficacy and empowerment. Consistent with the critical pedagogy
   literature, we find that an effective pedagogy within these contexts
   must be tailored to the canvasser population and need to help canvassers
   establish and maintain a sense of collective purpose over time and
   provide the scaffolding for both. We contend this direct action is a
   form of emancipatory learning that allows participating canvassers to
   relearn their position of power vis-a-vis the polity and gain a more
   profound sense of political purpose and empowerment. We highlight an
   area of civic engagement not often seen as a learning environment and
   offer two avenues for future research in this novel context.},

Abstract = {Existing research has argued that terrorism is common in civil war
   because it is ``effective.{''} Surprisingly, however, only some groups
   use terrorism during civil wars, while many refrain altogether. We also
   see considerable variation in the use of terrorism over time. This
   article presents a theory of terrorism as a mobilization strategy in
   civil war, taking into account benefits, costs, and temporal dynamics.
   We argue that the choice and the timing of terrorism arise from the
   interaction between conditions for effective mobilization and
   battlefield dynamics. Terrorism can mobilize support when it provokes
   indiscriminate government repression or when it radicalizes rebels'
   constituency by antagonizing specific societal groups. The timing of
   attacks, however, is influenced by battlefield losses, which increase
   rebels' need to rally civilian support. The analyses of new
   disaggregated data on rebels' terrorist attacks during conflicts
   (1989-2009) and of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) tactics in
   Iraq and Syria support our theoretical argument.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of representation at the national and state levels have
   provided evidence that elected officials' votes, political parties'
   platforms, and enacted policy choices are more responsive to the
   preferences of the affluent, while those with average incomes and the
   poor have little or no impact on the political process. Yet, this
   research on the dominance of the affluent has overlooked key partisan
   differences in the electorate. In this era of hyperpartisanship, we
   argue that representation occurs through the party system, and we test
   whether taking this reality into account changes the story of policy
   dominance by the rich. We combine data on public preferences and state
   party positions to test for income bias in parties' representation of
   their own co-partisans. The results show an interesting pattern in which
   underrepresentation of the poor is driven by Democratic parties pushing
   the more liberal social policy stances of rich Democrats and Republican
   parties reflecting the particularly conservative economic policy
   preferences of rich Republicans. Thus, we have ample evidence that the
   wealthy, more often than not, do call the shots, but that the degree to
   which this disproportionate party responsiveness produces less
   representative policies depends on the party in power and the policy
   dimension being considered. We conclude by linking this pattern of
   influence and ``coincidental representation{''} to familiar changes
   which define the transformation of the New Deal party system.},

Abstract = {This study examines popular perceptions about the ruling state on the
   Chinese Internet before and along the state's project of `online public
   opinion guidance.' We chose two historical moments from 2011 and 2016,
   and systematically captured and analysed massive amounts of speech
   traces on Weibo that contain the term tizhi, a discursively flexible,
   yet distinctive, concept onto which sentiments related to the state are
   projected. Combining semantic network clustering and critical discourse
   analysis, our analyses have revealed, historically and macroscopically,
   the relative dominance of differing ways of evaluating regime legitimacy
   on the Chinese Internet. Among other things, the previously dominant
   legitimacy-challenging imaginary grounded in (Western) democratic
   references has imploded and become absorbed by a nationalist,
   `civilizational competition' discourse that enhances regime legitimacy.
   Additionally, the legitimacy-criticizing imaginary within the
   party-state's `reform framework' has become depoliticized into
   administration-focused compartments. By exploring the `regime
   imaginaries' held by ordinary people, this study complements the
   scholarship on Chinese state legitimacy that predominantly focuses on
   historico-structural analyses, policy initiatives, or the party elite's
   normative justifications. It also makes methodological and conceptual
   advances for researching the complex cultural frames, political tropes,
   and repertoires of local references that comprise regime imaginaries.},

Abstract = {This article argues that opposition veto power in institutional arenas
   such as second chambers can foster a more consensual relationship
   between government and opposition parties in parliament. This
   theoretical claim is supported in the article using data on legislative
   voting behaviour in the German Bundestag. The statistical analysis shows
   that opposition and government parties are much more likely to vote the
   same way, if the opposition controls a majority in the second chamber
   and this chamber enjoys veto power. This pattern holds even when
   controlling for policy-area specific ideological distances between
   government and opposition parties and electoral signalling incentives.
   The article's findings suggest that government and opposition parties
   seek compromises early in the legislative process and that bicameral
   conflicts are often already resolved in the lower chamber. The results
   here support theoretical arguments on the absorption of institutional
   veto players and challenge the frequent claim that opposition veto power
   leads to more competitive behaviour and gridlock.},

Abstract = {By focusing on visible minority women in Germany, this article
   contributes to an emerging field of intersectional research on political
   representation. Research on minority women's access to politics is still
   limited despite Germany's sizable immigrant population. To fill this
   gap, this article provides recent data on the descriptive representation
   of visible minority women at both the federal and state level.
   Furthermore, it seeks to explain differences in political
   representation, primarily why the representation of minority women at
   the federal level and in some states is better than that of minority
   men, while in other states it is the reverse. Since traditional
   institutional explanations, such as gender quotas and electoral systems,
   provide only part of the solution to this intersectional puzzle, this
   article argues that informal practices of individual party elites need
   to be considered. Qualitative interviews with visible minority women in
   German politics suggest that some party elites actively promote minority
   women, while others overlook or even discriminate against them,
   contributing an additional explanation of why minority women's access to
   politics is easier in some cases than in others.},

Abstract = {Trump's Department of Homeland Security implemented the Zero Tolerance
   policy from April 6 to June 24, 2018. Refugees, prevented from crossing
   the midpoints of bridges by Customs and Border Protection agents,
   crossed the Rio Grande to ask for asylum, were denied, and forced to
   cross at places deemed illegal by law. This resulted in misdemeanor
   violations for unlawful entry and fleeing immigration checkpoints. The
   policy initiative centered on the separation of children from their
   migrant parents-refugees fleeing from the northern triangle countries:
   El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Adult migrants were sent to
   prisons and holding facilities, brought before a magistrate to plead
   guilty, and were deported while their children were placed in
   government-funded privately-owned detention centers. Migrants contend
   with a security apparatus comprised of border walls, zones of
   surveillance, agents, and paramilitary troops. This article analyzes the
   United States (in)security system using Baudrillard's concept of
   simulacrum supplemented by Foucault's dispositif and Agamben's
   apparatuses.},

Abstract = {Debates over controversial articles often highlight important issues
   regarding academic freedom, transparency, and how to handle
   disagreements in publishing. I argue that a response outlining criticism
   is generally a more productive course of action than calling for
   retraction. However, there are a number of constraints that impede
   meaningful debates, and a problematic divergence between our common
   ideals of open research and free debate and the actual practices that we
   see in academic publishing, where our current practices often undermine
   transparency, replication, and scientific debate. I argue that research
   can benefit from more explicit recognition of politics and preferences
   in how we evaluate research as well greater opportunities for
   post-publication debate. The successful initiatives to promote data
   replicability over the past decade provide useful lessons for what
   improved post-publication transparency may look like.},

   Attempted Coup},

Abstract = {The attempted coup of July 16, 2016 caught many observers of Turkey by
   surprise. It was either hoped or believed that the age of military
   intervention was over. After all, hadn't Turkey's military been
   politically pacified following EU-centered reforms and after waves of
   resignations and indictments of top officers resulting from allegations
   of deep-state conspiracies against the government? We argue the
   contrary; in Turkey, the armed forces remained a political actor and had
   failed to professionalize. In addition, the Turkish military were
   plagued by in-fighting and factionalism, most notably officers aligned
   to the Gulen movement. These two factors, factionalism and
   unprofessionalism, were the main reasons why Turkey experienced yet
   another attempted coup. Such a state of affairs highlights Turkey's
   seemingly perpetual crisis in its civil-military relations, a
   significant obstacle on the road to democratization and a lesson to
   other countries with histories of military interference in the political
   process.},

Abstract = {Despite growing awareness of the American state's active role in the
   early nineteenth century, scholars have tended to ignore the early
   republic's public health apparatus. The few studies that do chronicle
   antebellum health initiatives confine themselves to programs intended to
   directly reward citizens-and particularly those who contributed
   politically or economically to the nation's founding and expansion. As
   this detailed study of the Indian Vaccination Act of 1832 makes clear,
   however, antebellum policymakers saw value in providing medical care to
   those outside their settler citizenry. Blending liberal, republican, and
   ascriptive ideas, the vaccination program joined two competing political
   logics: one emphasizing the humanity of indigenous people and the
   importance of providing for their welfare, and the other prioritizing
   the state's interest in an efficient ``removal{''} process. Evidencing
   far more autonomy and administrative capacity than the average
   nineteenth-century bureaucracy, the War Department played a pivotal role
   in petitioning Congress for, and ultimately administering, the
   vaccination program. Unwilling to cede regulatory power over indigenous
   health to more proximate local governments or private parties, the War
   Department preferred its own military manpower-a decision that would
   profoundly shape the design and reception of subsequent Native health
   programs.},

Abstract = {This study is the most comprehensive analysis of the election of black
   state legislators in the American South. We start with the election of
   Leroy Johnson to the Georgia Senate in 1962, the first African American
   to win a state legislative seat in the modern South. We also document
   the election of all subsequent African Americans who were the first to
   enter their southern state legislative chambers. Next, we assess the
   factors influencing the election of southern black state legislators
   from the 1970s through 2015. Because of notable long-term changes to the
   southern electorate and alterations in the racial composition of
   legislative districts, there has been substantial variation in the
   likelihood of electing black lawmakers. Our final analysis highlights
   the undeniable reality and broader significance that the increasing
   share of southern African American state legislators has occurred at the
   same time that Republican representation has grown at a greater rate.},

Abstract = {Most political scientists studying representation adopt some version of
   Hanna Pitkin's definition of representation as ``making present what is
   absent.{''} Their emphasis is on the ``making present{''}-that is, on
   how representatives gain access, voice, and decision-making authority.
   Although presence is an essential component of representation,
   understanding and properly evaluating representation requires attending
   not only to how representation makes groups present but also to how it
   makes groups absent. In particular, it is important to differentiate the
   various kinds of absences that constitute representation. To that end,
   this paper offers a typology of political absence. It identifies three
   relevant divisions within absence (and presence) and distinguishes
   strategic absences from involuntary ones. Such theoretical distinctions
   are central to any general theory of representation that can adequately
   account for how representatives make and further claims by choosing to
   be absent from representative processes, and explicate the democratic
   costs and benefits of such absences.},

Abstract = {The growing research on post-industrial labor market inequality bears a
   strong-yet widely misunderstood-relevance for the literature on
   electoral realignment. In this contribution, I contend that the
   assumption of ``labor market outsiders{''} being equal to
   ``globalization/modernization losers{''} is largely mistaken. Rather,
   atypical work and unemployment is most widespread among service workers,
   whose primary electoral choice is to abstain from voting. This implies
   that the ongoing reconfiguration of European party systems-through the
   rise of right-wing populist parties-is driven by skilled and routine
   workers in the manufacturing sector (the traditional ``insiders{''}).
   Hence, the rise of right-wing populist parties reflects a political
   mobilization of the formerly well-protected industrial working class,
   rather than of labor market outsiders.},

Abstract = {Researchers and practitioners increasingly want to learn from one
   another and work together to solve problems. This article presents
   results from a new evidence-based approach for connecting them, called
   Research Impact Through Matchmaking (RITM). This method leverages
   research on organizational diversity to initiate new relationships
   between diverse people. The article describes the method and presents
   data from 37 new connections between practitioners working at nonprofits
   and social scientists. To my knowledge, this is the first dataset
   describing reasons why a large variety of nonprofit practitioners value
   social science research. I also document the impact of these matches.
   Overall, this article provides actionable guidance for those who want to
   initiate their own new connections (i.e., match themselves) and/or to
   broker new connections between others.},

Abstract = {Violence and insecurity in Latin America is a claim for the
   commissioning of ``mano dura{''} policies. Despite its popularity, those
   policies have shown low effectiveness. In fact, they are usually the
   path to the breakdown of the Rule of Law and to the repression of
   vulnerable groups. Actually, those groups are doubly victimized by one
   hand because of their difficult socio-economic condition and by the
   other hand because of violent government action. This paper, analyses
   four cases, in four Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, Colombia
   and Guatemala through the lenses of ``violent pluralism{''} approach.
   The objective is to provide evidence for a theoretical approach based on
   the relationship between state and violence versus those approaches that
   consider violence as a malfunction of state.},

Abstract = {Ryan Carlin and Timothy Hellwig challenge our claim that voters
   misattribute responsibility for economic performance in low-savings
   commodity-exporting (LSCE) countries of Latin America. They argue that
   we overlook incumbents' capacity to choose ``policy regimes{''} that
   signal to voters their level of control the economy. They also claim
   that LSCE membership should be allowed to vary over time and that, even
   then, the concept is not useful to distinguish the impact of exogenous
   conditions on political outcomes. This article demonstrates that several
   implications of Carlin and Hellwig's alternative theory are not
   supported by the evidence, that their measure of policy regimes is
   endogenous to international conditions, and that even considering
   variation over time, Latin American countries remain clustered into the
   two original categories we proposed. We finish by showing that exogenous
   conditions affect presidential popularity in other LSCE countries and
   that the deviating case of Chile only reinforces our theory.},

Abstract = {Elections are an important source of regime legitimation across
   sub-Saharan Africa, but they are increasingly being held amidst climates
   of fear, tension, and threat of ensuing violence. This article explores
   these climates of fear, arguing that they are, in part, a political
   construction; the result of strategic efforts to frame elections as a
   threat to peace and security, in order to legitimize tactics that tilt
   the playing field and intimidate political opposition. The article draws
   upon three diverse cases - the 2015 elections in Tanzania, and the 2016
   polls in Zambia and Uganda - to explore the use of securitization
   discourses as a strategy of electoral manipulation. It argues that in
   these cases, the language of security was used to justify the
   construction of a ``militarized{''} environment, and restrictions upon
   the freedoms of assembly and expression. Whilst these served to create a
   highly uneven electoral playing field, they were nevertheless tolerated
   by key stakeholders in the process.},

Abstract = {The European Union increasingly uses `soft' international arrangements
   rather than formal international agreements in establishing relations
   with non-EU states. This contribution aims to raise the question of to
   what extent a move from hard to soft law in relations between the EU and
   its partners can be seen as allowing the Union to `step outside' the
   legal framework (if that indeed is what is happening) and disregard the
   rules and principles that define the way in which EU external relations
   are to take shape. Possible consequences include the risk that these
   instruments are not subject to appropriate safeguards, that
   parliamentary influence (by the European Parliament as well as by
   national parliaments) is by-passed and that transparency is affected.
   There are various reasons for the EU not to use formal procedures, but a
   turn to informality does come at a price.},

Abstract = {Popular consent is an essential element for success and stability of
   democracies. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that ``electoral
   winners{''} (i.e. voters casting a ballot for government parties) are
   more satisfied with democracy than supporters of the opposition parties.
   However, little is known about the dynamics of satisfaction during the
   electoral cycle: Do winners become happier and losers even more
   discontent over time? We approach this question by utilizing an
   interview date in the European Social Survey (rounds 1-8) to position
   individuals within the different stages of electoral cycle. The results
   based on 199,207 responses from 199 surveys in 31 countries suggest that
   satisfaction with democracy stays relatively stable during the electoral
   cycle across various electoral systems if the political development is
   predictable. However, if actions of the parties are uncertain, namely
   the alternations of governments tend to be frequent, partial, and opened
   to all parties, and hence neither winners nor losers know how steady
   their status is with respect to the political development in the
   country, their satisfaction tend to fluctuate over time. Therefore, the
   conclusion reached is the more stable West European democracies have
   limited generalizability to the low-predictable systems in Central and
   Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {Large cities are cosmopolitan environments where people embrace
   inter-national connections whereas small towns, villages, and the
   countryside are more likely to prioritize the maintenance of national
   traditions. These geographic divides are at the center of contemporary
   politics but we do not know why they exist. One possibility is that
   cities make people more cosmopolitan while smaller areas make people
   less cosmopolitan. However, credibly measuring geographic effects is
   difficult because people sort across geography in ways that are
   correlated with political attitudes. I address these methodological
   challenges with longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel. My
   central result is that evidence of contextual effects is limited and
   unlikely to account for the broad geographic divides. Instead, sorting
   is likely to be the most important explanation for spatial polarization
   over cosmopolitanism. These findings have several implications for our
   understanding of geographic divides.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence is promising and there are
   more and more applications and programmes which, based on said AI, offer
   efficient solutions for carrying out all kinds of tasks. Public
   administration, with the final objective of contributing to appropriate
   consolidation of an intelligent administration which can continue to be
   efficient, personalised, electronic and a guarantee of citizenship
   rights, is progressively incorporating this technology in public
   services. These intelligent tools have a great capacity for improving
   the provision of public services, to the extent that they can process
   natural language or analyse high quantities of data in order to help in
   making public decisions, among other functions. This new administration,
   together with this potential of great improvements in administrative
   activity, is accompanied at the same time by a series of risks with a
   clear legal and ethical dimension. As a result, the required
   technological progress for the improvement of public services can come
   into conflict with legal security, with basic rights such as equality at
   the present time, privacy or the protection of personal data, or with
   the principles or obligations of administrative conduct; for example,
   the obligation of motivation, transparency or the efficiency of defence
   or appeal law, as it will not always be possible to know the reason for
   the results given by some forms of artificial intelligence. Among other
   regulatory challenges that need to be addressed from the point of view
   of administrative law, it is possible to highlight in its principal aims
   the range of transparency (algorithmical), the suitable motivation for
   decisions assisted by artificial intelligences, and responsibility in
   the event of damages occasioned by following or by not being aware of
   the results provided by algorism.},

Abstract = {A crucial imperative for decolonial praxis in the liberal settler colony
   is to radically delegitimise the prevailing social order. This is
   regarded as necessary to achieving genuinely decolonial forms of social
   transformation rather than merely the ongoing modification of colonial
   rule. I propose here, however, that such objectives depend not simply on
   delegitimising the colonial regime as such, but also on finding ways to
   expose and challenge its resources of legitimating power, that is, the
   capacity to shape and reshape perceptions of legitimacy in the public
   sphere, and thus render legitimacy a moving rather than static target
   for opponents. I explore, here, the potential for a basic democratic
   grammar of contestation to be utilised in this task. The promise of such
   a grammar lies in its permanent availability to problematise rule
   arranging powers in the public sphere, and thus work to expose their
   unjustified nature. It also carries a threat, however, in that its
   public activation always arouses a broader array of normative forces,
   some aspects of which might oppose or undermine decolonial objectives.
   Whilst the democratic grammar holds promise for challenging liberal
   legitimating power, then, it must also be treated with caution from a
   decolonial perspective.},

Abstract = {While a relatively large body of literature has explored the conditions
   that might promote either reform or the status quo in multinational
   federations, few studies have explored majority attitudes toward
   minority nations in the context of multinational federations. In this
   article, we ask what factors account for majority attitudes toward
   minority nations in multinational federations. In making use of data
   from the 2011 Canadian election study (CES), we explore both attitudes
   toward Quebec in general and the willingness to do more for Quebec,
   which we refer to respectively as ``affective attitudes{''} and ``policy
   attitudes.{''} Our findings demonstrate the key role played by
   generalized prejudice and perceptions of how one's province is treated
   in the Canadian federation in structuring both sets of attitudes. The
   impact of Canadian identity, on the other hand, is more limited.
   Meanwhile, conservative ideological predispositions are a predictor of
   policy attitudes but not affective attitudes.},

Abstract = {Japan's upper house, the House of Councillors, is a less powerful body
   than the House of Representatives, the lower house of the national Diet.
   Yet, electoral results of the upper house can have a significant impact
   on the government of the day, both for legislative purposes and for
   judging the credibility of the ruling party and its leader. This article
   analyses the July 2019 election and its likely impact on the Abe
   administration, and implications for Japan's parliamentary democracy and
   party politics. The article argues that opposition forces are highly
   fragmented and weak, sustaining the LDP's dominance in Japanese
   politics. Such a political landscape is welcomed by the ruling party and
   its leader, but continuing to entrench the hold on national governance
   by one dominant party is unhealthy for Japanese democracy.},

Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2020},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {34-58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper is about contextualizing Heidegger's thought and his
   relationship with Nazism within the framework of the conservative
   revolution, reactionary modernism and the ideology of war of his time.
   As well as collecting his criticisms of Liberalism, Americanism and
   Bol-shevism within the general framework of his criticisms of modernity.
   The conclusion is that the only revolution that Heidegger advocated was
   the National Socialist in tune and continuation with the conservative
   revolution of the anti-democratic German intellectual elites of the
   1920s whose influence was received and amplified by our author. This
   makes it very problematic to look to Heidegger for inspiration for
   today's left. The few useful things that it would have, such as its
   critique of modernity, some ecologist glimpse and the highlighting of
   the sacred as something unmanipulable, based on reactionary, ruralist
   and mystical positions, are difficult to translate into the language of
   the left. All of the above does not prevent us from considering that
   Heidegger is an author that we must continue reading but without
   con-sidering him the panacea for the ills that afflict us today.},

Abstract = {This article examines the early stage of the Northern Ireland conflict
   from the beginning of the ethno-nationalist conflict called the Troubles
   of 1969 to the beginning of the `peace process' through the Downing
   Street Declaration of 1993 by focusing on a process of political,
   non-violent resolution efforts of political agents, which affected the
   route of the conflict. It utilises conflict resolution approaches to
   determine the variables with regards to the perceptions, positions, and
   decisions of conflicting parties, which provide an understanding of
   their role in peacemaking during the high-intensity conflict.
   Particularly, it offers three major aspects for analysis: inter-party
   collaboration, popular support, and interchangeability between armed and
   political struggle. It uses rich data from archival documents to analyse
   the influence of early peace efforts to de-escalate the conflict and
   establish foundations for peace prior to official negotiations. It
   argues that peace efforts do not consist of official negotiations in the
   1990s. The article finds that they had been initiated long before
   multilateral negotiations through political conferences, direct and
   indirect dialogues between major political parties in Northern Ireland,
   and the British and Irish governments. However, the reluctance of
   political agents towards peace prevented making progress towards peace.},

Abstract = {Celebrity humanitarianism has been transformed in its scope, scale, and
   organization in the last thirty years. Its flourishing has generated
   considerable academic interest from a wide variety of disciplines that
   share two characteristics. First, these studies are-unusually-well
   connected, which means that different disciplines have not tended to
   develop their own separate literatures, but learn from each other's
   approaches. This makes it useful and important to identify ways
   different disciplinary approaches can complement each other. Second,
   most of this attention has focused on politics of celebrity
   humanitarianism in the global North. Yet focusing also on the South and
   on North/South relations will move the field forward. We argue that
   celebrity humanitarianism must be interpreted through the broader
   systems of which it is a part. We offer a heuristic typology of
   celebrity humanitarianism that continues to bridge between different
   disciplines and which identifies ways in which political science can
   complement existing studies. We also use this typology to refocus work
   on the politics of celebrity humanitarian relations away from merely
   Northern politics. This approach allows us to identify what sorts of
   politics and political solutions are being advocated by current forms of
   celebrity humanitarianism.},

Abstract = {Presidentialism has been widely studied in Latin America. Nonetheless,
   its impact on the policy making remains largely unexplored. This article
   analyzes the role and influence played by ministries and informal rules
   in the case of Chilean childhood policy reform (2014-2018), elaborated
   in a presidential system with a fairly institutionalized center of
   government. The methodological approach is mainly based on a set of
   in-depth interviews. The results show that in a first moment informal
   rules overlap formal ones whereas in a second moment there is a
   decoupling between formal institutions and informal rules, with
   Ministries playing a larger role. The conclusion is reached that the
   relation between formal and informal institutions is not static, but it
   responds to dynamic balances of power. Therefore, article aims to
   reflect on the role of informal rules to understand public policy-making
   in presidential regimes, as well as the need for discussing alternatives
   to institutionalize the center of government.},

Abstract = {In the field of public policies studies, there has lately emerged a
   growing interest in analyzing why and how public policy change. The aim
   of this article is to study the change of water and sanitation public
   policy in Ecuador between 2008 and 2015, in order to explain the main
   causes of its transformation and its consequences. To this aim, the
   ideational model (Kisby, 2007) of policy networks is used at three
   levels: context, network and policy results. The hypothesis held here is
   that policy instruments change due to the external intervention of the
   President of the Republic which, in turn, reorganizes the policy
   context, network structure and resources of the decision-making process.
   Policy change based on the direct intervention of a political authority
   can thus cancel the consensus within the policy networks, transform the
   decision-making process, change the policy instruments and replace the
   actors' programmatic beliefs (Marsh and Smith, 2000).},

Title = {Why are African American Governors and US Senators so Rare? Exploring
   White Voters' Responses to African American Statewide Candidates},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {285-304},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite making notable gains at the local level, very few African
   Americans have been elected to the high-profile statewide offices of
   governor or U.S. senator. Previous research offers little systematic
   evidence on the role of racial prejudice in the campaigns of African
   Americans trying to reach these offices for the first time. In this
   paper, I introduce a new data set designed to test whether African
   American candidates for these offices are penalized due to their race.
   Comparing all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000
   to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same
   state for the same office around the same time, I find that white
   challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about
   13 percentage points more support among white voters. These estimates
   hold when controlling for a number of potential confounding factors and
   when employing several statistical matching estimators. The results
   conflict with earlier studies that focus on a single gubernatorial
   contest or elections at the U.S. House level.},

Abstract = {The middle class is an important engine of political development and
   social change, but their political attitudes and values are mostly
   unclear in the Internet era. The author found that the use of modern
   information technology does not have a significant impact on Chinese and
   Japanese middle classes' trust in their national and local governments.
   However, the impact of technology on the middle classes' pride in their
   government system, and the wish to live under their current political
   system vary wildly between China and Japan. Modern information
   technology significantly reduces the Chinese middle class's pride in
   their government and their wish to live under the current political
   system, but it does not have the same impact on Japanese middle class.
   These findings provide effective guidance and references for the
   improvement of national image. Based on ROC (relative operating
   characteristics) curve analysis, the logistic regression model presents
   a good fitting effect.},

Abstract = {Public organizations are subject to many kinds of control mechanisms and
   analysts worry that they often suffer from an ``accountability
   overload.{''} This article argues that such diagnoses are typically set
   without an adequate demarcation criterion for identifying accountability
   practices and separating them from other kinds of interaction, such as
   strategic pursuit of power or reputational standing. In response, the
   suggestion is that accountability practices should be restricted to
   procedures that track the mandate of the organization. This requires
   clarification of how mandates can be seen as more than a mere heap of
   conflicting considerations. The concept of a ``multidimensional
   mandate{''} is introduced as a heuristic for thinking about how
   different perspectives on organizational action can be integrated. The
   interpretive test for deciding if a procedure qualifies as an
   accountability practice is whether it is sufficiently sensitive to the
   intertwinement of the goals and commitments of the organization. Neither
   account-givers nor account-holders can legitimately refrain from
   orienting themselves in this broader normative framework.},

Abstract = {Recent research documents that voters infer that governing coalition
   partners share similar ideologies, independently of these parties'
   actual policy statements. We argue that citizens estimate party
   positions from more general forms of interparty cooperation and
   conflict, particularly near the times of national elections. We analyze
   tens of thousands of media reports on elite interactions from 13 Western
   democracies between 2001 and 2014, and show that-controlling for
   coalition arrangements and for the policy tones of parties' election
   manifestos-voters infer greater left-right agreement between pairs of
   parties that have more cooperative public relationships, but that this
   ``cooperation effect{''} is only evident near the times of national
   elections. Our findings have implications for parties' policy images and
   for mass-elite linkages.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I take issue with Peter Balint's recent account of the
   value of toleration as an instrument for securing freedom-maximising
   outcomes in pluralistic societies. In particular, I question the extent
   to which the ideal of toleration can be entirely reduced to someone's
   intentional withholding of negative interference whose value lies in the
   protection of individual negative freedoms. I argue that couching the
   value of toleration entirely in these freedom-maximising terms fails to
   do justice to the relational value of toleration. To see this value, we
   must also have in sight the drastic changes that appeals to toleration
   make to the nature of what goes on between the tolerator and the
   tolerated, not only to the state of affairs that is created by their
   relation.},

Abstract = {The outcome of the 2019 general election-a resounding Conservative
   majority and an unprecedented defeat for Labour-delivered a decisive
   electoral verdict for the first time in recent years following a period
   where British politics has been characterised by instability and
   indecision. In this article, we draw on aggregate-level data to conduct
   an initial exploration of the vote. What was the impact of Brexit on the
   2019 general election result? How far has Brexit reshaped electoral
   politics? Was 2019 a `realignment election'? And, if so, what are the
   implications? With a focus on England and Wales we show that, although
   the Conservatives made gains deep into Labour's working class
   heartlands, these gains have been a long time coming, reflected in
   Labour's weakening relationship with working class Britain. As such,
   2019 is not a critical election but a continuation of longer-term trends
   of dealignment and realignment in British politics.},

Abstract = {The current debate on populism is mostly Euro-American centric. Less
   attention is paid to how the rise of populist ideas echo and reverberate
   in other regions of the world. This paper examines how the core concepts
   to populism, namely `the people', `the elite' and `the other', is
   constructed and contested in China. I show how the netizens
   contextualise the rise of populist right in America in relation to
   China, and how they construct a narrative of `must learn lessons' for
   China out of the American experience, with identifiable populist
   elements. I argue that although non-establishment populist leaders or
   parties are unlikely to emerge under the one Party rule, the grassroot
   political narratives in China harbour significant latent populist
   tendencies, and the potential for populist rupture is real.},

Abstract = {Hybrid regimes have consolidated on the back of techniques that balance
   strong regime structures with tokenistic pluralism. This democratic
   veneer is performed through pseudo markers of democracy such as weak
   political parties and semi-competitive elections, which aim to ratify
   regime legitimacy. How public opinion polling fits into authoritarian
   landscapes, however, is an aspect of hybrid regimes that remains less
   understood. Scholars of public opinion research in democracies believe
   that polling can contribute to constructing the world around it,
   prompting this paper to examine whether public opinion research - and
   pre-election polling in particular - contributes to the democratic
   veneer in hybrid regimes by constructing a perception of participatory
   democracy. It examines the nature and quality of pre-election polling
   undertaken in authoritarian Iran in the lead-up to the 2017 presidential
   election in order to make preliminary observations about the potential
   impact of polling on a regime's pluralist credentials. It finds that
   while most polls were poor quality, no polling in an authoritarian
   environment is benign because the very process of asking citizens their
   opinions and publicizing responses creates an impression that individual
   opinions count, in an environment where the opposite is often true.},

Abstract = {Is President Donald Trump an outlier among presidents in the ways in
   which he meets with the press? Using comparative data for Presidents
   Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack
   Obama, and Trump, this article looks at how similar and different Trump
   is compared to his recent predecessors. While at one time presidents
   answered reporters' queries in presidential press conferences, today
   presidents have more opportunities to meet the press. All six presidents
   studied used three basic forums: press conferences, informal
   question-and-answer sessions, and interviews. They did so in ways
   consistent with their presidential goals and in settings in which they
   felt comfortable. In their first 32 months, all recent presidents
   employed strategies similar to ones that brought each to the presidency
   and then most found additional resources for communicating with the
   public. Except for President Trump, Presidents Reagan through Obama did
   so with relatively stable White House leadership teams and coordinated
   communications organizational structures. In this way as well as in
   significant others, the five previous presidents had more in common with
   one another than they did with President Trump.},

Abstract = {Fact-checking and warnings of misinformation are increasingly salient
   and prevalent components of modern news media and political
   communications. While many warnings about political misinformation are
   valid and enable people to reject misleading information, the quality
   and validity of misinformation warnings can vary widely. Replicating and
   extending research from the fields of social cognition and forensic
   psychology, we find evidence that valid retrospective warnings of
   misleading news can help individuals discard erroneous information,
   although the corrections are weak. However, when informative news is
   wrongly labeled as inaccurate, these false warnings reduce the news'
   credibility. Invalid misinformation warnings taint the truth, lead
   individuals to discard authentic information, and impede political
   memory. As only a few studies on the tainted truth effect exist, our
   research helps to illuminate the less explored dark side of
   misinformation warnings. Our findings suggest general warnings of
   misinformation should be avoided as indiscriminate use can reduce the
   credibility of valid news sources and lead individuals to discard useful
   information.},

Title = {Competing Architects: Applying Social Contextualist Analysis to
   Negotiations on the African Peace and Security Architecture},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 FEB 1},
Abstract = {Social contextualist analysis, by contrast to much of the existing
   research on international negotiations, emphasizes the social and
   organizational environment in which negotiations take place and the
   effect that it can have on the decision-making of participants. This
   paper applies a social contextualist lens to negotiations held to decide
   upon the form and function of the African Peace and Security
   Architecture (APSA). Certain elements of the Architecture, which is one
   of the central pillars of the African Union (AU), present something of a
   puzzle for theorists, given the cession of sovereignty they represent on
   a continent where leaders have traditionally been very protective of
   their authority. After illustrating the limited value of the most
   prominent approaches to negotiation analysis, the social contextualist
   framework is outlined. The analysis incorporates negotiations held to
   decide upon a number of features of APSA. Its findings rest upon
   interviews conducted with representatives from AU member states and AU
   officials, as well as examination of a broad range of primary and
   secondary documents. In highlighting the significance of factors that
   are generally overlooked by traditional approaches, a case is made for
   greater consideration of social contextual factors in analysis of
   international negotiations.},

Abstract = {Which social characteristics of voters reduce the chances to waste a
   vote? Surprisingly, little is known about the commonalities and
   differences of citizens who do (not) make their vote count. In this
   article, we argue that levels of education and income, gender and age
   shape the likelihood to waste a vote through two channels: the voting
   motivation and the ability to correctly assess the viability of
   candidates. Drawing on data from the Comparative Study of Electoral
   Systems, we analyse voting behaviour in six elections in Great Britain,
   Germany and France between 2005 and 2015. Our analyses demonstrate that
   holding a university degree is not related to effective voting.
   Differences in cognitive capacities as a consequence of formal education
   are hence not decisive for voters' ability to assess candidates'
   viability correctly. Instead, our results show that many of those
   wasting their ballots are male and young voters who tend to knowingly
   decide to support candidates unlikely to win. Overall, these findings
   shed light on wasted votes as one of the factors that might balance and
   reinforce existing social inequalities in the political process.},

   evaluations},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Motivated partly by descriptive representation concerns, political
   scientists have become increasingly interested in voters' preferences
   over the social class of their representatives. Whereas existing
   research focuses mainly on preferences concerning politicians' own
   immediate class markers, we argue that voters may also care about
   politician class roots - the social class of the household in which a
   politician grew up. Drawing on conjoint experiments fielded in Austria,
   Germany, and Britain, we show that in the latter two cases voters do
   care about class roots, displaying an average preference for politicians
   with more humble class roots. In followup experiments testing different
   explanations for this preference we find little evidence that voters
   treat humble roots as a signal of social mobility and therefore
   politician quality. Rather, preferences over class roots appear to be
   driven by class affinity biases. Our findings have implications for
   debates concerning the descriptive underrepresentation of the working
   classes.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have engaged extensively with the empirical findings
   of the Easterlin-paradox. However, any statement regarding the meaning
   and implications of the paradox are derived only through the mediation
   of normative assumptions. The paper renders these assumptions explicit
   (and, therefore, open for political discussion), a necessary step in
   legitimizing the Easterlin paradox as a compass for politics. Based on
   the analysis of the assumptions lurking behind the common implications
   of the paradox, the paper opens the door to alternative implications of
   the paradox. Thus, it refers to other normative assumptions that combine
   together the assumptions discussed - and is therefore regarded as
   pluralist in essence - and singles out one particular strong variant -
   the `dual necessity' variant. This strong assumption, invariably
   overlooked in the literature, is defined here and its significant
   political implications for the Easterlin paradox illustrated.},

Abstract = {I argue social and political freedom is not primarily about the absence
   of constraints, whether those constraints be in the form of interference
   or domination. Instead, social freedom is centrally about what makes us
   free. That is, the question of social freedom is first and foremost
   about determining the positive preconditions of being a free person
   within society. Social freedom is about what I call the social bases of
   freedom, or those features of our social world that we have a reason to
   rely on in making plans or going about our business.},

Abstract = {In a recent article, Behnke provided a critical assessment of our
   proposal to use electoral responsiveness as a criterion in the
   evaluation of options to reform the German mixed-member electoral
   system. Our measure, the disproportionality parameter of the generalized
   cube law, supposedly contradicts the normative criteria used in the
   concept of electoral responsiveness. In this article, we first of all
   reject Behnke's core critical point: by means of a mathematical proof we
   show that the most elementary criteria of responsiveness formulated by
   Behnke are compatible only with proportional representation. Second, we
   argue that Behnke's focus on the mechanical transformation of votes into
   seats curtails our argument for strengthening the majority vote
   component because it neglects the empirical finding that the majority
   vote is more responsive to perceived differences in performance between
   the parties.},

Abstract = {The disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991 was a pivotal challenge in U.S.
   foreign policy during the early 1990s. Specifically, ethnic cleansing in
   Bosnia proved to be a particularly contentious issue across two
   presidential administrations. Even as both Presidents Bush and Clinton
   recognised the humanitarian atrocities - initially, neither was willing
   to use military force in response, fearing any U.S. intervention would
   lead to a Vietnam-like quagmire. Yet, following the massacre at
   Srebrenica in 1995, Clinton's position changed, favouring decisive
   action. Given that during this time, the U.S. remained a great power and
   enjoyed relative stability in coalitional arrangements - what explains
   this variation in policy? To explain this variation, I build on
   discursive institutionalist approaches, which distinguish between
   different types of ideas, offering two mechanisms - normative
   displacement and cognitive repression - by which agents come to
   interpret interests in more principled, or cognitively-laden ways,
   leading to variation absent systemic or ideational shifts.},

Abstract = {This article ismotivated by one central question: when do we say that
   representation has been achieved well, and how can we be wrong? In
   asking this question I am interested in finding the norm internal to
   political representation. My assumption is that the norm of
   representation is discernible through how we speak about representation,
   and indeed how we speak when we represent. In other words, I propose a
   foundationalist norm. The argument will first spell out what is meant by
   a norm and then present a constructivist account of representation that
   a foundationalist normative approach must address. I then argue, using
   Cora Diamond's writings on ethics and Viveiros de Castro's ontology,
   that the norm of representation is tied to articulating someone's life,
   to evoking them, or more precisely to making it absolutely transparent
   that someone has a life.1 My argument is that representing well is
   fundamentally tied to engaging the moral imagination in the sympathetic
   exercise of understanding another embodied perspective. I spend some
   time expanding on this, what I call evocative representation. I show how
   a foundationalist account of when we say that representation has been
   achieved well gives us grounds for judging the merits of any particular
   representation. Although what is normative of representation gives
   grounds for judgingwell accomplished representative processes, it does
   not insulate us against misrepresentation; indeed, misrepresenting is a
   possibility internal to representation; a failure of themoral
   imagination being written into its very nature.},

Abstract = {Extant research suggests that candidate selection methods can be
   consequential for party unity in legislative voting. Yet thus far, only
   variations in the selectorate and the degree of centralization have been
   examined. This article argues that Candidacy Eligibility Criteria (CEC),
   too, have implications for party unity. I theorize that with stricter
   formal requirements, parties avoid adverse selection and ensure the
   nomination of committed candidates. By using roll-call vote data from 16
   industrial democracies, candidate surveys and an original data set
   consisting of nearly 500 historical party constitutions, I show that
   parties demanding prior membership and nudging aspirants to maintain
   networks within the party tend to be more unified in parliamentary
   voting. Moreover, their candidates, too, express greater loyalty when
   compared with parties without formal CEC. Thus, this article contributes
   to the literatures on party unity and on candidate selection by showing
   how certain party rules, hitherto neglected, affect party unity.},

Abstract = {Are proponents of Islamic government in the Arab World more likely to
   support violent extremist groups like ISIS? Previous research indicates
   that the answer to this question is dependent on individuals' beliefs
   about what constitutes proper Islamic government. In this study I
   theorize that individuals' beliefs about the compatibility of Islamic
   government and democracy is a key predictor of support for armed groups
   like ISIS. Using 2017 survey data from six Arab countries I find that
   `nondemocratic Islamists' - those who favor the implementation of
   Shari'a law and clerical rule but believe Islam to be incompatible with
   democratic principles - are significantly more likely to express support
   for ISIS. In contrast `democratic Islamists' - those who view Islamic
   Government to be congruent with democratic rule - are not more likely to
   endorse ISIS goals or tactics. These findings underscore the conditional
   and complex nature of the relationship between Islamism and violent
   extremism.},

   expectations, and its countermove of `reversing cover'. I acknowledge,
   along with Ghosh, that both the demands to `cover' and `reverse cover'
   are problematic from the perspective of LGBT+ authenticity. I aim to
   show, however, that such acts of covering, and reversing cover, are
   borne from complex social relations that involve (often conflicting)
   expectations, self-identifications, and modes of being treated as. This
   social structure of what it is to be `gay' may help explain, not only
   why such demands to cover, and reverse cover, are problematic, but also
   why, in the world we live in, the harm and oppression of the two demands
   are very different.},

Abstract = {Maintaining an active research agenda while teaching full-time at a
   community college can be daunting, but with institutional support for
   scholarly research by way of course release it is possible. This
   personal reflection offers up evidence of institutional support from a
   variety of sources within the public university system of New York City,
   the City University of New York (CUNY), including that from LaGuardia
   Community College itself, senior colleges, NEH Grants, and contractually
   mandated course release by the faculty and staff union, PSC-CUNY. This
   reflection does not offer a comprehensive account of the working
   conditions of community colleges across the United States in general. I
   close my reflection with a brief description of how teaching at
   LaGuardia Community College has transformed by teaching and research
   from disciplinary to interdisciplinary. I also thank APSA's Committee on
   the Status of Community Colleges in the Profession for including and
   highlighting community college political science professors'
   contributions as an important part of the national organization.},

   the structure of the international political system. The author
   concludes that the present structure of the international political
   system is gradually transforming. Its basic elements are eclectic
   because the process of transformation is uneven and incomplete.
   Moreover, the nature of relations between the main actors undergoes
   fundamental changes. The global arena tends to experience a heating
   confrontation against the background of increased ties within clusters

Abstract = {Most studies of technocratic populism have focused on democracies under
   stress (e.g., Italy, Czech Republic). This article builds on and extends
   these studies by analyzing a hybrid regime-post-Soviet Georgia-and
   argues that technocratic populism in this context is utilized as a
   facade to cover authoritarian and oligarchic tendencies, while
   suspending (or reversing) democratization efforts. The state apparatus
   is weaponized against current and potential political opponents.
   Ideology is irrelevant, loyalty is key, and passivity is encouraged. The
   government aims to chip away at institutional checks and balances, and
   to demobilize the public by undermining confidence in the country's
   representative institutions while increasing dependence on experienced
   personalities, the `can do experts.' The result is most often a stable
   partial-reform equilibrium. We illustrate this argument with evidence
   from Georgia, where Bidzina Ivanishvili, the richest man in the country,
   came to power in 2012 and, despite not holding any official position in
   the government since 2013, has run the state as a firm.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the genesis of the first journals of European
   studies in France, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the United
   Kingdom, from 1950 to 1993. The aim is to test the comparative
   hypothesis that the knowledge produced about European integration was
   more permeated by political discourses in the United Kingdom than on the
   continent. In the long term, this would have contributed to the
   increased politicization of the discourse about the European Communities
   in the UK. I show here that the three journals studied were constructed
   as hybrid places between science, practice and politics. In this
   respect, the hypothesis of a British specificity is only partially
   confirmed. More than a clear-cut opposition between science, practice
   and politics, it is therefore the various modalities of their
   articulation that this study invites us to examine.},

Abstract = {Open list proportional representation (PR) systems require that
   candidates seek personal votes in order to be successful. This feature
   of the system is considered to lead to intense competition among
   co-partisans and, ultimately, to weak electoral and legislative parties,
   narrow public policies, localism, clientelism, and corruption. We
   examine the distribution of personal votes among candidates from the
   same party for seven elections to the Brazilian national chamber of
   deputies (1990-2014). These elections are widely seen as
   hyper-competitive, particularly among candidates from the same list.
   Yet, the patterns in the data are not compatible with such a view. We
   find that the level of overall competition is considerably lower than
   the absolute number of parties and candidates competing would suggest.
   More significantly, we find that the number of viable candidates within
   party lists is limited and that their votes are distributed in such a
   way that indicates a contained competition among co-partisans during the
   election. These findings add to recent work that builds a more nuanced
   view of ballot structure, competition, and personalism.},

Abstract = {Prior international political economy public opinion research has
   primarily examined how economic and socio-cultural factors shape
   individuals' views on the flows of goods, people and capital. This
   research has largely ignored whether individuals also care about
   rewarding or punishing foreign countries for their policies on these
   issues. We tested this possibility by administering a series of conjoint
   and traditional survey experiments in the United States and China that
   examined how reciprocity influences opposition to foreign acquisitions
   of domestic companies. We find that reciprocity is an important
   determinant of public opinion on the regulation of foreign investments.
   This suggests the need to consider the policies that other countries
   adopt when trying to explain public attitudes toward global economic
   integration.},

Abstract = {Between 2014 and 2017, the Islamic State maintained vibrant communities
   on a range of social media platforms. Due to aggressive account and
   content takedown policies by the major platforms, these visible
   communities are now almost non-existent. Following the March 2019
   Christchurch attack, the question as to why major platforms cannot rout
   the extreme right in the same way has repeatedly arisen. In this
   article, Maura Conway explores why this is not as straightforward as it
   may seem.},

Abstract = {Italy represents an exceptional case in comparative perspective as far
   as its electoral system is concerned. Since the restoration of democracy
   after the Second World War to the present, up to six different electoral
   laws have been passed for the Chamber of Deputies. Moreover, during the
   so-called Second Italian Republic, the country has witnessed four
   electoral systems: Mattarellum (1993), Porcellum (2005), Italicum (2015)
   and Rosatellum (2017). This paper aims to summarize the electoral
   reforms that took place in Italy. Thus, this contribution sheds light on
   the different types of electoral systems used at the Italian national
   level and its effects, and discusses what have been the most relevant
   characteristics of their reform processes as well. The main conclusions
   highlight that the electoral reform processes have been different from
   each other, fitting one of them in the elite-mass interaction type and
   others in the elite-majority imposition one. In addition, against what
   had been usual in this issue, this paper stress the crucial role played
   by the Italian Constitutional Court as the main triggering actor of
   electoral reforms in its judgments 1/2014 and 35/2017.},

Abstract = {This article studies Los tragicos dias in Mas afuera (1931). Written
   testimony in relation to the political imprisonment of its author in the
   context of Carlos Ibanez del Campo's dictatorship (1927-1931). The
   reading perspective is focused on the strategies of resistance deployed
   by the political prisoners in the penal colony Mas afuera in order to
   counteract the negative effects related to their captivity. We have
   analysed, the communication opportunities promoted by these prisoners in
   order to counteract the loneliness and the lack of information. Our
   critic reading is based on the postulates of sociologist Emilio de
   Ipola. This analysis perspective suggests that the political prisoners
   decode the signs of the penal environment in order to preserve the
   physical and moral integrity of those who are confined in a space of
   horror and deterioration.},

Abstract = {This article presents the research results of the reconstruction of the
   case that took place in 2006 in the Montebonito district, municipality
   of Marulanda, department of Caldas. The objectives of such
   reconstruction were to describe what happened and to consider some of
   the consequences for the inhabitants, the police and their families. The
   study was framed in a qualitative paradigm, with a case study approach.
   The events that occurred as well as some testimonies of the wounded,
   some inhabitants of the township, relatives and friends of the deceased
   were reconstructed. Likewise, assets and other personal resources
   destroyed, along with social and institutional damages were reported on
   the part of those affected. The affectations of the surviving uniformed
   officers are also raised, as well as those suffered by the families of
   the deceased, from the psychological, physical and economic aspects.},

Abstract = {Ten years after the Arab uprisings, China's role in the Middle East and

   of offshore balancing to weaken US influence in that region without,
   however, making evident attempts to establish its own sphere of
   influence. They analyse China's approach to Libya, Syria and Iran and
   draw important conclusions for how to understand China's approach to
   regional crises, and regional and extra-regional actors.},

Abstract = {Among the Russian Germans who have arrived in Germany since the 1990s,
   there are also Mennonites. They have an intense common life. Religion
   and a strong sense of community are at the same time resources and

   values and expectations of the community can become a source of tension
   when they collide with worldly norms and ideals. In each case, the issue
   is identity and belonging to a group.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates how official hegemonic narratives of armed
   conflicts and history are resisted by academics by generating
   counter-narratives and how this affects the public perception of
   identity conflicts. Due to the relatively high status of academics,
   critical and alternative knowledge production serve as a tool for
   resistance against the mainstream narrative. In the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict, we discuss competing narratives, and how new narratives by
   various academics challenge the official narrative. In the case of
   Rwanda where the resistance is more clandestine, we demonstrate how the
   official narrative is challenged by academics and individuals based
   outside the country. In the case of Sri Lanka, we highlight how two
   dominant narratives, one by the government and the other by the rebels,
   competed with the counter-narratives. Overall, we demonstrate how
   counter-narratives construed to serve as a form of resistance are
   unfolding in various struggles, and how the gradual impact of academics'
   agencies on changing hegemonic narratives finds a contextual definition.},

Abstract = {In recent years, authors from the social sciences have been arguing that
   it is necessary to pay more attention to objects, because not only
   humans act, so do materials. Taking the example of the wet wipe, I will
   explore how materials can act and what relationships are relevant. To do
   this, I will mobilize two cases, that of the doekje, the wet wipe in
   Holland, and that of ``the wet wipe monster{''} (the obstruction of a
   Valencia sewage collector by a jam formed by wet wipes and grease). The
   case of the wet wipe makes visible that objects do never act alone, they
   are always in the practices that surround them (in this case practices
   that have to do with hygiene, care, poop, infrastructure and management
   of fecal waste). It is not that the objects have agency on humans, but
   that the assemblies of wet wipes and other waste objects belong to
   concrete practices (in this case what we do with our poop) reminding us
   that in the context of environmental crisis it is urgent to think about
   the material-semiotic effects of things, not just of the agency of
   things in themselves. The lesson would be to learn to live with the
   material abundance of the Anthropocene in a better way, rather than
   defending that objects have agency.},

Abstract = {Since the discovery of oil in Bunyoro sub-region, land-related conflicts
   have grown rapidly. Traditional conflict resolution capacities, which
   were already in a state of disrepair, have been side-lined and the court
   system has been overwhelmed. Given this context, the objective of this
   research was to enhance the capacity of local peacebuilders to help
   resolve land conflicts in their communities. The research was based on
   an action research approach which involved three phases - exploring the
   issue, planning and implementing an intervention and evaluating the
   short-term outcomes. In the exploration phase, data was collected using
   focus group discussions with community members and in-depth interviews
   with key informants. In the intervention phase, an action team was
   formed to help resolve land-related conflicts in their communities,
   using traditional conflict resolution approaches. The short-term
   outcomes show that local peacebuilding capacities were enhanced and that
   many land-related conflicts were resolved using traditional conflict
   resolution approaches.},

Abstract = {Although many scholarly works have already been devoted to the influence
   of Internet technologies and social media on protest activity, their
   impact on the intensity of terrorist attacks has not yet been studied.
   To fill the gap, N.Khokhlov and A.Korotayev analyzed the relationship
   between the spread of the Internet and the number of terrorist attacks.
   The authors hypothesized that an increase in the number of Internet
   users in autocracies should be positively related to the intensity of
   terrorist attacks - this is because when political regime controls
   media, it is the Internet that opens up opportunities for the rapid and
   wide dissemination of information about terrorist attacks. In countries
   with democratic or hybrid regimes, where at least part of the media
   operates relatively freely, such connection should be absent. To test
   the hypothesis, the authors employed negative binomial regression
   models. The data were taken from the Global Terrorism Database and the
   World Bank database.
   The study conducted by the authors partially confirmed their main
   hypothesis. The analysis of the empirical data showed that in
   autocracies the spread of the Internet indeed positively affects growth
   of the intensity of terrorist attacks, while in countries with
   democratic and hybrid political regimes such relationship is not
   significant. At the same time, the obtained results do not allow us to
   state that the revealed differences stem from the variation in the media
   environment under different types of political regimes. Testing this
   hypothesis requires further research and refinement of the research
   methods, in particular, shifting the focus to the level of individual
   regions, as well as studying causal mechanisms using mixed methods and
   Bayesian statistics.},

Abstract = {This chapter highlights some of the weaknesses of shoehorning ``new{''}
   elections into a model designed to demonstrate differences between
   national and European elections. It argues that using the terminology of
   first- and second-order elections is problematic given the new elections
   introduced to Britain over the last two decades. Rather than relying
   upon such terminology, it outlines how a more holistic classification of
   elections may be achieved and argues that in order to achieve this we
   should broaden our analysis of groups involved from simply voters to
   include political parties and the media. As well as offering a new
   method for understanding British elections, it argues that rather than
   distinguishing between firstand second-order a more accurate
   classification would differentiate elections based on geography-between
   national and subnational elections.},

Abstract = {Despite prohibitions and attempts at intimidation, at the end of
   January, hundreds of thousands of mainly young people took to the
   streets in Russia to protest against the arrest and sentencing of Alexei
   Navalny. As yet, events have not led to the emergence of any stable
   political structures. However, the protests took place against a
   backdrop of growing dissatisfaction. The regime has responded with
   force, yet society refuses to go back into hibernation. What once seemed
   unimaginable is now becoming a real possibility: that Putin is no longer
   the source of all legitimacy, but is becoming a burden of which the
   establishment wishes to relieve itself.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to investigate the current state of illegal
   merchandise trafficking in Ukraine, as well as the basic conditions that
   promote the spread of counterfeiting in this country together with the
   methods to counteract this phenomenon. The research methodology was
   chosen based on the purpose and objectives of the study, consequently, a
   set of methods and approaches to scientific knowledge were combined, of
   a general theoretical and special scientific nature. Everything
   indicates that Ukraine is one of the world leaders in the illicit
   production and distribution of software, intellectual property, etc.,
   and this problem has not been a priority for the authorities for a long
   time. It is concluded that the basic conditions that promote the spread
   of counterfeiting in Ukraine are determined on the basis of the analysis
   of the activities of the police and supervisory authorities in the fight
   against illegal trafficking of goods. The most efficient methods are
   proposed to counteract the illegal traffic of goods, within the
   framework of the underground economy in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {The article presents a comparative analysis of the stages of the
   negotiation process between the United States and the Taliban. The
   different positions of the B. Obama and D. Trump administrations towards
   the Afghan peace process are also compared. The relevance of this study
   is determined by necessity to adequately assess the possibilities of
   Russia's participation in the settlement of the Afghan conflict, taking
   into account the increase of its role in Afghan affairs. Demonstrating
   the evolution of the US approach to contacts with the Taliban, the
   author draws attention to the unwillingness of the Taliban to seek
   compromises. At the first stage of the negotiation process, the Taliban,
   waiting for the US plan for the full withdrawal of its troops from
   Afghanistan, were ready to discuss only exchange of prisoners and the
   delisting of the Taliban from the UN sanctions list. At the second
   stage, discussions ended with illusory promises of the ceasefire, the
   intra-afghan dialogue and the provision of guarantees that terrorists
   would not use Afghanistan against the United States, but the Taliban's
   demand for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan
   remained unchanged. Despite exhortations of the United States, official
   Afghan authorities had every reason to consider themselves excluded from
   the negotiation process. Ultimately, Americans declared that the draft
   of the agreement was ready. However, the US president refused to
   continue negotiations with the Taliban, as the final version of the
   agreement indicated that the Taliban were not yet ready to abandon
   contacts with al-Qaeda and provide all the necessary guarantees
   regarding the non-use of Afghan territory by foreign terrorists. The
   author points out errors made by the Trump administration in planning
   and conducting negotiations with the Taliban. The results of the study
   can be used by the profile department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs in the practical implementation of the foreign policy course of
   the Russian Federation in the Afghan direction.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Relatively recently. students of authoritarianism have not paid much
   attention to institutions. It was believed that since authoritarian rule
   is generally an arbitrariness, its institutionalism is not really
   important. Modern approach, however, is that institutions in
   authoritarian regimes are no less important than in a democracy. This is
   also applicable to such a political institution traditionally associated
   with democracy as elections. Recent works on comparative
   authoritarianism provide more evidence that holding election may help
   autocrats to survive. Starting from the third wave{''} of
   democratization, the political regimes of ``electoral
   authoritarianism,{''} that means regimes that are authoritarian in
   nature, but successfully implementing initially democratic political
   institutions including elections. are becoming more widespread. The
   regular holding of moderately competitive elections is characteristic of
   two the most important types of electoral authoritarianism, both
   hegemonic and competitive authoritarian regimes. This article attempts
   to generalize and systematize the conceptual views available in
   literature on the elections role in authoritarian regimes. Four main
   functions of authoritarian elections are identified and analyzed:
   legitimation, display of strength, co-optation and information
   acquisition.},

Abstract = {The article explores the challenges arising from Brexit for Czech and
   Slovak EU policy-making. Based on the insights from literature on Brexit
   (expected) challenges and small states' policy-making in the EU, the
   primary focus is on Brexit challenges within two areas of EU
   policy-making: 1) policy fields and 2) advocacy capacities. The main
   argument foregrounded in this paper is that the challenges arising from
   Brexit for member states' EU policy-making are affected by two factors:
   1) the country's EU policy and 2) the country's ties to the UK in its
   policy-making in the EU. Out of the two countries under scrutiny here,
   it is especially the Czech Republic whose EU policy-making will be
   challenged by Brexit.},

Abstract = {The National Security Doctrine in Argentina involved statal and
   parastatal persecution of every dissidence, not only under dictatorial
   governments but also during the brief constitutional period between 1973
   and 1976. Far from limiting from the big urban centres, the repression
   achieved far and relatively oblivious to the political unrest places,
   such as the case of El Bolson (Rio Negro), where the main target was the
   public health staff. From a micro-historical approach, this article
   pretends to contribute key concepts to complex the definition of the
   persecuted ``internal enemy{''}.},

Abstract = {Like other transnational threats such as climate change, the extinction
   of biological species, SARS or Ebola, the current COVID-19 confronts the
   modern utopia of rigid borders between nations and contemporary
   finance-led neoliberal economic models. Acknowledging the complexity of
   COVID-19's root causes, this paper builds on the contradictions between
   science, expertise and policy in the definition of global human
   security, and sketches five possible future international scenarios. I
   argue that in the aftermath of the pandemic any sort of future global,
   regional and state regulation will need to consider transnational
   threats not only to ensure the security of individuals, but also to
   guarantee the long-standing durability of the biosphere as a
   life-supporting system. To uphold this argument, I develop three
   sections: (i) the nature of the threat; (ii) the geopolitical tensions
   that COVID-19 heightens; and (iii) possible future scenarios.},

Abstract = {When does war occur for economic reasons? In an anarchic environment,
   stronger states may fear that their security will be undermined by the
   economic growth of weaker states and may attempt to constrain it. Weaker
   states, even if they are rising, may prefer to declare war. The weaker
   institutional constraints on stronger states are, and the smaller the
   spheres of influence of weaker states are, the greater are the risks of
   war. We illustrate our theory by analyzing the economic roots of the
   Second World War, and we reflect on the general lessons of our argument.},

   to define digital assets as a legal category and precisely
   characteristics for the digital objects of other civil objects according
   to identifications. Methods of analysis of legal standards, collection
   and study of individual facts, statistical methods, scientific
   abstraction methods and methods of representation of the archives were
   used. The study that digital objects are an independent legal category,
   which is an intangible digital asset that can only be created with the
   help of modern technologies, my that ownership of digital objects arises
   from the moment of verification with a verification with a code and the
   realization of a digital input. in a special transaction log. For the
   right of inheritance of digital objects, it is necessary to implement a

Abstract = {The article identifies features of decentralization reforms in Ukraine
   and Poland. Starting conditions of the preparedness of Polish and
   Ukrainian society on the verge of reform have been studied. The
   Ukrainian-Polish relations in the process of implementation of the
   reform in Ukraine have been investigated. Namely the expert environment
   responsible for the implementation of the Polish decentralization model
   has been identified. The common features of decentralization reform for
   Ukraine and Poland are identified which are in the same three-tier
   system (oblast - voivodeship, rayon - povit, hromada - gmina). The basis
   for decentralization reform in Poland was gmina, as a basic unit that
   includes one or more settlements, and the territorial basis for
   realization of local self-government by residents of settlements. For
   Ukraine, such units are united territorial communities, which creation
   have not yet been completed.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the filmic representations of delinquency in the
   cinema of the Chilean transition to democracy, paying attention to the
   relationship between film discourse and sociopolitical context. To do
   this we conceptualise, from a foucaulteana perspective, the notion of
   governmentality, later we examine the way in which the transition
   established the expansion of consumption as a way of governance and,
   finally, we investigate the social imaginary and ideologies associated
   with the filmic representation of the offender, seeking to determine how
   the governmentality and modes of neoliberal subjectivation are
   registered in four films of the chilean cinema of the transition. For
   this, we will analyze the films Caluga o menta (Gonzalo Justiniano,
   1990), Johnny cien pesos (Gustavo Graef Marino, 1993); Taxi para tres
   (Orlando Lubbert, 2001) y Mala leche (Leon Errazuriz, 2004).},

Abstract = {In this article we discuss how racism and securitization are an integral
   part of global human mobility since modern times. In these times of
   exacerbation of vigilance and control, migrants' subjectivities and
   their relationship with the societies of origin, transit and destination
   are constantly reconstructed and deconstructed. We analyze the global
   fortification -walls, fences, bureaucratization- and the resistance
   produced by the migrants. Through a theoretical-reflective and
   interpretative analysis of secondary data sources -recent academic
   publications, documentaries, news in newspapers and forums-, we used the
   case study of ``The Beast Train{''}, the freight train that crosses
   Mexico until the northern border. With the United States, as a
   biopolitical laboratory to understand human mobility. Raised to this
   train, we discuss and rethink the violence of the global border regime
   and the neoliberal government of migration. In conclusion, we propose
   certain alternatives to the capitalist regime that expels, excludes and
   externalizes},

Abstract = {The more repressive the state, the sharper the wit. This insight from
   the cultural history of Russia and the Soviet Union resonates today with
   regard to the treatment of Alexei Navalny. His return to Russia, his
   arrest, his Kafkaesque trial and the publishing of the video ``A Palace
   for Putin{''} triggered different responses. While the Putin regime
   deployed force and intimidation, users of social media turned to jokes
   and irony. They posted memes, which may be short-lived and ephemeral,
   but which can also be so on point that they gain global notoriety within
   a very short space of time. In Russia, they mobilise people who are
   critical and dissatisfied.},

Title = {Proxy Warfare and the Future of Conflict Take Two},
Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {165},
Number = {2},
Pages = {38-47},
Abstract = {While proxy wars have been around since time immemorial, the last decade
   of conflict has seen a rise in their strategic appeal. In the same way
   that sub-state violence captured the attention of policymakers and
   academics at the end of the Cold War, proxy wars are now a core feature
   of the contemporary and future strategic and security environment.
   Vladimir Rauta argues for a relocation of proxy wars by conceptualising
   them as strategic bargains waged on more complex grounds than risk
   avoidance, cost efficiency and deniability. He identifies two types of
   strategic goals sought through the employment of proxies: coercing and
   coping with an adversary, the differences of which are presented by
   contrasting the rationale for the US decision to support Syrian rebels
   against President Bashar Al-Assad with the Iranian strategy of proxy war
   in Syria.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {525-555},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the combined impact of hitherto understudied
   factors in the literature about multilevel parties - presidentialism,
   party agency, and party system fragmentation - on the vertical
   integration of party organizations, using Brazil as a case study. We
   rely on original data on party funding and intra-party interventions,
   party statutes, and secondary literature to compare the multilevel
   distribution of powers within the major Brazilian parties. The findings
   show that state branches receive overall more autonomy to deal with
   their own regional matters than powers to participate in central party
   decisions. The differences among parties can be attributed mainly to
   strategic choices: the parties that usually engage in presidential races
   grant lower levels of autonomy to their regional branches and face fewer
   pressures from regional elites. The findings have theoretical and
   empirical implications beyond the case, as they suggest important
   connections between multilevel party organizations, institutions, and
   party strategies.},

Abstract = {How can policing communications deny terrorism its desired effect?
   British police have steadily mobilised social media to reach
   stakeholders. In May 2017, Greater Manchester Police communications were
   effective in mitigating communitarian divisions sought by the Islamic
   State and in inciting empathy, solidarity, feelings of security and
   police collaboration. Furthermore, by writing and describing the
   community, events and actors in ways that serve specific priorities,
   they were able to take advantage of these platforms. In this article,
   Jill S Russell and Pablo de Orellana deploy historical and discourse
   analysis approaches to analyse how police communications depicted the
   event, civic identity, the police force itself and the response.},

   needs of citizens in general. Based on psychological assumptions, the
   author justifies the importance of such needs in the life of modern
   society. The article details the issue of creating and guaranteeing the
   correct functioning of a special authorized administrative body, to act
   as an instance of appeal and supervision in the course of the legal
   regulation of information and the underlying legal relationships. By way
   of conclusion, the authors especially emphasize the need to overcome the
   culture of secrecy, a type of undemocratic government, and refer to
   other requirements and accepted standards in this area to guarantee the
   enjoyment and enjoyment of this right at all times.},

   the wealth of raw materials and the sparse population in the country.
   However, attitudes have changed in recent years. Following huge public
   demonstrations against waste disposal sites, waste management has
   suddenly become a hot political topic. The industry also aims to
   increase efficiency by re-using raw materials. State funding programmes
   totalling billions of roubles aim at increasing the recycling quota and
   making waste a part of the economic cycle. While this transition will
   take longer than planned due to the upheaval caused by the Covid-19
   pandemic, in the longer term, Russia will continue to experience a
   fundamental cultural change with regard to waste management.},

Abstract = {Japan - U.S. relations, which are of great importance for the both
   countries as well as for international relations in North-East Asia and
   the Indo-Pacific, have experienced significant changes in recent years.
   While continuing to maintain close military-political alliance with the
   United States and recognize unconditionally its leadership regarding the
   choice of strategic course and priorities, Japan is increasingly
   promoting its own regional policy agenda and its vision of national
   interests. The main task of its government, headed by Shinzo Abe, is a
   kind of ``rebranding{''} Japan in political terms as a ``normal{''}
   country void of negative historical heritage with the ability to employ
   a full set of foreign policy tools and promote its interests on a
   regional scale. The said task brings about new accents in Japan's
   relations with the USA in the sphere of security, in solving regional
   political problems and regulating mutual trade and investment. At the
   same time, bilateral relations are viewed by Japan as a complex set
   where some elements can be used as a tool or traded as parts of a
   package deal to secure a comprehensive solution.
   The United States, for its part, is focusing on maintaining its role as
   the undisputed leader, trying to neutralize Japan's attempts to break
   the framework of the established hierarchical order and change the logic
   of bilateral relations to that of trading concessions and optimizing
   complex network balance.
   Since the change of presidential administration in the US in 2017 there
   has been a marked decay of long-established consensus on the
   desirability of further liberalization of international trade and
   investment through multilateral agreements and frameworks. Like other
   countries, Japan faced a persistent drive by Trump administration to
   withdraw from them in favor of bilateral agreements on managed and
   balanced trade. Japan's government had to give in to the US pressure and
   begin negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement designed to reduce
   imbalance of trade flows between the two countries through policy steps
   to be taken mainly by the Japanese side.},

Abstract = {In this study, I examine whether the effect of biased media can be
   reduced when voters have an alternative source of political information.
   Specifically, I investigate whether the introduction of television
   mitigated the effect of partisan press on U.S. presidential elections
   from 1944 to 1964. I first show that newspaper coverage of presidential
   campaigns during this period was affected by newspapers' party
   affiliations and their readers' political preferences. The main finding
   of this study is that television decreased the correlation between the
   circulation of partisan newspapers and parties' vote share. The results
   suggest that the existence of centrist media can make voters less
   susceptible to partisan media.},

Abstract = {Different understandings of indigeneity have been used to justify who
   receives reparations or acknowledgment of historic injustices in white
   settler nations. This article seeks to interrogate definitions of
   indigeneity used in contemporary Australian land claims, with the aim of
   challenging the state's legislative and judicial responses to indigenous
   Australians. Drawing on key legislative and judicial responses to
   indigenous Australians since the 1970s, I identify and analyze five
   problems generated by these responses: the problem of evidence, the
   problem of articulation, the problem of authenticity, the problem of
   character and the problem of legitimacy. Naming and characterizing these
   problems indicates the extent to which injustices against indigenous
   Australians are perpetuated through discourses based on poorly
   constructed legal definitions. It also generates certain ethical
   responses, such as the necessity for a more critical assessment of the
   role of the state in shaping discourses around indigeneity. I argue that
   identifying and addressing these five problems might result in
   recognizing indigenous alterities in ways that will engender new
   practices of justice.},

Abstract = {This article aims at analyzing the recent mutations of the Breton
   repertoire of contention. To do so, it proposes to look at the example
   of an association called ``Dibab{''}, which praised participatory
   democracy by organizing local votes on nationalitarian topics in small
   Breton towns during the year of 2015. Having a look at the trajectory of
   Dibab activists shows that many of them had started their militant
   career years ago, and were familiar to more radical pro-independence
   organizations. How do these activists have managed to play with
   different political strategies without losing their ideological frames?
   How have they expressed different kinds of commitment through their
   political practices and discourses? Observations, document studies and
   semi-structured biographical interviews disclose that the construction
   of a new participatory ideal by radical Breton activists does not
   prevent them from being multipositioned in the militant field, widening
   their action spectrum by doing so. That is why the Breton repertoire is
   better understood as a continuum. Indeed, long term processes and the
   juxtaposition of different spaces of mobilization must be taken into
   account in the analysis.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Based on an analysis of the norms of the Civil Code of the Russian
   Federation, the authors studied the legal basis for the provision of a
   range of services by the online classified in the digital environment.
   Additionally, the authors studied the structure of relations arising
   between the buyer, seller, online classified, delivery service, and the
   bank. The article substantiates that there is a conditional escrow of
   property in the framework of the considered relations, but the fact of
   concluding an agreement creating an appropriate legal basis for such an
   escrow is not observed. The study results identify several civil law
   agreements, needed for the goods delivery services offered by online
   classifieds. The authors concluded that the relationship system built by
   the online classified with sellers, buyers, a delivery service, and a
   bank and providing for the reservation of the buyer's money excludes the
   conclusion of an escrow agreement.},

Title = {The 2016 Water Crisis in San Andres Island: An Opportunity for Change?},
Journal = {CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {29},
Pages = {73-109},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {During the first half of 2016, the ``Nino{''} Phenomenon reached severe
   conditions in San Andres Island, Colombia. On April 2, people, mostly
   the Raizals, an ethnic minority group, and people from poor
   neighborhoods started 11 road protests asking for water. The water
   crisis affected, differentially, more than 14.000 people. The
   institutional response focused on distributing free water trucking
   during dry periods, increasing the water frequency, and incrementing
   water production. This study analyzed the crisis response and explored,
   in the short term, whether there was a change in access to water. In
   August 2016 were conducted 34 semi-structured interviews and 45 in
   November 2018. Findings suggest that crisis response used a conservative
   philosophy embedded in a technocratic perspective; as a result, it is
   still limited water access in the way it was before the crisis. This
   study contributes to the understanding of the factors that influence
   crisis response.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The standard justifications for control over territory appeal to goods
   that are delivered to persons who inhabit the territory
   (self-determination, justice). This raises the question: What justifies
   territorial rights in unoccupied places? This question is relevant to a
   pressing practical question concerning the permissibility of national
   and corporate interests in mining or gas drilling and other resource
   extraction activities in unoccupied places, some of which were either
   technologically impractical or prohibitively expensive in the past, but
   which now are possible. The territorial rights literature does not focus
   on unoccupied places, treating resource rights there as an extension of
   rights in occupied places, thereby suggesting that these activities
   could be justified in the same way. This article examines the
   distinctive normative contours of unoccupied spaces, and so considers a
   number of possible arguments to justify such rights. It focuses on
   rights to resources in relation to three different kinds of unoccupied
   places and suggests that the stewardship justification is the most
   promising (although there is some role for other arguments in relation
   to certain kinds of unoccupied places).},

Abstract = {Democratic responsiveness implies that politicians are expected to be
   responsive to public demands and needs but also that the public is
   expected to respond to actual policies and reforms by adjusting their
   demands. What is often over-looked is that policy-specific knowledge is
   imperative for public policy responsiveness to send correct signals. By
   using survey experiments, we tested the effects of policy-specific
   information on policy preferences for privatization of welfare services
   in Sweden. In line with the thermostatic model, we expected information
   on the increase of privatization to show negative correlations with
   demand for more privatization. The experiments showed that policy
   preferences changed in most policy areas when policy-specific facts were
   provided. The negative effects of information about privatization were
   most pronounced among centre-left respondents, increasing the left-right
   polarization. The results suggest that policy-specific knowledge can
   serve as a useful mechanism in order to meet the identified theoretical
   need to strengthen the causal relationship in theories of public
   responsiveness. The study adds important knowledge to how we understand
   public responsiveness, and highlight the need of ``reality checks{''}
   when analysing policy demands.},

Abstract = {This article argues that contrary to cyber-pessimist beliefs, citizens'
   internet use in authoritarian regimes still generates anti-regime
   sentiment. Using a multilevel regression analysis with country- and
   individual-level data for 21 authoritarian regimes (2010-2015), it shows
   that there is a positive effect of internet use on anti-regime sentiment
   and that stringent internet controls do not weaken this effect. An
   in-depth case study of Malaysia under the BN (1957-2018) examines the
   causal mechanisms. Interviews with activists (22), protestors (17), and
   online journalists (2) reveal how the internet gave alternative
   Malaysian voices a platform, essentially breaking the regime's monopoly
   as an information broadcaster. The consequential circulation of
   alternative political information exposed online Malaysians to new
   perspectives on the regime, which sometimes very swiftly, but most often
   gradually increased their anti-regime sentiment. The BN regime was
   unable to prevent this. It first underestimated the internet's
   potential, but later failed to effectively control it.},

Abstract = {Non-constituent donors constitute an increasingly important fundraising
   base for members of the U.S. House. These donors are theorized to be
   seeking ``surrogate representation{''} by buying additional
   representation rather than relying solely upon representation provided
   by their own House members. However, precisely why they contribute in
   this way remains unclear. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional
   Election Studies (CCES) 2008-2014 in a series of logistic models, I
   investigate whether self-reported donors make contributions to House
   races outside of their home states for policy or partisan reasons. I
   uncover evidence that surrogate seekers make their out-of-state
   contributions to recover partisan representation and to gain additional
   partisan and policy representation. Further, conservative issue stances
   significantly increase the likelihood of out-of-state giving more so
   than liberal stances suggesting conservative donors have less difficulty
   identifying surrogate representatives. Taken together, the results
   suggest surrogate seekers are strategic and politically sophisticated
   with respect to their giving choices and motivations.},

Abstract = {This article deconstructs the stated reasons behind the quartet's
   blockade on Qatar, including i) Iranian-relations; ii) funding `terror;'
   iii) supporting `political Islam' -Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, etc.; and
   iv) destabilizing the Arab world through Al Jazeera, and scrutinizes
   their veracity. In actuality, these accusations are mere obfuscation.
   Henceforth, understanding the quartet's motivation requires employing
   post-colonialism as an explanatory variable. It does so by assuming the
   preponderance of US. military power in the GCC produces three
   conflicting ideal-types: i) Saudi-led quartet Arab project,
   `subservient' to U.S. hegemony; ii) Iranian-led partisan project,
   resisting/increasing engagement to U.S. hegemony; iii) Turkish-led
   `civic Islam' project, pivoting from engagement to resisting U.S.
   hegemony. In this, three-rivalry is the roots of the blockade and the
   larger meta-strategy at behind the blockade.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an in-depth analysis of the transformation of the
   idea of interculturalism in Quebec from its genesis in Montreal
   community groups in the 1960s to its integration into party politics in
   the beginning of the 21(st) century at the National Assembly of Quebec.
   This historical sociology insists on the relay race between various
   actors who have competed in order to define its meaning and principles.
   The history of the idea of interculturalism highlights four distinct
   periods: the genesis of the vocabulary of ``intercultural{''}
   (1963-1977), its diffusion outside of the community groups (1978-1988),
   the semantic transition to ``interculturalism{''} (1988-2006) and its
   political polarization over contemporary Quebec's identity controversies
   (2007-2018).},

Abstract = {The development of a country's civil society has typically been tied to
   the development of democracy: a vibrant civil society is indicative of a
   vibrant democracy. Why, then, has civil society emerged differently in
   South Korea, a country that democratized fairly recently, and Japan, a
   country that has been democratic since the end of the Second World War?
   I argue the origins of democracy in both states significantly
   contributed to the contrasting characters of civil society. In Japan,
   top-down democratization facilitated the development of a civil society
   with a strong link to the state for the majority of the 20th century,
   best viewed from the perspective of Gramsci. By contrast, the bottom-up
   democratization process in South Korea fostered a civil society where
   organizations monitor the state, best understood from the Tocquevillian
   perspective. Through comparative case analysis, this study endeavors to
   contribute to the literature on civil society by highlighting the ways
   in which democratization influences the trajectory of civil society.},

Abstract = {While scholarship on ``retrospective voting{''} has found that incumbent
   politicians can be punished for a range of events outside their control,
   the literature has paid scant attention to the role of political
   alignment between the different levels of government in disaster
   responses and its implications for voting decisions. We argue that
   retrospective voters punish only opposition incumbents (candidates in
   office but not aligned with the government leader), who have limited
   access to government resources for relief, for natural disasters. We use
   monthly data on precipitation and evaporation to capture droughts and
   floods in India's four thousand State Assembly electoral constituencies
   over the years 1977-2007. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that
   Members of State Assembly from the party of the Prime or Chief Minister
   do not face an electoral backlash under bad weather conditions during
   the monsoon season, whereas opposition politicians face major losses.},

Abstract = {Fluctuations in the labor market are a natural part of the business
   cycle, and they have attracted attention from political scientists for
   decades. Some scholars argue that left-wing parties benefit from rising
   rates of unemployment while others claim that voters rally behind
   conservative parties when the labor market weakens. I argue that the
   heterogeneous response of voters to a rise in the unemployment rate is
   due to differences in asset wealth. Put simply, the well-off have less
   need for social insurance, so they vote for conservative parties in
   order to put a cap on social spending when the unemployment rate rises;
   by contrast, asset-less voter opt for the left, with an eye to
   preserving their entitlements. I show with panel data from Swedish
   electoral districts that left-wing parties gain an electoral advantage
   when the local unemployment rate rises in less well-off areas, but they
   lose support when unemployment rises in wealthier districts.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the collective action frame and its interaction
   with the sociopolitical context of Hong Kong. By tracing the history of
   civil disobedience, the authors argues that civil disobedience in Hong
   Kong has been localized by signifying agents as a spontaneous response
   to the sociopolitical contexts, rather than a planned action. The
   rapidly changing political environment and sovereignty issues from 1980
   onwards had restricted the favorability for opting a planned civil
   disobedience movement. Through in-depth interviews with protagonists,
   major civil disobedience attempts in Hong Kong, including (a) Yau Ma Tei
   Boat People Incident, (b) Protest regarding 1989 China's June Fourth
   Incident, (c) Anti-Public Order Ordinance Demonstrations, and (d)
   Citizens' Radio Incident, are discussed. These four cases would be
   contrasted with the well-planned Occupy Central Movement in 2014 to
   explain why the latter failed to materialize, and why future attempts of
   civil disobedience will become less possible in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how political strategies interrelate populist
   rhetoric with memory issues. By looking at the case of the Social
   Democratic Party (PSD) from Romania, between 2017-2019, this article
   reveals how the slide to populism, generated by cyclical confrontations
   with the rule of law institutions, steered the psd to adopt
   conspirational beliefs and appeal to traumatic memories to frame the
   judiciary as the new Securitate. Through the use of discourse analysis
   and virtual ethnography, this article analyses party resolutions and
   political rallies. This article explains how the populist rhetoric
   created a new hegemonic narrative of the judiciary, by intersecting its
   values and symbolism with the memory of the former Securitate from the
   Communist period.},

Abstract = {An established body of multi-disciplinary evidence demonstrates that
   children and young people's lived experiences and spheres of influence
   are fundamental to their wellbeing and realisation of rights, with
   adversity suggested to have significant and long-term consequences. For
   the past two decades the Scottish Government has responded with a
   sustained strategic commitment to children and preventive policy
   measures. Only recently have Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES)
   assumed a prominent role in this context. A corresponding policy
   development in Scotland has been on children's rights, with significant
   steps taken towards implementing the United Nations Convention on the
   Rights of the Child (CRC). This has involved a focus on incorporation,
   with the tag line `making rights real'. By analysing key literature and
   policy documents, this article considers the extent and shape of the
   interconnections between these policy areas. Informed by Carol Bacchi's
   problem representation framework, we identify evidence of conceptual
   pairing. However, deep engagement in children's rights appears to be
   lacking, as is children and young people's active role in national
   ACE-policy review and development.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study provides a new frame of reference for understanding
   intraparty dynamics by analyzing party members' representativeness with
   respect to party supporters regarding socioeconomic status and the
   ideological spectrum in a multiparty system, namely that of Finland. The
   analysis is based on a unique member-based survey of Finland's six major
   political parties (N = 12,427), which is combined with supporter data
   derived from a nationally representative survey (N = 1648). The clearest
   difference was found between supporters' and members' social status as
   members were generally in clearly higher social positions. However,
   there is a wider gap between parties when comparing supporters and
   members in terms of social status. Findings show that political opinions
   on income equality are still a key difference between traditional mass
   parties at the different levels of party strata, while incongruence
   within parties is relatively low. In contrast to the traditional
   parties, the newer parties, namely the Finns and the Greens, are
   ideologically close to their supporters in terms of attitudes concerning
   immigration and environment. Together, these findings provide an
   interesting landscape of the last decade's changes in the Finnish
   political spectrum and contribute to the ongoing discussion on the
   changing forms of political parties.},

Abstract = {. What are the roles China plays and what approaches does China take to
   the global order? This paper goes beyond the singular and static view on
   the roles of states as either status quo or revisionist and introduces
   more subtle roles of states with multi approaches of Status Quo,
   Parallel Supplement, Nested Enhancement, Regime Shifting, Competitive
   Regime Creation and Ideological Confrontation. After coding 1889 events
   from the `Belt and Road Portal' and then taking eight most frequent case
   clusters of the BRI as representative cases, the congruence analysis
   leads to the main argument that China plays multiple roles of rule
   taker, rule reformer, rule breaker and rule innovator. The contribution
   is both theoretical and practical. It improves the typology of states'
   approaches to the global order and helps to interpret the roles of
   emerging powers for the global order. By designing the BRI Index and
   coding the case cluster, this paper provides a new way to identify the
   representative case of the BRI.},

Abstract = {How do congressional leaders efficiently distribute particularistic
   benefits? When allocating funding, they face a problem: they want to
   help the rank-and-file, but do not know what projects are most valuable
   to their colleagues. I argue that leaders use two strategies to ensure
   projects are allocated efficiently, namely they reliably fund members'
   top priorities and line items that cost them little bargaining capital.
   Doing so allows them to bank political goodwill while guaranteeing that
   the rank-and-file have politically valuable credit-claiming
   opportunities. By matching senators' confidential prioritized requests
   for two appropriations bills from the 1990s to legislative outcomes, I
   examine how Senate leaders distributed federal funding. My findings show
   that the two strategies I identify strongly predict how much of a
   request is funded. Moreover, priorities and low-cost requests are more
   strongly associated with project funding than other factors commonly
   identified in the distributive politics literature. These results shed
   new light on how leaders distribute favors in Congress as well as help
   explain mixed findings about both who receives particularistic benefits
   and their electoral consequences.},

Abstract = {The inner workings of advisory commissions are opaque, which has
   frustrated inquiries about them. However, relying on data obtained via a
   Freedom of Information Act request from the Department of Justice, we
   focus on one readily observable aspect of the Attorney General's
   Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys (AGAC)-its composition. Unique to
   studies of executive commissions, we know the population from which AGAC
   membership is drawn. This allows us to definitively characterize the
   ideological distribution of the population of potential appointees, a
   significant advance in the empirical study of executive appointments.
   While the analysis cannot speak to AGAC's operations directly, our
   findings indicate that AGAC is characterized by asymmetrical political
   polarization. Democratic administrations are likely to politicize AGACs
   ideologically but Republicans are not, and we consider possible
   explanations for this result. In addition to its contribution toward
   understanding one aspect of informational commissions as an important
   source of policy development, the study provides the first empirical
   analysis of one route by which administrations interface with the
   nation's prosecutorial corps.},

Abstract = {Eric Hobsbawm will forever be a giant intellectual figure. Yet, an
   aspect of his work is underappreciated-the case for a more pluralistic,
   dynamic and intellectually inquiring Labour Party. As such, his
   political thought is particularly relevant given the recent election of
   Keir Starmer, and the avowed quest for `unity' in bringing Labour back
   to power. Hobsbawm came to believe that political strategies which
   sought to exploit social and political stratification and conflict-such
   as vilifying reformist political movements and those of moderate
   persuasion-doomed Labour to permanent opposition. A broad-based people's
   party, uniting objectives of solidarity and aspiration, was the only
   viable class politics. Although from the Marxist tradition, Hobsbawm
   believed Labour's purpose was to make liberal democracy function more
   effectively, rather than creating an alternative economic and political
   system. Suggesting conflict was more suited to kung fu movies,
   Hobsbawm's predominant theme of `anti-factionalism with a purpose'
   remains apposite today.},

Abstract = {In the past few decades, political theorists have attempted to
   articulate a nontheological basis for a special human place in the moral
   universe. These attempts, I argue, generally fall into two groups, one
   centered around the concept of ``dignity{''} and the other around ideas
   of ``difference.{''} Both of these attempts ultimately fail, I maintain,
   but their failures are instructive and help us along a path toward a
   better kind of relationship with nature and the earth as well as one
   another. In the face of increased scientific knowledge about the
   environment, animals, and our own species, we have every reason to
   recalibrate our stance toward nature as a whole. But in doing so we must
   acknowledge that the human relationship with nature is ultimately a
   representative one that can therefore never achieve the kind of
   reciprocity available in human society. Whatever form our respect for
   nature takes, it will always be distinct from the relationships we have
   with those we consider co-citizens.},

Abstract = {Does earning income empower women in patriarchal societies? We conducted
   two original experiments in Jordan investigating how patriarchal norms
   constrain the effects of relative earned income on women's bargaining
   power and women's preferences for paid employment opportunities. In the
   first experiment, we randomized women's relative earned income in a
   bargaining lab game involving male and female partners. Women with
   higher incomes than their partners behave more efficaciously than women
   with lower incomes. They are only more influential over bargaining
   outcomes, however, when paired with women, not men. We then employed a
   conjoint survey experiment using hypothetical job opportunities to
   assess how the prospect of higher incomes and working alongside men
   affect women's job preferences. Though higher wages make jobs more
   desirable, mixed-sex work spaces are a strong deterrent. Together, these
   findings demonstrate that patriarchal norms constrain women's desire to
   engage in paid labor and segment the empowering effects of earning
   income.},

Abstract = {In a randomized experiment in cooperation with two national parties
   competing in a congressional election in the Philippines, we estimate
   the causal effect on voting behavior of a town-hall style campaign in
   which candidates discuss their campaign platform with small groups of
   citizens. Keeping the parties' platform fixed, we find that town-hall
   meetings have a positive effect on parties' vote shares compared to the
   status quo, in which voters play a passive role. Consistent with the
   parties' advocacy for underprivileged groups, we observe heterogeneous
   effects by income, education, and gender. Deliberative campaigns
   increase voters' awareness on the issues parties campaign on, affecting
   the vote of the direct beneficiaries of the parties' platform.},

Abstract = {State incarceration rates have been a topic of much policy discussion.
   One notable issue missing from much of the literature concerns the
   various determinants that account for state differences in incarceration
   rates. Why are some states more or less likely to incarcerate their
   citizenry than other states? The article examines the 50 states in a
   cross-sectional state comparative model. Using a dependent variable of
   state incarceration rates, we offer and test several explanatory models,
   including socioeconomic factors, political explanations, social control
   mechanisms, and structural factors. We find that socioeconomic
   explanations to be the most robust, but we find varying degrees of
   support for each of our four models.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have regarded China's emergence as an economic force as a
   threat to democracy in Africa, presenting China as the exporter of an
   authoritarian model through its rising economic influence. This article
   investigates how well founded the contended Chinese economic threat to
   Africa is by both analyzing the data at a very fundamental level and
   applying time-series, cross-sectional analysis to economic and political
   data. In particular, the relationship between Chinese economic
   interactions with African states and democracy is explored. The analysis
   considers different aspects of an economic interaction with China
   measured both as share of GDP and of country totals. I do not find a
   relationship between Chinese economic interaction with African states
   and democracy in these states. The article thus contributes much
   important groundwork concerning the existence of patterns in Chinese
   economic relations and democracy, as well as some specific links between
   these economic relations and political change.},

Abstract = {The international dimension of authoritarian resilience is receiving
   increased attention by scholars of comparative politics and
   international relations alike. Research suggests that autocratic states
   exploit regionalism to boost domestic regime security. This article
   explains how membership in regional organizations can help to strengthen
   survival chances of autocratic incumbent elites. It argues that
   membership provides additional material, informational, and ideational
   resources to autocratic incumbents that can be used to boost domestic
   survival strategies vis-a-vis internal and external challengers. The
   article provides qualitative case-based evidence to show how autocratic
   incumbents in Zimbabwe, China, and Bahrain have benefited from the
   involvement of regional organizations during moments of political
   instability to strengthen legitimation, repression, co-optation, and
   international appeasement strategies. The article thereby provides the
   first encompassing explanation linking regionalism and authoritarian
   survival politics that is applicable across regions and different types
   of authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {Tanzania has experienced a remarkable economic growth averaging 6
   percent over the past two decades. While this growth is usually
   associated with the liberalization of the economy that began in the
   mid-1980s, the influence of African Socialism in Tanzania cannot be
   overemphasized. Specifically, Tanzania has mostly been a developmental
   state focusing on infrastructural push. This article qualitatively
   analyzes rhetoric from senior political and government figures to detect
   if there is a political myth underpinning the existence of the ``China
   Model{''} in Tanzania. Results show that, while for the past two decades
   Tanzania's development trajectory has been partially influenced by the
   China model, the China case is unique and thus its model may not be
   successfully replicated in Tanzania. I thus recommend a home-grown model
   if sustainable economic development has to be achieved in Tanzania.},

Abstract = {Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely used to address
   endogeneity concerns. Yet, a specific kind of endogeneity - spatial
   interdependence - is regularly ignored. We show that ignoring spatial
   interdependence in the outcome results in asymptotically biased
   estimates even when instruments are randomly assigned. The extent of
   this bias increases when the instrument is also spatially clustered, as
   is the case for many widely used instruments: rainfall, natural
   disasters, economic shocks, and regionally- or globally-weighted
   averages. Because the biases due to spatial interdependence and
   predictor endogeneity can offset, addressing only one can increase the
   bias relative to ordinary least squares. We demonstrate the extent of
   these biases both analytically and via Monte Carlo simulation. Finally,
   we discuss a general estimation strategy - S-2SLS - that accounts for
   both outcome interdependence and predictor endogeneity, thereby
   recovering consistent estimates of predictor effects.},

Abstract = {The Introduction to American Government course, and its textbook, is a
   nearly universal experience for students in American colleges and
   universities, but what exactly is being taught in this course? Do the
   textbooks used in this widely taught course accurately reflect the
   diversity of populations and experiences in the United States? More
   specifically, how do textbooks for Introduction to American Government
   cover historically marginalized groups, if at all? This article builds
   on previous work by analyzing the representation of individual
   historically marginalized groups to conduct index search and content
   analyses on traditionally published and openly licensed (i.e., open
   educational resources {[}OER]) textbooks. This study finds that American
   government textbooks include little coverage of any historically
   marginalized groups, and that OER textbooks are average in this respect,
   doing neither better nor worse than their traditionally published
   counterparts.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Using publicly available data on campaign disbursements, we examine
   gender gaps in staffing and compensation for congressional campaigns
   between 2010 and 2016. We find significant differences in both staff
   representation and pay on the basis of gender. Women make up a lower
   proportion of campaigns' staffs, on average, and receive less
   compensation overall than their male counterparts. These disparities are
   present across a wide variety of campaigns, but are exacerbated by
   partisanship, candidate gender, and incumbency status. We find that
   staffing and wage gaps are larger for Republican candidates, male
   candidates, and challengers. These findings provide new insight into
   distinctions in the political networks between Democrats and Republicans
   and the pipeline of future political candidates.},

Abstract = {Although sociologists and psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated
   that colorism shapes how Black Americans evaluate members of their
   racial group, the literature on colorism in electoral politics remains
   curiously and ironically bereft of studies of Black Americans. We fill
   this lacuna in our article by asking how and in what ways might the skin
   tone and gender of Black candidates shape Blacks' vote intention along
   with perceptions of representativeness? Using an original survey
   experiment with 1,260 Black Americans (of which we analyze 839) that
   varies the gender and skin tone of political candidates, we find that
   darker-skinned candidates are evaluated more favorably than
   lighter-skinned candidates. Our results advance the research on colorism
   in electoral politics and have sweeping implications for the vast body
   of literature on descriptive representation.},

Abstract = {This study applies the concepts of brand resonance and brand
   transgression to the brand management of a political leader and, for the
   first time, proposes a framework linking these two concepts. Qualitative
   analysis was used to examine the case of Kevin Rudd, a former, once
   popular, Australian Prime Minister (2007-2010, 2013), and found that
   Rudd's brand resonance was harmed as a result of a brand transgression.
   Specifically, a thematic analysis and semistructured interviews
   indicated that Rudd supporters' behavioral loyalty, sense of community,
   and active engagement declined. This study provides support for the
   proposed framework and a base for future research in this area.},

Abstract = {The administration of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
   implemented a strategy understood as a ``dual approach{''} that
   proactively promotes economic cooperation with China. What kind of
   economic cooperation will Abe's successor, Yoshihide Suga, implement
   with China in the context of the escalating competition over security?
   In 2018, Japan-China Third Country Business Cooperation (TCBC) project
   was launched treating China as an equal partner. However, Japan and
   China have different concepts of ``economic cooperation{''} under the
   TCBC framework, leading to discrepancies in their expectations.},

Title = {Do political connections make businesspeople richer? Evidence from
   Russia, 2003-2010},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Extensive literature shows that businesspeople thrive on political
   connections. Most research, however, does not differentiate between
   types of political connection, thus effectively assuming that economic
   return on being connected should not differ systematically between
   federal and regional, legislative and executive, formal and informal
   connections. We collect a unique comprehensive dataset on Russia's
   richest businesspeople in 2003-2010 and demonstrate that only certain
   types of connections work, depending on the political context. Our
   analysis shows that as Russian politics became centralized and the
   federal executive more powerful during the 2000s, businesspeople with
   informal connections to the federal executive increased their fortunes
   much faster compared with everyone else-including those with any other
   type of connections. Businesspeople's wealth thus dynamically reflected
   these important political changes. This suggests a procedure for
   inferring nominally unobservable changes in the political system from
   politically connected businesspeople's fortunes, while also shedding
   additional light on the institutional origins of informality in Russian
   politics today.},

Abstract = {Trust anticipates collective action and cooperation. When there is
   trust, people offer less resistance to relate and share information and
   innovate, spend less time and resources to controlling and watching each
   other, and are more comfortable and happy to engage in interactions.
   Countries with high levels of trust have higher state efficiency, lower
   corruption, higher social equity. Now, what about other countries? How
   is it possible to reverse scenarios where distrust is the rule and the
   vicious circles predominate? The aim of this work is double. First, it
   seeks to systematize the literature on the repair of trust (dispersed in
   different disciplinary areas), and to propose a useful analytical
   scheme. Second, it offers an operating route with indications to explore
   the factors that determine distrust in each case (dissatisfaction,
   imagery, and emotionality) and find the best answers to their
   reconstruction, reparation or creation.},

Title = {The digital disconnection of workers. Reflections concerning its
   description as a right and its implementation},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {31},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital disconnection was regulated in the recent Organic Law 3/2018, of
   December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital
   Rights, as a legally recognised right for the workers in order to
   guarantee observance of rest times. However, its content has not been
   defined by the legislator, and transfers this responsibility to social
   agents and employers, who, through collective negotiation and the
   production of internal business policies, are called upon to play a
   fundamental role in the configuration and requirements of this new law.
   In the light of these circumstances, this article addresses whether the
   description as a right offers a solution adjusted to the proposal that
   is pursued with digital disconnection, also adding a critical analysis
   of the part that collective negotiation and the representation of
   workers and business owners plays, as well as the legal implications of
   this in the regulation of digital disconnection.},

Abstract = {What can be done to encourage people to condemn intimate partner
   violence? Looking at Indonesia, I combine electoral data with a
   large-scale health survey and find that the narrow victory of a female
   candidate-as opposed to a male candidate-in local council elections
   leads to a decrease in the share of female constituents who agree that a
   husband is justified in assaulting his wife. I observe similar results
   for male constituents, although some estimates are not statistically
   significant. These results improve our understanding of the role of
   descriptive representation as a cause, rather than simply a consequence,
   of changing attitudes.},

   Rights: Lessons on the Owino Uhuru Pollution Incident in Kenya},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In Kenya, have been embroiled in an effort to obtain justice for harm
   suffered as a result of pollution by a lead-acid smelting plant. The
   lead-acid smelting plant was operated by the now defunct Metal
   Refineries Limited from 2007 until its closure in 2014. In 2016, a class
   action was filed on behalf of the members of the community. In an August
   2020 judgement that has since been appealed by the state, the High Court
   found in favour of the residents of Owino Uhuru, declaring that the
   pollution incident constituted violations of the right to life, health,
   water, and a clean and healthy environment. This article shows that
   despite that outcome, the environmental human rights dimension of the
   pollution incident is more expansive that the petition and the ensuing
   judgement suggest. These violations occurred against a backdrop of a
   near-exhaustive bill of rights. The apparent gap between the promise
   embodied by environmental human rights and the lived experience of those
   negatively impacted by the pollution incident provides a focal point to
   reflect on the potential and limits of environmental human rights in
   Kenya's legal context.},

Title = {From Markets to Stakeholders: Toward a Conceptual Model of Political
   Stakeholder Orientation},

Abstract = {Since the first publication of the conceptual model of political market
   orientation model has been used empirically to understand the behavior
   and attitudes of political party members towards stakeholders in various
   contexts. The results have provided only limited support for the
   constructs that represent orientations towards the various stakeholder
   groups. This has led to an evolution in the conceptualization of the
   stakeholders that are included in the PMO model across existing
   literature with the aim of addressing this problem; whilst the inclusion
   of voters, party members and competing parties have received a degree of
   support across empirical investigations, it has proved difficult to
   usefully conceptualize other stakeholder groups. The research aim of
   this paper is to integrate recent advances in the theoretical
   foundations of political marketing with conceptual model of PMO in order
   to propose a revised conceptualization of a political stakeholder
   orientation. This aim is motivated by a need to further develop the
   conceptual foundations of the political marketing research field. This
   paper discusses recent research into the nature of stakeholders in the
   political marketing context and of the nature of the political exchange
   of value as a series of three, linked interactions. We subsequently
   present and critique the stakeholder orientation constructs of the PMO
   model. Finally, we demonstrate how these recent advances in the
   political marketing literature necessitate the development of the PMO
   concept into a broader PSO concept, based on a stakeholder perspective
   on political marketing.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},

Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents and addresses a simple, yet overlooked, research
   question: is there a sexuality gap in political engagement and
   participation between sexual minority individuals and the heterosexual
   majority in Western Europe? To answer this question, we employ a
   recently applied method of identifying lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB)
   individuals using data on the gender composition of cohabiting partner
   households from the European Social Survey. Relying on a total sample of
   more than 110,000 individuals across 12 different countries with an
   identified sample of 1542 LGB individuals, we test the divergence in
   political interest and political participation, both electoral and
   non-electoral, between LGB and non-LGB individuals. The results of our
   empirical analyses conform with our expectations. Theorising that LGBs,
   as a marginalised social stratum, are incentivised to participate and
   `vote like their rights depended on it', we find empirical evidence of a
   significant and positive `sexuality gap' in levels of political
   interest, turnout and other forms of political participation in Western
   Europe over and above what can be determined by socio-economic
   determinants of political participation.},

Abstract = {Noting the lack of ``anti-man{''} bias research in the 2016 election,
   Zigerell (2019) argued that a relative lack of conservatives in
   political science can lead to bias in publications against political
   science research supporting conservative viewpoints. This article offers
   an alternative explanation for this lack of research: that this research
   produces null findings and therefore is subject to the ``file-drawer
   problem,{''} in which null effects are less likely to be published than
   positive effects. Using data from the 2016 American National Election
   Studies, I provide an illustrative example to support this claim and
   suggest some solutions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to understand the factors driving the BOP
   community's voting decisions. This study used a qualitative
   phenomenological approach, conducting 32 interviews with BOP voters in
   two areas: Kharagpur and Kolkata, in West Bengal, India. The findings
   showed some political parties and politicians powerfully operate in BOP
   areas and dominate BOP people through information persuasion, benefits
   and coercion. Hence, BOP people in those areas vote for them. Social
   ties and capital and social identity resulting from the sense of
   belongingness with local politicians also drive their voting decisions.
   This study contributes to political marketing literature, particularly
   in the BOP context. These results will assist public policy makers.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes factors which explain support for the
   representative model and its two main alternatives: direct democracy and
   technocracy. It discusses the role played by two understudied
   explanatory factors: perceptions relating to the personal qualities of
   the different actors involved in decision-making (i.e. representatives,
   citizens and experts) and electoral support for mainstream parties (PSOE
   and PP) and new parties (CiudadanosandPodemos). We rely on two Spanish
   surveys from 2011 and 2015. The results show that both perceived
   qualities and party preferences are linked to support for the three
   decision-making models. The emergence of new parties in 2015 has
   reshaped the connection between party choice and process preferences and
   has made this relationship stronger.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {Scholarly interest in issue ownership is growing rapidly. Although
   originally introduced as a competence-oriented, alternative concept to
   the predominantly spatial understanding of voting and party behaviour,
   parties' policy positions are an inescapable aspect of issue ownership.
   Using data for multiple issues in several countries over time, this
   article shows that the party with issue ownership sides with the median
   voter. A party earns issue ownership by taking up a position as close to
   as many voters as possible. Moreover, the analysis indicates that a
   party's issue emphasis only matters to issue ownership insofar as it is
   used as a device to make its position credible to voters. Hence, to have
   issue ownership is to have a credible position, and in that sense, issue
   ownership has less added theoretical value to spatial proximity than
   previous literature suggests.},

Abstract = {Democratic theorists tend to assume, without a great deal of argument,
   that age-based discrimination in access to the franchise is justified.
   In this paper, I challenge the orthodoxy. I argue that all major,
   plausible accounts of the justification of democracy converge upon a
   requirement to enfranchise a substantial proportion of the child
   population. Along the way, I consider and respond to several challenges
   that have been raised to child enfranchisement.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are accustomed to imagining electoral politics in
   geographical terms. For instance, there is a ``red America{''} that
   largely covers the country's expansive heartland and there is a ``blue
   America{''} mostly confined to the coasts. Until recently, however,
   public opinion scholars had largely lost sight of the fact that
   theplaceswhere people live, and people's identification with those
   places, shape public opinion and political behavior. This paper develops
   and validates a flexible psychometric scale measure of a key political
   psychological dimension of place: place resentment. Place resentment is
   hostility toward place-based outgroups perceived as enjoying undeserved
   benefits beyond those enjoyed by one's place-based ingroup. Regression
   results indicate that males, ruralites, younger Americans, those high in
   place identity, and those high in racial resentment are more likely to
   harbor higher levels of place resentment.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-50},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {How should responsibility be theorized in the context of the global
   climate crisis? This question is often framed through the language of
   distributive justice. Because of the inequitable distribution of
   historical emissions, climate vulnerability, and adaptation capacity,
   such considerations are necessary, but do not exhaust the question of
   responsibility. This article argues that climate change is a structural
   injustice demanding a theory of political responsibility. Agents bear
   responsibility not in virtue of their individual causal contribution or
   capacity, but because they participate in and benefit from the
   carbon-intensive structures, practices, and institutions that constitute
   the global political and economic system. Agents take responsibility by
   engaging in collective political action to transform these structures
   that generate both climate hazards and unjust relationships of power. By
   incorporating distributive principles within a capacious conception of
   political responsibility, this framework advances the theory and
   practice of climate justice in two ways. First, adopting a relational
   rather than individualistic criterion of responsibility better makes
   sense of how and why individuals bear responsibility for a global and
   intergenerational injustice like climate change. Second, framing climate
   justice in terms of political responsibility for unjust structural
   processes better orients and motivates the political action necessary
   for structural transformation.},

Abstract = {Roughly half of the U.S. public thinks that torture can be acceptable in
   counterterrorism. According to recent research, dramatic depictions of
   torture increase public support for the practice. Yet we do not know how
   frequently-and in what context-torture is depicted across popular media.
   What messages about the acceptability and effectiveness of torture do
   Americans receive when they watch popular films? To address this
   question, we coded each incident of torture in the twenty top-grossing
   films each year from 2008 to 2017 to analyze how torture is portrayed in
   terms of its frequency, efficacy, and social acceptability. Results show
   that the majority of popular films-including films aimed toward
   children-have at least one torture scene. Across films, the messages
   sent about torture are fairly consistent. As expected, movies tend to
   depict torture as effective. Further, how movies portray torture is also
   a function of who is perpetrating it. Specifically, protagonists are
   more likely to torture for instrumental reasons or in response to
   threats and are more likely to do so effectively. In contrast,
   antagonists are more likely to use torture as punishment and to torture
   women. The frequency and nature of torture's depiction in popular films
   may help explain why many in the public support torture in
   counterterrorism.},

   a number of sources, including the National Consortium for the Study of

   The Economist, NPR, the Washington Post, and Vox. She serves on the
   editorial boards of Criminal Justice \& Behavior, Studies in Conflict
   and Terrorism, and Dynamics of Asymmetric Conflict. This project was
   funded by the University of Alabama. They would like to thank Amazon
   Prime, Hulu, and Netflix for making these movies easily accessible and
   relatively inexpensive and Adam Ghazi-Tehrani whose extensive movie
   collection supplemented streaming services. They are most grateful to
   Lauren Delehanty who put up with constantly pausing movies to rewind and
   code-this was no doubt annoying. She was particularly instrumental as a
   sounding board for coding decisions. They would also like to thank the
   many people who provided feedback on coding dilemmas-namely J.M. Berger,
   Chardon Murray, and Laila Wahedi. Victor Asal, Courtenay Conrad, and
   Rochelle Terman provided valuable feedback on this manuscript in various
   stages. The paper's title was inspired by Leili Haririan, a student in
   Kearns' course on Torture, who was shocked and saddened to learn that
   there is torture in her favorite movie.},

Abstract = {Politicians deliver their messages through the use of language with the
   intention of creating public support for their ideas and actions.
   Politicians, therefore, apply certain concepts, in preference to others,
   to mark certain phenomena in a specific way in the common discourse.
   Therefore, concepts utilized by politicians need to be analyzed
   critically from a sociological and political perspective. This paper is
   built on a political discourse analysis of the strategic
   ``normalization{''} of political concepts by Icelandic politicians. The
   Social Science Research Institute at the University of Iceland conducted
   a questionnaire survey on the attitudes of Icelanders towards three
   debated issues in contemporary Icelandic society: the legitimization of
   casinos, ways to finance major road constructions, and new laws on the
   abortion rights of women. To account for the effects of the politicians'
   utilization of concepts, half of the respondents received a question
   with a ``neutral{''} concept and the other half got a question with a
   ``value-laden{''} concept on each of the issues. The hypotheses assumed
   that the more neutral concepts would gain more general support than the
   more value-laden concepts. The results indicate that the attitudes
   towards the three issues were mixed and, furthermore, that the use of
   different concepts does not seem to make much of a difference, since
   only one hypothesis was supported, whereas the other two were rejected.
   It can also be argued that the circulation of concepts and the
   conceptual literacy of the public are important issues in this context.},

Abstract = {Mobilization efforts by parties and candidates during election campaigns
   tend to reach those who are more likely to vote in the first place. This
   is thought to be particularly consequential for turnout among the young.
   Harder and less cost-effective to reach, young adults are less mobilized
   and vote less often, creating a vicious circle of demobilization.
   However, new forms of political communication-including online and text
   messaging-have created expectations this circle might be broken. Is this
   happening? We examine data from Module 4 of the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems surveys, looking at the prevalence of different types
   of party contacts in 38 countries, the profile of voters who are
   reached, and the effects of these efforts on turnout. New forms of party
   contacting do matter for turnout and partially reduce the age gap in
   contacting, but still fail to compensate for the much larger
   differentials that persist in traditional forms of contacting.},

Abstract = {In the past two decades, the embeddedness of potential grantees in
   complex local webs of both political and welfare relationships
   challenged the work of international grant-makers, particularly in the
   context of the war on terrorism. These concerns are no novelty as
   organized philanthropy has historically worked in countries with
   undefined political constellations where recipient organizations pursue
   a wide range of goals. The relationship between the Carnegie Endowment
   for International Peace (CEIP) and its local representatives in interwar
   Germany serves here as a historical case study to better understand the
   political realities influencing foundations' selection of local
   partners. This case shows that the radical pacifist stand of CEIP's
   German representatives soon became an obstacle to the work of foundation
   officers, who consequently sought the collaboration of more pragmatic
   and politically connected voices. Overall, the study underscores the
   power dynamics at the center of philanthropic relationships and the
   different degree of autonomy of advisors, representatives, and grantees
   in these relationships.},

Title = {Climate politics in hard times: How local economic shocks influence MPs
   attention to climate change},

Abstract = {Most countries struggle to implement CO(2)reducing policies.
   Implementation is politically difficult since it typically forces
   politicians to trade-off different concerns. The literature on how
   parties and members of parliament (MPs) handle these trade-offs is
   sparse. We use structural topic models to study how MPs in an oil
   dependent environment responded to a shock in the oil price that created
   spatially concentrated costs of climate policies. We leverage the rapid
   oil price drop between parliamentary sessions and MPs' constituency
   adherence in a difference-in-differences framework to identify if MPs
   respond differently to variation in the salience of trade-offs. We find
   that MPs facing high political costs of climate policies tried to avoid
   environmental topics, while less affected MPs talked more about
   investments in green energy when the oil price declined. Our results
   suggest that the oil price bust created a `window of opportunity' for
   advocates of the ` green shift'.},

Abstract = {In Kazakhstan today, overt dissent is not typically tolerated. However,
   recent large-scale citizen protests over land use and the environment
   have resulted in significant concessions by the government. This paper
   examines the discourses and slogans of protests spaces, which invoke the
   (inter)national legal frameworks of the United Nations, the legacy of
   land and bio-species conservation in the former Soviet Union, and a
   nationalized moral paradigm of respect for ancestral lands, cultural
   heritage, and sovereignty. Protesters not only call upon government
   leaders to respect these existing structures of authority, but also
   position themselves pragmatically as agents of social and political
   change.},

Title = {De-colonizing the political ontology of Kantian ethics: A quantum
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {448-467},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article explores the relevance of ontological assumptions for
   justifications of agency and ethics. It critiques Kantian ethics for
   being based upon an ontological imaginary that starts from the
   substantialism of Newtonian physics. Substantialism shapes Western
   political philosophy's view about who we are as subjects and how the
   world works. In this ontological imaginary, validation of ethics is
   based upon universality and abstractions. Furthermore, Kantian ethics
   underscores an anthropocentric and theocratic vision of how to govern
   societies. I argue Kantian criteria are not onlyinsufficientto make good
   choices but are alsoconducive towrong ones, since they elicit
   self-appeasement in international intervention, and contribute to the
   conceptual repertoire of coloniality. I propose that an ontology of
   entanglements opens possibilities for overcoming the shortcomings of an
   ethos based upon abstractions and possibly for correcting some of its
   moral failures. In a quantum ontological imaginary, the validation of
   ethical choices relies instead upon the exploration of the apparatuses
   we deploy, as well as upon careful situational evaluation. Specific
   practices, rather than an abstract humanity, are the referents for
   devising such ethos. This position, I argue, resonates with the critical
   project of decoloniality and its acknowledgment of the political
   salience of ontological imaginaries.},

Abstract = {This research conducted list experiments to estimate the percentage of
   respondents who received electoral gifts during the 2015 legislative and
   the 2015 and 2017 subnational campaigns in Mexico. Consistent with
   recent studies on sensitive survey techniques, our research finds that
   list experiments seem to methodologically work better among more
   sophisticated voters (e.g. those with higher levels of education). Such
   findings suggest that previous studies that rely on list experiments
   tend to underestimate the percentage of voters who receive electoral
   gifts since this technique tends to work better among respondents who
   are, in fact, least likely to be targeted by clientelistic strategies.
   Given levels of education in the region, we suggest that research solely
   relying on list experiments approach its empirical findings with
   caution.},

Abstract = {The spectre of Brexit has raised issues of concern for Roma communities
   living and working in Scotland and other parts of the UK. The effective
   ending of freedom of movement has produced new uncertainties and
   insecurities for people living outside their EU countries of origin,
   especially for those who are racialised and stigmatised by `hostile
   environment' policies. Brexit is best understood as both a process and
   effect of everyday bordering as well as a continuation of historically
   embedded structural divisions. This paper looks at everyday Roma life in
   Glasgow, via the work of the NGO Romano Lay (Roma Voice), to assess how
   Brexit is impacting on people's lives. Further, the paper examines how
   Scotland can best move forward in terms of independence and the European
   project. It is argued that a second independence referendum that gives
   full political independence to Scotland is the only way to secure future
   EU membership and freedom of movement.},

Title = {Gender quotas and placement mandates in open and closed lists: Similar
   effects, different mechanisms},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that placement mandates, that is, regulations
   for gender ordering in party lists, enhance gender quotas' effectiveness
   in proportional representation electoral systems, independently of list
   type. In closed-list systems, placement mandates increase women's
   representation automatically as a result of the electoral rules, and,
   for this reason, we call this effect mechanical. In open-list systems,
   the effect is also strong due to systematic patterns of electoral
   behavior. We call this effect psychological. In order to demonstrate
   this, we analyze 140 Latin American legislative elections carried out
   between 1990 and 2018. Then, we compare the two most similar cases of
   open-list systems with different rules for placement mandates to
   illustrate the occurrence of the psychological effect. This is the first
   article to argue that placement mandates have similar effects in both
   kinds of lists as a function of distinct mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Governments claim to establish lobbying registers with the intent of
   giving citizens and the media the opportunity to see who is lobbying
   whom and for what purpose. This external scrutiny is expected to help
   prevent undue influence and corruption. Scholars, however, have noted
   that transparency might also serve internal scrutinizers by providing
   information to the lobbyists themselves. This study employed a survey of
   more than 300 interest groups in Ireland to test this alternative to the
   `armchair scrutiniser' assumption, whereby transparency serves the
   purpose only of public scrutiny. The analysis found that a small but
   well-defined group of organizations routinely accesses the website of
   the Irish lobbying register and `consumes' the information during the
   advocacy process. Interest-group characteristics, such as group type and
   material resources, help explain these trends. This study is relevant
   for scholars interested in the effects of transparency and how the
   availability of information is linked to lobbying strategies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the relationship between occupational
   vulnerability and attitudes toward immigration in Western Europe. We
   measure occupational vulnerability as the risk of unemployment due to
   routine-biased technological change and offshoring of jobs to other
   countries. Previous empirical studies in political economy have shown
   that individuals' policy preferences echo their economic risks and
   prospects. Workers in low routine occupations are most worried about
   their job market prospects, most likely to demand social protection and
   least likely to support free trade. We find that attitudes toward
   immigration become considerably more negative as occupational task
   routineness increases. We do not find a similar association between
   occupational offshorability and immigration attitudes. Direct exposure
   to global competition is not associated with increased worries about
   immigration. However, offshorability seems to be associated with the
   polarization of attitudes toward immigration between routine and
   nonroutine workers.},

Abstract = {Accountability-constraints on a government's use of political power-is
   one of the cornerstones of good governance. However, conceptual
   stretching and a lack of reliable measures have limited cross-national
   research on this concept. To address this research gap, we use V-Dem
   data and innovative Bayesian methods to develop new indices of
   accountability and its subtypes: the extent to which governments are
   accountable to citizens (vertical accountability), other state
   institutions (horizontal accountability), and the media and civil
   society (diagonal accountability). In this article, we describe the
   conceptual and empirical framework underlying these indices and
   demonstrate their content, convergent, and construct validity. The
   resulting indices have unprecedented coverage (1900-present) and offer
   researchers and policymakers new opportunities to investigate the causes
   and consequences of accountability and its disaggregated subtypes.
   Furthermore, the methodology provides a framework for theoretically
   driven index construction to scholars working with cross-national panel
   data.},

Abstract = {Most bills that pass the House of Representatives do so under suspension
   of the rules. Despite the procedure's prevalence, however, we know
   little about its systematic use. Although the supermajoritarian
   threshold for passage of bills under suspension typically precludes the
   majority party from using these bills for partisan policy, I argue that
   leadership control over the procedure still allows for the pursuit of
   party goals. Speakers split the suspension agenda between
   noncontroversial but substantively important legislation and parochial
   bills that serve credit-claiming goals of individual members. While the
   minority party is not entirely shut out of the process, I argue that
   Speakers have been strategic in appeasing minority party demands for
   inclusion. Using data on bills considered under suspension from 1973 to
   2015, I demonstrate that the distribution of suspension bills
   systematically favors electorally vulnerable majority party incumbents,
   and largely excludes their minority party counterparts.},

Abstract = {In countries where legislators can sponsor bills, but these bills have
   few chances of promulgation, motives other than seeing a bill become law
   must also account for bill sponsorship. After discussing the theoretical
   determinants of bill sponsorship, we propose five hypotheses that
   account for a legislator's bill sponsorship. We test these hypotheses
   for the case of Chile's presidential system, where only 8.6\% of
   legislative bills were promulgated as laws between 1990 and 2014. We use
   data for 4602 bills presented by the 728 members of the Chamber of
   Deputies during those six legislative terms, totalling 30,986 individual
   sponsorships. Deputies with discrete career ambitions sponsor fewer
   bills than legislators with progressive or static ambitions. Legislators
   with a longer tenure sponsor fewer bill. Opposition legislators do not
   sponsor more bills than government legislators. Legislators sponsor
   fewer bills in the first and last years of every term. As they have few
   chances of seeing their bills become laws, Chilean legislators use bills
   as a tool to advance their political careers and do so responding to the
   incentives of the electoral cycle.},

Abstract = {Concurrent housing and opioid crises have increased exposure to
   street-crime, homelessness and addiction in American cities. What are
   the political consequences of this increased neighborhood disorder? We
   examine a change in social context following the relocation of
   homelessness and drug treatment services in Boston. In 2014, an
   unexpected bridge closing forced nearly 1000 people receiving emergency
   shelter or addiction treatment to relocate from an island in the Boston
   Harbor to mainland Boston, causing sustained increases in drug-use,
   loitering, and other features of neighborhood disorder. Residents near
   the relocation facilities mobilized to maintain order in their
   community. In the subsequent Mayoral election, their turnout grew 9\%
   points while participation in state and national elections was
   unchanged. However, increased turnoutfavoredthe incumbent Mayor,
   consistent with voter learning about candidate quality following local
   shocks. Voters responded to neighborhood changes at the relevant
   electoral scale and rewarded responsive politicians.},

Abstract = {This note introduces the POLITICIZE dataset which contains information
   on the characteristics of 105 Deliberative Mini-Publics (DMPs) that took
   place in Europe between 2000 and 2020. Based on coding of experts
   regarding cases of real-life deliberative experiments in 18 different
   European countries, the dataset describes the core features of DMPs in
   Europe. It comprises information on three crucial dimensions: their
   composition (who deliberates?), their format (how do they deliberate?)
   and their role (what do they deliberate about and what are their
   prerogatives?). Hence, the note presents the different variables
   included in the dataset and reports empirical variations across them,
   thereby presenting the main contribution of the POLITICIZE dataset:
   delivering the most systematic and comprehensive efforts of data
   collection on mini-publics in Europe.},

Abstract = {Populism has become a pervasive concept in political science research.
   However, a central and basic question remains unanswered: which European
   parties are more populist than others? Despite the increasing wealth of
   studies on populism in parties, we lack data that measures populism in
   political parties in a valid and precise manner, that recognizes that
   populism is constituted by multiple dimensions, and that ensures full
   coverage of all parties in Europe. In this article, we first appraise
   the weaknesses of existing approaches. Arguing that parties' populism
   should be measured as a latent construct, we then advocate a new
   approach to operationalizing and measuring populism in political parties
   using expert surveys. Relying on the Populism and Political Parties
   Expert Survey spanning 250 political parties in 28 European countries,
   we show that populism is best measured in a multi-dimensional and
   continuous manner. We subsequently illustrate the advantages of our
   approach for empirical analysis in political science.},

Abstract = {This essay analyzes Fred Moten's ``antipolitical{''} romance with the
   ``fugitive black sociality{''} that he radically opposes to
   ``politics,{''} defined as inescapably tied to antiblack modernity. By
   comparing Moten's argument to other voices in the black radical
   tradition, and by triangulating Moten with Hannah Arendt and Sheldon
   Wolin, this essay opens inherited conceptions of the political to risk
   and reworking but also complicates figurations of fugitivity and resists
   the antagonism Moten posits between black fugitivity and democratic
   politics.},

Abstract = {In this article we develop a new theory that interest group donation
   behavior will vary based on the politicization of industries that a
   particular group works in. With this theory, we develop a new empirical
   measure of industry politicization using mentions of contributor
   industry and partisan keywords in newspapers in the United States from
   1999 to 2014. We show using a difference-in-differences model that as
   industry politicization increases, the likelihood of a political action
   committee (PAC) using an access-oriented donation strategy decreases and
   the likelihood of a PAC using an ideologically oriented donation
   strategy increases. Our results indicate that there is significant
   variation across interest groups that is often ignored when considering
   PACs' donation strategies as parts of broad subgroups. Furthermore,
   these results illuminate the policy areas in which interest groups seek
   access to the legislative process via strategically placed campaign
   contributions.},

   a mixture of subcultures that are shared across the world. Our results
   demonstrate that value consensus varies substantially across countries

Abstract = {This article approached the analysis of the role of the political
   representation of the councilors of the city of Barranquilla, in
   Colombia, from the double dimension: focus (what interests they
   represent) and style (if they behave following instructions or, on the
   contrary, following their own interests). Likewise, it studied the
   knowledge on the socio-political and demographic characteristics of the
   local political elite of the city as well as the identification and
   definition of the factors that influence (or explain) the configuration
   of their role vis-a-vis their political representation. Similarly, based
   on the attitudes, beliefs and perceptions of the councilors, it also
   seeks to answer questions related to democracy, its actors and
   institutions, political guidelines and the rules of the local political
   game. The article ends highlighting the scarce literature on local
   political elites in the Colombian case and, therefore, the need to delve
   into the study and knowledge of the citizens' closest representatives.},

Abstract = {Slovenia is one of the very few countries in the European Union with a
   single tier local government system, and while levels of local democracy
   have been on the rise since gaining independence in 1991, relations
   between the state on the one side and local governments (municipalities)
   on the other has slowly deteriorated, especially over the questions of
   municipal competencies and financing of local communities. While
   Slovenia ratified the European Charter on Local Self-Government (ECLG)
   in 1996, the charter was never fully implemented, as the subsidiarity
   principle was never fully implemented. The paper is analysing the issue
   of local autonomy with an emphasis on the financial autonomy, using
   primary and secondary sources as well as empirical data from national
   and local authorities.},

Abstract = {Social network sites may have contributed to the global electoral
   success of populism in important ways. Drawing on the technological
   affordances of social media, politicians are enabled to directly
   communicate populist discourse via Twitter by constructing a pervasive
   societal divide between the ``good{''} people and ``corrupt{''} elites.
   Such Tweets may resonate with the reality constructions of receivers-who
   are also enabled to communicate populist discourse online. To understand
   the intersections of the supply- and demand-sides of populist discourse
   in the U.S. and Europe, this paper draws on extensive comparative
   qualitative content analyses of Trump's and Wilders' Tweets (N = 2681)
   and the electorates' discourse on Facebook (N = 657). The results
   provide important insights into the mechanisms of inclusion and
   exclusion at play in populist discourse and the affordances of social
   media in shaping populist and polarized discourse among politicians and
   the electorate at election times.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors describe the characteristics of Germany's
   foreign policy in Central Asia, which is included in the Common Foreign
   and Security Policy of the European Union. The aim of the article is to
   study the mutual conditioning of German and European politics in Central
   Asia, as well as the influence of other actors on these processes. The
   study used the paradigms of regional studies such as globalisation
   theories and postmodern theory, since the topic of the study is regional
   studies, affecting the regions of Europe and Central Asia. The theory of
   postmodernism and the theory of network integration were used to study
   the features of the trade and economic relations of states in the era of
   the post-industrial, information society. In the study context of the
   European Union and Russia crisis report on the relationship between the
   Federal Republic of Germany and Central Asian Republics, the smart power
   theory was used. The result of the analytical work is the identification
   of the general and the private in the relations of the Central Asian
   states with Germany and the European Union.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to comparative analysis of contemporary political
   theories of socio-cultural integration policy as a way of constructive
   conflict resolution in the North Caucasus. Latent ethno-political
   conflicts remain the most noticeable of contemporary challenges and
   threats to civil solidarity and ethnic peace in this unstable region.
   The fundamental issue that requires a constructive solution in order to
   ensure political stability in the North Caucasus region is the promotion
   of multi-level and inclusive sociocultural integration. This study
   claims that the escalation of protracted, deep-rooted conflicts is the
   result of large-scale social disintegration as a fundamental threat to
   the North Caucasus stability. Socio-cultural disintegration is
   superimposed on ethno-territorial and social polarization:
   ethno-political particularism, religious traditionalism and large-scale
   demodernization of the North Caucasus archaize regional identities,
   hindering the formation of civil society.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of the far right movement CasaPound
   Italia, from its origin to the 2018 general elections. In order to
   depict the link between fascism, four different facets have been taken
   into consideration: a) the characteristics of the Italian fascism before
   the beginning of the dictatorship and also during its Republican stage;
   b) the psychological backlash the neofascists experienced after their
   defeat in the Second World War; c) the dissident aspects of traditional
   neofascism represented by the former political party Movimento Sociale
   Italiano, focusing on the more common features within CasaPound Italia;
   d) the influences of the French Nouvelle Droite and the Italian
   extraparliamentary right. Subsequently the origin of the organization
   and its political participation within the context of the right wing
   systemic crisis and the reorganisation between 2008 and 2018 is
   discussed. Finally, details regarding the movement's main ideological
   patterns are provided, in addition to an analysis of its political
   program. To sum up, not only have certain links between traditional
   fascism and neofascism been substantiated, light has also been shed on
   the modernization of those aspects that the CasaPound Italia militants
   depicted as third millennium fascism.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to discuss the fight against corruption in Brazil
   and its impact on the UN 2030 Agenda affirmation, under Amartya Sen's
   Development as Freedom Theory, especially aspects related to the way
   transparency guarantees influences individuals' behavior patterns.
   Therefore, using the hypothetical-deductive method, at first, the
   Amartya Sen Development Theory was analyzed in order to subsequently
   assess its relationship with the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda,
   discussing the importance of institutional accountability and the
   effects of anti-corruption practices to achieve those goals. In the end,
   the conclusions were presented, demonstrating how tackling corruption,
   foreseen in 2030 Agenda goal 16.5, allows other objectives' fulfillment,
   such as integrity behavior, penetrating the essence of the institutions,
   interfering in their habits, customs, values, practices, and processes,
   alters the corruption culture to an ethic, integrity and transparency
   one. Consequently, they offer an improvement in public resources'
   allocation and in the provided services' quality thus leading Brazil to
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Wikipedia is a powerful tool that reinforces dominant knowledge
   paradigms, especially those emanating from the Global North.
   Simultaneously, it has subversive potential to challenge these
   paradigms, offering a far-reaching platform to voices that have been
   traditionally marginalized and underserved. Despite this potential,
   instructors often employ an ``abstinence approach{''} to Wikipedia,
   telling students to avoid using it in their academic work. This article
   advocates for active engagement with Wikipedia with the aim of
   challenging bias resulting from omission or underrepresentation of
   particular material to develop more diverse, publicly accessible
   political science content. First, I explain the theoretical objectives
   of the assignment and describe its structure. Then I reflect on its
   successes, challenges, and possible modifications.},

Title = {Unity or Distinction over Political Borders? The Impact of Mainstream

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This study exploits close elections in Sweden to assess the causal
   relationship between seat majorities for mainstream political parties
   and refugee reception policy. The study focuses on the two dominant
   mainstream political blocs, in a centre-right and a centre-left
   coalition, during three waves of elections from 2002 to 2010. In doing
   so, the study makes a few contributions to current research: Firstly,
   besides addressing a current knowledge gap in the focus on mainstream
   parties and refugee reception policy, this study investigates the impact
   of seat majorities which potentially have a more influential position
   compared to individual parties. Secondly, the study relies on an
   empirical strategy which allows comparison of comparable cases. Lastly,
   the study focuses on mainstream parties at the local level of government
   within one institutional context and thus addresses the obstacle of case
   comparability within cross-country studies. In conclusion, this study
   finds that the relationship between the mainstream political blocs and
   refugee reception policy is of an associative nature. In order to find
   significant estimates of seat majorities, the win margin for each bloc
   needs to be substantial. These results indicate that there is a unified
   political attitude over the mainstream blocs towards refugee reception
   and that other factors, and not political seat majorities, have
   contributed to the uneven distribution of refugees among municipalities
   in Sweden.},

Abstract = {Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and
   preferences for the information sources from which to obtain them,
   represent genuine differences of opinion or insincere cheerleading? The
   answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of
   partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with
   experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow
   respondents to search for information before answering each question. We
   find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information,
   but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in
   information search; these divides are no different from those that occur
   outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the
   same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning
   interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with
   congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their
   party in a favorable light.},

Abstract = {Literature on agenda-building dynamics has neglected to assess the
   impact of contextual factors on the interplays between the issue
   attention of political actors and of the media. I fill the void by
   highlighting how media storms cause significant changes to the electoral
   communicational environment. Using a custom dataset compiled through an
   automated content analysis, I empirically examine patterns of issue
   salience during the 2015 Canadian federal election. The results support
   three main points. First, media storms do emerge during election
   campaigns. Second, media storms cause two main types of changes in the
   informational environment that characterize nonstorm periods: (1) a
   reduction in the variety of issues included in the daily campaign
   coverage, and (2) a higher concentration of media attention on the
   storm-generating issues. Third, coverage of media storms compels
   political parties to engage with them, especially if they can exploit
   these storms with minimal risks. These findings suggest that some
   electoral contexts may be less conducive to political actors' influence.
   They also offer evidence in support of the mediatization theory,
   according to which media market logic can take precedence over political
   normative logic in guiding the decisions of political actors.},

Abstract = {When is oil a curse for health outcomes? This paper addresses the
   question by analyzing the effect of oil wealth on child mortality rates
   in nondemocratic countries. We argue that oil is particularly likely to
   harm child mortality when leaders have short time horizons. Such leaders
   are more likely to use oil revenues to finance private goods and
   patronage which builds their support coalition at the expense of public
   goods that benefit the broader population. We test this argument using
   panel regression and a global sample of nondemocratic regimes,
   supplemented with a case study of Cameroon. Results from both empirical
   approaches are consistent with our argument. These findings identify
   some specific conditions under which oil can be detrimental to child
   mortality, and thus explain some of the variation in health outcomes
   across oil-producing states.},

Title = {Defending the European court of human rights: Experimental evidence from
   Britain},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {As nationalist sentiments gain traction globally, the attitudinal and
   institutional foundations of the international liberal order face new
   challenges. One manifestation of this trend is the growing backlash
   against international courts. Defenders of the liberal order struggle to
   articulate compelling reasons for why states, and their citizens, should
   continue delegating authority to international institutions. This
   article probes the effectiveness of arguments that emphasise the
   appropriateness and benefits of cooperation in containing preferences
   for backlash among the mass public. We rely on IR theories that explain
   why elites create international institutions to derive three sets of
   arguments that could be deployed to boost support for international
   courts. We then use experimental methods to test their impact on support
   for backlash against the European Court of Human Rights in Britain
   (ECtHR). First, in line with principal-agent models of delegation, we
   find that information about the court's reliability as an `agent' boosts
   support for the ECtHR, but less so information that signals Britain's
   status as a principal. Second, in line with constructivist approaches,
   associating support for the court with the position of an in-group state
   like Denmark, and opposition with an out-group state like Russia, also
   elicits more positive attitudes. This finding points to the importance
   of `blame by association' and cues of in/out-group identity in building
   support for cooperation. The effect is stronger when we increase social
   pressure by providing information about social attitudes towards Denmark
   and Russia in Britain, where the public overwhelmingly trusts the Danes
   and distrusts the Russians. Finally, in contrast to Liberal explanations
   for the creation of the ECtHR, the study finds no evidence that
   highlighting the court's mission to promote democracy and international
   peace contains backlash. We show that the positive effects of the first
   two arguments are not driven by pre-treatment attitudes such as
   political sophistication, patriotism, internationalism, institutional
   trust or political preferences.},

Abstract = {It is time to reclaim the egalitarian democratic purposes of public
   universities. Public universities and colleges play a crucial political
   and public role in a democratic society. Yet much of the higher
   education literature looks at higher education through an economic
   framework. This paper argues that a healthy and broadly accessible
   higher education system serves the democratic public interest in a
   democratic polity such as the United States. It concludes by arguing
   that public universities could serve the public interest more
   effectively with an expansive view of who the ``public{''} is and of
   their role as anchor institutions for democracy.},

Abstract = {Long histories and entrenched habits of inattention among advantaged
   groups mean that even minor challenge and concession can provoke
   subjective perceptions of victimization. How, in such conditions, might
   claims of structural injustice break through? Drawing on field work with
   practitioners across conflict mediation, therapy, education, and
   performance - four sectors that facilitate listening in fraught contexts
   yet are undertheorized in politics - this article makes the case that
   among the most overlooked and powerful resources for cultivating
   receptivity and responsiveness among advantaged groups are the arts of
   listening. Practices of engagement across these sectors establish
   listening as potent rather than passive, given the extent to which it
   constitutes the field of encounter and shapes what emerges within it,
   both in terms of expression and, more significantly in this context,
   receptivity of those to whom one listens. Yet this also means that how
   one listens is a pivotal consideration - particularly when listening
   might serve to reinforce and normalize unjustly dominant positions. In
   contrast to progressive politics' emphasis on finding more forceful
   forms of voice and conventional reliance on direct communicative
   practices, this article explores how specific comedic, theatrical, and
   embodied tactics can generate `oblique forms of listening' potentially
   useful to social justice struggles.},

Title = {Citizens' Attitudes Towards Municipal Mergers - Individual-level
   Explanations},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Municipal mergers are one of the most common reforms of jurisdiction
   size. While there are many studies of municipal mergers at the
   contextual level and some about how mergers affect opinions, studies of
   how individual citizens regard prospective mergers are still scarce.
   Thus, we study why citizens have different opinions on prospective
   mergers that are yet to be decided on. Specifically, the factors of main
   interest in this study are political efficacy and political trust since
   these relate to how citizens make sense of the complex and uncertain
   reforms that municipal mergers are. To study this, we disseminated a
   population survey (N = 6,686) in the Finnish municipality of Korsholm in
   2018. At that time, a merger was planned with the neighboring city of
   Vaasa. This merger was surrounded by a very heated debate, mainly due to
   the fact that the merger would have affected the position of language
   minorities (a very salient issue in bilingual Finland) whereby the
   Swedish-speaking majority in Korsholm would become a minority in a
   merged new municipality. Using regression analyses where internal- and
   external political efficacy and political trust are tested as predictors
   of opinions on this proposed merger, with control for demographic,
   socio-economic and social factors, the study demonstrates that external
   efficacy and political trust have independent significant impact on
   citizens' opinions on mergers. The findings also show that salient
   issues connected to mergers are important factors as are social factors.},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Over the past twenty years, there has been much discussion about two of
   the most important recent trends in American politics: the increase in
   income inequality in the United States and the increase in ideological
   and partisan polarization, particularly in the U.S. House. These two
   national-level trends are commonly thought to be positively related.
   But, there are few tested theoretical connections between them, and it
   is potentially problematic to infer individual-level behavior from these
   aggregate-level trends. In fact, an examination of the literature
   reveals, at least, three different theoretical outcomes for
   district-level income inequality on voter and congressional ideological
   positions. I explore these district-level theoretical and empirical
   possibilities as well as test them over decades with three different
   measures of income inequality. I argue and demonstrate that higher
   district levels of income inequality are related to higher levels of
   ideological liberalism in the U.S. House. This stands in contrast to the
   national-level trends, but it tracks closely to traditional
   understandings of congressional behavior.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Poor health is generally believed to cause political passivity. Prior
   studies that satisfactorily acknowledge the causality problems involved
   are mainly limited to considering turnout and the U.S.A., so we lack
   knowledge of how non-electoral participation is affected in other
   countries. This article considers Sweden, characterized by a generous
   welfare state and an extensive public health system. Using unique panel
   data, which allow more thorough analyses of causality, poor health was
   found to have a negative effect on voting but not on non-electoral
   participation. By primarily focusing on other countries than Sweden and
   the U.S.A., it is a task for future longitudinal research to show
   whether the belief that poor health lead to political passivity is
   incorrect-or whether Sweden is an exceptional case, due to the barriers
   to participation being particularly low there.},

Abstract = {Voters use heuristics to help them make decisions when they lack
   information about political choices. Candidate appearance operates as a
   powerful low-information cue. However, widely held stereotypes mean that
   reliance on such a heuristic can reduce support for candidates of color.
   We argue that racial prejudices are more likely to dominate decision
   making when electoral environments require voters to expend more
   cognitive resources-such as when they must choose multiple candidates at
   once. Using two experiments we find that black candidates receive less
   support from cognitively taxed voters than from voters who have the
   cognitive space to intentionally limit their prejudices when voting. We
   also reveal that this pattern is particularly evident among
   ideologically liberal voters. Respondents who profess politically
   liberal views support black candidates more often than white candidates
   when the cognitive task is simple but are less likely to do so when they
   are cognitively taxed.},

Title = {Devolution, ``new politics{''} and election pledge fulfilment in
   Scotland, 1999-2011},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The institutions of Scottish devolution were designed using the
   majoritarian Westminster system as a ``negative template{''} with the
   hope that a more consensual ``new politics{''} would emerge. The
   electoral system successfully prevented a single-party majority in the
   first three sessions of the Scottish Parliament. But did this bring
   about the desired changes in party behaviour? Research on the connection
   between campaign promises and government actions shows that it is
   strongest in the United Kingdom-where single-party majorities are the
   norm-and weakest in countries where multiparty coalitions are common. If
   new politics had succeeded in its aims, we would expect Scottish
   governments to fulfil a lower proportion of manifesto pledges than
   British governments. This study investigates the extent to which the
   1999 and 2003 Scottish Labour-Liberal Democrat coalitions and the 2007
   SNP minority administration fulfilled their campaign pledges using an
   original dataset containing 600 individual manifesto pledges. All three
   parties are found to have fulfilled pledges at a rate comparable to
   Westminster governments. These findings reinforce the notion that the
   reality of post-devolution Scottish politics fell short of its
   designers' ambitions. Supplementary analyses provide further support for
   inferences made in previous pledge studies concerning the factors which
   contribute to pledge fulfilment.},

Abstract = {In our fieldwork, we frequently encountered forced migrants who
   articulate discourses that engage in the hierarchization,
   essentialization, and othering of other migrants. This led us to
   interrogate our positioning as researchers vis-a-vis our informants: by
   endorsing the language of (un)deserving migrants, were some of the
   informants exhibiting ``false consciousness{''}? Is the researcher's
   role to uncover a ``true consciousness{''} and correct such ideological
   ``confusions{''}? What would this imply for our understanding of
   migrants' agency? The researcher's positionality can lead to projecting
   one's political subjectivity onto migrants at the risk of dismissing
   certain narratives as misguided. Rejecting the explanation of a
   self-deceived migrant consciousness and challenging the transcendent
   positioning of the researcher, we propose a re-articulation of the
   concept of agency in order to engage migrant voices from an immanent and
   non-prescriptive positioning. We argue that migrant expressions of
   agency are pragmatic attempts to re-appropriate norms within a
   constraining social context.},

Abstract = {As the USA initiated strategies of democracy promotion to support the
   spread of democracy, a key element involved democracy assistance.
   However, some states receive substantial commitments of US democracy aid
   while other states receive little or none, and the mix of democracy
   assistance varies in allocation between civil society and institutional
   channels. This study examines democracy aid allocation, focusing on the
   role of regime conditions on the targeting and composition of the aid.
   We disaggregate regime type to differentiate among non-democratic
   governments and argue that such differences affect both the amount of
   democracy aid and whether aid packages target government institutions or
   civil society channels. We theorize how these regime conditions shape
   allocations, controlling for donor interests and recipient features, and
   test our argument against US democracy aid allocations by the US Agency
   for International Development (USAID) from 1975 to 2010. We conclude
   with discussion of the implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {In this article I aim to show that compulsory voting cannot be defended
   on democratic grounds. In pursuing this task, I first offer a generic
   account of the democratic argument in favor of compulsory voting,
   drawing on some of the most salient recent defenses of a moral duty to
   vote. I then offer an overarching objection that defeats both the
   generic form of the democratic argument for compulsory voting and its
   various operationalizations. The crux of the objection is that the
   democratic justification of a moral duty to vote is parasitical upon the
   existence of a moral duty to vote well. This decisively undermines the
   democratic argument for compulsory voting, since the latter can only be
   deployed as an enforcement mechanism for a duty to vote, regardless of
   the substantive content of that vote.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the politicization of local activism in Russia caused
   by the 2011-12 protest movement ``For Fair Elections{''}. The authors
   propose the theoretical model of an eventful social change at a micro
   level integrating different approaches such as pragmatic sociology,
   cultural sociology, eventful approach, and social movement studies. They
   argue that before the protests, Russian local activism was apolitical as
   it was based on the ethical opposition between (good) ``real deeds{''}
   and (bad) ``politics{''}, as well as on the anti-ideological belief in
   the authenticity of ``self-evident{''} facts. The politicization of
   a-political activism was stimulated by the ``eventful protests{''} of
   2011-2012 and was not a break with a-politicism, but new arrangements of
   ``self-evident{''} facts and ideological campaigning, of oppositional
   ``politics{''} and getting real things done.},

Title = {Green Criminology and State-Corporate Crime: The Ecocide-Genocide Nexus
   with Examples from Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Following the lead of researchers in other disciplines, a handful of
   state and corporate crime, and green criminological researchers have
   addressed crimes such as genocide and ecocide. Criminologists have drawn
   attention to the intersection of state and corporate crimes (i.e.
   state-corporate crime), and illustrated how state and corporate crimes
   victimized, among other groups and other places, citizens of African
   nations. More recently, criminologists, particularly green
   criminologists, have begun to examine the connection between genocide
   and ecocide, or how the human destruction of ecosystems and people are
   inter-related, and reflect features of state-corporate crime. The
   current study examines these issues and extends that discussion by
   describing how the intersection of genocide-ecocide can be linked to
   treadmill of production arguments and related approaches in
   environmental sociology. Specifically, we suggest that the
   ecocide-genocide nexus is useful for understanding how the destruction
   of people and ecosystems by states and corporations intersect throughout
   the history of capitalism, with evidence that many contemporary
   genocides are driven by ecocide and efforts to expand raw material
   resource withdrawals controlled by the capitalist treadmill of
   production. This perspective is then applied to the case of Nigeria to
   illustrate how the oil-related treadmill of production and the history
   of governance in Nigeria facilitated eco-genocide, or the genocide of
   Native Nigerians through ecological destruction over the past half
   century. Our argument links concepts and theory from environmental
   sociology, state-corporate crime research, green criminology, ecological
   Marxism, human rights scholarship and various other literatures
   addressing ecocide and genocide. We describe how the capitalist
   treadmill of production, as a specific phase in the history of
   capitalism, continues the historical tendencies toward ecocide-genocide
   generated by colonial capitalism, and how the interaction between state
   and corporate behaviour facilitates expanded production and profit
   making through accelerated rates of ecological withdrawal which then
   promotes ecologically induced genocide.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of personality traits on political
   participation in Taiwan in an effort to broaden our understanding of
   this topic in Asia. In contrast to research on other countries, this
   study finds that personality traits are not directly associated with
   individual turnout decisions and protest participation in Taiwan.
   However, personality traits mediate the effects of attitudinal factors
   on voter turnout and protest participation. Specifically, political
   interest mediates the effects of extraversion, agreeableness and
   conscientiousness on voter turnout and protest participation, while
   strength of partisanship also mediates the effect of extraversion and
   agreeableness on voter turnout. In contrast to other countries, our
   findings suggest that political efficacy does not play a mediating role
   in the relationships between personality traits and political
   participation in Taiwan. This study indicates the importance of
   mediation mechanisms in understanding the influence of personality
   traits on political participation and implies heterogeneous effects for
   personality traits between countries.},

Abstract = {Street-level bureaucrats set the terms for policy implementation and
   often operate under limited oversight. In American elections, poll
   workers are the street-level bureaucrats tasked with implementing a
   jurisdiction's laws for verifying voter eligibility. Using in-depth
   interviews with 24 poll workers from the city of Chicago, this article
   assesses how poll workers make decisions about voter eligibility under
   Illinois' signature-matching law. Respondents discussed a range of
   considerations used when they examine voter eligibility. The evidence I
   present suggests they rely on personal perspectives and experiences in
   their evaluations. Respondents also offered a range of responses for how
   they would proceed in the instance of a mismatching signature-including
   requesting voters provide identification even though it is not a
   requirement in Illinois unless a voter is challenged. Broadly, these
   results illustrate how poll workers' subjective interpretations of
   election law shape their decisions and can lead to idiosyncratic
   applications of election law.},

Abstract = {St Helena is a British Overseas Territory. This paper investigates how
   an imagined and ideological link between Britain and the island was
   created, maintained and eventually weakened. British citizenship was
   removed in 1981. Since its return in 2002, many St Helenians have
   migrated to the UK. Whilst an ideological sense of Britishness has
   weakened, a sense of lived Britishness has simultaneously occurred.
   Investigating the feelings, emotions and cultural values within this
   small migrant community, the islanders are far from deluded about their
   downgraded national identity and, as a community, are willing to
   articulate their mixed emotions.},

Abstract = {Based on an original large-N data set of Serbian firms privatized
   between 2002 and 2011, and qualitative evidence, this article applies
   survival modeling to network data to analyze the political foundations
   of renationalization. I build on embeddedness scholarship and
   hypothesize that renationalization is influenced by varying patterns of
   embeddedness of firms in political and ownership networks. In contrast
   with expectations of the state capture literature, I find that
   politically connected firms are more likely to be renationalized than
   non-politicized ones, whereas firms owned by domestic corporate owners
   are less likely to be renationalized than those owned by non-corporate
   owners. I theorize my findings as the logic of extraction, showing that
   renationalization in politically connected firms happens either as an
   unintended consequence of extraction or of predation, and as the logic
   of reciprocity, which demonstrates that domestic corporate owners are
   more likely to avoid renationalization because they can offer favors to
   political parties.},

Abstract = {Does European soft law matter? In order to answer this question, the
   article investigates the processes through which the European Union (EU)
   affects domestic politics and policies in the eHealth sector in France,
   Austria and Ireland. More precisely, it shows how the hardening of EU
   soft law creates a new rationale for the use of European instruments by
   domestic actors, thus expanding their strategic opportunities for policy
   making at the national level. Despite the empirical diversity of the
   cases, similar patterns of variation in Europeanisation mechanisms
   emerge over time, and the data show how the varying structure of
   European soft instruments (i.e. their degrees of `hardness') accounts
   for these changes. This comparative analysis includes multiple
   process-tracing cases of eHealth public policy making in France, Austria
   and Ireland in which Europeanisation processes are at work.},

Abstract = {Automatic voter registration (AVR) is a recent innovation in voter
   registration in the United States, passed by 18 states plus DC in the
   last 4 years. AVR has generally escaped partisan polarization about
   election reform, having passed in Republican and Democratic controlled
   states. Using a survey experiment in the 2018 Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study, we investigate effects of source cues about support of
   AVR from different party elites and from election administrators on the
   public's expectations about AVR's impact on turnout, voter fraud,
   fairness, and election problems. Our experimental results show an
   asymmetric partisan effect. When AVR is endorsed by Democratic leaders,
   Republicans (and independents) expect AVR to reduce the fairness and
   legitimacy of elections, while Democrats are generally resistant to
   partisan cues.},

Abstract = {Regional and sub-regional organisations in Africa play vital roles in
   the promotion of peace and security on the continent. The African Peace
   and Security Architecture (APSA) mandates certain roles for
   AU-recognised Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and RECs have been
   active in many peace and security spheres from early warning to peace
   missions. This article seeks to illuminate the changing landscape of
   regional security governance in Africa, primarily through the lens of
   formal peace agreements, which are important tools for ending violent
   conflict. Extant research does not establish the frequency and capacity
   of regional organisations'engagementin peace agreements. We present
   original quantitative data, systematically tracing these evolving and
   uneven activities. Our data establishes trends of REC peace agreement
   engagement that vary across Africa's sub-regions during 2002-2015. We
   further explore patterns of organisationalinteraction, presenting case
   studies of peace processes that highlight important variation in terms
   of the distribution of influence and authority.},

Abstract = {Given the urgency of redressing South Africa's unjust legacies of the
   past, we interrogate the nature of support and opposition to restitution
   in South Africa. Informed by responses to the nationally representative
   South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), we contend that South
   Africa remains deeply polarised when it comes to addressing these unjust
   legacies, with race being the major fault line. When it comes to
   restitution, South Africans are worlds apart on three levels. We are
   worlds apart across racial groups; we are worlds apart within racial
   groups, and we are worlds apart in the kind of language we wish to use
   in framing our pursuit of equality. In the final analysis, while South
   Africans may be unified in the acknowledgement that the inequality gap
   is too high, and perhaps even unified in a desire for change, there is a
   fundamental disagreement about the desirable vehicles we hope to employ.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Engaging in public discussion and debate are crucial aspects of the
   impact agenda, but what are the politics of this engagement? What
   happens when female academics engage with, or are reported by, media in
   disseminating their research? Does negative impact `count' as impact?
   Adopting a poststructuralist intersectional feminist analysis, this
   article uses the REF policy agenda as a case study in order to explore
   these questions. Drawing on extensive qualitative interview data, I
   operationalize the concept `cultural sexism' as a mechanism to connect
   micro and macro analysis, using cumulative individual experiences to
   render visible wider social and political power structures. This article
   argues that while women may seek to actively build impact and public
   engagement in to their research agendas, we need to be cognizant that
   the site of interaction between media and academia is gendered and
   raced. I argue that we therefore need to reflect upon the ethics of
   pursuing a policy which (1) disproportionately exposes a diversity of
   women to structural and symbolic violence (2) has the potential to
   silence women's contribution to knowledge and (3) conversely may serve
   to simply privilege masculinised assumptions as to what does and does
   not count as knowledge.},

Abstract = {Affluent Americans have disproportionate influence over policymaking and
   often use their power to advance conservative economic policies that
   increase inequality. I show that this behavior is partially driven by
   affluent Americans' desire for social status. First, I use a new survey
   scale to show that affluent Americans' desire for social status strongly
   predicts their level of economic conservatism. Second, I test my theory
   experimentally in the context of social media. On sites like Facebook,
   Instagram, and Twitter, affluent Americans compete for social status by
   sharing curated versions of their lives that highlight their upper-class
   lifestyle. When I randomly assign affluent Americans to experience this
   status competition, it causes them to become more economically
   conservative. The results help us understand the social and
   psychological origins of economic conservatism among affluent Americans,
   and provide the first evidence that social media encourages political
   behaviors that are conducive to inequality.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the methodology and practice behind planning and
   executing the Comparative Interest Group-survey project (CIG-survey).
   The CIG-survey includes surveys among national populations of organized
   interests in 9 European countries and at the European Union level.
   Although surveys are a useful and reliable way to collect data on a
   variety of topics, there are also numerous pitfalls and challenges in
   surveying interest groups, especially across multiple countries. Despite
   the prominent use of surveys in interest group research, systematic
   reflections on this method are scarce and data sets are not always
   properly archived or openly accessible. This article elaborates upon the
   practical implications and reflects on the lessons learnt during from
   the implementation of the CIG-survey. Moreover, we highlight how the
   fuzzy boundaries of interest communities obfuscate sampling and that
   surveying interest organizations requires researchers to navigate
   through a specific organizational context to reach and motivate
   respondents. We also demonstrate how a careful survey plan can
   positively affect response rates and enable the creation of robust
   comparative data sets.},

Abstract = {The `asylum paradox' is a pivotal feature of refugee politics in the
   Global North: In order to effectively claim and obtain refugee rights,
   refugees are forced to cross borders illegally because of the lack of
   legal entry options. As a result, access to refugee protection has
   become a controversial issue, and civil society initiatives have begun
   mobilizing people for safe passage and escape aid. This paper analyses a
   range of such practices in Germany and Austria. While some initiatives
   focus on existent, but barely implemented legal entry channels, such as
   resettlement, family reunification, or relocation, others directly
   facilitate the transit of refugees, including undocumented border
   crossings. In the context of dominant border regimes, members of these
   organizations oscillate between positions of `active citizens' and
   `activist citizens' (Isin). In different ways, these initiatives
   demonstrate notions of community and belonging, pointing to practices of
   transnational solidarity that include people on the move.},

Abstract = {This article recounts the story of sanctuary city organizing in Ottawa,
   Canada to explore the politics and potential of a transformative
   approach to sanctuary rooted in anti-prison activism and abolitionist
   feminist thought. More specifically, we have adapted the abolitionist
   framework of reformist reform and non-reformist reform and applied it to
   sanctuary city organizing. Analysis of the Ottawa case draws on research
   with frontline service providers and migrant justice organizers, as well
   as our own organizing experiences, observations, and adaptive practices
   as sanctuary city campaigners. The paper also elaborates on the forms of
   solidarity and citizenship that have emerged or have the potential to
   emerge in the context of a non-state centric vision of sanctuary that
   prioritizes grassroots transformative practices over municipal policy
   and that do not bolster or legitimize the state's capacity to deport,
   punish, and exclude.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The American Dream is central to the national ethos, reflecting people's
   optimism that all who are willing to work hard can achieve a better life
   than their parents. Separate from the support for the idea of the
   American Dream itself is whether the public believes it is attainable.
   We consider the origins and dynamics of the public's belief in the
   achievability of the American Dream. Is the American Dream a symbolic
   vision, rooted in political socialization rather than contemporary
   politics? Or does optimism about the American Dream follow from the
   viability of the dream, rising with economic prosperity and falling with
   declining opportunity? We develop a new macrolevel measure of belief in
   the American Dream from 1973 to 2018. We show that it moves over time,
   responsive to changes in social mobility, income inequality, and
   economic perceptions. As inequality increases, belief in the
   attainability of the American Dream declines.},

Abstract = {This article adds to the literature on digital capitalisms by
   introducing a new state-led model called `digital ID capitalism'. Here,
   state agencies help guarantee personal data for commercial exploitation
   by connecting it to the provision of state welfare services. This is in
   contrast to the usual focus on US Big Tech corporations' use of personal
   data from the internet. Describing how the system works in India, it
   explains how businesses make money from the personal data collected.
   While doing so, it draws some of its elements into traditional political
   economy concerns with the relationships between state, business and
   labour. The benefit of framing it as a capitalist system is that it
   sharpens the focus on the corresponding social relations and potential
   for group governance of this important twenty-first century resource.},

Abstract = {Policy scholars can learn a great deal from students of clientelism with
   respect to the forces at work in the policy process. This is apparent,
   for example, with respect to scholarship in recent years which has
   focused attention on the idea of replacing patchworks of public policies
   in specific issue areas with more coordinated or `integrated' policy
   strategies (IS). In theory, such strategies should display a judicious
   mix of policy goals and means which can produce policy outcomes matched
   to specific large-scale problem contexts. Empirical work on such
   strategies, however, has shown the resilience of pre-existing policy
   elements often leading to reform failures and/or sub-optimal outcomes
   from such efforts. This article examines a case study of large-scale
   policy reform efforts in the area of Integrated Land Management (ILM) in
   Western Canada which reveals the role played by policy clientelism in
   blocking efforts to enhance policy integration in this area. This
   finding is significant in pointing out more generally the role played by
   clientelism in preventing successful policy reform.},

Abstract = {In September 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) to gear up in countering imminent ``struggles{''}
   and in achieving the ambitious ``two centennial{''} targets amid the
   US-China trade war, Hong Kong unrest and a slowing economy. A novel
   coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that erupted in Wuhan in October
   2019 had scuppered China's timeline to achieve its targets. While China
   successfully curbed the spread of COVID-19 within its border, enormous
   challenges lie ahead for China to maintain its economic growth and
   social stability. The daunting combat against the COVID-19 pandemic
   marks the beginning of the testing time.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of legislative speeches made by prime ministers and
   party representatives in parliamentary sessions in Japan from 1953 to
   2013, we argue that it is possible to place parties according to a
   dimension that captures their confrontational nature within a
   parliamentary democracy and its evolution over time. Using this
   dimension extracted via a well-known scaling algorithm (Wordfish), we
   develop an index of the intensity of the government-opposition divide
   that is directly related to the dynamics of the electoral cycle of
   Japanese politics. We then show how this new index greatly facilitates
   the investigation of two important aspects of Japanese legislative
   politics (the survival rate of governments and the speed of passage of
   cabinet bills) compared to a situation in which we focus on more
   traditional measures capturing the ideological position of the parties
   alone.},

Abstract = {Existing research offers competing predictions as to whether election
   outcomes affect the future political behavior of individual supporters.
   Drawing on a dataset of millions of donors across thousands of
   candidates in different races, this study analyzes a series of
   regression discontinuities to estimate the effect of donating to a
   barely winning candidate as opposed to a barely losing one. It finds
   that winning donors were substantially more likely to donate in the
   future to that same office type. These effects are large and occur even
   when their original candidate was not up for re-election. The results
   show that the consequences of election outcomes extend beyond control of
   a particular seat, and affect the future behavior of ordinary citizens.},

Abstract = {Does local oversight improve public service delivery? We study the
   effect of a mobile phone application that allows citizens to monitor
   school construction projects in Brazilian municipalities. The app
   prompts users to submit data about construction sites, sends such
   crowdsourced information to independent engineers, and contacts the
   mayors' offices about project delays. Our results show that the app has
   a null impact on school construction indicators. Additionally, we find
   that politicians are unresponsive to individual requests. The results
   question the impact of bottom-up monitoring on public service
   performance and suggest that interventions targeted at other groups, or
   focused on different issues, may produce better policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the application of the spitzenkandidaten procedure
   as instances of a larger institution building process in which the
   European Parliament and the European Council try to enact competing
   rules. The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a new clause on how to appoint
   the Commission President. While in 2014 the European Parliament
   successfully realised its interpretation according to which the winning
   spitzenkandidat became Commission President, in 2019 the Council
   succeeded in deciding not only who would take the Commission presidency
   but also other key positions. We consider both appointments as cases of
   decision-making in a natural arena that lack stable institutions about
   how to appoint the Commission president. Accordingly, the single
   decisions pended on the case-specific strategic use of resources. While
   the analysis of the two single cases does not allow us to predict what
   the institutional rules for future appointments will be, we can identify
   key resources and strategies that will determine how the institutional
   rules will be shaped in the elections to come and thus further the
   understanding of the institutionalisation in the making.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {Previous studies have found that deliberative practices such as
   mini-publics produce opinion changes among participants. Nevertheless,
   the underlying mechanisms and whether these conform to deliberative
   ideals have received much less attention. This is problematic since
   research on public opinion and political psychology suggests that
   political opinions often are unstable or driven by prior notions. For
   this reason, we examine the underlying mechanisms of change in opinions
   and attitude consistency. We do so with data from an experiment with two
   deliberative treatments-cross-cutting and like-minded discussions-as
   well as a control group, where no deliberation took place to be able to
   determine whether deliberation actually cause the observed changes. The
   results suggest that participants in cross-cutting deliberation are more
   willing to change opinions, even when they have prior experiences with
   discussing the topic at hand, which is in line with deliberative theory,
   but attitude consistency is largely unaffected by the deliberations.},

Abstract = {From February to September 1988, Iraqi Kurds were subjected to a
   genocidal operation by the Iraqi government, known as the Anfal
   operation. The operation lasted just over seven months but it had a
   devastating impact on most parts of rural Kurdistan in Iraq, resulting
   in the killing of thousands of Kurdish civilians. Most scholars have
   overlooked the multiple strategies, dimensions of and motivations for
   the operations and have mostly focused on and/or examined the military
   and genocidal dimensions of the operation. This article examines some of
   data and documents as well as secondary sources related to the Anfal
   operation directly or indirectly. It scrutinizes the pattern of
   casualties and disappearances of the Kurdish civilians during operations
   in order to identify and explain the motives of the Iraqi state. It
   argues that although the Iraqi government's objectives and intentions
   were multidimensional, two dimensions were the primary ones; the first
   one security and the second identity. In the Security-Anfal the
   intention was to overcome the Kurdish rebel groups; however, in the
   Identity-Anfal the key motive was the de-Kurdification of the Kirkuk
   province in order to Arabize the areas of Iraqi Kurdistan that were
   strategically significant economically and politically.},

Abstract = {Since 9/11 western and non-western governments have implemented
   counter-counter terrorism and de-radicalisation programs to ``inoculate
   Muslim populations{''} and de-radicalise those deemed as radicalised
   through securitization and ``moderate Islam{''}. The Indonesian
   government and civil society organizations have attempted to address
   radicalisation by setting up counter-radicalisation and
   de-radicalisation programs. This paper will critically reflect on the
   Indonesian de-radicalisation programs. It will first critically discuss
   the terms radicalisation and de-radicalisation. Then critically assess
   the Indonesian de-radicalisation programs. In the final section, the
   author suggests that Indonesia needs to introduce humanitarian
   activities to make the de-radicalisation programs more effective and
   overcome labelling and stigmatization.},

   International Organization for Migration (IOM) to the participation of
   victims in the municipality of Pasto and argues that such support
   contributed to the development of bottom-up transitional justice by
   encouraging victim's active role and promoting their participation in
   their own terms, which exerted a transformative power pr victims and
   post-agreement processes. These findings are relevant within a liberal
   context of transitional justice that has focused on satisfying the state
   needs and has not allowed a real influence of the victims. The article
   is based on fieldwork carried out in the cities of Pasto and Bagota. We
   use a qualitative methodology, including semi-structured interviews,

Abstract = {What happens when local governments hire lobbyists? Although
   intergovernmental lobbying is common in the United States and other
   federal systems, we know little about its consequences. Using newly
   compiled data on state-level lobbying across the country, I establish a
   positive correlation between city lobbying and state funding. I then
   introduce over a decade of panel data on municipal lobbying in
   California to estimate the returns to lobbying for cities with a
   difference-in-differences design. I show that lobbying increases state
   transfers to cities by around 8\%. But the benefits of intergovernmental
   lobbying are not equally distributed. I find that cities with higher
   levels of own-source revenue per capita net more state money when they
   hire lobbyists, despite enjoying a local revenue advantage. These
   results offer some of the first empirical evidence that city officials
   can influence state spending by lobbying-but this behavior may also
   perpetuate local economic inequality.},

Abstract = {How do deep economic crises reshuffle dominant policy frameworks?
   Institutionalist scholars such as Peter Hall, Mark Blyth, Vivien Schmidt
   and Colin Hay have focused particularly on the 1980s. The polarizing
   ascension of Thatcher and Reagan, characterized by a public battle of
   ideas, has become the prime example of a broader neoliberal turn. Based
   on this experience, it is common to assume that a shift in policy
   paradigm involves a politicized contest over ideas. The Dutch
   market-oriented reforms of the 1980s have long been described as a
   counterexample, representing an alternative, consensual trajectory of
   institutional change. As critics have pointed out, the problem with this
   account is that there is little evidence for an economic policy
   consensus in the 1980s. Based on the Dutch case, this paper proposes a
   third, depoliticized model of institutional change, where policy makers
   instigate a battle of ideas within the institutions, while politicians
   depoliticize the reforms in public debate.},

Abstract = {Major political events around the globe have been subject to
   disinformation campaigns that leverage intentionally misleading content
   to influence public opinion. The disruption created by the
   micro-targeted dissemination of disinformation presents a problem for
   democracies: how should democracies, where legitimacy is derived from
   free and fair elections, respond to this phenomenon? In the United
   Kingdom, Westminster's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
   Committee opened an inquiry into the role of disinformation in the
   Brexit vote that culminated with numerous recommendations. Using
   securitization theory as a framework for analysis, this article explores
   the work of the DCMS Committee and its reception by the UK Government,
   Facebook, and the general public. It contributes to a deeper
   understanding of how democracies can respond to disinformation,
   providing a building block for future studies on state strategies to
   regulate technology platforms. The findings suggest the Committee
   successfully established a securitizing frame around disinformation.},

Abstract = {This article examines why and how a regulation on retail banking fees,
   commissions, and charges emerged in Turkey after a long period of
   regulatory forbearance. The article shows that when regulatory
   forbearance caused stasis, and the ``statist{''}, exclusionary
   policymaking context limited consumer groups' access to the policymaking
   process, consumer groups challenged the policy regime of the banking
   sector and the regulator by appealing to another state actor, the
   Ministry of Customs and Trade. The Ministry took advantage of an
   opportunity structure to pass a new consumer protection law which
   assigned a de facto mandate on the regulatory agency to regulate fees,
   commissions, and charges. The article argues that the regulatory policy
   change was a product of a policy regime change with the Ministry
   emerging as a veto player, as it redefined the institutional
   arrangements in the policymaking process, and imposed its preferences
   and its stricter policy approach. As such, the article contributes to
   our understanding of the conditions of how diffuse interest groups can
   trigger regulatory policy change, but more importantly policy regime
   change.},

Abstract = {Rodrigo Duterte won the Philippines' 2016 presidential elections thanks
   to a well-orchestrated campaign and his populist appeal among Filipinos.
   Soon after he assumed the presidency, he surprised and upset most of his
   domestic and western international audiences by pragmatically rejecting
   the pro-Western approach followed by the previous Aquino administration
   and adopting a China-friendly one. Adopting Critical Discourse Analysis,
   this research reveals President Duterte's bicephalous leadership:
   populist in domestic policies, and pragmatic but unpopular in foreign
   relations. To qualitatively describe the dichotomy between the populist
   and pragmatic nature of Duterte's leadership, this article surveys the
   Philippines' mainstream media from 2016 to 2019. Furthermore, this
   analysis shows that Duterte is using a defensive neorealist approach in
   building Philippines-China relations and that Filipinos are willing to
   consider China as a constructive partner for their country.},

Abstract = {This conclusion ties together the various contributions to the Special
   Issue from the perspective of the introductory framework. Based on this
   framework, the conclusion shows that: (i) domestic mediating factors are
   responsible for nuanced state rescaling outcomes in small unitary
   states, (ii) the EU has led to decentralization and recentralization in
   both phases of the EU decision-making process and (iii) the level of
   authority is the best predictor of SNAs' empowerment, although this is
   intertwined with secondary mediating domestic factors. This concluding
   article sheds new light on the hybrid nature of the European polity and
   demonstrates that states remain the most important pieces of the
   European `puzzle'. The Special Issue arrives at two conclusions: first,
   we are witnessing a `transformation of the state' rather than its
   demise, and second, the notion of a `Europe of the Regions' in small
   unitary states is nothing more than a `damp squib'.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how economic intervention affects individuals'
   political behaviour by assessing the impact of intervention on aggregate
   and individual turnout. The intervention of the European Union in a
   selection of member states is viewed as having negative consequences for
   democratic choice, reducing the ability of voters to select between
   distinct policy alternatives, resulting in the absence of the primary
   benefit of voting: choice. It is argued that when voters are faced with
   electoral choices without the ability to shape policy alternatives, they
   are less likely to vote. Moreover, the negative effect of intervention
   is found to be conditioned by both individuals' level of education and
   ideological identification. Voters on the centre and the left who feel
   abandoned by left-leaning parties, who have prioritised being
   responsible to their European paymasters, are significantly more likely
   to abstain when exposed to intervention. Empirical support for the
   argument is found via the analysis of aggregate turnout as well as
   individual level data from the European Social Survey from across
   fifteen Western European states.},

Abstract = {A critical evaluation of the official stance of Shaykh Al-Azhar Ahmad
   Al-Taayeb since the beginning of the protests on 25th January 2011 and
   until the military intervention on 30th of June 2013 merits particular
   attention. Al-Azhar did play an important political role in directing
   the revolutionary tide in Egypt based on its importance as the most
   ancient Islamic religious institution in Egypt. This paper addresses the
   political role of Al-Azhar from the establishment of the republic in
   1952 until the Arab Spring in 2011 and the military intervention in
   2013. It also sheds light on the relations between Al-Azhar and
   Islamists, mainly the Muslim Brotherhood; that explains the behavior of
   Al-Azhar since 2011 until today. The study adopts a mixed research
   method: content analysis, critical discourse analysis, along with
   personal interviews. The study finds that Al-Azhar turns out to be a
   state institution committed to its political orientations. Al-Azhar
   found a threat to its interests and religious position during Mursi's
   rule, therefore it endorsed the military intervention in June 2013 as it
   found a chance to protect itself from Muslim Brotherhood and Islamists.},

Abstract = {Although public attention to transgender (trans) politics has increased
   dramatically in recent years, the scholarly community still has a
   limited understanding of how trans and gender non-conforming (GNC)
   individuals participate in the political system. Trans/GNC individuals
   are faced with a dual reality. On one hand, they are part of a highly
   organized and activated group whose rights depend on political
   engagement; on the other hand, individuals often face barriers to
   political participation including a lack of proper identification and
   low socioeconomic status. In this paper, we explore the effects of these
   competing forces on trans/GNC voter registration. We use the theory of
   oppositional consciousness to hypothesize that being part of a political
   and highly mobilized population helps trans/GNC individuals overcome
   barriers to participation. Using data on over 5000 self-identified
   trans/GNC individuals from the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination
   Survey we show that, though individuals are less likely to participate
   if they lack gender-conforming identification, on the whole trans/GNC
   individuals in this survey register at rates that are consistent with or
   higher than the general population. The evidence points to the
   importance of the trans political movement in activating and developing
   oppositional consciousness in its members. We explore the implications
   of these findings and what they mean for future research.},

Abstract = {Do economic policy preferences distinguish populist voters from
   mainstream ones? We compare the preference profile of the voters of the
   Five Star Movement (M5S), one of the most successful southern European
   populist parties, with the profile of voters of other parties at both
   the 2013 national and the 2014 European Parliament elections by means of
   a conjoint analysis experiment on economic policy programs. Despite
   economic insecurity and recent recessions being key drivers of populist
   voting, we provide evidence that M5S supporters are fiscally moderate:
   they are happy with the current size of government and oppose more
   spending. Their Euroscepticism, shared with right-wing voters and
   representing a new domestic divide, takes the form of a lukewarm support
   for the euro, which they would readily ditch if it were to improve
   economic performance.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the trust in the Monarchy in Spain during the
   recent economic crisis, relative to other political institutions. The
   article differentiates public opinion on political institutions
   depending on whether they are or not accountable to the electorate. The
   purpose is to confirm whether there is internal homogeneity in the trust
   that citizens place in political accountability institutions, such as
   the government, parliament, political parties or even the Monarchy. The
   article analyzes the specific evolution of the perception about the
   Monarchy, showing that such perception has behaved differently as
   compared to other ``unaccountable institutions{''} during the recent
   period of political and economic crisis. It also presents the effects
   that the perception on the political and economic context has on it.},

Abstract = {The unexpected influx of Syrians to Turkey has shifted the focus in
   political and administrative discussions. Turkey has accepted over 3.5
   million Syrians fleeing from the civil war while Istanbul alone hosts
   over half a million Syrians. The population influx to major urban areas
   has put further responsibility on the shoulders of local governments.
   Istanbul being the Ibremost. Given the low average age of the Syrian
   community Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is specifically in a
   position to address the needs of Syrian children and youth from
   education to health and from integration to self-realization.},

Title = {Reinventing Hybridity in a Globalized Context: The Case of Turkish Soap
   Operas and Their Reception in Morocco},
Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-217},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This article aims to examine Turkish soap operas as a multi-faceted
   phenomenon that, as a product of cultural hybridization, will also
   contribute to similar cultural hybridization in the countries and
   regions where they are broadcasted. The purpose is to highlight the fact
   that this is not a unilateral process of cultural influence, with an
   active production pole and a static and non-active receptor, but rather
   a dialectical process of hybridization, transformation, and adaptation.
   Analyzing the power of television and the strategies used by soap operas
   to attract an audience, the article highlights the dynamics accompanying
   their diffusion and the impact on the watchers. The main conclusion of
   this work is that Turkish soap operas are at the same time an outcome of
   cultural hybridization and a vector of this phenomenon since the series
   will influence the cultural frame of references of their host societies.
   The case study on Morocco helps us understand the encompassing dynamics
   at stake when it comes to cultural influence and interaction.},

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why do Japan-South Korea relations remain tense despite repeated efforts
   to overcome the past? Elite narratives in Japan and South Korea reify
   the bilateral relationship as a difficult problem. For the Japanese
   policy elites, the difficulty is due to South Korean unwillingness to
   embrace a future-oriented relationship; whereas for the South Korean
   policy elites, the source of the problem is the unwillingness of the
   Japanese to sincerely address past wrong-doing. The result is a
   self-fulfilling prophecy of an intractable mutual misapprehension,
   suggesting that the difficult relationship is here to stay. I analyse
   pronouncements by both the Japanese and South Korean policy elites
   appearing in official documents and media reports for clues into the
   manner in which the bilateral relationship is reified into a difficulty
   purportedly due to the recalcitrance of the neighbour. The narratives
   consistently show that both the Japanese and South Korean policy elites
   consider the onus of improvement lies with the troublesome/insincere
   neighbour. In short, the bilateral relationship is a clash of realities,
   with the logical conclusion being that the difficult relationship will
   persist for the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {Genocide prevention has been a field located in the Global North but
   preoccupied with the Global South. It is an elite field that is
   dominated by Western technical experts, many of whom have close ties to
   Western governments, and that is organized along vertical hierarchies.
   It works largely with states and militaries, and focuses a majority of
   its attention on military intervention into ongoing conflict as well as
   legal accountability after genocide has been committed. These priorities
   have had a dramatic impact on how genocide is defined and identified,
   preferencing the mass killing element of the crime and ``reducing
   genocide to law,{''} as the legal scholar Payam Akhavan aptly put it in
   his 2012 book of that title. Although grassroots outreach is sometimes
   advocated, it is usually understood in terms of pressure politics and
   lobbying at the center of global power rather than as the empowerment of
   ordinary people worldwide as transformative and preventative agents in
   and of themselves. This article is both a call for critical
   self-examination of the field of genocide studies and a surfacing of
   paths not taken in the practice of genocide prevention.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the globalization of resilience by examining a
   particular and prominent vehicle for the dissemination of resilience
   ideas: the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)
   initiative. As a philanthropic initiative organized through a network of
   international cities, 100RC demonstrates how the spread of resilience
   thinking has been facilitated by exploiting changes in the structures
   and processes of global governance afforded by neoliberal globalization.
   The analysis focuses on explicating100RC's animating logic of
   governance, which is committed to the cultivation of network
   connectivity. Rather than directly fostering resilience, connectivity is
   established as a condition under which resilience solutions can be
   immanently surfaced from the interactions of a diverse selection of
   stakeholders brought together through these networks. The article
   situates this governmental logic within broader changes associated with
   neoliberal globalization, namely the emergence of multi-scalar
   governance networks, the rise of philanthrocapitalism and the inception
   of platform capitalism. The conclusion discusses the implications of
   this analysis for further study of the relation between connectivity,
   danger, knowledge and value contained within resilience discourses.},

Abstract = {Does ideological proximity between the individual and political parties
   determine electoral participation in regional elections, as much as in
   national elections? Does the degree of self-rule of a region affect the
   interplay between ideological distance and turnout? This article
   addresses these questions and provides empirical evidence drawing upon
   individual-level and regional-level data from 53 regional elections and
   4 national elections in Spain. Results indicate that citizens are more
   likely to vote when they perceive there is at least one congruent policy
   option among the party supply, and this happens at both regional and
   national levels. However, whether the closest party is in national
   government or whether it is a regionalist organization has a dissimilar
   impact on turnout in different tiers. This relationship between the type
   of party which is most ideologically proximate and electoral
   participation is partially affected by the degree of regional autonomy
   of the territory.},

Abstract = {Erick Olin Wright's Real Utopias Project was concerned to establish the
   intellectual grounds for an open-ended politics that was still inspired
   by the goal of replacing capitalist systems by socialist ones. Conceived
   when `civil society' was still all the fashion, its emphasis on the need
   to concentrate on institution-building in civil society was a testament
   to what Gramsci had called `patience allied with perseverance'. Yet the
   exemplary cases highlighted by Wright - above all the Participatory
   Budget institutions in Porto Alegre Brazil and those of Quebec's
   Chantier de l'economie sociale - lacked the sober assessment actually
   needed to confirm Wright's theory of `empowered participatory
   governance' let alone to reconstruct that theory in light of its
   inadequacies. What was most problematic about Wright's real utopias
   project was its lack of concern with what Gramsci focused on, i.e., the
   kind of institutional design mass socialist parties needed in order to
   engage in hegemonic practices as agencies of both class formation and
   social transformation. This was recognized by Wright himself in his
   final work.},

Abstract = {When and why do parliamentary majorities in Europe suppress
   parliamentary minority rights? This article argues that such reforms are
   driven by substantive policy conflict in interaction with existing
   minority rights. Government parties curb minority rights if they fear
   minority obstruction due to increased policy conflict and a
   minority-friendly institutional status quo. Empirical support is found
   for this claim using comparative data on all reforms in 13 Western
   European parliaments since 1945. A curbing of minority rights is
   significantly more likely under conditions of heightened policy conflict
   and these effects are stronger the more the institutional status quo
   favours opposition parties. Contrary to frequent claims of consensual
   rule changes from single-country studies in Europe, these findings
   demonstrate the importance of competitive strategies in explaining
   institutional reform in European parliaments. The conditional impact of
   the status quo provides interesting theoretical links to historical
   institutionalist arguments on path dependence.},

Title = {Are 16-year-olds able to cast a congruent vote? Evidence from a ``voting
   at 16{''} initiative in the city of Ghent (Belgium)},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An often used argument against lowering the voting age to the age of 16
   is that this age group would lack a sufficiently high level of
   ``political maturity{''} and therefore would not be able to cast a vote
   that is in line with their political opinions. In this paper, we use a
   unique initiative set up by the city of Ghent (Belgium) to invite 16 and
   17 -year-olds to take part in a mock election to investigate whether
   adolescents are able to cast an ideologically congruent or ``correct{''}
   vote. Our results do not show differences in proximity voting between
   adolescents and adult respondents. Furthermore, we find no evidence of
   socio-economic stratification in the extent to which adolescents cast a
   congruent vote. Our conclusion, therefore, is that this recurrent
   argument against lowering the voting age lacks empirical validity.},

Abstract = {The AKP came to power in Turkey in 2002 after a devastating economic
   crisis and has since become a hegemonic party. Despite its neoliberal
   policies, its votes mostly come from the poorer echelons of the society.
   This article analyses the AKP as a prime example of `neoliberal
   populism' and argues that the AKP's social policies are the material
   sources of its neoliberal populism. There are, however, important
   contradictions in AKP's social policies. First, they have mostly
   bene?ted informal sector workers, but have decreased the bene?ts of
   formal employees. Second, some of the social policies are programmatic
   and universal, but others are particularistic and clientelistic. Third,
   although social programmes and spending increased, the labour policies
   of AKP have decreased the power and conditions of labour. These social
   policy contradictions help AKP target the poor unorganized sections of
   the society, gain and maintain popularity among them and weaken
   opposition to its neoliberalism and authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Post-authoritarian Indonesia has emerged as a state advocating human
   rights values in the Asia-Pacific region. However, its policies in
   promoting these values at the global level remain limited. This can be
   seen in Indonesia's reluctance to strengthen global human rights
   governance, particularly in the United Nations (UN) Human Rights
   Council. In addressing the puzzle, this article shows that Indonesia's
   standpoint on the global human rights issue does not stem from
   Indonesia's search for autonomy from Western values. Rather, it is
   suggested that Indonesia's historical memory is behind Indonesia's
   reluctance to strengthen global governance dealing with human rights
   issues. Specifically, Indonesia's history in protecting its territorial
   integrity under UN scrutiny during the authoritarian regime (1967-1998)
   shapes its current approach to the separatist movement in Papua
   provinces. Moreover, its role as a voice for developing countries, which
   is an integral part of its historical memory, causes Indonesia to
   protect abusive regimes.},

Title = {The Differentiated Effects of Direct Mobilisation on Turnout: Evidence
   from the 2013 Austrian Parliamentary Election},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-296},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {In recent years several European countries have experienced a
   significant decrease in turnout, even as the level of campaign
   professionalisation has been increasing. Since scholars have recognised
   mobilisation as a key aspect in determining turnout, this article aims
   to disentangle the effects of mobilisation on electoral participation.
   It will do this by focussing on the 2013 Parliamentary Election in
   Austria, which saw the lowest turnout rate ever recorded in that
   country. The data used are taken from the Austrian National Election
   Study Rolling Cross-Section Panel 2013. This data source allows for the
   dynamic analysis of campaign effects through LOWESS estimations of the
   daily means of the measures of interest. Moreover, its panel structure
   permits us to take under control the individual likelihood to turn out
   before the elections whilst studying the effects of various forms of
   party contact on self-reported turnout. The findings show that only
   personal forms of party contact significantly increase electoral
   participation. Furthermore, these forms are more effective in increasing
   the turnout among low-propensity voters. Overall, one of the main
   contributions of the work is to provide differentiated estimations of
   the effects of various forms of party contact on turnout, computed on
   the same sample and concerning the same electoral context.},

Abstract = {This article analyses two recent French counterterrorist legislations
   (Law No. 2016-386 - hereafter OCT\&F law and the Law No 2017-1510 -
   hereafter the OCT\&Flaw) through the lens of distinct yet complementary
   theoretical frameworks. Combining the State of Exception thesis of
   Giorgio Agamben, the Enemy Penology as framed by Gunther Jakobs as well
   as the more recent scholarship contributions on Pre-Crime, the article
   seeks to contribute to the scholarly debate on the use and the
   consequences of the use of criminal and administrative law in the fight
   against terrorism. In view of the numerous terrorist attacks that France
   has faced in recent years, the article aims to provide deeper knowledge
   of the French case by drawing substantially from the unfamiliar French
   scholarship. The article argues that the measures recently adopted seem
   to deepen the exceptional and pre-emptive logic in which potentially
   dangerous subjects have to be identified as ``the enemy{''} as soon as
   possible in order to then be contained and dealt with.},

Abstract = {The SDGs are intended to be universal, in the sense of global
   applicability. Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is
   officially titled: `Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for
   sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build
   effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels'. This
   article provides an analysis of the importance of SDG 16 to achieving
   all of the SDGs, the progress on implementation of SDG 16 to date, the
   principal challenges that countries are encountering in the
   implementation of SDG 16, and proposes a set of policy solutions to
   overcome those challenges. It argues that progress on SDG 16 is critical
   to progress on the other SDGs and, therefore, it is imperative that
   countries vigorously attempt to overcome those challenges to meet the
   targets indicated for each goal. It draws on country experience as well
   as on the author's own field experience.},

Abstract = {Much has been made of the threat of battle hardened jihadis from
   Islamist insurgencies, especially Syria. But do Americans who return
   home after gaining experience fighting abroad pose a greater risk than
   homegrown jihadi militants with no such experience? Using updated data
   covering 1990-2017, this study shows that the presence of a returnee
   decreases the likelihood that an executed plot will cause mass
   casualties. Plots carried out with American returnees from Islamist
   insurgencies abroad also decrease the likelihood that a plot will come
   to fruition. The presence of a known foreign fighter increases the
   likelihood of detection and disruption by law enforcement officials.
   These data also show successful attacks by any but lone-actors are
   becoming increasingly rare. However, attacks planned and executed by
   close-family members are the exception to the general rule.},

Abstract = {For many years, FARC - EP stirred up a singular fascination among
   countless scholars who wondered about the more than five - decade - long
   duration of their armed struggle. However, very few analysts have
   inquired about their identity bond, stablished by said group inside its
   ranks and the relationship this guerrilla had set in regards to its
   otherness -the colombian stablishment-. This paper intends to highlight
   the particularities of the inner farian solidarity, from the sociology
   of political identities, parting from some of their own documents and
   disciplinary regulations. Therefore, we will try to inquire about - FARC
   and its clandestine organizations' inner tension between a vertical and
   unquestionable military hierarchy and its different political goals.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The objective of this work is to contrast nine methods of democracy
   quality measurement in the world and to highlight the positive and
   negative aspects of each of them, to end with an analysis of the factors
   that contribute to the reliability of such methods. The methods are
   Freedom House, Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), Latin American Public
   Opinion Project (LAPOP), Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI),
   Democracy Assessment: International Institute for Democracy and
   Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), Bertelsmann Transformation
   Index (BTI), Latin American Democratic Development Index (IDD-LAT),
   Levine and Molina (2011), and V-Dem (Coppedge et al., 2019). Initially,
   the work revises the different definitions of democracy and quality that
   affect its measurement. Then, it looks at the different methodologies
   applied. Finally, it concludes with a heartfelt need to reformulate some
   methodological approaches that more accurately reflect endemic elements
   of each region and country. This is done without falling into
   simplifying homogenization and with the expectation of its application
   in South America, particularly in Ecuador.},

Abstract = {This article examines the process of extinction of former remainer
   Conservative MPs who followed different paths in the run-up to the 2019
   general election: either choosing to stay loyal and merge with the rest
   of the parliamentary party, or to express their discontent and leave the
   party. When they chose to rebel against the leadership, only a small
   minority dared to vindicate their position. The other rebels constantly
   played down their identity as remainers and justified their views in an
   apologetic way. More remarkably, they were treated differently by Boris
   Johnson, who eventually suspended the last remainers and called for a
   general election to renew the composition of the party. The consequences
   of this last move are crucial in order to understand the radical
   transformation of the Conservative Party into the actual (and only)
   `party of Brexit'.},

Abstract = {Throughout Enrique Pena Nieto's administration and during the 2018
   presidential campaign, three problems stood out among the Mexican
   electorate: the limited economic growth, a sustained increase in
   violence, and multiple corruption scandals. Therefore, based on the
   CIDE-CSES 2018 National Electoral Study, we analyze the simultaneous
   effects of individual evaluations of the economy, violence and
   corruption on electoral preferences. Our findings indicate the
   prevalence of a retrospective economic vote that coexists with a
   security vote, but without clear support from crime victims. Although
   corruption was widely discussed during the electoral campaign, this
   issue did not play a major role in voter preferences.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the Communication Strategy of Chile' Foreign Policy
   towards China, in the period 1973-1979. With this aims, through the
   collection of primary data product of work with secret, reserved and
   ordinary documents, as well as telex and notes of archive, the study
   from a multidisciplinary approach (International Relations, Present Time
   and Communication) analyzes the bilateral relations of these countries.
   It has been concluded that bilateral relations in the 70s was not a
   continuum, but was subdivided into two stages, which represented a
   complex scenario to be solved for the Communicational Strategies of
   Chile's foreign policy; in which China was central so that the
   Civic-Military Dictatorship would not be completely isolated from the
   international system. In the same way, it was possible to determine the
   subjects on which both States exchanged ideas, visions and positions for
   the categories of Internal Policy of Chile, Bilateral Relations
   Chile-China and Regional and International Policy of Chile. In this way,
   the research, thinking about current and future bilateral relations,
   allows us to look at a historical moment in which the tensions and
   problems of the Chilean Communicational Strategy towards China had not
   been visualized; and it is a contribution to understand how this country
   was relating and establishing its position to determine the way it
   communicated with Chile.},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {409-437},
Abstract = {Keynes' project for an International Clearing Union does not respond
   only to the economic and political needs of the particular historical
   moment in which it was conceived, i.e. the establishment of an
   international money really complementary to national currencies. With
   that project, in fact, Keynes conceives a new kind money, whose positive
   character is to be un-hoardable. The non-hoardability of the bancor
   raises the issue of the nature of what is commonly known as `liquidity',
   and allows not only to distinguish the liquidity that is proper to money
   from liquidity in general, but also to refine the concept of liquidity
   in itself. And finally, it allows to think about the very possibility of
   other forms of monetary complementarity, notably at different local
   levels.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67-68},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {188-213},
Abstract = {European integration changes the conditions under which political
   parties operate and position themselves. It is a challenging issue for
   them as European integration lends itself to contradictory
   interpretations. It contains elements of differentiation which
   complicate the problem and the elaboration of a clear political stance.
   Through a socio-historical study of the PCF's position-taking process,
   this article demonstrates that differentiation elements are more taken
   into account by actors with specialised European expertise. However,
   their ability to influence the party's political line depends on their
   alliances within generalist political staff and on the national
   political situation.},

Abstract = {Contrary to what would be expected, the decline in judicial independence
   positively affects the representation of women in high courts. According
   to the theory I propose, this phenomenon is explained because, due to
   deficiencies in judicial independence, the political actors try to
   strategically reduce the costs derived from this phenomenon selecting
   more women in the benches of supreme or constitutional courts.
   Therefore, in labor markets with structural distortions such as those in
   Latin America, the presence of more supreme or constitutional women
   judges should not necessarily be interpreted as an reflect that
   political actors are interested in reducing asymmetries in
   decision-making arenas.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This essay recounts the continuing influence of Marx on Alasdair
   MacIntyre's Aristotelian practical philosophy, first tracing the
   latter's commitment to democracy and account of the nature of
   flourishing communities to his reading of Marx. It then discusses
   MacIntyre's reappropriation of Marx's Capital in his most recent book,
   Ethics in the Conflicts of Modernity, noting the contrast between
   MacIntyre's Nietzschean reading of modern morality in After Virtue and
   his Marxian reading of morality in his latest book. After contrasting
   MacIntyre's position with Althusser's account of ideology, it concludes
   by arguing that MacIntyre's recent reappropriation of Marxian concepts,
   while selective, points to the need to uncover new economic institutions
   capable of realizing his neo-Aristotelian practical philosophy.},

Title = {Politicization and Regional Integration in Latin America: Implications
   for EU-MERCOSUR Negotiations?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Regional integration in Latin America has experienced different periods
   of politicization. The most recent goes back to the 2000s and is related
   to the domestic political changes resulting from the so-called `left
   turn' which sought alternative economic and development policies to
   neoliberalism as the state regained centrality. These transformations
   led to a broad process of politicization of regionalism which changed
   the terms of the debate surrounding whether regional integration and
   free trade are the only way for these countries to integrate regionally
   and internationally. Analyses have thus underscored the postliberal
   character of this phase of regionalism as reflected in the greater
   weight of social and political agendas at the expense of economic and
   trade issues. The Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) was no exception
   to this trend. However, in 2010 the bloc rather surprisingly agreed to
   relaunch negotiations with the European Union (EU). Why did MERCOSUR
   decide to resume these negotiations-stalled since 2004-in a context of
   high politicization of regional integration? This article argues that
   internal politicization did not lead to a paralysis of the international
   agenda. Moreover, internal politicization, coupled with external
   pressures and the demand for group-to-group negotiations by the EU,
   drove and supported the conduct of international negotiations. In so
   doing, this article also contests the idea that after the 2000s,
   MERCOSUR moved inexorably towards a postliberal model, thus rejecting
   any trade component. Findings suggest that these accounts may have
   overemphasized change and underestimated continuities in regional
   integration dynamics as the case of the external agenda shows.},

Abstract = {This case study, informed by historical institutionalism, explores how
   path dependency has been a significant factor in the
   institutionalization of a form of consociational representation in Nova
   Scotia, accomplished through the creation and maintenance of protected
   ridings for two historical minorities: Acadians and African Nova
   Scotians. The adoption of a `consociational districting' approach by
   electoral boundary commissions in Nova Scotia ran counter to the
   dominant trend in electoral redistribution and apportionment exercises
   toward reducing the extent of population variance between electoral
   districts. However, when Canada's Supreme Court created `legal space'
   for this approach, institutional entrepreneurs in Nova Scotia were able
   to initiate changes that were consistent with provincial history,
   demography, and political culture, entrenching a consociationalist ethic
   that legitimized the accommodation of cultural group identity. When
   there was a concerted government attempt in 2012 to reject this
   unorthodox practice, its constitutional validity was upheld by the
   courts and the protected ridings subsequently restored. In effect,
   history and institutions matter in the politics of redistricting, giving
   Canadian provinces significant leeway in pursuing their own distinctive
   approach, especially as it concerns the representation of minorities.},

Abstract = {In January 2020, the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of
   SARS-CoV2, which caused COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Soon, a continuous
   outbreak of coronavirus infection was declared a pandemic. This
   situation has led to an increase in cybercrime. Cybercriminals did not
   stray from the situation and used the pandemic to commit various digital
   frauds and cyberattacks. As a result, the objective of the investigation
   was to analyze computer crimes at the COVID-19 scene and identify their
   social and legal consequences. This is a documentary-based
   investigation. It is concluded that, security standards have
   deteriorated in the context of forty social as many organizations were
   not prepared for remote work and the number of victims of cybercrime
   will only grow soon. International organizations and law enforcement
   agencies in many countries issue many recommendations to prevent digital
   criminal acts against businesses and citizens. This situation also
   prompted active legislation around the world to deal with the crisis.
   Most of the rules adopted in recent months are likely to be derogated.},

Abstract = {How do populists govern in crisis? We address this question by analyzing
   the actions of technocratic populists in power during the first wave of
   the novel coronavirus crisis in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. We
   identify three features of the populist pandemic response. First,
   populists bypassed established, institutionalized channels of crisis
   response. Second, they engaged in erratic yet responsive policy making.
   These two features are ubiquitous to populism. The third feature,
   specific to technocratic populism, is the politicization of expertise in
   order to gain legitimacy. Technocratic populists in the Czech Republic
   and in Slovakia weaponized medical expertise for political purposes.},

Abstract = {The correlation of national, supranational, trans-regional, and
   international legal systems is a concern of comparative legal (including
   their political science and international relations aspects) studies
   because it has decisive influence on how States position themselves
   within the family of nations, perceive themselves in the surrounding
   world community, and build relations with other nations, international
   organizations, and the international community as a whole. At the same
   time, the correlation has immense pragmatic significance, for it is the
   essential basis for determining which of the multi-level management
   legal systems operates and/or prevails when the rules binding on
   individuals, societies, businesses, civil services, international
   organizations, and interstate communities are formed within or outside
   of national jurisdictions. Study of this correlation is of particular
   importance in the context of the growing complexity of the international
   legal field and multilevel management systems, as well as in the light
   of current trends in the development of international economic and
   political processes. On the one hand, the growing international
   confrontation and misuse of international legal instruments are forcing
   States to take measures to protect their internal law systems. On the
   other hand, the need to build harmonious international cooperation
   requires them to open their legal systems to some extent. The article
   discusses the experience of various integration structures in this
   context. The authors claim that the project of the Greater Eurasia has
   the advantage of sharing a common Soviet legal heritage, which already
   establishes a common legal language and cohesive terminology - factors
   that have, for example, restrained EU integration efforts. Whatever the
   CIS may or may not have achieved, meeting expectations or otherwise, it
   represents nearly three decades of integration experience.},

Abstract = {The social state crisis as well as the post-socialist transformation of
   society and consequential reforms have been discussed in many studies,
   but most scholars have analysed and explained them from liberal and
   libertarian perspectives. This paper draws on the Marshall theory of
   citizenship when examining these phenomena and emphasizes the social
   dimension of citizenship and social rights of the citizens. Based on
   both Slovak and foreign studies and research papers, this article
   analyses present changes in the labour market (increasing power
   asymmetry between locally-bound work and global capital, dualization of
   labour market, precarious forms of employment) as well as shifts in the
   system of social protection (from universalism to a targeted approach,
   from rights to legitimizing criteria) and social insurance (from
   universalism to privatization and commercialization). We must point out
   that the content of the reforms as well as their political reasoning and
   social discourse omitted ideas of the social rights and human dignity.
   In this article, we emphasize the positive effects of the social state,
   such as the fact that it acknowledges full citizen status, the role of
   an individual, and maintains social cohesion, stability and the
   democratic status quo.},

Abstract = {Still far from the shadow of the tropics, geography in Europe found
   under the tropical studies the eavesdropper for the development of a
   rich regionalist vision that the academy would later be in charge of
   denying for political reasons. The decolonization process cornered a
   rich regionalist vision, despite being the origin of many of the
   geography departments. Tropical studies outside the discourses of power
   signified a plural look at the world that after becoming silent begins
   to regain its strength. This article investigates the colonial academic
   legacy from the case of document analysis and the results of interviews
   with disciples of tropical geography from the Bordeaux School. After
   being cornered, the diversity of his background is beginning to be
   reconsidered from a postcolonial perspective.},

Abstract = {The discussion about ``Chile, mining country{''} is necessary to open
   the debate beyond the sectorial and disciplinary vision, and to consider
   the need of agreements between direct and indirect stakeholders involved
   in the extractive activity. The visualization of the mining activity
   inserted in the local and regional dimensions, can help to minimize the
   negative impacts of the mining cycle that is framed in an extractivist
   model for exportation. By doing this, it will be possible to foster
   meeting spaces about the involved dimensions beyond the merely
   productive aspects. Posing a territorial planning need, recognizing
   different ontologies and another State participation, the stakeholders
   could monitor the mining activities' performances. A mining industry
   that includes environmental aspects, the rights of people, communities
   and public opinion can be legitimized by a reformulation of the
   political, productive, economic and environmental culture.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2020},
Number = {24},
Abstract = {Aldo Zargani (Turin, 1933-), who lived through the anti-Semitic
   persecution in Piedmont between 1938 and 1945, is the author of two
   autobiographical books, Per violino solo (1995) and Certe promesse
   d'amore (1997), as well as several stories and essays, some of which are
   collected in In bilico (2017). These works form an autobiographical
   macrotext in which each text positions itself against the background of
   the previous ones and is linked to them by cross-references. I examine
   the macrotext with a focus on the narrating self's need to bear witness
   on behalf of the murdered members of his extended family - mostly
   non-Jewish and mostly young - to his readers, thus creating continuity
   between past and present. Drawing on theories of irony, I also look at
   the way Zargani uses irony to comment on death and to express his fear
   that memories of the past may vanish.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {94-115},
Abstract = {This article explores the possible repercussions of Brexit upon Italian
   foreign policy. Whilst Italy has not modified its foreign policy
   fundamentally after Brexit, we argue that it has, however, led to a
   change in the European balance of power. This has exposed Italian
   foreign policy, which has had to adjust accordingly. Successive Italian
   governments, from Matteo Renzi's to Giuseppe Conte's first cabinet, have
   had to rethink, design and implement a new role for Italy among the EU
   top countries. They had to do so as they faced the common prospect of
   losing such an ally as the UK, which has often proved instrumental in
   counterbalancing continental European powers. Nevertheless, we observe
   that the ruling coalitions differed in their response to Brexit. We
   argue that a neoclassical realist approach aids in understanding the way
   in which the Italian response to Brexit has been influenced by two key
   factors: the need to preserve Italy's status in the European balance of
   power and the governing coalitions' commitment to delivering their
   electoral promises. The result is that Italian governments pursued a
   different approach to Italian foreign policy after Brexit, and the
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the emergence and development of the cuban
   anti-fascist movement as one of the central repercussions that the
   Italian invasion of Ethiopia brought. From the review of documentary
   sources and periodical publications, it is demonstrated how fascist
   invasion of the african country was transformed for the Communist Party
   of Cuba (PCC) and progressive intellectuals into the fact-symbol of the
   capitalist exploitation that countries could exercise more powerful over
   the weakest, which allowed us to establish a close analogy with the
   situation that Cuba was facing with respect to the United States. At the
   same time that the revulsion against Fascism was consolidated by the
   various political and mass organizations, the promotion of north
   american anti-imperialism became part of the programmatic platform of
   the cuban anti-fascist movement, placing Fascism and american
   imperialism almost as one enemy, which favored the creation of a true
   alliance between trade unionism, the Communist Party, and the
   progressive or leftist intellectuality.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Pages = {126-137},
Abstract = {Indigenous Peoples are not some homogenous mass but are grouped, belong
   to and identify with, diverse groups-constructs such as culture, nation,
   confederacy, tribe, band, ethnicity, religion, ``race{''} and clan,
   family. But these and other groups-constructs are, like the dimensions
   of the historical social formations and modes of production within which
   they were developed, socio-cultural, geo-historical, economic,
   politico-legal and global; not a matter of biology or genes. Thus as
   there are some common denominators among also diverse groups of
   non-Indigenous Peoples, so it is with Indigenous Peoples: some common
   defining and differentiating denominators in terms of common themes and
   ``epistemologies{''} as well as ``heuristics{''} (traditional rules of
   thumb) constructs, definitions of, integrated or more ``holistic{''} and
   ``dialectical{''} approaches to: development; growth; sustainability;
   roles of tradition, command and markets in posing and answering basic
   questions of all social formations and modes of production: what, how,
   where, when, why, for whom, to produce, distribute, utilize the means of
   subsistence, survival and expanded reproduction of the society. This
   paper explores some differences and implications between Indigenous
   versus more Eurocentric definitions and approaches to economic growth,
   development and sustainability.},

Abstract = {As the number of people displaced by disaster reaches record highs, this
   article describes how international law is relevant to disaster
   displacement, how refugee law is probably not the answer, and
   synthesises recent developments into contemporary application. New
   interpretations of international human rights law have advanced legal
   protections such that planning and preparedness to address future
   disasters now form an express component of states' international legal
   obligations. At the same time, climate change is increasing the
   frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, exacerbating factors
   that cause disaster and displacement and rendering the effective
   implementation of international law more difficult. The further
   `othering' of migrants during the Covid-19 pandemic could stymie the
   realisation of protections as national governments close borders,
   anti-immigration sentiment is stoked, and economies decline.},

   proletariat and trade union movement desperately and expeditiously to
   identify themselves with ``Bolshevism{''} and in that sense repeat the
   path of soviet revolutionary socialism. The disagreements between the
   most important union leaders, the mediatic exploitation of the
   programmatic and ideological differences between the workers' parties
   -Partido Socialista Revolucionario (PSR) and Partido Comunista (PC)- and
   the persecution, political, violent and juridical of key workers leaders
   of the labor movement in the country they influenced the inhibition of

Title = {How Does Corruption Affect the Adoption of Lobby Registers? A
   Comparative Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {116-127},
Abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that some governments in developed
   democracies followed the OECD and the EU recommendations to enhance
   transparency by adopting lobby registers, whereas other countries
   refrained from such measures. We contribute to the literature in
   demonstrating how corruption is linked to the adoption of lobbying
   regulations. Specifically, we argue that governments regulate lobbying
   when they face the combination of low to moderate levels of corruption
   and a relatively well-developed economy. To assess this argument
   empirically, we compare 42 developed countries between 2000 and 2015,
   using multivariate logistic regressions and two illustrative case
   studies. The statistical analysis supports our argument, even if we
   include a number of control variables, such as the presence of a second
   parliamentary chamber, the age of democracy, and a spatial lag. The case
   studies illustrate the link between anti-corruption agenda and the
   adoption of lobby registers.},

Abstract = {Strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and China has significantly
   increased in the last two decades. The Sino-Kazakh bilateral
   relationship has considerably extended in terms of economic, political
   and security particularly after the collapse of Soviet Union. Especially
   both countries have great prospects for cooperation in the energy
   sphere. But the energy future of these countries carries a great
   potential for change, which is related to the shortage of global energy
   resources. Dialogue between the two countries in the sphere of
   extraction and use of energy resources will be determined by the
   political and economic situation on the Eurasian continent. Furthermore,
   the study concludes that the relationship between the two countries
   should be beneficial and transparent not equaovocal in nature.},

Abstract = {The social organisation of long-term care in Catalonia has been for some
   years influenced by a changing scenario of public policy, which was
   intended to de-familiarize care responsibilities, but has instead
   reinforced its continuity or displacement to the family circles. In the
   present article we examine the contextual factors, such as the crisis of
   2008, the legal framework, the social normativity and the public
   policies in Catalonia, that have moulded the current situation, in which
   the business sector has acquired a prominent role, while the family has
   kept its key historical one. Besides analysing which social institutions
   assume crucial care work, this article also reflects about the
   precarious conditions in which this activity occurs.},

Abstract = {This research maps the business and political elite networks in Mexico
   to understand the social organization and influence capacity of Mexican
   elites, and to open up avenues of research on power elites in Mexico.
   First, a study of the internal cohesion of the business elites is
   carried out through an analysis of networks of interlocking directorates
   and ownership ties. Secondly, we examine several cases of revolving
   doors through a prosopographic analysis of biographies and trajectories.
   The results reveal that the Mexican business elites are cohesive and
   that a group of individuals fluctuate between the public and private
   sectors. In addition, the combination of both analyses shows that
   corporations or business groups with access to the State via revolving
   doors are well-connected firms in the network of interlocking
   directorates. Findings suggest the emergence of a public-private ruling
   class in Mexico.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Pages = {436-453},
Abstract = {The objective of the article is to analyze the various forms of
   responsibility of parent companies and their subsidiary multinationals
   in terms of what corporate social responsibility means. At the
   methodological level it is analytical and descriptive research. Despite
   all the struggles and activities carried out to regulate the operations
   of multinational corporations and the demand of the agents of the main
   governments responsible for strictly monitoring compliance with the
   rules (corporate social responsibility) the fact that major
   multinational corporations are pursuing interests for the implementation
   oflos control and monitoring of the cross-border activities of their
   companies should not be ignored. It is concluded that the government's
   support for foreign investment, for example, is sometimes subject to
   compliance with minimum social, environmental, and human rights
   standards. It is difficult to judge the success and outcome of the
   effort made to monitor and regulate the business of multinational
   corporations, but what seems certain is that rich countries, such as the
   United States and the United Kingdom, have apparently accepted the task
   of playing a significant role in promoting and promoting cross-border
   (corporate social responsibility).},

Abstract = {Studies investigating gender gaps in the doctoral training of political
   science students have focused so far overwhelmingly on the US context.
   Although important research within this context has made strides in
   identifying the persistent challenges to women's incorporation in
   political methodology, much remains unknown about whether women and men
   have different experiences in methods training during their PhD
   programs. We contribute to this debate by analyzing data from an
   original survey on the methods-training experiences of political science
   PhD students at different European universities. We assess whether
   gender gaps exist with respect to PhD students' methods training and
   confidence in employing methods skills. Our findings show that women
   cover significantly fewer methods courses in their doctoral training.
   When women do participate in methods training, they show levels of
   method employment similar to their male colleagues. We discuss the
   implications of these findings in the context of European doctoral
   training.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to deepen the analysis of violence executed against
   workers during the decade of 1910, in the spaces of the ``Sociedad
   Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego{''}, the most important sheep farming
   company at that period on the Territory of Magallanes. After reviewing
   different sources, it is proposed that such violence, far from being
   exceptional, were escalations that responded to objectives of labour
   discipline and maintenance of employer power, facing the agency
   developed from the local working class, and contributing to the
   configuration of conflict scenarios.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a network analysis of federal lobbying in Canada by
   the fossil fuel industry and compares lobbying across the Harper
   Conservative and Trudeau Liberal administrations. The network we uncover
   amounts to a small world of intense interaction among relatively few
   lobbyists/firms and public officials in select centres of state power.
   Under Trudeau we find that the majority of lobbying is carried out by
   the same large firms as under Harper, while lobbying has become trained
   on fewer state agencies. We consider lobbying to be an important channel
   through which the fossil fuel sector shapes government policy.},

Abstract = {To what extent do women's rights change in a post-civil war society, and
   what explains these changes? To address these questions, a number of
   studies emphasise the disruptions to daily home, work, and community
   environments brought about by the dynamics of conflict. While war is
   disruptive and has the potential to generate new opportunities for
   women, we argue that conflict alone fails to explain variations in
   women's rights. Using a cross-sectional dataset, we examine the
   insurgent group's political ideology as a central explanatory factor for
   changes in women's rights in the aftermath of civil war. Results from a
   series of regression analyses show that while wartime dynamics help
   improve women's political rights, this is not necessarily the case when
   it comes to women's economic and social rights. These results
   demonstrate the need to account for the insurgent group's political
   ideology in examining the change to women's rights in the context of
   armed conflict.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {47-70},
Abstract = {This paper examines WWII forced labour memory politics in Germany and
   Japan by drawing from Barkan's concept of amending historical
   injustices. After lengthy negotiations, Germany reached in 2000 a
   milestone agreement compensating victims individually, while in Japan,
   settlements, consolation payments and apologies have been overshadowed
   by a revival of revisionist historical narratives and victim denial. It
   is argued that the official recognition of forced labour as historical
   injustice made a mutually acceptable outcome possible in Germany and
   helped to shape a genuine historical memory in victim nations. In Japan,
   by contrast, an alliance of politicians, bureaucrats and academics has
   been reconsecrating revisionism as official position. The revisionist
   inability to recognize victims and admit mistakes has implications for
   South Korea as the rift between right-wing pro-revisionists and
   left-wing nationalists divides the country and prevents the formation of
   a shared collective memory. Unintended consequences have dimmed
   prospects for a settlement.},

Abstract = {This article aims to provide an understanding of the objectives and ways
   of organization that support the social movements in the Triunvirato de
   San Cayetano. The aforementioned is integrated by the following groups:
   Confederacion de Trabajadores de la Economia Popular, Barrios de Pie,
   and Corriente Clasista y Combativa. Our objective is to consider the
   perspective of these groups' highest referents and disclose the
   information gathered. The topics which will be analyzed are: informal
   employment, popular workers, the tension in the claims between
   innovation and tradition, the relationship with unions and,
   fundamentally, with the history of the unemployed movement itself. A
   hypothesis guides this work: the organizations mentioned above are not
   structured according to the acceptance or the rejection of paid word,
   which was the case at the onset of the unemployed movements, nor do they
   understand their situation as transitory informal work, which the labor
   market does not consider an option. Their informal or unemployable
   condition is understood as chronic. This is the starting point of their
   struggles. This research is qualitative. Ten key leaders of social
   movements were interviewed in 2018 in the framework of a previous
   investigation that included interviews to government officials in 2016
   and 2017.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the state of agony parties are experiencing
   today. In a nutshell, I argue that parties are now at pains to retain
   their linkages with society, and that the compensation they envisaged
   has further damaged them. To respond to sociocultural and economic
   changes which had weakened parties both in their organizational standing
   and in their public reputation, parties took a dual route: They went to
   the state to acquire financial resources and profit in other ways; and
   they introduced direct democracy practices inside the parties
   themselves. After discussing how parties have reacted to the changing
   environment, the article concentrates on intra-party organizational
   modifications and deals with three basic questions: (a) Why did parties
   attempt to democratize? (b) What outcome did the democratization, in
   terms of members' direct intervention, produce? (c) Is democracy at
   stake because of the negative impact of the parties' change and their
   consequent, persisting, crisis of legitimacy?},

Abstract = {Climate warming is the fundamental challenge of our time, not only
   because it will radically transform our natural environment but also
   because it will redefine jobs and livelihoods. This article builds an
   interpretive bridge for understanding the political consequences of how
   climate change pressures will affect work, production, and technology.
   We organize this review along three themes: commodification and the
   processes through which costs and resources are made visible; the
   production of knowledge and the politics of representing the future; and
   just transitions and how to distribute the costs and the opportunities
   of change equitably. These themes all address the ways that the
   dominance of the market-both in rhetoric and in policy-eclipses the
   materiality of economic production and social exchange. Together,
   however, the three themes also allow us to contemplate new political and
   institutional actions for tackling the twinned challenges of mitigating
   climate change and safeguarding our livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Seeing the United States as a model for laissez-faire economies
   discourages research on the distinctive features of the U.S. political
   economy. The conventional view is that the U.S. economy suffers from
   chronic coordination problems, in which market actors engage in
   arm's-length transactional relationships. This article challenges such
   generalization by delving into an unexplored tripartite experiment
   conducted by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg during the Kennedy
   administration in the early 1960s through the President's Advisory
   Committee on Labor-Management Policy (LMAC). The experiment was a
   product of policy entrepreneurs' attempts to tackle the decline of U.S.
   manufacturers' market competitiveness and worsening labor-management
   relations, rather than being merely a negligible outlier of mainstream
   American liberalism. Given the absence of peak business and labor
   associations, these entrepreneurs designed the LMAC in a way that made
   it different from its European counterparts. Drawing from the literature
   on political entrepreneurship and creative syncretism in American
   political development, I describe where the tripartite experiment failed
   and how it paved the way toward industrial pluralism in a legal sense,
   and toward growth liberalism or reactionary Keynesianism in an economic
   sense. The article contributes to the burgeoning literature concerning
   various U.S. policy experiments to address problems in market
   coordination.},

Abstract = {The 2018 regional election in South Korea brought a tremendous political
   victory for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and a dramatic
   loss for the conservative Liberty Party Korea (LPK). The DPK won 14 out
   of 17 gubernatorial and metropolitan races, 151 out of 226 (69\%)
   elections for executive office at the municipal level, 652 out of 824
   (79\%) provincial council seats, and 1,638 out of 2,926 (56\%) municipal
   council seats. DPK's triumph can be ascribed to the aftermath of the
   impeachment of the last president Park Geun-Hye and high approval rates
   for the current DPK president Moon Jae-In. Despite DPK's extraordinary
   victory, LPK managed to keep some of its electoral strongholds. In
   addition, the proportion of elected female and young candidates remained
   very low even though the number of female and young candidates has risen
   over the past two decades.},

Abstract = {In Belarus, the authoritarian ruler Lukashenka has created a
   personality-based regime in which all political and social processes are
   controlled by him via a rigid vertical power structure. For him, power
   is a question of life and death. His worldview is dominated by
   conspiracy theories, and politics is a battle against his enemies.
   Lukashenka regards the state as being his own, and the people as his
   subjects. Due to his lack of communication with society, he failed to
   register the development of a revolutionary situation in the run-up to
   the 2020 presidential election. For Lukashenka, the only way of
   responding to the protests is to use repression and violence. Yet the
   fundamental social changes that have been set in motion are unstoppable.},

Abstract = {In Slovakia, the change of government following the parliamentary
   elections took place during the height of the battle against the
   Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. The change of political direction anticipated
   before the pandemic broke out failed to materialise. The new government
   continued with the restrictions on public life and business activity and
   expanded them further. The only disagreement arose over the law that was
   quickly passed on the storage and use of mobile phone data. Although the
   law gives the health authorities fewer rights than in one original
   draft, the opposition wants to take the case to the constitutional
   court. The more severe the economic impact of the battle against the
   pandemic become, the more likely it is that the consensus will start to
   crumble.},

Title = {SAFE HAVENS FOR GLOBAL JIHADI MOVEMENTS},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {23-50},
Abstract = {The issue of terrorist safe havens has been dealt with since 9/11 when
   al-Qaeda attacked the US from its sanctuary in Afghanistan. However,
   until now there have been only few attempts to elaborate an analytical
   framework to identify areas that could transform into terrorist safe
   havens. Moreover, this issue is particularly important in the era when
   the so-called ISIS has been physically defeated, however, its ideology
   remains, hence there is a potential risk of its physical re-emergence in
   a new sanctuary. Thus, the aim of this article is to define safe havens
   for global jihadi movements by a set of criteria that make a certain
   area more attractive and vulnerable to the exploitation by jihadists.
   All criteria were identified after a rigorous study of the establishment
   of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan as well as its failure to establish itself in
   Somalia in the 1990s. The provided toolbox consists of three categories
   of criteria and sub-criteria whose interplay conditions a successful
   establishment of a global jihadi movement within a particular area. A
   quantitative analysis of every factor will enable to identify areas that
   are the most vulnerable and could potentially become the jihadist
   sanctuaries.},

Abstract = {The Territory of Citizenship Program (PTC) was created in 2008 aimed at
   reducing Brazilian regional socioeconomic inequalities and standardizing
   some federal actions and projects related to territorial policies. The
   main goal of this study was to verify, from the perspective of its
   institutionality, the progress of the PTC, considering the main
   challenges to the achievement of its objectives. Thus, it has started
   with a discussion about public policies, development and territory until
   the decree that institutionalized the PTC, among other available
   information about the program. The methodology used was descriptive,
   exploratory, based on bibliographical and documentary research. The
   history of territorial policies indicates that these were not priorities
   for the Brazilian State, obtaining relative prominence only in the last
   decades. In this way, there are significant obstacles for such policies
   to provide a more equitable development. Thus, it is concluded that
   there is considerable difficulty for the PTC to reach the goals proposed
   when it was created. In addition, there is an explicit limitation
   regarding the attempt to standardize the implemented actions and the
   expected results, since the territorial peculiarities were ignored,
   preventing the achievement on part of the objectives in the program.},

Abstract = {The level of legislative turnover in a polity can have significant
   political consequences. Low turnover may increase the number of
   legislators who are out of touch with constituents, while high turnover
   can limit a legislature's ability to fulfill its duties. Focusing on
   separation of powers arrangements, a factor overlooked by previous
   studies, we identify institutional conditions that affect turnover. When
   the executive and legislature are equally responsible for budgetary
   outcomes, we argue, this creates ambiguous contexts, leaving voters more
   likely to re-elect incumbents, thereby lowering turnover. We test our
   predictions using US state-level data.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether Nordic administrative collaboration is
   still `alive and kicking,' or whether it has been marginalized by
   increased integration into Europe and strong international reform
   trajectories. We analyse the scope and intensity of Nordic
   administrative collaboration from a structural perspective based on the
   perceptions of civil servants in the Norwegian central government. We
   also address the implications of Nordic collaboration for policy design
   and reform measures. The main conclusion is that Nordic administrative
   collaboration can best be described as differentiated integration. The
   scope of Nordic administrative collaboration is rather broad, and its
   internal structural features vary significantly. Nordic collaboration is
   perceived to have more of an effect on policy design than on specific
   administrative reform means and measures. However, structural features
   also matter.},

Abstract = {In this study we examine the representation of income groups in two
   EU-level institutions, the Council and the European Parliament. We find
   that the political positions of these institutions, and especially of
   the Council, are always on the right compared to European citizens,
   though closer to the wealthy among them. However, a more systematic
   analysis of congruence between different income groups and the Council
   reveals that while the poor are systematically underrepresented, the
   rich are not systematically over-represented. This holds both when we
   examine the poor and the rich across the EU as a whole and when we
   cluster them according to their respective member states.},

Abstract = {China's effectiveness in quickly solving the health crisis caused by the
   coronavirus pandemic and in softening its economic impact is rooted in
   the structural characteristics of its development model, in which
   state-owned enterprises remain crucial. This article holds that a strong
   public presence within the industrial and banking sectors has provided
   Chinese government with the opportunity to rapidly reactivate domestic
   production and, potentially, to maximise the effectiveness of the
   recently launched monetary and fiscal policy measures.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},

Number = {15},
Pages = {371-386},
Abstract = {As an essay, the result of an action-research is presented with the aim
   of contributing to the clarification of the dynamics of the Cuban
   Revolution with respect to Racism from 1959 onwards. In particular, in
   six events the counterpoint is highlighted with outstanding artists,
   teachers/researchers, political analysts and activists against forms of
   social discrimination; and it is noted what has been disclosed by the
   author since 2011 in the Spanish websites Kaos en la Red and
   Cubainformacion, and his exchange with colleagues and students. In the
   content, it stands out that what constitutes an aspiration of the United
   Nations is perceptible dynamics in Cuba, despite the fact that we still
   have much to do -endorsement for the criticism that I exercise-.
   Initially, the outline of this title was exhibited at the ``VI Meeting
   Aponte In Memoriam/2017{''} held in the city of Camaguey, Cuba.},

Abstract = {The essay seeks to analyse the conceptual trajectories of the
   intersection between underdevelopment and culture in the cultural media
   of the Left in Latin America during the 1960s. To that end, it proposes
   a reading of two spaces of discussion that are representative of
   Left-wing intellectuals during the period: the editorial circuit linked
   to the Cuban journal Casa de las Americas and the Cultural Congress of
   Havana (1968). The paper holds that Latin American cultural producers
   are able to generate a specific inflection in the concept of
   underdevelopment that identifies correlations between an economic and a
   cultural infrastructure, while at the same time practising a strong
   ambiguity in the semantic contents of the concept as it was used in the
   field of social sciences at the time.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explain the dominance of the ANO movement in
   the 2013 and 2017 parliamentary election, and thus contribute to the
   discussion about ``technocratic populism{''}. The article opens with a
   brief overview of the state of research on populism. In particular, the
   term technocratic populism. The next chapter presents the Czech protest
   movement ANO 2011 and its successes in the elections as an example of
   technocratic populism. The following analysis presents selected findings
   from party research and electoral geography and tries to answer the
   following question: Given its programmatic de-ideologization and
   technocratic communicative style, does the spatial support for the ANO
   movement cross the long-term spatial dividing lines of Czech party
   system, or is it more successful in traditionally left or right-wing
   areas of the Czech Republic, thus only gaining voters from the
   traditional blocs of the Czech party system?},

Title = {The meaning of Lulism in Brazilian political life: rights and
   institutionalization of struggles in light of the 1988 Constitution},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {160-188},
Abstract = {The objective of the article is to analyze the crisis of Brazilian
   democracy from the relation between the political phenomenon of Lulismo
   and the 1988 Constitution. Our hypothesis is that Lulismo, in addition
   to electoral realignment, is heir to a set of struggles for rights that
   cross the Constitutional Charter and the dynamics of institutionalizing
   these rights. This set of struggles, we call petismo and we argue that
   Lulismo was one of its possible results. In this sense, the present
   crisis of democracy was made possible with two events - the 2016
   parliamentary coup and Lula's arrest in 2018 - which, together, served
   to interdict the Lulismo of the political dispute, radically altering
   the pattern of electoral competition in force since 1989. We developed
   the argument that this interdiction has a meaning beyond the imbalance
   of the elections: the coalition that took power in 2016 and then helped
   to elect and sustain bolsonarism needs to cancel the very relation
   between struggles and rights that flowed into Lulismo in order to annul
   the democratic dimensions of the Constitution of 88 and establish the
   hegemony of anti-democratic neoliberalism in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
   (TTIP) between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) and
   for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU
   and Canada have provoked massive mobilization throughout Europe, both on
   the streets and online. Yet France, long at the epicenter of
   anti-globalization and anti-Americanism, has played a surprisingly
   modest role in the mobilization campaign against these agreements. This
   article asks why France did not contribute to anti-TTIP mobilization
   and, more broadly, how patterns of French mobilization over trade have
   changed over the past two decades. Using comparative-historical
   analysis, we explore to what extent this puzzling French reaction can be
   traced to changing attitudes towards the US, agenda-shaping by the
   French government, and transformations in the venues and techniques of
   social mobilization. We thus contribute to the growing literature on the
   politicization of trade agreements and offer insights into the links
   between domestic and international politics.},

Abstract = {Reconciliation in Zimbabwe remains a recurring question despite several
   interventions by the government to respond to the challenge. Such
   efforts stretch as far back as the first decade of independence. A key
   observation about the failure of the interventions is the weak
   utilisation of localism. Yet other countries with similar historical
   experiences as Zimbabwe have recorded better progress by embracing
   community-based methods. Indeed, the traditional liberal view that there
   is a universal set of approaches to reconciliation has for long been
   discredited and it is now widely accepted that due to diverse cultural
   values, practices and norms, communities should approach reconciliation
   in diverse ways. The National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC)
   of Zimbabwe has the opportunity to learn from other developing countries
   on how community approaches unfolded, and apply such lessons in
   enriching its own programmes in the country. The East Timor and Sierra
   Leone cases are adduced as providing practical and valuable insights
   upon which the NPRC can benchmark and refine its strategy, and take
   advantage of the idle pool of indigenous methods in the country.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen an increasing trend towards the personalisation
   of election campaigns, even in systems where candidates have few
   structural incentives to emphasise their personal appeal. In this
   article, we build on a growing literature that points to the importance
   of candidate characteristics in determining electoral success. Using a
   dataset composed of more than 3700 leaflets distributed during the 2015
   and 2017 general elections, we explore the conditions under which
   messages emphasising the personal characteristics of prospective
   parliamentary candidates appear in British general election campaign
   materials. Even when we account for party affiliation, we find that
   there are important contextual and individual-level factors that predict
   the use of candidate-centred messaging.},

Abstract = {In this essay I examine the importance of truth in society an d public
   life. I adopt the Polish perspective, which, however, can also be
   considered in universal terms. Polish experiences are a kind of
   exemplification here, which I refer to quite briefly so as not to
   obscure the main theme, which is the moral dimension of truth in social
   and public life. The pandemic, in turn, acts as a lens in which the
   phenomena related to the exercise of power by populists and the flood of
   false information focus. Paradoxically, it also creates an opportunity
   to overcome the structures of lies and falsehoods. However, the future
   of truth in the post-pandemic world will not depend on random forces,
   but on a collective effort made to search for it, and on shaping the
   right attitudes and strengthening the institutional order that will
   foster freedom which is a necessary condition for truth.},

Title = {Politicization `Reversed': EU Free Trade Negotiations with West Africa
   and the Caribbean},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {266-276},
Abstract = {The politicization of recent European Union (EU) trade negotiations such
   as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or the
   Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement suggests that the more
   negotiations focus on deep integration issues, the higher the potential
   for polarization of values and interests. Yet, as we argue, this pattern
   does not necessarily hold true in EU trade negotiations with the
   developing world. In the case of the Economic Partnership Agreements
   with West Africa and the Caribbean region, the pattern of politicization
   was `reversed': Politicization remained low in the Caribbean region,
   despite the inclusion of deep integration issues. To the contrary,
   negotiations became highly politicised in West Africa, where
   negotiations focussed on the traditional realm of trade in goods.
   Combining the insights from the literature on the role of non-state
   actors (NSAs) in trade policy-making in developing countries and on
   politicization, we show that limited pre-existing mobilisation resources
   of NSAs, and few opportunities to engage with the political level of
   negotiations, imply that those affected by the inclusion of deep
   integration issues hardly mobilise. We also find that lack of technical
   expertise and the significance of traditional trade areas pre-empts NSAs
   from engaging in emotive framing on deep integration issues. This helps
   us to unpack the different patterns of politicization across both
   regions: Politicization in West Africa was facilitated by civil society
   actors who-in contrast to the Caribbean region-could draw on
   pre-existing networks, expertise, and direct access to the regional
   negotiation level.},

Abstract = {The period of transition to democracy in Chile saw one of its most
   notable products emerge as a dominant and hegemonic perspective on the
   complex performance of the left in the times of Popular Unity. A part of
   this explanation was articulated around the denominated thesis on
   political violence in the sixties and seventies. The article proposes,
   however, that the conceptual and thematic bases of this thesis were not
   elaborated during the period of transition, but that these issues were
   already visible in the context of the 1973 coup d'etat in a series of
   documents and publications coming from the military field. From there
   they would decisively influence sectors of the civilian intelligentsia
   that adhered to the Dictatorship, who contributed to propagate, through
   diverse works, the aforementioned thesis.},

Abstract = {In recent years, much attention has been paid to the rise of political
   populism and its relationship to neoliberalism and neoconservatism
   hitherto dominant in the West. In particular, some have speculated that
   populism is a reaction against the failures of the neoliberal
   internationalist project, or capitalist globalization. Even so, clearly
   the new populists on the political Right do riot stand opposed to, or
   outside, capitalism itself. Theirs is not a revolutionary project but a
   post-crisis reactionary one, demonstrating once again capitalism's
   tendency to reproduce and, if necessary, reinvent itself. But if this is
   the case, and if populism is the political face of this new era of
   capitalism, what is its cultural-ideological manifestation? This essay
   suggests that technological developments, not least in the area of
   social media and its associated individualization of knowledge-sharing,
   may be driven by precisely the same logic as drives political populism,
   and may thus be a major part of the culture-ideology that reinforces the
   new capitalism.},

Abstract = {Classic geopolitical knowledge has been a key approach to analysing
   Chile's Great Northern Region border problems. On this issue,
   continuities, changes and nuances in theoretical area have been
   disclosed such as, for instance, the dialogue with International
   Relations approaches (say, with ideas related to the realist paradigm).
   In the policies field, it is noted that new perspectives have been
   introduced which differ from traditional geopolitics, although the
   latter still exert an important influence on various aspects of defence
   policy, foreign policy and national policies. Therefore, both dimensions
   - renewed and traditional - coexist in the definition of Chile's State
   policies and institutions towards the Great North and the border. The
   problematization carried out in this article is informed by critical
   geopolitics ideas. The analysis, in sum, focuses on the presence of
   ``renewed and traditional{''} perspectives in the practical
   approximation of Chile towards the Great North border.},

Abstract = {A republican theory of social justice specifies how republican freedom
   should be distributed. The goal of this paper is to assess the
   plausibility of two recently proposed principles of republican social
   justice: an aggregative maximizing principle defended by Philip Pettit
   in Republicanism and a sufficiency principle of republican social
   justice offered by Pettit in On the People's Terms. The maximizing
   principle must be rejected because it permits under-protecting
   vulnerable members of society in favor of increasing the freedom of the
   powerful. The sufficiency principle avoids the most basic objection to
   the maximizing principle, but it is at best an incomplete theory of
   social justice. Social justice requires principle(s) for determining the
   justice of distributions above the sufficiency threshold and republican
   theory does not determine which principle(s) should govern distributions
   above this threshold. Republicans must therefore decide whether they
   will incorporate an independent commitment to equality within their
   theory of social justice.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been
   generating a series of severe effects on the experiences of social space
   and time, which deserves attention and understanding. In this text, an
   initial approach to the problem is proposed, examining how these
   experiences could be giving continuity or transforming space-time
   regimes that were already under way. For this purpose, measures of
   confinement and regulation of the rhythms of daily life are analyzed, as
   well as projections of the behavior of the pandemic on maps and
   calendars. This leads to identify how geopolitics and chronopolitics of
   the pandemic operate, and to propose some strategies for what follows.},

Abstract = {This study bridges research on squatting and urban commons by studying
   squatting - when collectively self-organized for community wide social
   (material and immaterial) benefit and within largely anti-capitalist and
   anarchist ways - as a practice of commoning. In this paper we analyze
   the ``why{''} and ``how{''} of such a practice in a Swedish context. A
   country where the provision of community spaces has historically been
   satisfied by public authorities within a contradictory hybrid model of
   corporatist/state capitalism amidst a traditionally well-developed
   public service sector and strong civil society. Our empirical material
   consists of 17 semi-structured interviews with squatters, as well as the
   authors' participant observation at the longest lasting squats in the
   Swedish capital since 2000. We focus on how the creation of this `free
   and voluntary' community led to a `commoning' of knowledge and skills
   within squatters' daily lives; and how these practices developed,
   evolved, and were maintained. Our analysis shows that while the space,
   most objects in it, and the provisioning of goods there were commoned;
   the most profound `commoning' there was immaterial in nature. This
   commoning centered on the un/intentional sharing, diffusion, and
   commoning of knowledge, skills, and even emotions and feelings which
   happened within the mixture of planned and autonomously rotating
   responsibilities in space.},

Abstract = {The year 2018 was a key time for the feminist movement around the world.
   In Chile, feminist students transformed into a purple wave that took to
   the streets and took on institutions to fight for non-sexist education
   and put an end to sexual harassment against women. This article proposes
   that the movement has both historical and global foundations that are
   configured in parallel to the demands voiced in the streets. It also
   hypothesizes that this movement represents the fourth wave of feminism.
   This study applies a qualitative methodology based on in-depth
   interviews with feminist activists and the analysis of secondary

Abstract = {This article analyzes the uses and functions that the music produced by
   the FARC-EP had for the organization and its political-military work
   during the armed conflict in Colombia. Based on the review of primary
   and secondary sources, participant observation in 6 ``fariano
   concerts{''} and 14 interviews, it is affirmed that Fariano music -as
   sound and practice- fulfilled fundamental role to strengthen the social
   and ideological cohesion of the FARC-EP, to motivate and inspire its
   members and to sustain a collective identity both in the countryside and
   in the cities. Regarding the political work of the insurgency with civil
   society, music was used to entertain, generate sympathy and add
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {As a result of climate change, the Northern Sea Route could become a
   profitable link between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Russia, which
   already began plans to develop the Arctic region during tsarist times,
   anticipates an increase in transit traffic and goods exports. The
   expansion of the infrastructure for the use of the sea route and for
   extracting raw materials is a key project in Russia's Arctic strategy.
   At the same time, the Arctic Ocean acts as a projection screen for
   Moscow's claims to power in partnership with China.},

Abstract = {Latin America is facing the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19 devoid
   of regional spaces for consensus and cooperation. The end of an
   expansionary cycle of the economy, added to a very weak social
   structure, with unresolved pressing needs, does not represent the best
   scenario to confront the health alert situation. The objective of this
   work is to reflect on these aspects, warning of the absence of a solid
   regional architecture and its consequences. For this, the work reviews
   all the regional schemes of the continent and analyzes the way in which
   multilateral spaces have been arranged for joint decision-making. Thus,
   except for the Central American Integration System and the Pan American
   Health Organization, it is scarcely possible to find regional
   commitments beyond the exchange of information or concern about economic
   recovery.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the resistance actions developed by the
   social movement that emerged in Chile against the government policies
   after the increase of the rate in the Santiago Metro. It focuses on the
   events that happened at the city of Concepcion between October 2019 and
   March 2020. In particular, this study addresses how civilians have used
   nonviolent strategies to transform social, political and economic
   structures in this conflict. Methodology involves an ethnographic design
   and content analysis. Data collection techniques include interviews to
   key informants, a deep review of local media, and the examination of
   social networks belonging to the movement actors. There are three main
   findings in this research. First, structural violence is identified as
   the main trigger for the mobilizations. Second, civil society
   organizations deployed a wide range of nonviolent methods in their
   resistance processes, the most prominent were methods of protest and
   persuasion. Third, a partial success of the anti-government movement is
   estimated based on the analysis of the collective actions and the
   government counter-response. The resistance process opened a political
   opportunity through a constituent process in November 2019. However,
   this did not fully address the ambitious goal of ending structural
   violence, which poses challenges for campaign participants.},

   the Sino-American rapprochement, which Mao initiated in response to the

Abstract = {The link between crime and violent extremism (VE) has been the subject
   of increasing scholarly and political concern. While there is evidence
   to suggest a link between crime and VE, such evidence is particularly
   limited in developing countries. In an attempt to address this gap in
   understanding, Gayatri Sahgal and Martine Zeuthen conducted a study in a
   prison environment to investigate the relationship between criminality
   and VE in Kenya. The study finds a tenuous link between other types of
   crime and VE at the individual and organisational levels, with some
   indication of specific institutional patterns of recruitment and
   radicalisation within prisons.},

Abstract = {This article studies the phenomenon of the delegation of jurisdictional
   functions to the Colombian superintendencies and the possible
   transgression that this may have in terms of human rights, since
   judicial independence could be compromised as an essential value of the
   concept of justice. To do this, the institution of the separation of
   powers is analyzed, as well as the legal process that Colombia lived to
   separate these functions from the judicial branch. In sum, this
   phenomenon is examined in light of the control of conventionality that
   the judges must do in compliance with international human rights
   treaties. The conclusion of this study is that the delegation of
   jurisdictional functions in the Colombian superintendencies violates the
   fundamental and human right to be tried by an independent judicial
   operator.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic that disrupts thousands of everyday lives around
   the world has become a paradigm for understanding the ways in which the
   world-system is articulated, by virtue of its capacity to plunge it into
   a deep crisis. This article highlights the relevance of reflecting,
   through negative geopolitics, on the implications of the dispersion of
   coronavirus. This proposal is articulated in six main axes: The
   production of space, the cross-scale power relations, the processes of
   domination and violence, the concretion of the world-system, the
   analysis of geostrategic spaces and the recognition of negative spaces.
   We consider that this methodological approach allows both clarity to the
   process to the crisis and significant horizons of transformation.},

Abstract = {What undermines cooperation in ethnically diverse communities? Scholars
   have focused on factors that explain the lack of inter-ethnic
   cooperation, such as prejudice or the difficulty to communicate and
   sanction across group boundaries. We direct attention to the fact that
   diverse communities are also often poor and ask whether poverty, rather
   than diversity, reduces cooperation. We developed a strategic
   cooperation game where we vary the income and racial identity of the
   interaction partner. We find that beliefs about how poor people behave
   have clear detrimental effects on cooperation: cooperation is lower when
   people are paired with low-income partners, and the effect is
   particularly strong when low-income people interact among themselves. We
   observe additional discrimination along racial lines when the
   interaction partner is poor. These findings imply that poverty and
   rising inequality may be a serious threat to social cohesion, especially
   under conditions of high socioeconomic segregation.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this research is to determine whether Russia being
   under Western economic sanctions could significantly strengthen its
   presence in the Asia-Pacific with a pipeline gas and LNG supplies. Based
   on the study of the Russia's current and planned gas projects in the
   eastern part of the country and in the Arctic, that are realized under
   sanctions' pressure, the authors concluded that most probably by 2030
   Moscow can reach this strategic objective. To resist Western sanctions
   against the Russian energy industry Moscow launched a program of
   accelerated import substitution, and as a result they have only
   partially achieved their goals. Considering Russia's largest gas
   exporters, they resorted to different strategies to counter sanctions.
   The state company Gazprom postponed plans for offshore gas exploration
   in the Arctic and continues to prioritize gas pipeline projects which
   reinforce its dependence on China. In contrast, with the help from the
   RF government and foreign investors, the private company Novatek
   successfully creates a powerful infrastructure for producing LNG in the
   Arctic and for delivering it to Europe and the Asia-Pacific.},
