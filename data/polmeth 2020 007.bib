Abstract = {The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus
   Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have had far-reaching health, economic,
   social and political impacts. The latter is the focus of this research
   note, which proposes using a difference-in-differences approach to
   estimate the electoral impact of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.
   The approach is illustrated using data from the 2020 Croatian
   parliamentary election. The outcomes of interest are the vote shares for
   the dominant Croatian Democratic Union party, as well as the turnout.
   The analysis concludes that there is no evidence that reported
   county-level infection rates affected Croatian Democratic Union support
   or turnout. However, results using this approach may be affected by the
   statistical power of the analysis, issues related to causal
   identification and reliability of infection rate measures. Nonetheless,
   the difference-in-differences approach can potentially be applied in
   contexts around the world to estimate the electoral impact of reported
   SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the organisational development of political
   parties in new democracies. In particular, focusing on Korean cases, it
   extends the existing discussions over party organisation into Asian
   democracies by examining the ways of overcoming the traditions of
   clientelism. Employing a dimensional approach, the evaluation relies on
   three core characteristics of party organisation by utilising a novel
   source of the official data of party organisation in Korea and a data of
   the Comparative Manifesto Project. Covering the long-term variations on
   organisational development, 1992-2018, it finds that Korean parties have
   experienced the waning power of the Party Central Office and the
   weakening ties with civil society. Despite these characteristics of
   development of a cartel-party type organisation, analysis does not
   confirm the expected of convergence of programmatic appeals between
   parties. These mixed findings lead to the conclusion that Korean parties
   have developed toward not a catch-all organisation, but a loosely
   cartelised organisation.},

Abstract = {Do governments represent the material needs and preferences of their
   voters? This is one of the central questions of political science with
   great consequences for how we should evaluate the state of democracy. A
   thorough test of the link between voters' economic vulnerabilities and
   public policies is presented in the article. Using data covering 17
   European democracies, it is shown empirically that economically
   vulnerable voters support generous unemployment protection; that parties
   adopt policy positions that correspond with these voter signals; that
   entire party systems can meaningfully be described by the economic
   vulnerabilities of parties' voters; and that parties, when entering
   office, pursue policies aligned with their voters' needs and
   preferences.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of efforts to harmonize asylum procedures, large
   unexplained differences in asylum outcomes persist across European Union
   member states. Unfortunately, relatively little empirical literature has
   examined the causes of disparities in asylum recognition rates. In this
   paper, I suggest that domestic politics impact how asylum claims are
   adjudicated. I analyze origin-specific asylum recognition rates in 27
   European Union member states from 2000-2018. The findings show that
   right-wing parties in government are associated with lower asylum
   recognition rates. This effect is strongest for far-right parties. When
   far-right parties gain legislative seats and cabinet positions, there is
   a substantive reduction in recognized asylum claims.},

Abstract = {The present pandemic scenario reformulates the question regarding Social
   Protection for the people affected in this matter. We suggest
   historically reviewing all the different ways that have been implemented
   in Argentina since the 20th century until today, analyzing which role
   the ``work world{''} is playing in this process. Furthermore, we aim to
   identify income transfer policies such as ``Asignacion Universal por
   hijo{''} AUH, (Universal Income per Child) and ``Ingreso Familiar de
   Emergencia{''}, IFE (Emergency Familiar Income) which have been
   introduced as new forms of Social Protection. Finally, we bring to the
   table certain questions that the current context presents and their
   possible interactions in the immediate future.},

Abstract = {Research on the determinants of institutional trust in courts that are
   part of transitional justice frameworks is scarce. This article relies
   on experimental evidence to explore whether features of the case and the
   ruling play a role in citizens' attitudes towards the Justicia Especial
   para la Paz, Colombia's transitional justice tribunal. I evaluate
   whether the profile of the accused and whether or not he is sentenced to
   the most lenient of restorative justice measures have an effect on
   trust. I find that support for the decision is lower for restorative
   sentences than for more punitive sentences, and that whether or not the
   acussed was a former guerrilla combatant or a member of the military
   does not influence evaluations. This research contributes to our
   understanding of how citizens in countries dealing with the aftermath of
   violence perceive the institutions devised to adjudicate on the
   atrocities of conflict.},

Abstract = {Trait stereotypes are a fundamental form of social cognition that
   influence public opinion. A long line of literature has established
   partisan stereotypes of politicians, but we know less about the source
   of these stereotypes and whether they apply to partisans in the mass
   public. Building on moral psychology, I argue that the public holds
   clear stereotypes about the moral character of mass partisans and that
   these stereotypes are rooted in ideology. Using a national survey, I
   show that Democrats and Republicans prioritize different aspects of
   moral character, but that these differences are more strongly linked to
   political ideology than partisan identity. Next, I show that much of the
   public holds trait stereotypes about mass partisans that reflect these
   differences in trait importance. Finally, I provide experimental
   evidence that people use partisan cues to draw stereotypical inferences
   about individuals, but that these inferences are more responsive to
   ideological information than partisan cues. Overall, the results suggest
   that partisan stereotypes are not merely outgroup animus, but reflect
   the values and motivations that differentiate the parties.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic caused the global blackout of the activities that
   move capitalism. It went beyond the health sector to settle on the
   political, economic, and social scene of the planet. Among the labor
   groups affected by this situation, the most affected are those who work
   on their own, associative or self-managed, and who make up what has been
   called popular, social, solidarity economy (EPSS). In this article we
   will contrast the voices of members of the EPSS of Rosario organizations
   with the national policies for the sector developed during the pandemic
   in order to recognize the scope and effectiveness of the implemented
   measures, the needs or problems that are still persistent and the
   proposals of the organizations themselves for the formulation of
   policies for this conjuncture and afterwards.},

Abstract = {Media outlets strategically frame news about violent events using
   sensationalist labels such as ``terrorist{''} or ``Islamist{''} but also
   more subtle wording choices that affect the overall article tone. We
   argue theoretically and show empirically using a conjoint experiment
   that, contrary to existing studies, the effect of these two framing
   devices on readers' perceptions of terrorist events should be carefully
   separated. Even though article tone transports no factual information,
   in our experiment negative and sensational wording choices carried a
   greater impact on threat perceptions than the explicit ``terrorist{''}
   and ``Islamist{''} labels. In a realistic news article setting, which
   varied other salient context cues such as proximity or event size,
   subtle shifts in article tone still subconsciously influenced threat
   perceptions. This highlights the potential dangers of media coverage
   fueling otherwise unjustified fears by injecting unnecessary editorial
   tone.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses the problems of democracy by examining the writings
   of the Chinese thinker Zhang Taiyan (1868-1939). The goal of this essay
   is not to promote Zhang's political philosophy as a panacea to the
   problems of democracy. Instead, it uses Zhang's struggle with Chinese
   political problems to clarify the complex nature of democracy-its source
   of power, its modes of participation, and its institutions to channel
   the people's voice. Focusing on Zhang's attempts to balance three
   competing claims of democracy-the protection of the people's rights, the
   expression of the people's voice, and the prudent exercise of power in
   taking care of the citizens' needs-this article elucidates a
   ``Buddhist-Daoist{''} model of democracy that is different from the
   American model of local autonomy and the French model of a strong state.},

Abstract = {Research on the relationship between neoliberalism and democracy has
   mostly overlooked the important theoretical contributions of public
   goods theorists in extending market mechanisms beyond the economy. Yet,
   many aspects associated with the rise of neoliberalism would have been
   unimaginable without these economists' contributions to the development
   of a new variety of liberal democracy, based on the model of the market.
   The separation of provision and production, the introduction of
   market-like competition in public services, and the use of performance
   incentives are inexplicable without reference to public goods theorists'
   reinvention of politics as the demand for and supply of publicly
   provided goods and services. Focusing on the contributions of Paul
   Samuelson, Charles Tiebout, and Vincent Ostrom rather than the usual
   suspects associated with the Mont Pelerin Society, the article argues
   that public goods theory represents a positive vision of the
   market-oriented democratic state that most scholars of neoliberalism
   have overlooked. This positive vision of marketized provision of public
   goods and services represents a new model of liberal democracy rather
   than the end of it.},

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The power and duty of the Government to preserve the health of the
   population can be traced back to ancient times. Prestigious writers of
   administrative law have given examples of that. Public health and
   sanitation are part of one of the three categories of what is known as
   ``police power{''} of the Government, which must not be confused with
   the security police, but refers to the authority to restrict the rights
   of the citizens to protect public safety, health and morale. It is
   important to note that these three categories refer to the most
   restrictive interpretation of the police power, which is known as
   ``narrow{''} and is linked to a liberal. There is no doubt that the
   COVID-19 pandemic has renewed this intervention, as it is compulsory to
   follow certain protocols that are imposed to the population by the
   Government. However, the exercise of this power-duty on behalf of
   Government authorities place them with the responsibility to avoid the
   damages that such restrictions cause to people with respect to their
   economy and the exercise of their freedom. This publication intends to
   analyze historic records in Argentine case law and the norms that
   currently regulate the responsibility of the Government for acting
   within the law, in order to clarify the importance of the role that each
   citizen plays to recover their right to exercise fully their
   constitutional rights.},

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},
Year = {2020},
Number = {40, S},
Pages = {357-365},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article intends to reflect on the notion of selective tradition,
   worked on by Raymond Williams, as a possible pertinent conceptual tool
   for the analysis of contemporary ways of looking at the past and
   re-installing a tradition that recovers those views in the present and
   in the future, in relation to the current context characterized by the
   social and health crisis, deepened by the Covid-19 pandemic.
   To do this, it is proposed to think about these conceptual tools from
   two different moments. In the first place, we will review certain
   discursive references, on social platforms and the media, which offered
   an interpretive framework for an unprecedented individual and social
   experience. Secondly, the objective is to identify incipient
   governmental strategies and those of some civil society actors as a
   possible attempt to found a defined tradition on the development of the
   pandemic and its political, economic and social drifts.},

Abstract = {Political hostility, unrest and flawed governance cause insecurity
   leading to demoralization, which triggers migration. There is a large
   body of literature on the determinants of international migration that
   highlights a range of factors to explain the direction and strength of
   migrant flows. For this research we interviewed 32 respondents who were
   a control group in a study conducted a decade ago. These respondents
   were determined not to migrate, but their migration decision was
   reversed over a period of 10 years. This article explores the relation
   between a sense of insecurity and the demoralization that influences
   migration decisions. It further investigates the causes that contributed
   to this change. As democracy shrinks, authoritarianism expands, implying
   that there is no accountability. This leads a country to widespread
   corruption, creating severe social injustices. People in general become
   demoralized and decide to migrate out. This article adds to the body of
   work by focusing on whether the migration decision is a response to
   widespread corruption, prevailing political conditions, violence,
   conflict, poor governance, an absence of rule of law and freedom or
   declining of democratic space in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Recent literature suggests that African Presidents tend to target
   co-ethnics with patronage, especially in non-democracies. Coupled with
   evidence on the role of incentives in driving ethnic identity change, I
   propose that a change in the ethnic identity of the President should
   lead to an increase in the proportion of people identifying with the
   President's ethnic group. I use survey data from fourteen African
   countries with Presidential transitions to show that ethnic Presidential
   change leads to an upwards shift in the percentage of respondents
   identifying with the new ruling ethnic group in non-democracies, and
   that this shift increases with the level of autocracy. I also show that
   countries where citizens perceive more ethnic favoritism see higher
   levels of ethnic switching. Within-survey evidence from Zambia
   demonstrates that this shift is immediate, and case study evidence from
   early modern China suggests that this phenomenon is not limited to
   Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {How responsive are democratic governments to business demands for tax
   cuts? We research this question in comparative case studies of cuts in
   corporate taxes and inheritance taxes in Austria and Sweden. We find
   that governments, regardless of partisan composition, are responsive to
   business demands, but that fiscal and electoral goals attenuate
   responsiveness. In both countries, the limited revenues generated by
   inheritance taxation and greater alignment of business demands with
   middle-class voter interests resulted in governments heading business
   demands for an abolition of this tax. Goal conflict were larger for
   corporate tax cuts. In both countries, governments tried to minimize
   these goal conflict by adopting compensatory policy measures,
   specifically measures to broaden the tax base and simultaneous tax cuts
   for low-income groups. The findings suggest that the policy output of
   business-friendly tax cuts reflect a balancing of conflicting goals,
   rather than outright business dominance.},

Abstract = {This present article investigates the processes of elaboration of gender
   equality policies under populist governments, focusing on the
   paradigmatic case of MAS government in Bolivia. Through interviews and
   documental analysis, the article examines how MAS applied its
   conceptions of ``people{''} and ``elite{''} to the women's organizations
   that intervened in policy-making processes in the field of gender
   equality, accusing feminist NGOs of being part of ``the elite{''} and
   praising indigenous women's social organizations as representatives of
   ``the people{''}. However, the government included feminist NGOs in the
   policy-making processes; which shows the existence of a contradiction
   between the anti-elite populist discourse and pragmatism in
   policy-making.},

Abstract = {Although membership is declining, parties continue to perform roles
   central to democratic governance in modern societies. Given this seeming
   paradox, we suggest that partisan identification, in complementing
   studies of formal membership, is a promising way of assessing the
   strength of parties' democratic linkage. Using data from an original
   survey of voters in Australia and the United Kingdom, we analyse the
   participatory and demographic profiles of party supporters. We show that
   there are significant differences between supporters and those not
   committed to any party, as well as between supporters based on the
   strength of their party identification, substantiating the idea that
   parties can be conceptualized as a series of concentric circles of
   increasing engagement but declining representativeness. Stronger
   supporters are more likely to engage with parties online, volunteer and
   donate, but are older, more likely to be male and less likely to be
   foreign-born. Our findings have important implications for democratic
   practice as parties seek to expand and rejuvenate their networks of
   affiliates.},

Abstract = {Treatments of collective action in political science, classical Greek
   history, and democratic theory often focus on the episodic and
   public-facing dimensions of dissent. This article turns to Aristotle for
   an account of solidaristic political action whose scale and tempo is
   sometimes obscured by such engagements. RevisitingThe Athenian
   Constitution's account of the tyrannicides of 514 BCE and the democratic
   revolution of 508/7 BCE, I argue for the centrality of comradeship to
   Aristotle's discussions of these episodes. I demonstrate that
   Aristotle's attention to the politics of comradeship is also legible
   inPolitics 5-which notes the dangers political clubs (hetaireiai) pose
   to tyranny-as well as Aristotle's references to comrades (hetairoi) in
   theNicomacheanandEudemian Ethics.This article contributes to our
   understanding of the birth of Athenian democracy and how comradeship-a
   vice, to Aristotle, under ordinary political circumstances-becomes a
   virtue.},

Abstract = {Around one-sixth of the European population have a disability, yet there
   are few self-declared disabled politicians. Despite scholarly and
   political interest in the under-representation of various social groups,
   little attention has been paid to disabled people. This article
   identifies and analyses the barriers to elected office faced by disabled
   people by drawing upon interviews with 51 candidates and elected
   politicians in the United Kingdom. It reveals barriers which occur
   throughout the political recruitment process, from initial participation
   to selection and the election campaign. They broadly fall into: (a) a
   lack ofaccessibility, including the built environment and documents; (b)
   a lack ofresourcesto make events and activities accessible; and
   (c)ableism, including openly expressed prejudices but also a lack of
   awareness and willingness to make processes inclusive. While people with
   different impairments encounter some distinct barriers, all of them have
   similar experiences of obstacles and exclusion which go beyond those
   faced by people from other under-represented groups seeking elected
   office.},

Abstract = {Since the emergence of propaganda, governments have used this strategy
   as a crucial instrument to manipulate the masses. The National Unity
   Committee, formed in Turkey after the overthrow of the Democrat Party
   rule on May 27, 1960, began to conduct intensive propaganda activities;
   they mainly focused their political propaganda on villages, home to the
   majority of the population. The primary propaganda activities in
   villages announced the regime change on May 27, followed by a campaign
   to win ``yes{''} votes in the constitutional referendum, requiring
   large-scale organization with different groups and tools. This study
   thus examines ways in which the National Unity Committee's propaganda
   efforts reached the population between the military coup (May 27, 1960)
   and the constitutional referendum (July 9, 1961). It also evaluates the
   propaganda process through speeches, meetings, and theater and film
   screenings organized in villages by village teachers, imams,
   intellectuals, and university youth assigned by the National Unity
   Committee and through newspapers, brochures, and posters distributed to
   villagers.},

Abstract = {About a decade ago an ambitious reform in the administration of justice
   began that affected all its areas: structural, functional, personal and
   technological. To this end, the promulgation of the regulatory norms of
   the New Judicial Office (NJO) was undertaken; the necessary legal
   reforms were approved to adapt the different functions and competences
   of the personnel to the service of the administration of justice; Law
   18/2011, of July 5, regulating the use of information and communication
   technologies in the administration of justice was promulgated; and,
   finally, important reforms in procedural norms have been promoted in
   order to adapt them to a new paradigm: electronic Justice or e-Justice,
   which aims to be more modern, efficient, effective and capable of
   responding to the requirements that society demands for this public
   service in the 21st century. However, the result has not been, in many
   respects, what was expected of such a relevant reform. In this work we
   will analyse the actions of CGPJ (General Council of the Judiciary), the
   undoubted achievements, but also the problems that are pending to be
   resolved and that ultimately prevent the culmination of this
   modernisation process.},

Abstract = {We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the
   International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to
   display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country
   than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in
   support is moderated by a citizen's ``proximity{''} to the
   investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be
   hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution
   and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey
   experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned
   respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and
   a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local
   violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for
   investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to
   the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help
   explain why support for international law can vary widely across
   subnational constituencies.},

Abstract = {Does government party support decline in a monotonic fashion throughout
   the legislative cycle or do we observe a u-shaped ``electoral cycle
   effect{''}? Moving beyond the study of midterm election results, this is
   the first comparative study to assess the cyclical pulse of government
   party support in parliamentary democracies based on voting intention
   polls from 171 cycles in 22 countries. On average, government parties
   lose support during the first half of the electoral cycle, but at most
   partially recover from their initial losses. Under single-party
   government and when prime ministers control cabinet dissolution, support
   tends to follow the previously assumed u-shaped pattern more strongly.
   Finally, we find that government parties hardly recover from early
   losses since the 2000s.},

Abstract = {Changes in voters' behavior and in the campaign strategies that
   political parties pursue are likely to have increased the importance of
   campaigns on voters' electoral choices. As a result, scholars
   increasingly question the usefulness and predictive power of structural
   forecasting models, that use information from ``fundamental{''}
   variables to make an election prediction several months before Election
   Day. In this paper, we empirically examine the expectation that
   structural forecasting models are increasingly error-prone. For doing
   so, we apply a structural forecasting model to predict elections in six
   established democracies. We then trace the predictive power of this
   model over time. Surprisingly, our results do not give the slightest
   indication of a decline in the predictive power of structural
   forecasting models. By showing that information on long-term factors
   still allows making accurate predictions of electoral outcomes, we
   question the assumption that campaigns matter more now than they did in
   the past.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The work analyses the legislative measures which the Party States in the
   Additional Protocol at the 2003 Convention on Cybercrime are obliged to
   adopt in order to harmonise the criminal legislation on the
   dissemination of ``racist and xenophobic material{''} on the Internet,
   classifying as criminal certain conduct against individuals or groups
   for reasons of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin or
   religion, addressing firstly the interpretative issues which its
   composition brings forward and which were addressed by the Explanatory
   Report. Next, there is a study of the problems posed by the application
   of the criteria resulting from the Protocol to that which is termed
   ``hate speech{''} in social networks: the intentionality of both the
   conduct and the effects brought about by the dissemination, taking into
   account the specifities of the social networks; intentional
   dissemination to the public in relation to the conduct, which is
   separate from private communications that are unpunishable due to the
   predetermination of the recipient, with the problems which arise when
   the recipient is a group of people; and the definition of the racist and
   xenophobic material which advocates, promotes or incites hatred,
   discrimination and violence, by reference to the international
   instruments in which incitement is a key element so that ``imminent
   danger{''} is incorporated as an additional implicit requirement in
   accordance with the recognised North American standard. Finally, there
   is an examination of how some of these criteria in particular, the
   doctrine of ``imminent danger{''} have been applied in a recent
   judgement by the European Court of Human Rights in 2018 on Internet hate
   speech.},

Abstract = {Political Psychology emerged as a discipline that examines political
   phenomena from a psychological perspective and produced various concepts
   and theories about nationalism. Thus, it shows that Turkish nationalism
   can be examined from the perspective of Political Psychology. At the
   same time, there are debates and different approaches around explaining
   the nationalism in the literature of nationalism. In this context, the
   purpose of this study is to evaluate Turkish nationalism through
   theories of Political Psychology within the frame of an ethno-symbolist
   approach. To that end, theories about the group formation and images
   have been cited from primary and secondary sources. Thoughts of Ziya
   Gokalp, who took an important place in Turkish political thought in
   terms of nationalism have been evaluated with social identity and image
   theories from an ethno-symbolist approach. In this evaluation two of the
   works, Turkification, Islamisation, Modernisation (Turklesmek,
   Islamlasmak, Muasirlasmak) and the Principles of Turkism (Turkculugun
   Esaslari) in which the notion of nationalism came to the fore have been
   assessed by using a discourse analysis method. At the end of the work it
   will show that from a Political Psychology perspective, Gokalp's
   conceptualisation of Turkish nationalism indicates a social identity on
   an ethnical basis and corresponds to an inner-group which has a high
   in-group solidarity and out-group discrimination, which is nationalistic
   in attitude and develops exemplary (ornek), rogue and excluded
   (dislanmis) images against the outer-groups.},

Abstract = {Armed insurgents seeking to seize the state often aim to transform the
   nature of state power. Yet for insurgents who become ruling authorities,
   how do radical visions of state power influence governance after the
   urgency of war? This article examines state-building in the liberation
   movement for Western Sahara, a partially recognized state which has
   ruled an exiled civilian Sahrawi population in Algeria from wartime
   through to a prolonged ceasefire. Drawing on in-depth qualitative
   fieldwork, and engaging with theories of radicalism, post-war
   sociopolitical reconstruction and anomalous forms of state power, the
   article traces how post-ceasefire international and domestic contexts
   created conflicting pressures and opportunities for both the moderation,
   and the continuation, of Sahrawi refugees' wartime radical governance.
   This case of insurgents-turned-rulers suggests how radicalism and
   moderation are overlapping processes, how moderation is not necessarily
   an `undoing' of radicalism, and how radical ideas matter for leadership
   and grassroots militants in different ways.},

Abstract = {This article outlines a preliminary perspective of peace in IR resting
   on analogue and digital versions in mainstream and critical forms. It
   discusses their implications for long standing key debates in the
   discipline about war and peace. It argues that digital IR/ international
   relations were initially thought to be a breakthrough for global civil
   society and rights, which promised a more emancipatory form of peace by
   allowing individuals and civil society to challenge power structures
   more effectively, and by curtailing the bounding effects of
   territorialism, sovereignty and nationalism. This gave critical forms of
   agency space to network. However, a brewing `counter-revolution' of what
   might be now called the `ancien regime' once again, points to digital
   forms of governmentality, which replicates the liberal and neoliberal
   governmentalities of the last few decades. This may make the analogue
   `liberal peace' look like a virtuous high-water mark in recent history.
   Furthermore, a digital version of peace has yet to be developed.},

Abstract = {When are high earnings considered a legitimate target for
   redistribution, and when not? We design a real-effort laboratory
   experiment in which we manipulate the assignment of payrates (societal
   ``reward rules{''}) that translate performance on a real-effort counting
   task into pre-tax earnings. We then ask subjects to vote on a flat tax
   rate in groups of three. We distinguish three treatment conditions: the
   same payrate for all group members ({''}equal{''} reward rule),
   differential (low, medium, and high) but random payrates ({''}luck{''}
   rule), and differential payrates based on subjects' performance on a
   quiz with voluntary preparation opportunity ({''}merit{''} rule).
   Self-interest is the dominant tax voting motivation. Tax levels are
   lower under ``merit{''} rule than under ``luck{''} rule, and merit
   reasoning overrides political ideology. But information is needed to
   activate merit reasoning. Both these latter effects are present only
   when voters have ``full merit knowledge{''} that signals precisely how
   others obtained their incomes.},

Abstract = {Although Member states have increasingly relied on welfare policies to
   control intra-EU migration in the last decade, they often grant
   additional social rights to EU citizens who do not comply with residency
   requirements set by EU law, revealing a gap between declared restrictive
   aims and actual inclusive measures. Based on document analysis and
   semi-structured interviews in Belgium, this article analyses the
   interests and logics of the plurality of institutional and civil society
   actors on the welfare-EU migration nexus, suggesting that policy
   inconsistency resulted from the struggle of these - conflictive -
   logics. In doing so, the paper also reveals how the category of `illegal
   EU migrants' has been institutionally produced `from below', with
   healthcare providers, welfare bureaucracies and pro-immigrant
   organisations - rather than `the State' - taking the lead in that
   process.},

Abstract = {Existential threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have historically
   engendered intellectual paradigm shifts, and even systemic
   transformations in the economy and polity. This paper focuses on two
   inter-related phenomena: rising economic inequality and the diminution
   of liberal democracy, a feature common to both developed and developing
   countries set in the context of a ubiquitous and globalized capitalism.
   In the post-pandemic world, we need to harness the positive dimensions
   of the powerful capitalist system to lower inequality and build a newer
   world akin to an earlier golden age of capitalism.},

Title = {Conditioned solidarity: EU citizens' attitudes towards economic and

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {330-350},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {During the European debt crisis, there has been a massive political
   debate between the EU institutions and the governments of crisis
   countries on the kind of austerity measures these countries have to
   accept in order to receive financial assistance from rescue funds
   established by EU and IMF. Based on a Weberian approach regarding
   solidarity as an act of mutual help, we interpret austerity measures as
   particular conditions of solidarity Alter has to agree to in order to
   receive assistance from Ego. In this paper, we ask to what extent
   citizens of EU countries agree on the notion of conditioned solidarity,
   and to which extent they are divided by socio-structural or cultural
   conflict lines, or by country particularities. Using unique data from
   the 2016 13 country `Transnational European Solidarity Survey', findings
   show that the majority of respondents reject the idea of conditionality.
   Logistic regressions reveal rather weak attitudinal differences between
   respondents at the individual level, while at the country level
   respondents from countries with growing unemployment, higher
   unemployment rates, government debt, and poverty rates are in tendency
   more likely to reject the measures. We conclude that paying attention to
   the idea of conditionality is an important aspect of assistance measures
   in the future, if political actors look to avoid a lack of legitimacy
   among European citizens.},

Abstract = {We develop a new framework to study legislative representation in list
   proportional representation (PR) systems. Our model studies a
   legislator's incentives to balance the competing interests of party
   leaders and local voters under a variety of list PR systems. We consider
   open and closed lists, as well as flexible lists-in which both rank
   assignments and preference votes determine the order in which seats are
   filled. We find that more flexibility can worsen local representation.
   List flexibility also acts as a key mediator of the effect of voter
   partisanship on party cohesion. And, our analysis reveals that higher
   district magnitude encourages representatives to toe the party line
   under all ballot systems.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed and accelerated an information crisis
   as well as a health one. What we discover about Covid 19, how it
   spreads, to whom and why and how best to mitigate it-all depend on
   information. The essays in this special section, which this article
   introduces, explore the importance of information and the fundamental
   role of fact checkers in understanding how information flows, why
   mistakes are made, and how to counteract them. Fact checking as an idea
   and a practice emerged in the early twenty-first century, developed as a
   positive beacon to counteract a growing sense that information could no
   longer be trusted. Now, more than a decade after its creation, fact
   checking sits within a far more complex and chaotic media context, and
   its expertise and understanding has never been so important. We need to
   understand what fact checkers do because they are grappling with how to
   tether us to reality.},

Abstract = {With the speed at which information is circulating, disinformation is
   bound to change our lives in profound ways. Although some may seem
   harmless, every time a piece of false information touches someone, it

   have been trying to reverse this negative trend to create value, and
   fight information disorder as a whole. These platforms are determined to
   explain that accurate information is accessible by anyone, and that no
   one needs to become an authority. However, organizations that do not
   agree with this idea can quickly become a target, especially in
   polarized societies. The only thing that can save us from being targeted
   is to provide transparency by engaging with our community and creating

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze the different impacts of the
   determinants of free trade agreements (FTAs) based on the stage of the
   FTA discussions. By disaggregating the FTA formation process into four
   stages, this study finds that the influence of industry interest groups
   has a positive impact on FTA formation in the first stage, when two
   countries initiate the discussion by establishing a joint study. In
   contrast, it has a negative impact in the last stage, when signed FTAs
   need to be ratified in order to enter into force. Political institutions
   emphasized in the existing studies are likely to be significant in the
   initial stages, but lose their significance as the process moves
   forward. The findings of this study collectively support the hypothesis
   that a given FTA is the result of sectoral politics where interests and
   the power of industries have a significant influence on trade policy
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {What strategies will states pursue in managing their relations with more
   powerful neighbours? International Relations scholarship identifies a
   wide range of policy options open to ``secondary states,{''} including
   soft balancing, bandwagoning and institutional binding. We provide a
   conceptual framework to distinguish between these similar and often
   conflated institutional strategies on the basis of two dimensions:
   threat perception and inclusiveness. We then apply this framework to the
   inter-American system. Analyzing original data on treaty action between
   1946 and 2015, we find that secondary states' adherence to multilateral
   agreements increases when the United States participates and when states
   do not perceive the hegemon to be a threat. These findings suggest that
   institutional binding captures the dynamics of inter-American
   cooperation more adequately than either soft balancing or bandwagoning:
   states balance against perceived threats but bind their friends.},

Abstract = {Nurse migration is a significant global issue that necessitates the
   cooperation of host and sending states. Cooperation enables countries to
   collaborate on shared solutions to confront global nurse imbalance that
   threatens health systems. While cooperation allows countries to
   collaborate, some states are cautious to cooperate while others
   participate actively. This article examines the bilateral labor
   negotiations between the Philippines and the following host countries:
   Canadian provinces-Saskatchewan (2006), Manitoba and Alberta
   (2006-2008), and South Australia (2008-2009) to demonstrate how
   bilateral parties negotiate agreements in hiring Filipino nurses.
   Drawing from negotiation analysis, it argues that bilateral negotiations
   that fulfill two necessary conditions- (i) participation of nonpartisan
   technical expert and (ii) history of previous interactions-facilitate
   successful negotiations that ultimately lead to labor cooperation. This
   article concludes by explaining how negotiation analysis uncovers the
   advantage of labor-sending countries like the Philippines in
   successfully securing agreements that promote labor export to achieve
   economic growth.},

   Polarization Towards Voters and Parties in Norway and the United States},

Abstract = {A growing body of comparative studies on partisan hostility - a
   phenomenon known as affective polarization - is providing evidence that
   partisan affective polarization is generally no greater in the United
   States than it is in many European multiparty systems. This article
   takes the comparative literature on affective polarization one step
   further by presenting the first comparative study on affective
   polarization that simultaneously uses, compares and combines a direct
   measure of affective polarization towards voters (using the inter-party
   marriage measure) and an indirect measure of affective polarization
   towards parties (using the like/dislike of party measure) while
   accounting for the fact that multiparty systems have numerous political
   parties. This is done by comparing the levels of affective polarization
   in the United States and Norway. The results show greater affective
   polarization in the United States relating to parties, but the
   differences between these two countries are indistinguishable from
   chance when focusing on the affect relating to voters. This provides
   empirical evidence that comparative evidence of negative affect towards
   parties cannot necessarily be generalized to suggest that there is
   comparative evidence of negative affect towards voters. Yet the results
   also suggest that negative feelings towards out-parties move to some
   extent to the personal level in terms of negative feelings towards
   voters of these out-parties.},

Abstract = {This article examines the conceptualisations of peace and its
   preconditions manifested in the critical turn in peace theory: bottom-up
   approaches which begin with particular contexts and postulate diverse
   local actors as integral to the process of peace-building. This article
   argues that the turn is at an impasse and is unable to address the
   crucial charge that its conceptualisation of peace is inconsistent. To
   explain the persistence of inconsistency and to move us forward, the
   article analyses, evaluates and responds to the turn through the lens of
   Nicholas Rengger's work on the anti-Pelagian imagination in political
   theory. This is defined as a tendency to begin theorising from
   non-utopian, anti-perfectionist and sceptical assumptions. Through this
   examination the article argues that the critical turn is anti-Pelagian
   but not consistently so because it often gives way to perfectionism,
   adopts naive readings of institutions and postulates demanding
   conceptions of political agency and practice. This inconsistency with
   its own philosophical premises makes the turn's conceptualisation of
   peace and its preconditions incoherent. Finally, the article sketches an
   alternative account of peace which draws upon a number of anti-Pelagian
   scholars and mobilises Rengger's particular defense of anti-Pelagianism.
   The suggested alternative, the article argues, provides us with a more
   coherent theory of peace and a way out of existing dead ends.},

Abstract = {To better account for deepening global inequalities, political theory
   could greatly enhance empirical and normative work by answering a
   fundamental question: What is profit? When engaging political-economic
   questions, however, theorists often begin thinking from the concept of
   private property. This, I argue, has obscured the central role of profit
   as an organizing category for capitalist societies since the eighteenth
   century. Grounded in the dynamic and uncertain processes of production
   and accumulation, profit displaces the proprietary citizen and subject
   of natural rights and gives rise to new social protagonists, who lay
   claim to increasingly asymmetric rewards. In particular, the article
   calls attention to a dangerous contemporary sensibility, which sees
   profit as inherently unlimited. As a viable, robust alternative, it
   presents Adam Smith's idea of profit as a regular, uniform rate that
   acts as a productive constraint on business activity, shapes character,
   and safeguards against risk by widely distributing its costs.},

Abstract = {Public school boards are a significant exception to the significant
   gender gap in political representation. Throughout the country, 44
   percent of board members are women; this is a potentially significant
   female candidate pool for higher office, given that, for example, of the
   state legislators who held prior elective office, 26 percent of them had
   served on a school board. With such a collection of experienced
   candidates, why then, are so few women progressing to higher levels of
   office? Drawing on findings of a survey of a representative sample of
   more than 300 elected school board members in the state of Pennsylvania,
   I extend the limited research on the role of networks of recruitment's
   impact on the progressive ambition among elected school board members
   and discusses the factors in both personal and political network
   recruitment associated with gender differences. I also highlight the
   largest delta between men and women: interest in running for state
   legislature. Implications for the deficient pipeline of women to higher
   office and potential remedies are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Arab Spring marks a puzzling shift in the sanction politics of the
   Arab League: for the first time, the Arab League suspended member states
   for matters of internal affairs by majority vote. This article argues
   that survival politics can explain the changing sanction politics of the
   Arab League. To re-legitimize rule during this unprecedented moment,
   member states selectively supported some protest movements to signal
   their understanding of public demands for change without committing to
   domestic reform. Contrasting case studies of the Arab League's
   suspension of Libya and Syria and its simultaneous support for military
   intervention against protestors in Bahrain illustrate how concerns for
   regime legitimation and a short-lived alliance between Saudi Arabia and
   Qatar contributed to the sanctioning decisions. The Arab League can thus
   be considered a case of negative democracy protection, where regional
   sanctions are employed to selectively preserve authoritarian rule.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between employee voice suppression
   by workplace authorities (i.e. supervisors) and the formation of
   employees' attitudes towards political authority. We test whether the
   effect of experienced voice suppression by supervisors on employees'
   preference for authoritarian governance is positive, negative or
   nonlinear. The hypotheses are tested on original data gathered within
   the Dutch Work and Politics Survey 2017 (N = 7599), which allows for a
   wide range of demographic and organisational control variables. The
   results favour a nonlinear effect of suppression on employees'
   authoritarianism. These results support the notion that political
   attitudes are dynamic and that the workplace plays a role in shaping
   them.},

Title = {When parties go abroad: Explaining patterns of extraterritorial voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As more countries grant political rights to their emigrants and more
   politicians look beyond national boundaries for support, scholars are
   beginning to explore the drivers and implications of voting from abroad.
   We use an original dataset of overseas campaigning by political parties
   in 108 elections in 24 countries to provide the first cross-national
   test of how party mobilization shapes turnout beyond national borders.
   Using fractional regression and inverse probability weighting with
   regression adjustment (IPWRA), we find that party mobilization increases
   extraterritorial voter turnout. Our results remain robust when
   controlling for emigrant profiles, institutional barriers to
   participation, and political context and correcting for self-selection
   bias.},

Abstract = {By 2018, Venezuela had lost 49.32\% of its total GDP in just five years
   (2014-2018). Performing a historical and comparative analysis with
   Stata's econometrics package, results show that this aggregated
   evolution of GDP represents the worst macroeconomic performance in
   magnitude and duration in the history of Venezuela (1950-2018), the
   worst in Latin America and the second worst in the world in the period
   1980-2018.},

Abstract = {A number of scholars have argued that we should pay closer attention to
   the role that philanthropy plays in shaping our societies. Philanthropic
   foundations are inherently political. They use private money for public
   purposes, and they receive tax advantages for the donations they make,
   but they typically lack transparency and public accountability. In this
   article, I argue that elite philanthropy may also violate three other
   democratic principles: (1) the all-affected principle; (2) the principle
   of non-arbitrary power; and (3) the provisionality principle. In
   response, I argue that we should consider using innovative democratic
   institutions - such as participatory budgeting processes - to decide how
   philanthropic funds should be used and distributed. Taking measures to
   democratize philanthropy would help mitigate some of the democratic
   concerns with elite philanthropy while acknowledging the important role
   that philanthropy plays in shaping our present, unequal societies.},

Abstract = {Protests in response to Israeli military action in the Occupied
   Territories have a long history in Israel. While such opposition
   movements in many countries are comprised of civil society activists,
   the dynamics of protest differ in Israel because of the country's
   mandatory military service. From the 1980s to present day, former and
   current Israeli soldiers have used a wide range of methods, tactics, and
   strategies to challenge Israeli military actions. Using insights from
   nonviolent resistance theories, we examine how the approaches and goals
   of military opposition groups in Israel have changed over the past
   decades. Specifically, we develop a typology to explain why different
   types of protest arise from within the Israeli Defense Force that garner
   strong reactions - whether laudatory or derogatory - from the Israeli
   government and general public. The paper concludes with lessons learned
   for military opposition movements in the context of nonviolent
   resistance theory and practice.},

Abstract = {This Comment focuses on the limitations of Stilz's individualist
   conception of occupancy rights. Her account of occupancy is critical to
   her attempt to answer the question of where one holds territorial rights
   as well as related place-related rights like the right of return. Her
   account appeals to the geographical location of individual life plans.
   This Comment argues that this fails to distinguish between Indigenous
   People who are connected historically and in many other ways to a place
   and individual Life-Planners: it treats the two as equivalent, which I
   argue is counter-intuitive. I also argue that Stilz's occupancy account
   fails to explain the scope of occupancy rights in a number of cases that
   she appeals to in her examples, such as the Navajos' expulsion from the
   area in which they lived. What she needs, I argue, is a group based
   conception of occupancy rights, in addition to the idea of individual
   rights of residency.},

Abstract = {Anna Stilz'sTerritorial Sovereignty(2019) aims to be a revisionist
   account of territorial rights that puts the value of individual autonomy
   first, without giving up the value of collective self-determination. In
   what follows I examine Stilz's definition of occupancy rights and her
   emphasis on the moral relevance of what she calls `located' life plans.
   I suggest that, if it aims at being truly revisionist, her theory should
   work with a broader definition of occupancy. So long as it doesn't,
   these rights will be mainly the preserve of groups of settlers and
   peoples with predictable patterns of movement. Moreover, insofar as
   occupancy rights ground collective rights to self-determination, they
   actually have the potential to trump individual rights to what I call
   `dynamic' or non-located occupancy. This is worrying, I claim, for at
   least two reasons. First, rights to dynamic occupancy are arguably as
   central for respecting individual autonomy as rights to located
   occupancy. And second, rights to dynamic ocupancy should be seen as key
   in helping to form the kind of political allegiances required to
   overcome the most pressing collective action problems that humanity
   faces.},

   discussion of the ethics of migration, labeled here the ``Argument from
   Parentage{''} and the ``Argument from Corruption.{''} When considered
   from the perspective of liberal democracies, those arguments help us
   realize that political communities should be considered as a subject of
   justice in migration alongside individuals, and that migration might
   entail some citizen-to-community obligations. This means that some
   correctives may be justified to offset the moral costs of some acts of
   migration. This paper concludes by exploring how the extension of local
   voting rights in absentia could be one such corrective.},

Abstract = {The nature of identity formation is complex. The production of identity
   in South Asia, with its colonial past, has been largely dependent on the
   region's colonial history. In this article we chart the process of
   political identity formation in Bangladesh. We identify the various
   historical causes that led to the creation of each of the two types of
   identity prevalent today. These two divisive identities based on
   language and religion, one pitted against the other, each became the
   central platform of each of the two major political parties, the Awami
   League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). This
   disquisition shows clear patterns of political distress that resulted in
   the bifurcation of these two divisive political identities that ossified
   by the late 20th century due chiefly to the actions of the colonial
   government of the Raj.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Throughout history and across countries, women appear more likely than
   men to enter politics on the heels of a close family relative or spouse.
   To explain this dynastic bias in women's representation, we introduce a
   theory that integrates political selection decisions with informational
   inequalities across social groups. Candidates with dynastic ties benefit
   from the established reputations of their predecessors, but these
   signals of quality are more important to political newcomers such as
   women. Legislator-level data from twelve democracies and candidate-level
   data from Ireland and Sweden support the idea that dynastic ties are
   differentially more helpful to women, and that the quality of
   predecessors may be more relevant for the entry and evaluation of female
   successors than their male counterparts. The role of informational
   inequalities is also reflected in the declining dynastic bias over time
   (as more women enter politics), and in the differential effect of a
   gender quota across Swedish municipalities.},

Abstract = {How can we merge the science of politics and the practice of politics
   into a single course? In a 16-week, upper division course on state
   politics, I address the need to develop students' social scientific
   skills and practical skills through journal article analysis (JAA) teams
   and public policy project (PPP) teams. I use a within-subjects, pretest
   post-test, research design and rely on student self-assessments of their
   scientific and analyst abilities before and after the course. I find
   that students self-identify a positive change in their scientific and
   analyst abilities.},

Title = {More Than a Vacation? Assessing the Impact of a Short-Term Study Abroad
   Program to the Middle East},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {What impact do short-term, faculty-led study abroad programs have on
   student learning? And are such programs more impactful than a standard
   face-to-face course? University administrators and faculty have long
   touted study abroad programs' ability to challenge stereotypes and
   promote cross-cultural understanding among students. However, little
   research exists to corroborate these claims, leading skeptics to argue
   that study abroad programs provide a fun experience for students, but
   not much actual academic value. This article weighs in on this debate by
   analyzing the impact of a two-and-a-half week study abroad program to
   Jordan and Israel during summer 2017 and summer 2018. It does so by
   assessing quantitative and qualitative data gathered from pre- and
   post-program surveys for 51 undergraduate program participants. In
   addition, it compares these data to similar data collected from students
   who completed an in-class section of Middle Eastern Politics to
   determine whether study abroad has any greater impact on student
   perceptions of the region than a standard university course. The results
   suggest that studying abroad in the Middle East does indeed impact
   student perceptions and stereotypes of the region and that, on most
   measures, this effect is greater than that observed among students in
   the face-to-face course.},

Abstract = {This article studies gender differences in media portrayals of political
   leadership, starting with the expectation that male politicians are
   evaluated more often on traits belonging to the male leader stereotype,
   and that female politicians have no such advantage. These gender
   differences are expected to be especially pronounced during non-campaign
   periods. To test these expectations, a large-scale automated content
   analysis of all Dutch national newspapers from September 2006 to
   September 2012 was conducted. The results show that male politicians
   received more media coverage on leadership traits in general, although
   the male and female leader stereotypes explain most of the variation in
   gender bias between leadership traits. These gender effects are found
   during seldom-studied routine periods but not during campaigns. As
   leadership trait coverage has electoral consequences, this
   gender-differentiated coverage likely contributes to the
   under-representation of women in politics.},

   pandemic: coordination for addressing emerging threats},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze, from the perspective of
   organizational theory, the coordination between the International
   Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and national police institutions
   to stop emerging security threats. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated
   changes in the way organized crime operates. Particularly, the pandemic
   has increased the illegal sale of falsified medical products and there
   has been an increase in frauds and financial scams to hospitals and
   health authorities, as well as diverse modalities of cybercrime.
   Multilateral efforts by INTERPOL and national authorities to prevent
   these crimes have had relative success in terms of coordination. Given
   this situation, the research question is: What characteristics of the
   INTERPOL `s organizational design has made the coordination with
   national police institutions more efficient? In this case study it is
   argued that, in a certain way, this is due to the following factors: a)
   the nature and structure of this inter-governmental organization; b) the
   autonomy and institutional strength that INTERPOL has built since its
   foundation; c) the ample organizational experience it has obtained
   through its constant technical assistance to governments; and d) civil
   and police bureaucracy dealing with crises as part of their routine
   tasks. Findings indicate that INTERPOL is an organization with autonomy,
   agency and legitimacy. Therefore, it can be considered a strategic actor
   (Barnett y Coleman, 2005), a self-directed actor (Zamudio, 2019), or a
   complete organization (Brunson, 2017).},

Abstract = {Most representative democracies seem to experience dwindling levels of
   legitimacy in the eyes of citizens. Nevertheless, it remains unclear
   what people want from parliamentary decision-making. In this study, we
   test the impact of outcome favourability, actor involvement and
   justifications on the perceived legitimacy of a parliamentary
   decision-making process on euthanasia in Finland. We do so with the help
   of a survey experiment (n = 1243), where respondents were exposed to a
   vignette where the treatments varied randomly. The results suggest that
   outcome favourability is of primary importance, but the involvement of
   experts and citizens also boost legitimacy in the eyes of citizens.
   Justifications, or presenting arguments for the decisions, does not
   enhance legitimacy and may even cause a backfire mechanism where the
   difference between getting and not getting the preferred outcome is
   amplified.},

Abstract = {The current European refugee crisis is first and foremost a humanitarian
   crisis. This article addresses the difficulties the European Union (EU)
   faces in building a proper Common Migration and Asylum Policy. The
   author argues that the problem here lies in the different approaches
   towards migration held by EU member states. Different migratory
   traditions are one of the key issues related to the misunderstanding
   among the states. Their approaches are determined by their geographical
   locations and migration histories. The member states use the same
   concepts and terms when discussing migration; however, the meanings of
   these concepts and terms are not equivalent, as each state uses them
   differently. The main aim of this article is to analyse, compare and,
   hopefully, to give some clarity to the positions held by the most of EU
   member states and particularly the Visegrad Group countries (V4). Even
   though apparently, they hold opposite positions towards migration, the
   study finds that they share some common features such as a denial of
   being an asylum country and the absence of a related public policy.
   Probably the most important conclusion has to do with the fact that
   these two group of countries are appealing to a ``selective solidarity
   principle{''} depending on the circumstances.},

Abstract = {Previous research provides solid evidence for the existence of a ballot
   position effect. The cognitive mechanisms behind this effect are,
   however, undertheorized and understudied. We develop and test here
   `voter perception effects' as a possible explanation. Following this
   reasoning, the list position in a list-PR system functions as a
   heuristic cue for the competence of candidates: candidates selected for
   a high list position are perceived as more competent by voters, even
   when controlling for other candidate characteristics. Our results, based
   on an experimental design, show that head of lists are indeed perceived
   as more competent than middle of list candidates. This is related to
   both advantages for the first position and to disadvantages related to a
   middle of list position.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to study the impact of social justice
   and alienation on the political participation of people in Jahrom, Iran.
   Methodologically, field surveys were applied in terms of amplitude, and
   a cross-sectional study in terms of scope. The statistical population of
   this research were the holders of voting rights (over 18 years old)
   residing in the city of Jahrom. Sample size was calculated using the
   Cochran formula and selected by simple multi-stage cluster random
   sampling. The research questionnaire was developed by an investigator
   and was used by experts to determine its validity. For the data
   analysis, the regression coefficient tests, Mann-Whitney and
   Kruskal-Wallis were used. The results showed that there is a significant
   relationship between the sense of social justice and the sense of social
   alienation with political participation among the citizens of Jahrom.
   Furthermore, according to the study findings, the relationship of
   political participation based on contextual factors of citizens, gender,
   marital status, income, occupation and social class did not have a
   significant correlation with political participation (P value> 0.5).},

Abstract = {Utilitarian theories propose that support for the EU is based on an
   instrumental calculus about the costs and benefits of European
   integration. Drawing on these theories, we analyze whether and how ads
   produced by European institutions affect public support for the EU. Our
   findings, based on a panel survey experiment, indicate that these ads
   increase support for the EU, and that ads emphasizing the policy
   benefits of European integration are more effective than ads emphasizing
   its reduced costs. However, these positive effects are short-lived,
   since they had disappeared one year after citizens were initially
   exposed to the ads. In a context of increasing negativity towards the
   EU, these findings, based on realistic treatments, have relevant
   theoretical and policy implications.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade and a half, the legislation on marital ruptures has
   experienced significant changes with the possibility of shared custody
   being one of the reforms with greater impact. Although these regulations
   have not ceased to be enacted, there is no study, such as this one, that
   relates legislation and practice of shared custody in Spain. This
   article uses the INE Statistics of nullities, separations and divorces,
   as the main data source analyzing it from its microdata. It is concluded
   that the existence of a specific law has triggered shared custodies;
   however, this practice has increased in those Autonomous Communities
   where it was previously more frequent. Yet, other variables also
   intervene in the assignment of shared custodies, as confirmed by the
   cases of the Balearic Islands or the Valencian Community.},

Abstract = {For decades, political and private polling operations have informed
   about the public's perceptions regarding a range of topics. In
   particular, universities (e.g., Marist and Quinnipiac) provide
   noteworthy research to inform and predict the outcomes of US elections.
   Yet, what role do our classrooms play in advancing the public opinion
   polling skills of our students? This article uses experiential learning
   as a descriptive framework to illustrate how a yearlong, immersive, and
   student-led public opinion polling experience, the Big Sky Poll,
   advances students' social-science and data-fluency skills. Our findings
   suggest important insights into the future of public opinion polling
   from the vantage point of a rural Western state, which can be replicated
   in other academic institutions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {433-449},

Abstract = {Why do some UN targeted sanctions (or ``smart{''} sanctions) cause
   collateral damage to the general population, while others minimize it?
   We suggest the scope and the effectiveness of smart sanctions, as well
   as the political institutions of target countries, are critical
   determinants of sanctions' adverse effects on human rights. Leaders
   targeted by sanctions with a broad scope will have a greater incentive
   to oppress people to ward off potential support for challengers. The
   degree to which they can carry out successful oppression, however,
   hinges upon the effectiveness of the implementation of sanctions.
   Furthermore, we expect that authoritarian systems are more likely to
   encourage oppression than other ones. We conduct a quantitative analysis
   of 56 UN-imposed smart sanction episodes. Our study reveals sanctions
   with a broad scope that are less effective result in deteriorated human
   rights conditions, especially in authoritarian countries. However, we
   find when sanctions with a narrow scope work effectively, they do not
   hurt innocent citizens.},

Abstract = {The political party rally was reinvented by Jeremy Corbyn. Despite
   retaining the rally as an election campaign strategy, Labour
   calamitously lost the 2019 general election. Did something go wrong with
   this strategy? This paper analyses the results of a survey of
   participants in a Corbyn rally in Camborne, Cornwall in 2017, close to
   two marginal constituencies. It finds that very few participants were
   not already dedicated Labour voters. The paper warns of the danger of
   advertising these rallies only through closed mobilisation channels. For
   improved efficacy, rallies in marginal constituencies might more widely
   advertise using open channels to a broader range of people.},

   behavior of their subjects. Here, we highlight several important areas
   of theoretical and empirical refinements, which can provide a more
   nuanced picture of the process through which authoritarian attitudinal
   legacies emerge and persist. First, we define the nature of attitudinal
   legacies and their driving mechanisms, developing a framework of
   competing socialization. Second, we use the competing socialization
   framework to explain two potential sources of heterogeneity in
   attitudinal and behavioral legacies: varieties of institutional features
   of authoritarian regimes, which affect the nature of regime
   socialization efforts; and variations across different subgroups of
   (post-)authoritarian citizens, which reflect the nature and strength of
   alternative socialization efforts. This new framework can help us to
   better understand contradictory findings in this emerging literature as
   well as set a new agenda for future research.},

   periods of development, this article draws attention to crucial turning
   points such as the Cyprus crisis of 1974, the establishment of SAGEB in
   1985, the ongoing fight against terrorism, the restructuring of the
   Turkish political system and the steadfast commitment of the AK Party
   governments under President Erdogan to invest in Turkey's indigenous
   defense industry. Since the early 2000s, the Turkish defense industry
   has shifted from a procurement model largely dependent on foreign
   imports to a far more self-reliant model with a strong research and
   development foundation and a growing number of exports. Thanks to the
   commitment, determination and resilience of Turkey's engineers,
   technicians, workers and companies, the Turkish defense industry has
   transformed into a multi-billion-dollar industry characterized by
   technological depth and global effectiveness.},

Abstract = {What factors shape citizens' willingness to engage in vote selling? This
   paper argues that providing voters with information about the
   detrimental effect of vote selling (public service predation) or telling
   them that their community members will look down on them if they engage
   in the practice (social sanctioning) can shape vote-selling attitudes in
   emerging democracies. Using a nationwide randomized survey experiment
   carried out between May and June of 2012 in Kenya, this study primes
   voters with theory-based informational messages for voters to test
   whether such messages can potentially curtail vote-selling attitudes.
   The paper finds that both public service predation and social
   sanctioning messages can reduce stated vote-selling preferences as much
   as legal campaigns that have been tested previously. The study has
   important implications for researchers and policy-makers because it
   suggests alternative methods to change vote-selling attitudes and even
   behavior in the short- to medium-term.},

Abstract = {In his relentlessly substantive and intelligent book,The Second
   Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era, Stanford
   historian Jonathan Gienapp offers an important contribution to founding
   scholarship and a fresh and foundational challenge to originalism.
   Specifically, Gienapp examines how the founders answered the question,
   what is a constitution? The historical narrative resulting from
   Gienapp's research into this question traces the eclipse and eventual
   replacement of ``incomplete{''} and ``unfinished{''} understandings of
   constitutional identity with a form of constitutional consciousness he
   calls ``constitutional fixity.{''} This review essay identifies several
   contributions ofSecond Creationand explains how and why it represents a
   fundamental challenge to originalism. It takes issue, however, with
   Gienapp's understanding of the evolution of James Madison's
   understanding of constitutional identity and suggests that
   ``constitutional fixity{''} may have been present in the political
   thought of the American founders earlier than Gienapp claims.},

Abstract = {In 2019, Canada's gross subnational debt to GDP was well over 40 per
   cent, easily the highest in the world (see Figure 1). This level will
   only grow as the provinces grapple with the pandemic and its fiscal
   effects. Some believe surging provincial debts have brought Canadian
   federalism to a critical juncture: they have greatly increased the odds
   of federal measures to stabilize provincial finances. This article
   assesses this claim. The cleanest and most balanced path to fiscal
   sustainability is a combination of enhanced federal transfers, which
   would bolster provincial fiscal capacity, and national fiscal rules,
   which would constrain provincial borrowing. But the former is unlikely
   to restore sustainability on its own, and the latter would require a
   severe provincial debt crisis, which Canada's existing fiscal federal
   structures can avoid. COVID-19 has increased the odds of certain
   reforms, and it is difficult to predict their long-run effects. But any
   obvious paths to fiscal sustainability remain hidden.},

Abstract = {Does populism threaten American democracy, and if so, what is the nature
   of that threat? In dialogue with the comparative literature on populism,
   this article considers the opportunity structure available to populist
   parties and candidates in the American political system. I argue that
   compared to most other democracies, the US system offers much less
   opportunity for organized populist parties but more opportunity for
   populist candidacies. Today's major parties may also be more vulnerable
   to populist insurgency than at other points in US history because of (1)
   changes in communications technology, (2) the unpopularity of mainstream
   parties and party leaders, and (3) representation gaps created by an
   increasingly racialized party system. Although no democratic system is
   immune to deterioration, the US constitutional system impedes
   authoritarian populism, just as it obstructs party power generally. But
   the vulnerability of the major parties to populist insurgency poses a
   threat to liberal democratic norms in the United States, just as it does
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The longstanding unresolved issue of Kashmir serves as a nuclear
   flashpoint between India and Pakistan. Since 2019, the prevalent
   security environment of the region has dominated the discourse
   surrounding the regional and global security architecture. India's
   policies during the Pulwama-Balakot crisis and the revocation of
   Kashmir's constitutional status demonstrate the country's intentions of
   dominating the escalation ladder in the region and marginalizing the
   muslim community of Kashmir. Because of the conventional disparity in
   South Asia where India is big interms of size, economy and military
   build-up, Pakistan has been further threatened by India's aggressive
   policies and provocative military modernization. Consequently, Pakistan
   may be compelled to further revisit its nuclear threshold level to
   overcome India's aggression.},

Title = {Disentangling an Elusive Relationship: How Democratic Value Orientations
   Affect Political Trust in Different Regimes},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The question whether democratic values are on the rise or in decline has
   received much attention in political-culture research. Yet, few scholars
   have studied the consequences either of these trends has for political
   trust. Although political trust has long been attributed a central role
   for the functioning and stability of any political system, we still know
   little about the relationship between citizens' value orientations and
   political trust. Recent advances have furthered the discussion by
   conceptualizing this relationship to be conditional on the respective
   country's level of democracy; yet this literature does not take into
   account findings that demonstrate citizens rarely have an accurate grasp
   of their country's democratic quality. Integrating the two strands of
   literature, this contribution suggests a relationship between democratic
   value orientations and political trust that is universally contingent on
   citizens' perceptions of democratic quality. Testing this proposition
   for over one hundred democracies and autocracies, it finds that
   democratic value orientations decrease political trust whenever citizens
   perceive their regime's democratic quality as lacking and increase
   political trust whenever citizens perceive their political regime as
   being of high democratic quality. In contrast, the actual level of
   democracy plays no role for the effect of democratic value orientations
   on political trust.},

Abstract = {This article examines the character of so-called Bonapartism through the
   development of the class struggle in the period between 1848 and 1851.
   The perspective adopted is that in contrast to what is stated in the
   classics (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Gramsci) of Marxism, Bonapartism is
   neither a form of politics imposed from the exterior against all social
   classes, nor is it a manifestation of the state's autonomy vis avis the
   bourgeoisie (Poulantzas). On the contrary, it is a characteristic form
   of the bourgeois state, which does not have parliamentary institutions
   among its constituent elements. On the basis of this argumentation, one
   can understand the current tendency of limited representative relations,
   which benefits state-controlled mechanisms that are independent of
   popular control},

Abstract = {The systematic persecution and ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas by
   Myanmar which resulted from populist hatred can be traced back to the
   Second World War when the Rohingyas sided with the British. Xenophobia
   has taken a permanent shape in the practice of power, the motive force
   behind the actions and reactions of successive Myanmar states and
   political elites. The colonial legacy has been used as the rationale for
   isolation and the use of violence against the Rohingyas. The
   socio-historical constructed and imposed identity throughout the
   colonial and post-colonial years has been used by the majority Buddhists
   to dehumanize the Rohingyas. The article argues that the historical
   identity creation and imposition by the majority Buddhists have
   facilitated the recent refugee crisis. The article aims to identify
   whether the tactics of post-truth politics have been used to fuel
   populist anti-Rohingya feelings among the majority Buddhists.},

Abstract = {Political theorists continue to be provoked by Giorgio Agamben's
   disturbing diagnosis that `bare life' - human life that is excluded from
   politics yet exposed to sovereign violence - is not a sign of the
   malfunction of modern politics but rather a revelation of how it
   actually functions. However, despite the enormous amount of attention
   this diagnosis has received, there has been relatively little discussion
   of Agamben's proposed `cure' for the problem that he diagnoses. In this
   article, I analyze the three main concepts of Agamben's positive
   philosophical program - `infancy,' `potentiality,' and `form-of-life' -
   in order to show how he attempts to subvert the sovereignty of law over
   life with his idea of a life of habit in which life is sovereign over
   law. In addition to analyzing these concepts, I engage in an immanent
   critique of Agamben's philosophy and contrast his vision of politics
   with those of other influential contemporary political theorists. I find
   that while Agamben's philosophical program is almost undone by internal
   difficulties, it still radically challenges current theories of
   subjectivity, humanity, and community.},

Abstract = {What explains the scarcity of women and under-represented minorities
   among university faculty relative to their share of Ph.D. recipients?
   Among many potential explanations, we focus on the ``demand{''} side of
   faculty diversity. Using fully randomized conjoint analysis, we explore
   patterns of support for, and resistance to, the hiring of faculty
   candidates from different social groups at two large public universities
   in the U.S. We find that faculty are strongly supportive of diversity:
   holding other attributes of (hypothetical) candidates constant, for
   example, faculty at both universities are between 11 and 21 percentage
   points more likely to prefer a Hispanic, black, or Native American
   candidate to a white one. Furthermore, preferences for diversity in
   faculty hiring are stronger among faculty than among students. These
   results suggest that the primary reason for the lack of diversity among
   faculty is not a lack of desire to hire them, but the accumulation of
   implicit and institutionalized biases, and their related consequences,
   at later stages in the pipeline.},

Abstract = {Political science engages similar types of identity on different terms.
   There are extensive literatures describing phenomena related to
   national, ethnic, class, and gender identity; however, these literatures
   in isolation give us little insight into broader political mechanics of
   identity itself. Furthermore, many of the theoretical approaches to
   identity in political science tend to proceed from the macro-level,
   without conceptualizing its building blocks. How should we conceptualize
   and operationalize identity in political science? In this article, we
   examine the existing literature on identity in ethnic politics,
   nationalism studies, and gender politics to show this disconnect in
   conceptualizing identity across research agendas. We then provide an
   integrated model of identity, focusing on how gradations of visibility,
   conceptualization, and recognition form the basis of claims and
   conflicts about the politics of identity. We conclude by elucidating a
   path to overcoming these issues by opening space for a rethinking of
   identity in political science.},

Abstract = {On 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union after 47 years of
   membership. This paper uses the conceptual distinction between
   integrative and distributive bargaining to compare the EU's and the UK's
   approaches in the negotiations that led to the Withdrawal Agreement,
   setting out the terms of the UK's exit, and the Political Declaration on
   the framework for the future EU-UK relationship. While it would be
   rational to expect both parties to adopt integrative approaches given
   the nature of the issues, the long history of cooperation, and the
   parties' mutual interest in maintaining a close relationship in the
   future, the comparison demonstrates that it was mainly the EU that
   leaned towards the integrative end of the negotiating spectrum, with
   extensive internal consultations, a willingness to engage in open and
   interest-based discussions aimed at problem-solving, and high levels of
   transparency, whereas the UK leaned further to the distributive end,
   reflecting less engagement and consultation with domestic constituents,
   a focus on pre-determined positions that need defending, and lower
   levels of transparency.},

Abstract = {Political parties have an electoral incentive to appear ideologically
   unified, but also to appeal broadly to different groups of voters with
   diverse preferences. This paper suggests that parties respond to both
   incentives through the distribution of candidate issue positions.
   Members of Parliament (MPs) are responsible for their party's national
   reputation and thus rarely take positions that diverge from those of
   their party. Non-incumbent candidates, on the other hand, are mostly
   visible within their electoral district and thus more likely to diverge
   from party positions that are unpopular among their constituents. These
   possibilities are tested with candidate position taking data from nine
   voting advice applications in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Switzerland.
   The results are consistent with the theoretical expectations and have
   important implications for the way representation works in parliamentary
   democracies as well as for the broader literature on the topic.},

Abstract = {Parties in government are widely expected to be broadly responsive to
   public opinion. However, history is littered with examples of
   governments pursuing unpopular courses of action. This article explores
   how public opinion influences elite decision-making by tracing the
   process behind the Liberal Democrats' notorious U-turn on tuition fees.
   Interviews with the politicians and advisers who took the decision
   reveal that the party's policy priorities in government owed more to the
   preferences of elite decision-makers than to the preferences of the
   party's supporters. They also provide evidence that selective perception
   compromised elites' ability to anticipate voters' reactions. The
   findings demonstrate that it cannot be assumed that parties in office
   will prioritise vote-seeking goals above policy-seeking goals.},

Abstract = {The European Union has historically sought to project outwards its
   identity, values and raison d'etre during times of uncertainty and
   crisis. One of the core values stated to be at the heart of the European
   Union's identity is gender equality. Yet, while gender equality features
   more visibly in the European Union's external discourse as it seeks to
   position itself as a global leader in equality and human rights, the
   internal challenge posed by crisis presents a real obstacle to future
   developments in this area. This article examines digital diplomacy,
   specifically Twitter presence, as a discursive site for constituting
   meaning. We thus take the digital space afforded by Twitter as a site
   where the European Union's internal and external identity is constructed
   in a process of articulation and contestation. Digital diplomacy is now
   a salient part of public diplomacy, increasingly prioritised over
   `traditional' approaches. Using data gathered from Twitter on the
   European Union's 60th anniversary and International Women's Day in 2017,
   this article provides the first in-depth study of the European Union's
   approach to digital diplomacy. We find the marginalisation of gender
   issues from the European Union's core narratives bringing into question
   the place of gender equality as a core value of the European Union.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a new interpretation of the realist claim that
   politics is autonomous from morality and involves specific political
   values. First, this article defends an original normative source:
   functional normativity. Second, it advocates a substantive functional
   standard: political institutions ought to be assessed by their capacity
   to select and implement collective decisions. Drawing from the
   `etiological account' in philosophy of biology, I will argue that
   functions yield normative standards, which are independent from
   morality. For example, a `good heart' is one that pumps blood well, and
   a good army is one that it is effective at exerting military force. I
   then interpret realism's naturalistic conception of politics as an
   etiological function of social groups: namely making binding collective
   decisions under persistent disagreement. I conclude that political
   institutions should be evaluated realistically by how well they perform
   this task. Finally, I assess trade-offs between this functional
   political normativity and other moral values. I conclude that justice,
   fairness, freedom and equality remain obviously important concerns, but
   only once the basic political function is secured.},

Abstract = {Existing studies of welfare regime generally consider that Christian
   democratic countries would face severe challenges in the transition to
   service economy due to its conservative cling to social insurance,
   breadwinner-oriented employment, and familialism. In this article, I
   explain how Christian democratic countries overcame these challenges by
   focusing on the concept of policy responsiveness. I argue that Christian
   democratic parties could shift from labor shedding to
   employment-friendly policies in transition by implementing a series of
   policies targeting the preference of unemployed workers. The historical
   root as the cross-class coalition party makes it politically feasible
   and less costly for Christian democratic parties to focus on unemployed
   workers' interests at the possible expense of labor market insider's
   interests. To substantiate my argument, I investigate the policy
   trajectory in the Netherlands, a country that achieved the most
   prominent employment expansion in Christian Democratic regime.},

Abstract = {Why are women less likely to engage with politics as compared to men? I
   explore whether women avoid politics because of their lower levels of
   tolerance for conflict and disagreement. Men are more likely to say they
   enjoy a lively political argument, while women are more conflict
   avoidant. These differences in people's orientations toward conflict are
   thought to contribute to gender gaps in political interest and
   engagement. I explore this using survey responses to a module of the
   2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. I find that people's
   positive reactions to conflict better explain the decision to engage in
   politics than negative reactions to disagreements. While women report
   higher levels of conflict avoidance than men, gender gaps in political
   engagement cannot be explained by women's greater aversion to conflict.
   Instead, gender gaps are better understood as a product of men's
   comparatively higher levels of enjoyment of arguments and disagreements.},

Title = {Principals or puppets? Analysing variation in local political parties'
   social policy positions},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {456-476},

Abstract = {The decentralisation of policy responsibilities from the national to the
   local level in the domain of social policies is meant to facilitate a
   better fit to local conditions, and, consequently, inspire local
   variation in social policy positions. This article examines two
   questions: (1) to what extent do Dutch local party branches' social
   policy positions deviate from their national mother party and local peer
   parties and (2) do local conditions explain this deviation? To answer
   these questions, we developed a dataset including 168 local party
   manifestos from 27 strategically selected municipalities and 8 national
   party manifestos. Our analyses show limited deviation in local parties'
   positions compared to their national mother party and other local
   branches of their national mother party. This suggests that the social
   policies addressed in the party manifestos of local parties seem to
   reflect a process of institutional isomorphism. Furthermore, the limited
   deviation that does exist in local parties' social policy positions is
   not convincingly larger in municipalities (1) that are smaller, (2) that
   have higher social benefit dependency, or (3) that have high vote shares
   for local independent challengers. This is contrary to what can be
   expected based on the contingency theory.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on inequality and political representation argues
   that economic elites are dominating democratic policy-making, yet it
   struggles to explain the underlying mechanisms. This article proposes
   that unequal responsiveness reflects asymmetries in information about
   fiscal policy across income classes, as opposed to being a structural
   bias inherent in capitalist democracy. I test the argument in a pathway
   case study of economic policy-making in Denmark, using a new data set
   that combines preference and spending data spanning 18 spending domains
   between 1985 and 2017. I find that governments that pursue standard
   macroeconomic policies coincidentally respond more strongly to the
   preferences of the affluent, owing to a closer adjustment of preferences
   to the state of the economy among citizens in upper income groups. These
   findings have important democratic and theoretical implications, as they
   suggest that unequal responsiveness may not reflect substantive
   misrepresentation of majority interests, but rather differences in
   information levels across groups.},

Abstract = {Beginning with Karl Marx, theorists have seen individual autonomy and
   ideology as opposing elements. Ideology was considered the product of
   mental, cultural or social constraints. People did not choose their
   world view - they fell victim to it. With the increase of individual
   autonomy, however, ideology would wither away. In the late 20th century,
   the advocates of individualization theory have similarly predicted the
   vanishing of clear-cut ideological divisions in a world in which any
   form of collective identity was difficult to sustain. Political
   eclecticism and the mixing of different political world views would
   become the new norm. Politics was now `beyond left and right', as
   Anthony Giddens once famously argued. In my article, I show that this
   understanding of the relationship between individualization and
   ideological polarization is flawed. By discussing the extreme
   ideological polarization in the U.S., I disprove the notion that our
   need for ideology vanishes the more our freedoms expand. On the
   contrary, precisely the increase in individual autonomy - in terms of
   mobility patterns, media use and lifestyle differentiation - has helped
   to turn the country into a series of closed echo chambers and to deepen
   the ideological fault lines of American society.},

Abstract = {Representative democracies are supposed to be uniquely virtuous in that
   they ensure that public preferences drive public policy. Dynamic
   representation is the outcome of a recurring interaction between
   electorate and parties that can be observed at the macro level.
   Preferences can shape government policy via two possible mechanisms.
   `Policy accomodation' suggests that governments respond directly to the
   electorate's preferences. `Electoral turnover', on the other hand,
   assumes that preferences shape policy indirectly. Parties pursue their
   ideological goals, and public preferences respond `thermostatically' by
   moving in the opposite direction to policy. This causes voters to switch
   votes and eventually leads to a turnover of power from one `side' to
   `the other'. In this paper, we estimate preferences for government
   activity ('the policy mood') in Spain between 1978 and 2017. We show
   that mood responds `thermostatically' to policy. Variations in mood are
   associated with support for parties. Policy is driven by party control
   but is not thermostatically responsive to mood. It appears that in Spain
   - like Britain - dynamic representation can only be achieved by
   electoral turnover. We consider the implications of this for our
   understanding of how representation works.},

Abstract = {From the emergence of punctuated equilibrium theory in the United States
   in the mid-1990s to the creation of the Comparative Agendas Project,
   scholars have predicted that punctuated equilibrium theory and related
   agenda-setting theories can be applied across all systems. Yet most of
   the literature to date has focused on Western countries. The Brazilian
   Agendas Project has now made data available on a wide range of policy
   inputs and outputs, the first such data available in Latin America. The
   objective of this article is introduce the data from the Brazilian
   project, justify the choices made in collecting and coding it, and
   present descriptive analyses on the dynamics of governmental attention
   toward different policy issues over time.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {556-570},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel framework for understanding the
   relationship between implicit and explicit preferences and political
   cognition. Existing work in political psychology focuses primarily on
   comparing the main effects of implicit versus explicit attitude
   measures. This paper rethinks the role of implicit cognition by
   acknowledging the correspondence between implicit and explicit
   preferences (i.e., the distance between implicitly and explicitly
   measured attitudes). Data from the 2008 American National Election Study
   are used to examine implicit racial ambivalence, or the gap between
   one's implicit and explicit racial preferences, as it exists in the
   United States. Results indicate implicit racial ambivalence, which has
   been shown to yield effortful thinking related to race, is negatively
   related to education and Need for Cognition, and predicts race-related
   policy attitudes as well as vote choice in the 2008 election.
   Furthermore, implicit ambivalence moderates the influence of ideology on
   political attitudes, including attitudes toward outcomes that are only
   covertly related to race and cannot be predicted directly by implicit or

Abstract = {Under what conditions does state expansion into limited statehood areas
   improve perceptions of state authority? Although previous work
   emphasizes identity or institutional sources of state legitimacy, I
   argue that relationships between state agents and citizens drive
   positive attitude formation, because these relationships provide
   information and facilitate social bonds. Moreover, when state agents and
   citizens share demographic characteristics, perceptional effects may
   improve. Finally, citizens finding procedural interactions between state
   agents and citizens unfair may adopt negative views about the state. I
   test these three propositions by randomizing household visits by male or
   female police officers in rural Liberia. These visits facilitated
   relationship building, leading to improved perceptions of police; shared
   demographic characteristics between police and citizens did not
   strengthen this effect. Perceptions of unfairness in the randomization
   led to negative opinions about police. The results imply that
   relationship building between state agents and citizens is an important
   part of state building.},

Abstract = {Principality and republic are two regimes and politic forms of necessity
   and liberty upstanding in the Machiavellian corpus. The equality, the
   present article addresses, perform a third -and fundamental-
   philosophic-political center, of important presence in Discourses and in
   Florentine Histories: 1) Machiavelli aims to a republic whose ordine is
   an ``admirable equality{''} that perfect, id est, that enable their
   permanence and the full validity of liberty, since the inequality is the
   origin of the states' corruption; 2) the modo to achieve, is such that
   will need the ruin of noblemen and rich through their ``extinguish{''};
   3) due to the fact that ``if it wants to lead to the equality, it is
   necessary to use too many extraordinary measures, that very few know or
   want to use{''}, it is required that those few (a prince or dictator of
   the people, or the best craftsmen) know that it is achieved with
   ``absolute power, called tyranny{''}. In sum, the article proposes that
   exists in the Machiavelli's imaginary, the horizon of an optimum stato
   of civil perfection, freedom and full equality, and there the equality
   provides a feature of the Republic so fundamental, but so perilous to
   achieve, as the vivere libero is.},

Abstract = {On 26 May 2019, European, federal and regional elections in Belgium were
   held. The main electoral results showed the decline of ruling parties
   (N-VA, MR, Open VLD, CD\&V) and the rise of radical parties on the right
   (Vlaams Belang) and left (PVDA-PTB). These results have opened a period
   of deep government instability with very long negotiations to form
   coalitions at the regional level, and even more so at the federal level.
   It eventually took the COVID-19 crisis outbreak for a new government to
   be formed. However, the new minority government obtained external
   support from six parties for a period of six months only. Over the last
   decade, forming a coalition has proven itself to be more and more
   difficult in Belgium. The rise of extreme parties and the decline of
   mainstream parties are making it even harder. If the trend holds, one
   might have to question the future capacity of Belgium to form
   sustainable coalitions.},

Abstract = {This study applies a multi-venue approach to assess whether business
   groups are more likely to realize their policy preferences than citizen
   groups. Conceptually, it measures the advocacy success of interest
   groups that are involved in the various institutional venues visited
   during entire policy-making processes (i.e., executive, legislative,
   judicial and direct democracy). Empirically, it compares interest group
   advocacy across three different policy issues (i.e., railway
   infrastructure, stem cell research and promotion of renewable energy) in
   both pluralist California and neo-corporatist Switzerland. The findings
   show that, when controlling for the political system, policy issues and
   advocacy strategies (i.e., single- or multi-venue), business groups
   display higher levels of advocacy success than citizen groups.},

Abstract = {The very title of the article suggests a journey back in not only time
   but politico-socio-cultural situation as well. The `Text' taken for
   consideration is a piece of colonial literature in terms of the period
   of its creation; the ideas within it, however, can be seen from a
   `postcolonial' perspective, in a period which is again `post-colonial'.
   The author Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay continuously juxtaposes the
   `colonialist' and the `colonized' in a series of metaphors, comparing
   one with the other. In the context, at one level creates a critique of
   colonialism; at a deeper level he shows how the processes of colonialism
   have been appropriated by the `colonized' through both acceptance of,
   and, resistance to colonialism. Subversion of the `superior' by the
   `inferior' is a recurrent theme. Finally, his project was cultural
   regeneration of a colonized society-his own-by imbibing the best
   elements of both the Orient and the Occident.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the impact of electoral participation on
   electoral dynamics in Quebec. We propose a parsimonious model that
   considers the linguistic composition of districts and the effective
   electoral support for parties to explain electoral politics. In modeling
   these dynamics, we introduce three new concepts, namely leverage effect,
   push effect, and differentiation effect. Our findings show that the 2018
   election represents an extension of dynamics established in 2012 and
   played a corrective role to those of the 2014 election. They also
   demonstrate that leverage effects are not effective mechanisms for
   ensuring electoral success.},

Abstract = {This article's guiding thesis is that the theory of radical democratic
   citizenship is built on a tension between a radical, conflictual element
   and a democratic element. As radical democrats, these philosophers point
   to the intimate relation between conflict and both emancipation and
   democracy. But as radical democrats, they also propose different methods
   that prevent conflict from breaking up the polis-the common ground that
   makes democratic conflict possible. I look at two radical democrats' way
   of dealing with this tension: Chantal Mouffe and etienne Balibar. My
   claim is that the former ends up overemphasising the danger of division
   in her later democratic works and is therefore unable to account for
   more intense forms of democratic resistance (such as riots). In the work
   of Balibar, however, we find a way of dealing with this tension.},

Abstract = {States always trade across and explore opportunities for relevant
   information on reforms capable of responding to progressive demands of
   domestic growth and national development. Presently, the traditional
   development landscape has expanded to include new actors not only
   devising new development models but also providing a variegated supply
   of developmental know-how in support of global prosperity - one of the
   most visible case studies being China's South-South-based cooperation
   with Africa via the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). In their
   development cooperation, FOCAC-based initiatives posture to bridge
   inequality and disparity between both sides often through the transfer
   of knowledge. Regarding this, the Forum employs knowledge sharing as a
   combination of capacity development initiatives in the form of training
   and educational, technical, human capacity-building and human resource
   development, including technology cooperation. However, citing marginal
   impact on industrialization processes of African countries, sceptics
   maintain that FOCAC's trail in the so-called `second continent'
   translates as a systematic imposition of a Beijing-centric paradigm of
   globalization. Notwithstanding, given the promise of cross-cultural
   cooperation in knowledge production, rather than succumb to monocausal
   critiques on sub-optimal development assistance, this article evaluates
   the prospects of Nigeria capitalizing on China's stock of development
   know-how more strategically.},

Abstract = {Recent events have led to a renewed conversation surrounding the
   relevance and potential removal of Confederate monuments around the
   country, and several monuments have already been removed. However, we
   have little insight to explain why some monuments have been removed
   while others remain. This article seeks to understand the social and
   political determinants that can better explain the recent removal of
   Confederate monuments throughout the United States. Analyzing results
   from an original dataset of Confederate monuments, we identify which
   local government structures and racial and civic characteristics best
   predict the removal of these monuments. Ultimately, although we find
   that other factors contribute to monument removal, the size of the black
   population, the presence of a National Association for the Advancement
   of Colored People chapter, and the percentage of Democrats in a county
   in which a monument exists-as well as whether the monument exists in a
   state that constrains removal by legislative decree-best predict whether
   a Confederate monument will be taken down. This project elucidates the
   interplay of race, partisanship, and local and statewide politics as it
   relates to the dismantling of Confederate monuments.},

Abstract = {In Italy, for some years, a series of new terms, such as `Civil
   Welfare', `Community Welfare', `Welfare Society', `Generative Welfare',
   and `Second Welfare{''}, have appeared in public discourse. These labels
   have different origins and traditions. However, all of them are reform
   narratives promoting `new' welfare-mix solutions to ensure the
   sustainability of the social protection system in the face of the
   permanent austerity (Pierson 1998, 2001) and the crisis of the public
   welfare. Moreover, all of them are presented as recalibration strategies
   betting on coordination, integration, networking, and synergy's
   capabilities of formal and informal components of the welfare system,
   reinforcing the role, not of the state, but of the other points of the
   so-called `welfare diamond' (Ferrera, 2006): individuals and families,
   third sector, but also companies and market. The contribution aims to
   critically present the different narratives, highlighting their
   similarities and differences, and-above all-to discuss their
   implications. For this purpose, the promises to provide sustainable,
   flexible, and plural welfare solutions (Osborne, 2006), as well as the
   presumed advantages and the risks of what appears to be a strategy of
   delegation to the private sector, will be subject of careful evaluation.},

Abstract = {Civil conflicts are complex: multiple warring parties compete for
   control of territory both against each other and the government. These
   processes are often dynamic, changing over time and space. In this
   study, we embrace these complexities through a network-based approach.
   By considering important relational patterns, such as reciprocity and
   transitivity, and tying them together with existing theoretical
   developments in the conflict processes literature, we answer the
   question of ``who fights whom and when{''} during civil conflict.
   Furthermore, by using the case of Nigeria, we offer novel theoretical
   insights about how the entrance of a new, aggressive actor can
   decisively alter the trajectory of conflict. In addition, we show that
   our approach is better at predicting ``who fights whom and when{''} in
   an out-of-sample context than extant approaches.},

Title = {Past Place, Present Prejudice: The Impact of Adolescent Racial Context
   on White Racial Attitudes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Extensive research on racial contexts suggests that white Americans
   living near black Americans adopt more negative racial attitudes.
   Theoretically, local intergroup exposure has been conceptualized as
   acting contemporaneously through various mechanisms. However, a separate
   body of research on political socialization indicates that adolescent
   experiences are often especially influential. We hypothesize that
   whites' racial contexts during adolescence produce prejudiced responses.
   We then test this hypothesis using two complementary data sets, a
   population-based panel conducted 2007-13 and the Youth-Parent
   Socialization Panel Survey (1965-97). Our analyses demonstrate the
   enduring influence of adolescent contexts at larger levels of
   aggregation: while the racial composition of whites' current counties is
   not a consistent predictor of racial prejudice, the racial composition
   of their county during high school is. Proximity during one's formative
   years increases racial prejudice years later, providing new insights
   about local contextual effects and the roots of racial prejudice.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In comparative studies, causal evaluations attempt to improve our
   understanding of the effectiveness of structural reforms by
   counterfactually inspecting post-treatment effects. Yet, even if
   comparative scholars find similar treatment and comparison units, the
   interpretation of the post-treatment trajectory is difficult as
   short-term estimates can be subject to strategic timing of reform
   implementation, while long-term effects are likely affected by further
   interventions. To illustrate these difficulties we apply the generalized
   synthetic control method to evaluate the introduction of a British
   national minimum wage. We find a short-term decreasing effect on youth
   unemployment that turns into an increasing effect over time. This
   suggests the presence of an upward biased selection effect from
   strategic timing. We also inspect two post-treatment interventions and
   find that they differ in their general and country-specific implications
   for the long-term trajectory.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, German parties at the regional level have started
   to hold party primaries (infrequently) to select their leaders. In
   recent years, research on primaries has attracted the attention of
   political science scholars, but surprisingly, the German case has been
   left out of international comparative studies. Hence, I tested four
   hypotheses on possible consequences regarding membership numbers,
   intra-party competition, and characteristics of party leaders. My
   findings indicate that primaries attract more candidates than
   conventions, but there are no differences in the closeness of the race.
   Party leaders selected by rank-and-file members are less politically
   experienced than those selected by delegates. The probability that the
   most experienced candidate wins a competitive leadership race is much
   lower in primaries. In contrast to previous studies, I find no signs
   that women are disadvantaged in primaries. However, I find support for
   the glass cliff phenomenon: in both delegate conferences and primaries,
   female leaders are selected in weaker party branches.},

Title = {Ideological or Pragmatic? A Data-Driven Analysis of the Russian
   Presidential Grant Fund},
Journal = {RUSSIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-51},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Research on Russian civil society focuses largely on the repressive
   legislative side of state policies, to the virtual exclusion of the rise
   of domestic funding, be it individual, corporate, or public. This
   article instead contributes to the discussion of state funding for the
   third sector by looking at the Russian Presidential Grant Fund, a state
   institution that has disbursed RUB18 billion (approx. \$275 million at
   the August 11, 2019, exchange rate) to the third sector since 2016,
   making it one of the most influential sources of financial support to
   Russian civil society. A data-driven analysis of the Fund reveals that,
   although it prioritizes certain types of non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) over others, there is a discernible attempt to address some of
   the most pressing social ills in Russia today. Whereas some grant
   directions, such as the ``preservation of historical memory{''} and
   ``development of public diplomacy and support of compatriots,{''}
   further long-held, Kremlin-sponsored ideological projects, the biggest
   categories supported by the Fund focus on more classical philanthropic
   issues, confirming the state's growing delegation of the provision of
   public services to the third sector.},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {How do legislative term limits affect representation? Proponents'
   arguments that term limits would reduce partisan conflict and improve
   the quality of representation have received surprisingly little
   empirical scrutiny. We argue that term limits increase party
   polarization by changing legislators' electoral and career incentives,
   in turn increasing the role of parties in legislative processes. Using
   panel data on roll call voting patterns from 1993 to 2016, we show that
   term limits produced systematically higher levels of polarization in
   state legislative voting patterns by increasing the ideological gap
   between Republicans' and Democrats' voting records. Consistent with our
   theoretical account, we further show that term limits had larger effects
   in more professional legislatures and increased contributions from party
   committees to legislative candidates. Contrary to the goals of their
   proponents, terms limits exacerbated the legislative consequences of
   contemporary partisanship and have implications for understanding how
   electoral and career incentives affect legislative outcomes.},

Abstract = {We present an intra-party account of electoral reform, contrasting the
   incentives of legislators (MPs) with those of party leaders. We develop
   our argument along the switch to proportional representation (PR) in
   early 20th century Europe. District-level electoral alliances allowed
   bourgeois MPs to counter the ``socialist threat{''} under the electoral
   systems in place. PR was thus unnecessary from the seat-maximizing
   perspective that dominates previous accounts-intra-party considerations
   were crucial: candidate nomination and legislative cohesion. We show our
   argument to hold empirically both for the prototypical case of Germany,
   1890-1920, using encompassing district-level data on candidatures,
   elections, electoral alliances, roll call votes and a series of
   simulations on reform effects; and for the implementation of electoral
   reforms in 29 countries, 1900-31.},

Abstract = {The ambition of this article is threefold. First, it is to offer a
   realist reading of Aristotle's regime theory as it is laid out mostly in
   Books IV-VI of his Politics. The author argues that Aristotle's regime
   theory has three fundamentally realist claims about the workings of
   politics: first, the search for a perfect regime is not the only
   legitimate subject of political theory; second, every regime is built on
   a delicate balance of a particular understanding of political justice, a
   variety of sociological factors and the institutional design and
   political virtues of its politicians; third, there are almost as many
   different regimes as polities, and although they can be grouped into
   major regime types, there are many sub-types and mixed and transitory
   regimes. Second, the article argues that modern democratic theories have
   an unacceptable `moralistic bias' from a realist point of view. Third,
   that a neo-Aristotelian regime theory can offer an attractive realist
   alternative to the predominant contemporary understandings of political
   regimes.},

Abstract = {The article joins the current debate between epistemic and procedural
   democrats in contemporary democratic theory and aims to put epistemic
   democracy on a more secure footing. Yet, unlike those who explore the
   question from the bottom-up by analyzing the relationship between
   ``truth{''} and the ``fact of disagreement{''} within the context of
   domestic political discourse, I adopt a top-down approach animated by
   political realism and situate democracy within the actual world that we
   live in: a competitive ecology of states and regimes. The article thus
   has two purposes. For those who are interested in the recent revival of
   realism in political theory, it shows how it can be combined with both
   the epistemic paradigm in democratic theory and the realist research
   program in international relations, including the neo-positivist strand
   that has dominated the field over the past four decades. And for those
   who see themselves as epistemic democrats, it provides a powerful
   realist argument to defend their conception of democratic authority
   against criticisms made by procedural democrats.},

Abstract = {This article discusses new technologies in regard to their potential to
   capture workers' situated knowledge. Machines are said to substitute but
   also to contribute to the labour process in collaboration with human
   skill sets. `Industry 4.0' became the policy-wide shorthand to describe
   the new quality of real-time interconnectedness and feedback loops,
   known as cyber-physical systems within industry and engineering
   sciences. Data flows generated in these systems are used to continuously
   improve work processes by extracting information down to the very
   micro-level of neuroergonomics. In this process, workers' interactions
   with the system are extracted, fed back and processed for future use and
   improvement. The article argues that in addition to the potential for
   extraction of new (bodily) knowledge, shifting skill use and the
   potential for new forms of control, new technologies contain the
   potential to extract situated knowledge owned by the worker and crucial
   for resistance and collective struggles.},

Abstract = {Although a long literature has analyzed how policies diffuse or spread
   across the American states, scant attention has been given to how states
   invent or create original policy instead of borrowing existing policy
   from one another. In this article, I use state legislative policymaking
   with respect to renewable portfolio standards to examine when
   legislatures invent original policy instead of borrowing existing
   policy. I use a novel data set that includes the state adoption of
   hundreds of policy provisions, including their combinations, and I
   employ logistic pooled event history analysis to identify the
   determinants of inventing and borrowing. I find that government ideology
   largely predicts inventing, whereas electoral vulnerability predicts
   borrowing. The results suggest that ideologues spearhead invention and
   further suggest that democratic accountability works chiefly through
   promoting borrowing rather than blunting inventing.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democracy entails a commitment to deciding political
   questions on their merits. To that end, people engage in an exchange of
   reasons in a shared endeavour to arrive at the right answer or the best
   judgement they can make in the circumstances. Of course, in practice a
   shared judgement may be impossible to reach. Yet while compromise may
   seem a natural way of dealing with the disagreement that deliberation
   leaves unresolved - for example, some deliberative theorists argue that
   a willingness to compromise manifests respect for the considered views
   of others, even as we continue to disagree with them - the relationship
   between deliberation and compromise is not as straightforward as one
   might think. To explain why, this paper contrasts conflicts of judgement
   with conflicts of preference, interest and value to show why greater
   attention needs to be paid to the character of the decision to be made.},

Abstract = {This article uses McAlevey's mobilising/organising dichotomy to analyse
   the recent McDonald's mobilisation in Britain. It argues that this
   movement has had some impressive successes but building on these
   requires greater organising activities. However, conventional union
   organising techniques are unlikely to be successful in hospitality.
   Instead, the approach of another low-wage worker movement OUR Walmart
   demonstrates how social media can be used not only to benefit mobilising
   activities but to enable organising beyond the workplace.},

   Information Elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cues and heuristics-like party, gender, and race/ethnicity-help voters
   choose among a set of candidates. We consider candidate professional
   experience-signaled through occupation-as a cue that voters can use to
   evaluate candidates' functional competence for office. We outline and
   test one condition under which citizens are most likely to use such
   cues: when there is a clear connection between candidate qualifications
   and the particular elected office. We further argue that voters in these
   contexts are likely to make subtle distinctions between candidates, and
   to vote accordingly. We test our account in the context of local school
   board elections, and show-through both observational analyses of
   California election results and a conjoint experiment-that (1) voters
   favor candidates who work in education; (2) that voters discriminate
   even among candidates associated with education by only favoring those
   with strong ties to students; and (3) that the effects are not muted by
   partisanship. Voters appear to value functional competence for office in
   and of itself, and use cues in the form of candidate occupation to
   assess who is and who is not fit for the job.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the mutually empowering relations between Turkish
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his followers, and how Erdogan's
   charismatic leadership and image functioned to galvanize his followers
   on the night of July 15, 2016, when large numbers of them mobilized
   against the attempted coup. The article has three sections. The first is
   a theoretical discussion which sheds light on the concept and the
   underlying mechanisms of political empowerment and its effects on the
   relationships between leaders and followers. The second section
   evaluates Erdogan's characteristics and ruling style, which was
   instrumental in motivating resistance to the abortive coup. Finally, the
   third section analyzes the various means by which Erdogan was able to
   inspire the masses to mobilize against the armed junta through
   interviews and observations.},

Abstract = {In many post-communist countries, the concept of patriotism is used
   instrumentally in populist discourses. It is rarely the subject of a
   substantive public debate, in which symbolic elites would be able to
   openly discuss and negotiate the scope of its meaning in front of an
   interested audience. A long-term plan to shape constructive civil
   attitudes gives way to the pressure of being effective in current
   politics. The author proposes to look at the category of patriotism in a
   socially useful way and to treat it as an important factor in the
   process of building a civil society. The young generation can play a
   significant role in this process. Poland seems to be an interesting case
   for the analysis of this research problem. This paper has two
   objectives. The descriptive objective is to present the author's
   research data on a sense and understanding of patriotism among Polish
   students. Its aim is to describe the prevailing pattern of patriotic
   attitudes and ideas about patriotism as shared by students. The
   explanatory objective of this paper is to answer the question about the
   constructive potential of patriotism: whether and to what extent it is
   an important determinant of civic activity. The results obtained should
   lead to practical conclusions that may be useful for various social
   institutions which are interested in releasing the positive energy of
   citizens and orienting them to functional goals, that is, the education
   system, as well as for political institutions that design and implement
   elements of the so-called youth policy.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the need to motivate bureaucrats to invest
   in high-quality policy implementation alters the appeal of executive
   unilateralism. If executive orders are less durable than legislation,
   then the bureaucracy will have weaker incentives to invest in policy
   making. This affects presidents' willingness to compromise and work with
   Congress to pass legislation, rather than pursue unilateral action.
   Unilateralism becomes less attractive as bureaucratic capacity increases
   and as the relative durability of executive orders decreases. I
   formalize this logic in a simple formal model and discuss fruitful
   extensions for future work.},

Abstract = {Control of executive power is a central accountability concern. This
   article focuses on ways for parliament and MPs to assist the voter in
   this important task. Parliamentary systems empower parliaments by a
   range of control institutions, but the role of political parties
   challenges MPs incentives to engage in control of government. This
   article focuses on Fire Alarm control activity, but argues that Fire
   Alarms call for MP Firefighting. In parliament, MPs have the opportunity
   to respond to reports from decentral control institutions about
   government mal-administration. Building on models of rational
   politicians, this paper investigates when MPs in fact engage in
   Firefighting related to Fire Alarm cases from the Ombudsman and audit
   institution. The article argues that MPs engage in Firefighting when it
   serves partisan purposes. The paper relies on a medium-N dataset of
   reports from the Faroese Ombudsman and Audit General (52 cases) and
   applies a mixed-method research design. The results show that the
   partisan logic dominates MP Firefighting. Opposition MPs use government
   mistakes to damage government reputation. However, the paper argues of
   the possibility of a more parliamentarian outcome, since focus on Fire
   Alarm cases puts pressure on government to make amends.},

Title = {The Historical Presidency Unilateral Politics in the Traditional

Abstract = {There are two significant omissions in the literature on presidential
   unilateralism. First, few scholars have examined whether their theories
   apply to directives other than executive orders. Second, scholars have
   primarily focused on unilateral usage in the modern era at the expense
   of the traditional era. This article addresses these omissions by
   testing one theory, Howell's Unilateral Politics Model, on the usage of
   more than 1,300 significant executive orders and proclamations from 1861
   to 1944. The results show that presidents in the traditional era issued
   more executive orders during a partisan administration change and that
   this effect continued into the modern era. Traditional presidents also
   issued more proclamations when Congress was stronger, which is counter
   to what Howell expected in his theory. Ultimately, these results show
   that the traditional-modern presidency dichotomy applies for
   proclamations but not for executive orders. The modern patterns of
   executive order usage are a continuation of the patterns that began in
   the traditional era. However, a noticeable shift in behavior occurred
   between eras with respect to presidential proclamations, probably as a
   result of this type of directive evolving from an administrative tool to
   a more unilateral order.},

Title = {Different worlds of contention? Protest in Northwestern, Southern and
   Eastern Europe},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Despite the voluminous literature on the `normalisation of protest', the
   protest arena is seen as a bastion of left-wing mobilisation. While
   citizens on the left readily turn to the streets, citizens on the right
   only settle for it as a `second best option'. However, most studies are
   based on aggregated cross-national comparisons or only include
   Northwestern Europe. We contend the aggregate-level perspective hides
   different dynamics of protest across Europe. Based on individual-level
   data from the European Social Survey (2002-2016), we investigate the
   relationship between ideology and protest as a key component of the
   normalisation of protest. Using hierarchical logistic regression models,
   we show that while protest is becoming more common, citizens with
   different ideological views are not equal in their protest participation
   across the three European regions. Instead of a general left
   predominance, we find that in Eastern European countries, right-wing
   citizens are more likely to protest than those on the left. In
   Northwestern and Southern European countries, we find the reverse
   relationship, left-wing citizens are more likely to protest than their
   right-wing counterparts. Lessons drawn from the protest experience in
   Northwestern Europe characterised by historical mobilisation by the New
   Left are of limited use for explaining the ideological composition of
   protest in the Southern and Eastern European countries. We identify
   historical and contemporary regime access as the mechanism underlying
   regional patterns: citizens with ideological views that were
   historically in opposition are more likely to protest. In terms of
   contemporary regime access, we find that partisanship enhances the
   effect of ideology, while ideological distance from the government has a
   different effect in the three regions. As protest gains in importance as
   a form of participation, the paper contributes to our understanding of
   regional divergence in the extent to which citizens with varying
   ideological views use this tool.},

Abstract = {Since at least the 1980s, scholars have highlighted parties' reliance on
   external actors, with Panebianco's `electoral-professional' party model
   spotlighting the increasing role of professionals in supporting party
   activities and campaigns. Over successive decades, our understanding of
   the role of external actors, and particularly consultants, has grown. As
   parties have begun to embrace digital tools and technologies, however,
   it has become apparent that our understanding of party organization does
   not reflect the array of actors who support party activities. In this
   article, we draw on extensive interview data from Australia and the
   United Kingdom to offer a new conceptual framework - that we call the
   `party-centred digital ecosystem' - to highlight the functions that
   different types of external actor provide for parties. Introducing the
   classification of CLANS to describe these different actors, we discuss
   the significance of this trend, highlighting the potential for
   increasingly porous organizational boundaries as parties call on
   different types of external actor for support.},

Title = {Is resilience a favourable concept in terrorism research? The

Abstract = {The concept of resilience is frequently found in academic documents
   describing the favoured solution for how to address the threat of
   terrorism. Despite this, few attempts have been made to critically
   examine what resilience means and whether it is a favourable concept in
   terrorism research. Since multiple researchers in other disciplines have
   claimed that the resilience concept serves as an umbrella concept for a
   range of positive attributes, this study investigates the different
   discourses that resilience in the academic terrorism literature is built
   upon. The analysis outlines five different discourses in the academic
   literature that contain different descriptions of what it means to be
   resilient regarding terrorism. It is concluded that the meaning of
   terrorism resilience in the academic literature is multifaceted,
   ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. The positive connotation embedded
   in the concept of resilience and the absence of a description of what it
   means not to be resilient is problematic because it turns resilience
   into a utopian goal rather than a realistic counterterrorism project.
   Moreover, resilience normalises the view of terrorism as a ubiquitous
   omnipresent threat and legitimises counterterrorism measures as a
   positive, depoliticised necessity. Resilience is serving ideological
   purposes, and thus researchers should not uncritically accept resilience
   as the solution to the threat of terrorism.},

Abstract = {The use of referendums to forge, ratify and enact peace agreements is on
   the rise. In growing numbers, peacemakers have organized referendums in
   order to aid peace talks and ameliorate post-settlement peacebuilding.
   Despite this increasingly common practice, there is little consensus on
   whether referendums help or hurt peace. Such votes can be uniquely
   powerful tools for addressing sovereignty incompatibilities driving
   armed conflict. However, dangerous outcomes include mass violence,
   intensified polarization, and the undermining peace agreement
   implementation. Based on 31 case studies and elite interviews conducted
   in Colombia, Cyprus, East Timor, Indonesia, and South Sudan, this
   article elaborates an analytical framework for the uses of referendums
   in peace processes and identifies specific benefits and risks associated
   with differing types. I argue that referendums can improve peacemaking
   and conditions for implementing negotiated settlements when they are
   well-designed and well-implemented.},

Abstract = {Which combinations of government structures and electoral systems create
   better frameworks for addressing ethnic violence? Is there any
   one-size-fits-all institutional solution to violent ethnic conflict? Why
   or why not? These questions are of substantial importance to scholars
   and policymakers alike, but the extant literature does not provide a
   systematic and thorough exploration. In this article, we argue that the
   effects of political institutions on ethnic violence are moderated by
   parameters of ethnic configurations. Through a large comparative study,
   we find that institutions are relevant when ethnic groups are not
   geographically dispersed, and whether ethnic minorities face a majority
   group also matters. For concentrated minorities facing a majority,
   semi-presidential-proportional and presidential-proportional systems are
   more effective in reducing violence. In cases involving concentrated
   minorities facing no majority, parliamentary-non-proportional systems
   are associated with the most intense violence. We conclude that states
   seeking to alleviate ethnic violence by institutional engineering must
   take contexts seriously.},

   because `the middle' has been `squeezed' over recent decades, Iversen
   and Soskice (2019) in their book, Democracy and Prosperity, present an
   optimistic account about the future of democracy. This paper examines
   their key assumption that the symbiosis between democracy and advanced
   capitalism is underpinned by electorally decisive middle-class voters
   that secure a constant share of economic growth. Using comprehensive
   data on income trends, it is shown that this claim does not stand up to
   scrutiny: median income has often lagged behind the mean in household
   surveys, rather than kept pace with it as Iversen and Soskice claim.
   Strong real income growth has generally not compensated the middle for
   lagging behind. The varying fortunes of the middle in securing its share
   of economic growth have implications for the broader debate about
   inequality and democracy.},

Abstract = {This article examines factors that influence voters' knowledge of their
   representatives, a key element in securing the responsiveness and
   accountability of parliamentarians. We argue that the parliamentary work
   of MPs (Members of Parliament) benefits incumbents through increased
   name recall, and that this relationship is conditional on: the
   incumbents' candidacy; the voters' political competence; and their
   ideological proximity with their representatives. Combining data on
   French MPs' activities with a 2007 CSES post-election survey enables us
   to test our hypotheses, while controlling for confounding factors. The
   empirical analysis demonstrates that some parliamentary activities
   increase the voters' capacity to recall the name of their MPs. The
   latter are therefore incentivised to be responsive to and serve their
   constituents. However, we also find that voters' political competence
   and ideological proximity with their MP alter the relationship between
   parliamentary work and name recall. This may potentially introduce some
   biases in the democratic process of accountability.},

Abstract = {Electoral dynamics are linked to a set of cleavages that divide the
   electorate among groups of voters. These cleavages are theorized to be
   behind the electoral coalitions formed, and their change is supposed to
   trigger electoral realignments. That said, not much is known about the
   ways in which these cleavages change beyond studies analysing big,
   drastic and unusual realignments. Combining a wide array of data
   sources, this paper is able to test, in a cross-sectional and dynamic
   way, the relationship between the cleavages emphasized at the party
   debate and the cleavages associated with voters' behaviour. It proves
   that the links between the two spheres are more complicated than
   sometimes assumed. The finding has important implications for the
   understanding of party competition dynamics and electoral mandates.},

Title = {Are minorities free riders? Applying the social resistance framework to
   public goods production in Central-Eastern Europe},

Abstract = {One of the key reasons for the scholarly and policy concern about the
   rising levels of ethnic diversity is its apparently detrimental effect
   on the production of public goods. Although numerous studies have
   tackled that issue, there is still much ambiguity as to the precise
   micro-level mechanisms underpinning this relationship. In this article,
   a novel theoretical explanation for this relationship is proposed,
   building on the social resistance framework. This proposition is tested
   using a new cross-sectional public opinion survey covering 14,536
   respondents in 817 neighbourhoods across 11 Central Eastern European
   countries. Analysing national minorities defined by postwar border
   changes means one can overcome the endogeneity problem faced by research
   based on immigrant groups. The findings show that it is the combination
   of a minority group's discrimination and its spatial clustering that
   makes minorities reluctant to contribute to public goods. The article
   constitutes a novel theoretical and methodological contribution to the
   research on the effects of diversity on public goods provision.},

Abstract = {Economic recessions have often led to stronger citizen activism. This
   article assesses the relationship between the economy and protest in
   2014, 6 years after the global financial crisis took place, a
   long-enough period for countries to have improved their economic
   situation and for people's interpretations of the economy to be more
   optimistic. Does the economy still matter to explain protest if it is
   not as salient any longer? This research employs data for available
   European Union member states from the 2006, 2008, and 2014 European
   Social Survey to test the importance of national-level objective
   economic indicators as well as individual-level evaluations of financial
   well-being. Findings from the research suggest that objective economic
   predictors are more relevant to understand protest in 2014 than before
   the crisis. Economic resources remain more important for the prediction
   of protest than deprivation views, with the exception of unemployment.
   Even at times of partial economic recovery, the state of the economy
   helps explain increased levels of political protest across Europe well
   after 2008. The link between the economy and confrontational activism
   before and after the economic recession looks in the end very similar
   and a full economic recovery in the future can lead to even more protest
   activism in Europe.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I explore the relationship between organized crime and
   the features of political party systems, particularly countries that
   underwent economic and political transition. The paper argues that
   during periods retreat from authoritarian rule, when the state is
   weakened and when economic hardships occur, there are mutually
   beneficial connections made between organized crime groups and political
   parties - parties need voter support and money, and organized crime
   needs stable partners who can provide access to patronage, and
   protection from ``legal{''} authorities. Further, even after
   ``transition{''} these relationship leave a collaborative legacy. I
   suggest that this relationship will affect features of the party system
   particularly reducing the number of political parties. Using data from
   39 post-communist and Latin American countries from 1985-2017, the
   results indicate that higher the level of organized crime's penetration
   of political parties the fewer political parties, as expected by the
   theory.},

Abstract = {In theory, granting politicians tools to oversee bureaucrats can reduce
   administrative malfeasance. In contrast, I argue that the political
   control of bureaucrats can increase corruption when politicians need
   money to fund election campaigns and face limited institutional
   constraints. In such contexts, politicians can leverage their
   discretionary powers to incentivize bureaucrats to extract rents from
   the state on politicians' behalf. Using data from an original survey of
   bureaucrats (N = 864) across 80 randomly sampled local governments in
   Ghana, I show that bureaucrats are more likely to facilitate
   politicians' corrupt behavior when politicians are perceived to be
   empowered with higher levels of discretionary control. Using qualitative
   data and a list experiment to demonstrate the mechanism, I show that
   politicians enact corruption by threatening to transfer noncompliant
   officers. My findings provide new evidence on the sources of public
   administrative deficiencies in developing countries and qualify the
   presumption that greater political oversight improves governance.},

Abstract = {Despite substantial advances in political participation across Latin
   America, relevant data from the region reveals an important
   cross-national and temporal variation in voter turnout. Unlike existing
   region-specific explanations of voter turnout, but in line with research
   on advanced democracies, we show here that actual electoral mobilization
   in Latin America is linked to the ideological and programmatic shifts
   experienced by political elites since the 1990s. Specifically, we first
   suggest that by setting clear programmatic stances and differentiation
   polarization allows voters to better understand the costs and benefits
   of turning out to vote. When more public policy is at stake, elections
   become more consequential, and thus voters are more likely to turnout.
   Second, polarization facilitates the formation of party brands that
   structure the policy preferences of voters, easing their mobilization to
   the polls. Our results, using elite survey data and electoral turnout
   for eighteen Latin American countries during the 1993-2010 period,
   provide strong statistical support for the elite polarization-turnout
   hypothesis and remain robust to different specifications of the model.
   Substantially, an increase in one standard deviation in elite
   polarization increases turnout - measured as a percentage of registered
   voters - by about 7 percentage points. This effect increases to 9
   percentage points when turnout is measured as a percentage of the voting
   age population.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to the scholarship on negative campaigning,
   revealing the important dynamics of party and media messaging and its
   subsequent effects on issue salience and vote choice. Using a
   large-scale dataset combined with content analysis of media coverage and
   party press releases, we offer an innovative methodology that provides
   evidence showing the effect of a prominent negative campaign
   ({''}Mediscare{''}) launched by the centre-left Australian Labor Party
   during Australia's 2016 federal election. We find political elites can
   influence what voters are paying attention to and, when issue salience
   is high, this can influence vote choice. We find Labor's ``Mediscare{''}
   had two main effects. It significantly raised the issue salience of
   healthcare with voters, and it had an impact on vote choice,
   particularly in marginal electorates. The scare campaign providing a
   reinforcement effect for Labor, arresting declining support for the
   party that was evident prior to the commencement of the negative
   campaign. We conclude that under the circumstances of high public
   awareness, ``issue ownership{''} and compulsory voting, this negative
   campaign was effective in shaping the 2016 electoral outcome.},

Abstract = {Polls report that, contrary to the evidence, one quarter of Americans
   believe that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 elections.
   What explains these types of beliefs? This article tests the predictors
   of public evaluations of electoral integrity in the 2016 American
   Presidential election, as measured by judgements about the fairness of
   the voting processes in the 2016 American National Election Study. We
   demonstrate that conspiratorial beliefs and populist values contribute
   towards citizens' electoral mistrust. The results suggest that the
   paranoid style of American politics is alive and well in contemporary US
   elections.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of educational environments on individual-level
   political participation? There is abundant evidence that education at
   the individual level affects political participation. However, we lack
   studies that systematically link the effect of individual-level
   education to that of the environment. For example, what are the effects
   of being a member of a high vs. low education community? Using a dataset
   composed of a Norwegian citizen survey comprising more than 11,000
   respondents living in 414 municipalities, we relate the effect of
   education at the individual level to that of the educational
   environment. The analyses reveal that the educational gap is smaller in
   high-educated environments and is in fact neutralized in those
   municipalities that have the greatest share of educated citizens. Thus,
   the Norwegian case lends support to the relative educational model; the
   higher the level of education in the environment, the smaller the effect
   of individual-level education. Judging from our study, citizens with few
   resources are not lifted by their environment, but educated citizens
   tend to free-ride in resourceful environments.},

Abstract = {Ethnic conflicts are a challenge to the state as it impacts the foreign
   policy as well as the domestic politics of a nation. The region of North
   Caucasus has been the most unstable region among the Republics of the

   rising tensions among the ethnic groups and the role of Russia in
   solving the problems in the region. It will further explain the
   drawbacks of the Russian authorities and will recommend policies which
   could bring a positive change in the conflict. The use of force would
   not be able to bring any change in the region rather it would be more
   fruitful if efforts are made to address the causes for the ethnic
   violence.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {10-36},
Abstract = {Y Scholarship on the challenges of ethno-linguistic federalism in
   contemporary Ethiopia is copious; yet a critical analysis of violent
   ethnic extremism in the country and its implications for the sub-region
   is rare. This article argues that violent ethnic extremism is a threat
   to the existence of Ethiopia and a destabilising factor for its
   neighbours. Based on qualitative empirical data, it attempts to address
   the knowledge gap and contribute to the literature by examining why
   violent ethnic extremism has persisted in the post-1991 Ethiopia and how
   it would impact on the stability of the Horn of Africa. Analysis of the
   findings indicates that systemic limitations of ethno-linguistic
   federalism; unhealthy ethnic competition; resistance of
   ethno-nationalist elites to the current reform; unemployed youths; the
   ubiquity of small arms and light weapons; and cross-border interactions
   of violent extremists are the major dynamics propelling violent ethnic
   extremism in Ethiopia. Thus, Ethiopia and the sub-region could
   potentially face cataclysmic instabilities unless collective, inclusive,
   transformative and visionary leadership is entrenched.},

Abstract = {Narrative research offers peace an itinerary inspired by respect and
   rigour for the word. In this case, three voices (a university professor,
   a student and a graduate, all linked to the Inter-University Master's
   Degree in Culture of Peace, Conflicts, Education and Human Rights;
   Andalusia, Spain) will feed the article. Not at all, they consider that
   education for peace is the only solution to the conflicts that plague
   the contemporary world; but it is the way. However, by way of
   introduction we point out that education for peace is in the hands of
   people who are sensitive and aware of the need to contribute, from their
   own areas of activity, to a more just society. Next, this research has a
   section for the method, arguing it, giving way to the informants and the
   tool used. As for the results, we would add that they are structured on
   the three voices of the interviewees, who offer a polyphony of contents
   on education for peace, the curriculum or, on the other hand, paying
   attention to the value of dialogue in this educational and cultural
   process. Finally, we have some final considerations that we do not wish
   to conclude but to continue encouraging questions rather than to settle
   this issue of education for peace.},

Abstract = {Policies leading to the internationalization of cities are a
   groundbreaking component of city's management. The sisterhood agreements
   are the most widely used instrument of international decentralized
   cooperation. Guanajuato City has signed a good number of sisterhood
   agreements. Except for one among such agreements, the others are
   inactive. The lone standing and functional sisterhood agreement is based
   on a North-South donation scheme. To provide rationality to the
   internationalization policy it is required to put in place some core
   institutionalization to make this aspiration functional. The European
   examples of cities, sisters of Guanajuato, may shed light on how these
   cities make sisterhood agreements functional and efficient. In the case
   of Guanajuato, we propose the creation of an Interactive Museum of
   Sister Cities as a core component for the internationalization of the
   city, based on dialogue, reciprocity, and mutual learning.},

Abstract = {This study aims at understanding the social imaginary significations
   upon forgiveness and reconciliation in Christian communities in
   Quibdo-Choco. As part of the process for collecting information, 56
   semi-structured interviews were carried out in 6 Christian communities,
   by means of a focus group living nearby the areas where those
   communities are located. The findings of this study evidence that the
   imaginary significations upon forgiveness and reconciliation in these
   Christian communities do not differ from those of other populations.
   Nonetheless, the critical point of this issue, in which these
   communities differ from, focuses on The Colombian Peace Agreement. Some
   of these communities were not in favor at the very beginning and remain
   reluctant so far. This was evident in the former plebiscite for the
   Peace Agreement, which led these communities to burgeon strongly as a
   political representation group.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-259},
Abstract = {Self-organized citizens' initiatives are a form of collective action and
   contribute to society through the production of public goods and
   services. Traditional collective action theory predicts that such
   initiatives are near impossible because of the persistent problems of
   free-riding. Citizens' initiatives however do exist and function
   properly, and their numbers seem to be increasing in countries such as
   the Netherlands. This article argues that free-riding problems can be
   overcome when some form of exclusivity is arranged in citizens'
   initiatives. We assume that citizens' initiatives use active and/or
   passive strategies to limit free-riding behaviour. Using three
   illustrative cases, our research shows that position rules, boundary
   rules, and authority rules are used in a subtle and often implicit way
   to differentiate the level of influence and authority between the more
   and the less committed members, enabling collective action. Such rules,
   though advantageous, may be paradoxical to the goals of the citizens'
   initiatives and can undermine the virtues associated with them.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the role of the Red Sports
   International in the formation of sports diplomacy in Soviet Russia in
   the 1920s and 30s. Based on archival materials and Soviet periodicals,
   the authors put forward the idea that the creation of the red sports
   international (IDR) served not only as the beginning of sports contacts
   between Soviet Russia and foreign countries, but also laid the
   foundations of Soviet sports diplomacy.
   Soviet Russia envisioned the creation of the red sports international as
   an important step in overcoming the isolation it found itself in after
   the October revolution of 1917. This was facilitated by the Spartakiads
   and various sports events organized by the red sports international, in
   which Soviet athletes actively participated, and contributed to the
   development of cultural ties with many European countries (Germany,
   Finland, Italy, Czechoslovakia, etc. The novelty of the research is
   determined by the fact that for the first time IDR is considered an
   institution of nascent sports diplomacy of the USSR. The authors suggest
   a new look at IDR's activities, considering it as the first institution
   of nascent sports diplomacy.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {For a long time, Belarus was a ``blank spot{''} in public perception and
   in eastern European research. It was not until support was given to the
   country after Chernobyl, and when reparations were paid to forced
   labourers, that ``White Russia{''} began to attract attention in
   Germany. Eastern European history as a discipline must allow the country
   to emerge from the shadow of the Soviet Union. The particular features
   of Belarus include its late territorialisation during the inter-war
   years and the process of urbanisation after the war. Historians have the
   task of explaining why, and how, the transformation of Belarus from an
   agricultural country to an industrial state led to a loss of national
   identity, and the cult surrounding the victory of the Soviet Union in
   the Second World War is still of constitutive importance for the regime
   today.},

Abstract = {This article presents a critical reflection on the contemporary action
   of Private Security Companies and their relationship with state
   structures, especially with regard to the narratives about possible
   violations of state sovereignty. We point out that the grammar involving
   CSP is articulated mainly with a supposed monopoly on the use of force,
   its use being commonly pointed out as the materialization of practices
   of erosion of the basic principles of modern States. The article focuses
   on articular epistemological premises that assume that these actors do
   not necessarily erode sobriety - but represent a moment of reframing it,
   in collusion with redefinitions of what is public and private in such
   contexts. The sober, in this sense, is understood as a concept in a
   recurring process of signification and not a rigid and timeless element.},

Abstract = {2019 has been an unusual year fora government that is beginning its
   term, due to the succession of crises that brought President Mario Abdo
   Benitez to the brink of impeachment. This article analyses the period by
   focusing on three dimensions: the overlapping of foreign and domestic
   policy, or ``intermesticity{''}, the convulsed political front, and the
   economic crisis. The article concludes that 2020 will be a decisive year
   for determining whether the marked deterioration of the government's
   political fortunes in its first year will be reversed and whether the
   opposition will be able to articulate a coherent and united opposition
   front for the future. How these two questions are resolved depends
   largely on the electoral scenario of 2023 and what the chances are for
   the success of the Colorado Party and the opposition.},

Title = {BACK TO THE SUBJECT: THE THEORY OF JUST WAR IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL
   THOUGHT},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {5},
Pages = {114-129},
Abstract = {The article compares several intellectual paradigms that inform the
   problem of just war. The beginning of article shows that the present-day
   legalist theory of permissible war (like Conventions and Charters of the
   UN), to our mind, inherits an antinomy which emerged in the history of
   political thought, and which counterposes state sovereignty and human
   rights. Within such normative framework, the justification of war
   gravitates either to protection of state sovereignty or to the defense
   of human rights; for example, the priority of human rights over
   sovereignty is being proclaimed by authors such as Habermas, who reduce
   war to a mere `police operation'. We reconstruct the philosophical
   foundations of this theory (Vattel, Kant) to suggest that such a
   normative theory incurs the loss of state legitimacy as a criterion jus
   ad bellum, interpreting legitimacy on contractual terms. Further, we
   examine ideas of political realism (Morgenthau) and the critics of
   `Kantian-Wilsonian system', which, as certain authors consider
   (Schmitt), leads towards the demonization of an enemy, towards the
   endless escalation of violence, and towards the transformation of
   regular war into partisan war. The third part of the article deals with
   the legitimation of war in Bolshevik political philosophy and studies
   the specifics of arguments of Lenin, which, along with the works of
   Pashukanis, represent the nucleus of the unique concept of just war,
   which goes beyond the antinomy `sovereignty - rights'. In the final
   chapter, the authors show that Walzer's theory of just war, which is
   popular nowadays, shares certain characteristics with Leninist theory of
   war; for both these theories, firstly, both place importance in rhetoric
   strategies for problematizing the status of subjects waging war;
   secondly, both are sensitive to status-based justifications of war in
   particular cases; and thirdly, both place emphasis upon the necessity of
   effective persuasion of `ordinary people' (or `masses', in Lenin's
   words) in the just character of war. The authors conclude that it is
   attention to the subject waging war and the subject consuming the
   information (an ``ordinary person{''}) that makes a difference between

Abstract = {Until recently, researchers who wanted to examine the determinants of
   state respect for most specific negative rights (i.e., physical
   integrity and empowerment rights) needed to rely on data from the CIRI
   or the Political Terror Scale (PTS). The new Varieties of Democracy
   (V-Dem) dataset offers scholars a potential alternative to the
   individual human rights variables from CIRI. We analyze a set of key
   Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project and V-Dem negative
   rights indicators, finding unusual and unexpectedly large patterns of
   disagreement between the two sets. First, we discuss the new V-Dem
   dataset by comparing it to the disaggregated CIRI indicators, discussing
   the history of each project, and describing its empirical domain.
   Second, we identify a set of disaggregated human rights measures that
   are similar across the two datasets and discuss each project's
   measurement approach. Third, we examine how these measures compare to
   each other empirically, showing that they diverge considerably across
   both time and space. These findings point to several important
   directions for future work, such as how conceptual approaches and
   measurement strategies affect rights scores. For the time being, our
   findings suggest that researchers should think carefully about using the
   measures as substitutes.},

Abstract = {In the contemporary context, it is inescapable that racism is a factor
   in US public opinion. When scholars take stock of the way we typically
   measure and conceptualize racism, we find reason to reconceptualize the
   racial resentment scale as a measure of perceptions of the reasons for
   political inequality. We also see reason to move beyond thinking of
   racism as an attitude, toward conceptualizing it as a perspective. In
   addition, we see reason to pay closer attention to the role of elites in
   creating and perpetuating a role for racism in the way people think
   about public affairs. The study of racism is evolving in parallel with
   the broader public discussion: toward a recognition of the complex and
   fundamental ways it is woven into US culture and political life.},

Abstract = {I study a model of conflict over territories from which rents are
   endogenously generated. Territorial conquest affects market power and,
   thus, rents. As such, there is an endogenous relationship between
   conflict behavior and economic behavior. Consistent with standard
   intuitions, changes to economic conditions that increase market power or
   market size at all territories lead to a positive association between
   rents and conflict. However, contrary to these same intuitions, changes
   in local economic conditions at a territory under dispute can lead to a
   negative, positive, or nonmonotone association between rents and
   conflict. The local comparative statics show that shocks at one
   territory have effects on violence at other territories and that the
   sign of these effects is heterogeneous. These local comparative statics
   also facilitate a theoretical exploration of the sign and magnitude of
   the bias associated with standard empirical strategies for estimating
   the effect of economic shocks on conflict outcomes.},

Abstract = {The election as president of Jair Bolsonaro in 2018, shocked some
   academic and political circles. However, if we look back at Brazil's
   historical and political trajectory, his election should not come as a
   surprise. For this reason, we discuss, based on the concept of hybrid
   political culture, the election of Bolsonaro in 2018 as an exploratory
   reflection of the fragility of Brazilian democracy. Based on the
   analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from the Seventh Wave of
   World Values Survey (WVS), collected in 2018 and 2019, we characterize
   the political culture of Brazilians as authoritarian and conservative,
   despite a general support for the democratic idea. In this sense, we
   understand that this political culture has contributed to the
   development of an inertial democracy that is sustained in its processes,
   but not in democratic values. We also retrace a brief political history
   to show that Brazilian politics has a pattern of instability. Our
   conclusions indicate that democracy remains fragile in Brazil, because
   the hybrid political culture, exacerbated by the election of a president
   who clearly defends an authoritarian outcome.},

Title = {ON THE SHORE OF THE EMPIRE: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF HARDT AND NEGRI
   BASED ON THE CONCEPTS OF IMPERIALISM AND THE PEOPLE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {2},
Pages = {92-108},
Abstract = {M. Hardt and A. Negri injected poststructuralist concepts into the
   traditional Marxist paradigm in their Empire quadrilogy. The classical
   Marxist concepts of Imperialism and the Proletariat are replaced with
   Empire and the Multitude through the autonomist post-Marxist line of
   Hardt and Negri. This essay attempts to replace the antagonism of Empire
   and the Multitude with Imperialism and the People. Firstly, the debate
   surrounding Empire and Imperialism and the validity of the concept of
   Imperialism are highlighted. Accordingly, this essay claims that
   nation-state sovereignty continues to operate via an uneven and combined
   developmental form of neoliberal capitalism. Finally, this essay
   attempts to approach the issue of revolutionary subject in the context
   of poststructuralism. Having discussed the fundamental dilemma of
   immanence and the transcendence of social struggles, the essay contends
   that the alternatives against the new imperialist relations should
   articulate the multiplicity of antagonisms on the grounds of hegemonic
   politics, which transcendentally constitutes the autonomous and
   representative phases of politics. Articulation of the antagonisms
   necessitates rescuing populism from its pejorative meaning and using it
   as a constitutional part of politics. This essay's critical stance on
   the concepts of Hardt and Negri through the ideology of populism opens
   the path for a theoretical framework of an anarcho-populist radical
   democracy.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Number = {1},
Pages = {22-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The congressional incumbency advantage reflects an inequity in
   competition-candidates receive an electoral edge simply because they
   hold office. Scholars have identified an array of factors that
   contribute to the incumbency advantage; however, the role of electoral
   campaigns has been largely ignored. We argue that campaigns are a
   mechanism through which the incumbency advantage works. All else
   constant, incumbents focus their campaigns on factors that reflect their
   standing position, such as their familiarity to voters and actions taken
   for their district/state. Voters consequently rely on such incumbency
   factors when making their decisions. The outcome is challengers are at
   an extreme disadvantage, and campaigns offer scant substantive
   engagement. We offer evidence for these dynamics with a large-scale
   content analysis of campaign websites and an experiment. In so doing, we
   highlight a challenge to theories of democratic representation that
   focus on equal competition and/or substantive campaign engagement.},

Abstract = {The mayor's office potentially offers a launchpad for statewide and
   national political ambitions. We know relatively little, however, about
   how frequently mayors actually run for higher office, and which mayors
   choose to do so. This article combines longitudinal data on the career
   paths of the mayors of 200 big cities with new survey and interview data
   to investigate these questions. While we find that individual and city
   traits-especially gender-have some predictive power, the overwhelming
   story is that relatively few mayors-just under one-fifth-ever seek
   higher office. We suggest that ideological, institutional, and electoral
   factors all help to explain why so few mayors exhibit progressive
   ambition.},

Title = {EXCLUDING EMOTIONS: THE PERFORMATIVE FUNCTION OF POPULISM},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {107-131},
Abstract = {Populists are often excluded from political life on the basis that they
   are too emotional. Both social movements as well as political parties
   who are labelled as populist are accused of using demagoguery and
   manipulation in order to attract support and new membership. Often,
   these critiques emanate from the political establishment, creating a
   division between emotional and rational actors in politics. In this
   article, I argue that instead of seeing populism as a nominal or ordinal
   category, we should look at how the term itself has performative
   properties. The article is interested in how populism as a concept is
   used as a tool for exclusion, and how being `too emotional' is used as
   justification for excluding certain actors. This article first contends
   that this perspective is endemic to political and social theory, and has
   long been utilised to marginalise women, non -Europeans, or young
   people. Second, the article demonstrates how this perspective also
   pervades much of contemporary studies on populism, which do not
   sufficiently recognise the political implications of employing a strict
   divide between emotion and reason. Third, the article further contends
   that by using a Laclauian framework which sees politics as equal to
   hegemony as equal to populism, one can conclude that populist actors are
   no different from other political actors; emotions and affects are
   always central to any political identity. Instead, the division between
   emotional and rational in politics serves to sediments exclusionary
   practices against newcomers and challengers of the status quo. I
   conclude by using the Laclauian framework, focus can be turned to the
   performative function of populism, and its political implications.},

   System: Opening a Black-Box},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {72-84},
Abstract = {Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have a multitude of
   parliamentary duties and, accordingly, have to prioritize some
   parliamentary activities over others. So far, we know comparably little
   about this prioritization process. Based on principal-agent theory, we
   argue first, that MEPs' parliamentary activities are systematically
   determined by the ``visibility{''} and usefulness of parliamentary
   instruments for their key principal; second, we expect the exclusiveness
   of candidate selection procedures of an MEP's national party-the
   nomination and the final list placement-to determine her/his key
   principal (i.e., elites or members of national parties). Combining
   multi-level mixed effects linear regression models and expert
   interviews, we show that MEPs who are nominated and whose final list
   placement is decided by an exclusive circle of national party elites
   prioritize speeches, whereas MEPs who are nominated or whose final list
   placement is decided by more inclusive procedures prioritize written
   questions and opinions or reports. In other words, speeches seem
   particularly useful to communicate with national party elites, while
   other activities are used to serve larger groups of party members. These
   findings open up the black-box of the ``national party principal{''} and
   illustrate how a complex principal-agent relationship stimulates very
   specific parliamentary activity patterns in the EU's multi-level system.},

Abstract = {The objective of the work is to analyze and characterize the political
   participation of Peruvians abroad based on official statistical data and
   empirical studies in different parts of the world, in particular in the
   countries where there are more Peruvian immigrants. It is explored from
   a citizenship approach and having as a theoretical framework political
   participation in its conventional and unconventional ways. The approach
   is qualitative based on descriptive statistics, following a historical
   analysis since the 1970s. It is found that electoral participation grows
   with each election, however absenteeism is very high and the preferences
   of voting abroad are towards parties of the conservative right.
   Likewise, unconventional participation is diverse, highlighting
   associations, community and digital activism.The various forms and
   spaces of participation allow the construction of political
   transnationalism from the State and citizens, and a transnational,
   direct and digital citizenship that is increasingly important,
   intercultural and citizen transformation, participating both in relation
   to the issuing country and of the receiving country.},

   issue focused on theorizations of power in diverse- and

   Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers, this
   collection of essays reflects broader, ongoing discussions about how to
   grapple analytically and practically with power-in all of its forms-as a
   feature of economic formations. We outline here how each of the
   contributors to this issue, unsatisfied with a division of labor between
   theorists concerned with power's constraining force and those focused on
   its enabling or generative force, offers new paths for critique that
   neither reify existing power relations nor turn away from them.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This paper addresses public sector communication by exploring the role
   of government whistleblowers. It argues for the need to reconnect voices
   by creating platforms from which whistleblowers can speak without fear
   of retribution for the betterment of society. The paper presents 13
   in-depth interviews with whistleblowers who worked for governmental
   entities in the United States or who worked as contractors to U.S.
   government entities. The goal was to understand their stories, including
   why they blew the whistle, how they blew the whistle, how whistleblowing
   affected their relationships with their employers, what role public
   relations executives and practitioners played in their whistleblowing
   experience, and how public relations executives and practitioners could
   interact more productively with whistleblowers. Four of the five
   theories explained some of the dynamics of whistleblowing: Resource
   dependence perspective explained the role of upper management in relying
   on wrong doing; normalization of corruption theory explained attempts to
   conscript new employees into corrupt practices; justice theory explained
   the sense of betrayal felt by employees who tried to correct wrong
   doing; and relationship management further explained the negative impact
   of retaliation on the relationships between whistleblowers and their
   employers. However, evolutionary theory explained all aspects of
   whistleblowing in terms of Darwinian natural selection.},

Abstract = {We study how partisanship influences the perception of directed campaign
   statements of varying polarity and sentiment strength. Using a
   crowdsourced survey experiment with German participants, we find
   asymmetrical perceptual biases. Partisan respondents perceive negative
   campaigning from or about a party they favour, as less negative than
   non-partisans. The discounting effect applies particularly for voters
   with stronger preferences and for messages that are more strongly
   negative. Partisan preferences only weakly influence the perception of
   neutral or positive campaign statements. The discounting biases found
   for negative statements point at limits of negative campaigning effects
   in electoral contests. Different effects for weakly and strongly worded
   messages substantiate concerns that dichotomous approaches to negative
   campaigning could miss important variation in party communication and
   its effects.},

Abstract = {Blame games between governing and opposition parties are a
   characteristic feature of domestic politics. In the EU, policymaking
   authority is shared among multiple actors across different levels of
   governance. How does EU integration affect the dynamics of domestic
   blame games? Drawing on the literatures on EU politicisation and blame
   attribution in multi-level governance systems, we derive expectations
   about the direction and frequency of blame attributions in a
   Europeanized setting. We argue, first, that differences in the direction
   and frequency of blame attributions by governing and opposition parties
   are shaped by their diverging baseline preferences as blame avoiders and
   blame generators; secondly, we posit that differences in blame
   attributions across Europeanized policies are shaped by variation in
   political authority structures, which incentivize certain attributions
   while constraining others. We hypothesize, inter alia, that blame games
   are Europeanized primarily by governing parties and when
   policy-implementing authority rests with EU-level actors. We test our
   theoretical expectations by analysing parliamentary debates on EU asylum
   system policy and EU border control policy in Austria and Germany.},

Abstract = {Land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) will be a pivotal component of the
   Royal Navy's likely expeditionary posture in the future strategic
   environment. Currently, the service has only one mode of delivery for
   LACMs - its attack submarine fleet. And even when the Queen
   Elizabeth-class carriers fully come onboard, they lack a true standoff
   capability. At the moment, the navy's surface force does not possess an
   LACM capability, and there is debate over whether LACMs should arm the
   new Type 26 frigate. Ben Wan Beng Ho assesses these three platforms for
   LACM deployment and shows that there are inherent shortcomings in the
   carrier aircraft and submarine options, notably in the combat power they
   can project.},

Abstract = {This essay by Evald Vasilyevich Ilyenkov (1924-79), ``On the Coincidence
   of Logic with Dialectics and the Theory of Knowledge of Materialism,{''}
   was published in his most widely known work, Dialectical Logic: Essays
   on Its History and Theory (first edition in Russian, 1974). The English
   translation by H. Campbell Creighton is from the edition published by
   Progress Publishers, Moscow 1977 In this adapted essay, Ilyenkov
   discusses the idea of the coincidence of dialectics, logics, and theory
   of knowledge, which was one of the hallmarks of the Ilyenkovian current
   in post-Stalin Soviet philosophy. Originally, the idea was jotted down
   by V. I. Lenin in his Philosophical Notebooks when he was reading G. W.
   F. Hegel in 1914 and 1915, as a critique against the separation of the
   theory of knowledge from other fields of philosophy.
   Ilyenkov was one of the most important and controversial Soviet Marxist
   philosophers. He contributed substantially to the Marx Renaissance that
   emerged in the so-called Thaw Period and aimed at the reconstruction of
   Marx's original methodology. In 1960, his first book, The Dialectics of
   the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx's ``Capital,{''} was published, to
   be followed by important articles and studies on the concept of the
   ideal and on problems of dialectical logic. Ilyenkov was known as an
   ardent critic of technocratic tendencies in the Soviet Union. He
   stressed that socialist society should express humanist values and not
   merely be an engineering project. Although Ilyenkov had constant
   problems with the Soviet philosophical establishment, which viewed his
   innovatory ideas with suspicion, he did not regard himself as a
   dissident and remained a member of the Party. He died by his own hands
   on March 21, 1979. For more information on Ilyenkov, see:

Title = {Designing a Constitutional Presidential Democracy in Indonesia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {22-31},
Abstract = {The constitutional design of the Indonesian democracy has undergone
   several significant changes from President Sukarno's regime known as
   Orde Lama or the Old Order (1945-1965) to Era Reformasi or Reformation
   Era (1998 to present). During the drafting of the 1945 Constitution, the
   desire to form a democratic system of government that is unique to
   Indonesia has led its founding fathers to adopt an ambivalent system of
   government resembling both a parliamentary and presidential systems of
   government. By investigating the Indonesian democracy and system of
   government through the analysis of relevant articles of the 1945
   Constitution, the present study seeks to address the question how to
   design a constitutional presidential democracy in Indonesia. The
   research results show that with the election of president and vice
   president and their accountability to the People's Consultative Assembly
   or Majelis Perwalikan Rakyat (MPR), the design of the Indonesian system
   of government better fits a parliamentary more than a presidential.
   However, the four amendments to the 1945 Constitution (from 1999 to
   2002) were intended to pave the way for a presidential democracy capable
   of accommodating the characteristics of a true presidential system of
   government in Indonesia.},

   relations fit well into the Cold War picture. Despite this fact, Russia
   manages to maintain a fairly high level of relations with both states.
   However, such maneuvering has its limits. The purpose of the article is
   to explore the main determinants of the importance of Iran and Israel in
   Russian foreign policy and key constraints of cooperation of Russia with
   those states at the present stage. The article uses the ideas of (neo)
   realism and (neo) liberalism. Methodologically, the study relies on a
   comparative method and the systems approach that makes it easier to
   establish correlations between external and internal foreign policy
   elements when reflecting on their impact on a state's foreign policy.
   The main results of the study include the following. Firstly, it has
   been established that Iran's place in contemporary Russian foreign
   policy is determined primarily by situational factors, while Israel's
   similar position is determined also by longer-term determinants based on
   historical, religious, ethnic, political and economic foundations. In
   the case of Israel, situational geopolitical and economic determinants
   are complemented by a relatively long-term human factor - resources and
   capabilities of the Russian-speaking Jewish diaspora. Secondly, it is
   shown that, despite the high level of Russia's cooperation with Iran and
   Israel at the present stage, there are a number of factors that limit
   the formation of strategic cooperation between them. The key constraints
   in this context in Russian-Iranian relations are epy problem of
   unresolved legal status of the Caspian Sea, Russia's ``all-azimuth{''}
   strategy in the Middle East, Moscow's concerns about Iran's growing
   regional influence and its ability to diversify energy supply routes
   from Central Asia to Europe and the last but not least is the negative
   impact of rapprochement with Iran on relations with Western states. The
   key factors hindering the strategic nature of Russian-Israeli relations
   include not only the allied nature of Israel's relations with the United
   States, but also Russia's position on a Middle East settlement, Moscow's
   expanding engagement with the Palestinian National Administration and
   relations with Iranian backed - labeled terrorist by Tel-Aviv - military
   groups in the region. And thirdly, based on an analysis of a combination
   of factors, it is concluded that Russia's relations with Iran and Israel
   cannot be strategic, since some determinants of the significance of
   these states in modern Russian foreign policy at the same time appear to
   be constraints towards a closer cooperation within this triangle.},

Abstract = {The article is based on the Masters Dissertation by the author, named
   PCB and the books: Editorial Calvino in its legality period in the 40's
   (1943-1948). PCB (Brazilian Communist Party), after more than ten years
   outlawed, chased by the suppression of the Estado Novo regime, is able
   to restructure itself from 1942 on with the entering of Brazil in World
   War II and its participation on the anti-fascist broad front which put
   together USSR (Soviet Union) and the capitalist democracies (England,
   France and United States of America). In those years for the first time
   the Party could organize its presses, which began to play an essential
   role in the agitprop (agitation and propaganda) work. The first press is
   Editorial Calvino, property of Jose Calvino Filho, editor, located at
   Rio de Janeiro. The communication intends to show how Editorial
   Calvino's publications were according to the political line of
   ``National Union{''} for the war effort of PCB at that moment, and its
   role in this effort with the publising of books with a main content of
   anti-fascism, disclosure of USSR and Marxist-Leninist doctrine, aiming
   to demystify both Nazi Fascism regimes and the operation of USSR to the
   Brazilian public.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Our contribution examines two questions regarding the internal security
   policies of 28 European countries: First, the question which different
   internal security conceptions regarding crime management exist and
   second, how countries cluster along these conceptions. As data
   foundation, we use a two-dimensional approach examining the dimensions
   of capabilities and punitivity with two variables for each. For the
   dimension of capabilities, we utilize the spending share of government
   budget for internal security and the relative number of police officers
   and for the punitivity dimension, we consider average prison terms and
   the share of alternatives to conventional incarceration. By using this
   data in combination with modern clustering techniques, we prove that our
   results are stable and cohesive despite the wide variety of different
   methods and clustering techniques deployed, which include
   state-of-the-art unsupervised learning algorithms adapted from big data
   frameworks. By also including most Eastern European Countries in a
   comparative European setup for the first time, we identify five
   different clusters, namely a Western and Central European Cluster, a
   liberal Scandinavian cluster, two different Southern and Eastern
   European clusters with high capabilities and very uneven levels of
   punitivity, and one cluster with special cases with very infrequent use
   of alternatives to conventional punishment.},

Title = {The Science-Policy Interface as a Discourse Network: Finland's Climate
   Change Policy 2002-2015},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {200-214},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the science-policy interface can be
   understood as a discourse network constituted by discursive interaction
   between scientific organizations and other actors that both use
   scientific arguments in conjunction with other policy arguments. We use
   discourse network analysis to investigate the climate change policy
   process in Finland between 2002 and 2015, focusing on the role of and
   relationships between scientific actors and arguments in the discourse
   networks. Our data consist of policy actors' written testimonies on two
   law proposals, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol (2002) and the
   enactment of the Finnish Climate Law (2015). Our results show that two
   competing discourse coalitions have influenced the development of
   climate change policy in the 2000s. In 2002, the dominant coalition was
   economic, prioritizing economic growth over climate change mitigation.
   In 2015, the climate coalition that argued for ambitious mitigation
   measures became dominant. The majority of scientific actors were part of
   the dominant economy coalition in 2002 and part of the dominant ecology
   coalition in 2015. The centrality of scientific arguments increased over
   time, and both discourse coalitions used them progressively more. These
   developments reflect the increasingly central position of science in
   Finnish climate policymaking. We contribute to the literature on the
   science-policy interface by operationalizing the interface as a set of
   connections in a discourse network and by showing how the analysis of
   discourse networks and their properties can help us understand the
   shifts in the role of science in policymaking over time.},

Abstract = {The French electoral system, which concerns ``political{''} elections,
   is marked by several fundamental features. The most remarkable is
   undoubtedly the presidential election, which is THE electoral moment in
   France and which conditions the life of the political regime of the
   Fifth Republic. Beyond that, respect for equal suffrage, the links with
   nationality and the exercise of legislative power to define the voting
   methods of the various elections are the highlights of electoral
   matters. It is also important to take into account the reforms that have
   been carried out in this area, with regard to the objective of electoral
   parity or the reconfiguration of parliamentary elections, which is
   currently being reflected in a draft constitutional law and a draft
   organic law designed to promote the renewal of democratic life and the
   moralization of public life.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the sociopolitical process of insertion,

   during the period 1990-2020, based on two political coordinates: 1) the
   period of protected democracy (examining migration policies) and; 2) the
   social and political struggle for a new constitution in Chile. It is
   essential to point out that there are not many academic works on the
   Peruvian refuge in the region that allow us to understand this aspect of
   the political dimension of contemporary Peruvian international
   migration. In this sense, the central purpose of this work is to explain
   the role of a sector of Peruvian refugee organizations and their
   political position in the aforementioned period, under the premise: ``to
   migrate is a right{''}, which was from his first actions and until
   today, it is their political banner of protest.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the number of problems that can occur when core model
   assumptions are violated, nearly all quantitative political science
   research relies on inflexible regression models that require a linear
   relationship between dependent and independent variables for valid
   inference. We argue that nonparametric statistical learning methods like
   random forests are capable of combining the benefits of interpretability
   and flexibility. Recent work has shown that under suitable regularity
   conditions, averaging over predictions made by subsampled random forests
   produces asymptotically normal predictions. After estimating the
   variance, this property can be exploited to produce hypothesis tests and
   confidence intervals analogous to those produced within a parametric
   framework. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by replicating
   an important study on the determinants of civil war onset and show that
   subtle nonlinear relationships are uncovered, providing a new
   perspective on these ongoing research questions.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a tremendous surge of public interest in partisan
   gerrymandering, including robust reform efforts and multiple
   high-profile court cases. Political scientists have played an important
   role in this debate, reaching an unusually high level of public
   engagement. Yet this public-facing period has to some extent obscured
   promising avenues for future research within the discipline. I review
   the history of political science and redistricting and describe how
   research on this topic has been shaped by the newfound interest. The
   goals of the law differ from those of political science, so research
   that focuses squarely on the former often misses opportunities to
   advance the latter. I lay out the contours of this difference and then
   suggest reframing the existing metrics of partisan gerrymandering to
   make them useful for more traditionally scientific questions. Finally, I
   offer some ideas about what those future questions might look like when
   reframed in this way.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the relations between the
   Chilean Communist Party and the Alliance of Intellectuals of Chile for
   the Defense of Culture (AICH). The temporal delimitation is established
   by the foundation date of the entity (1937) and ends with the last issue
   of the magazine, Aurora de Chile presented as the official body of the
   AICH. We seek to identify the intellectuals who formed the group, the
   activities they develop and the extent to which they follow the
   communist guidelines, especially regarding the formation of the Popular
   Front and the defense of the antifascist struggle. We believe that
   Comintern's influence was undeniable, but this did not mean absolute
   control over this diverse group of Aichi intellectuals.},

Title = {THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ETHNICITY IN THE IDENTITY POLICY OF RUSSIAN
   REPUBLICS: CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {3},
Pages = {78-92},
Abstract = {This article discusses the theoretical and methodological aspects of the
   manifestation of ethnicity and of its institutionalization in the
   regional identity policy of Russian republics. The author analyzes how
   ethnicity is included in politics. Indicators are identified that
   indicate the expression of ethnicity in identity politics. Identity
   policies as policies promoted by state actors are regarded as systemic
   and aimed at institutionalising ethnic categories thus helping create
   and sustain a sense of ``Us - Them{''} and form subjective assessments
   towards such categories. The use of socio-constructivist methodology
   leads us to the conclusion that identification and institutionalization
   are related processes that occur simultaneously and mutually reinforce
   each other. The institutionalization of ethnicity is manifested in the
   rooting of ethnic categories in the political process of the republics
   and their role of maintaining or changing the regional institutional
   order. Building on this assumption, the author proposes an analytical
   model based on the allocation of three levels of the process of
   ethnicity institutionalization in identity politics: the normative, the
   narrative-mythological, and the symbolic level. The normative level
   includes the establishment of ethnic categories in the political
   institutions of the region and is manifested in the normative
   consolidation of ethnic discourse, i.e. in normative documents, in the
   distribution of power positions, in language policies expressing ethnic
   preferences etc. The narrative-mythological level determines the
   significance of ethnic markers in the discourse of regional historical
   memory and myth-making. The symbolic level is defined as the
   incorporation of ethnicity into the symbolic attributes of the region. A
   set of indicators can be used to operationalize this three-level model
   in empirical studies of ethnicity institutionalization in Russian
   republics.},

Abstract = {By a measure of religious affiliation used by Gallup polls for nearly a
   century, the denomination with the largest following in the United
   States has always turned out to be ``None,{''} ahead of Catholic,
   Methodist, Baptist, or any other faith. The existence of such a large
   flock without religious affiliation might be expected for a country with
   a Constitution guaranteeing freedom of and from religion. The secular
   portion of the American electorate has always been big enough to wield,
   potentially at least, political clout. Its partisan attachments have
   consistently favored the Democratic over the Republican side. What is
   limiting the electoral clout of the ``Nones{''} today is that nearly
   half of them profess no partisan affiliation. They are Independents in
   matters of both church and state.},

Abstract = {Recent attempts at a reevaluation of utopia stress the significance of
   non traditional, open-process approaches to the envisioning of the
   future. A classic of blue-print utopia is here analyzed through the lens
   of such new perspectives and found less out-of-date than generally
   assumed. Through the particular attention devoted to the organization of
   labour and to the social and political provisions aimed at ensuring
   liberty, Bellamy's utopian posture is observed in its long-term
   evolution. What ensues is a far less clear-cut rendering of Bellamy's
   utopian vision, which does not really seem to remain fixed and static,
   but proves able to evolve in due course of time.},

Abstract = {Refugees' preflight class interacts with host state policies to shape
   refugees' post-displacement class trajectories. This interaction affects
   whether refugees of different backgrounds experience mobility over time
   and how refugees of various backgrounds disperse over space. ``Selective
   engagement{''} hosts that leave refugees to self-settle accentuate
   stratification insofar as refugees with capital can attain
   entrepreneurial success, poor refugees lack protection from further
   impoverishment, and middle-class professionals have both the means and
   motivation to try to migrate elsewhere. ``Interventionist engagement{''}
   hosts lessen the gap between rich and poor both by attracting
   middle-class refugees and by imposing integration programs that further
   compress all refugees toward the middle. Demonstrating these arguments,
   analysis of Syrian refugees in Turkey and Germany illustrates a
   diaspora's class-remaking in ways not attributable to displacement
   alone.},

Volume = {82},

Abstract = {How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when
   redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of
   distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as
   the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on
   people's perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that
   policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in
   general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair.
   Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party
   and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of
   the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the
   status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But
   there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest
   wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair
   by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income
   individuals.},

   the social time of public-private partnerships for development between
   transnational actors that settled in the region at the beginning of the
   21st century. The social time category refers to a cultural construct
   that captures the social rhythm of the processes and that allows to
   identify the role played by each actor within the system that they
   configured. We analyzed tis case from the perspective of the history of
   the present that has as its inaugural event the external debt crisis of
   the eighties.},

Abstract = {This paper has as a general objective to analyze and characterize the
   international condition of the People's Republic of China, from the
   beginning of the 21st century to the present. The study goes from the
   entrance of China to the World Trade Organization -OMC- (December 2001)
   to the current presidency of Xi Jinping (started in 2013). To achieve
   this goal, we have specifically set out: a) to describe the historical
   background of this process since the death of Mao Zedong and the reforms
   promoted by Deng Xiaoping; b) examine and characterize the main elements
   of China's recent evolution in the international context, focusing on
   its global economic relations, its military development and its foreign
   policy.},

Title = {UKRAINE IN THE TERRITORIAL MIGRATION SYSTEMS: CURRENT
   STRUCTURAL-QUALIMETRIC ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {60-78},
Abstract = {A characteristic feature of the new economy of the 21st century is the
   wide-scale transformation of the social relations in the sphere of labor
   and employment. Human migration that leads to the quantitative and
   qualitative changes in the numbers, structure, organization of the
   migrant workers flows holds a special place that is shown by the role of
   the migration capital in the development of national economy of the
   states and their separate regions, generates appearance of the new
   mechanisms of regulation in the market, etc.
   Migration factors predetermine formation of the relatively new
   phenomenon in modern economy - territorial migration systems (TMS) that
   in terms of economy are interpreted as the regional labor markets,
   determined by the effect of the additional agreements and labor
   contracts. These systems play a special role in terms of the
   perspectives of regulation of the sustainable economic development and
   enhancement of the competitiveness of human capital. Formation,
   territorial organization, development of TMS depend on the effect of the
   factors of both, external and internal environment. As the result, each
   of the systems acquires its own characteristics of its integrity,
   independence, designation, effectiveness of the performance of its
   functions.
   The examples of this can be the Ukrainian-Polish, Ukrainian-German
   territorial migration systems (TMS) the appearance of whose
   characteristics can be observed against the background of considerable
   volumes of the present day Ukrainian external migration, deepening of
   professionalization and division of labor in the transborder labor
   market, formation of infrastructure of migration services market, etc.
   Taking into consideration the high educational level of the Ukrainian
   workforce, regularities and particularities of the development of
   economic, social and demographic, political. Cultural ties between
   Ukraine, Poland and Germany, interests and opportunities of the
   implementation of achievements of economic knowledge in the practice of
   international economic relations as the economy of postindustrial (new),
   information (digital), innovation (network), Internet (virtual) era
   where knowledge becomes the determinant resource, product and source
   (factor) of the economic growth - the study of the state, factors of the
   formation and development UGTMS is exceptionally important not only from
   the standpoint of resolving structural-qualimetric problems of
   employment of population in Ukraine, growth of the level of income of
   citizens, but also from the standpoint of elaboration of the new foreign
   policy of Poland and Germany for the sake of stabilization of economic
   and political situation in Europe under the conditions of the changing
   world.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {57-67},
Abstract = {Relations within India-US-China triangle are rather complicated. The
   basis of the Sino-Indian dialogue was laid by the 1962 war, after which
   mutual distrust became its permanent feature. Despite the fact that the
   late 20th century was marked by rapprochement of bilateral cooperation,
   it is still off the mark. As for relations between the United States and
   China, today it is increasingly referred to as the rivalry of two
   superpowers - an established, but losing its positions, and a potential
   one. Historically, Indian-American relations suffered fluctuations: the
   US gave preference to Pakistan, while India was assigned a secondary
   role, though in some periods the parties saw active dialogue.
   Washington's choice was determined by its confrontation with the USSR,
   which directly affected cooperation with Delhi. However, in recent
   years, the American establishment has begun to pay more attention to the
   Asia-Pacific region due to the rise of China and its transformation into
   the main US geopolitical rival. Against this background, India started
   to pave its way as the second key power in the region by promoting its
   regional initiatives, with the Indo-Pacific being the most prominent.
   This shift received a new sound in American foreign policy, too. New
   geopolitical realities predetermine the relevance of this study, aimed
   at analyzing the influence of the Chinese factor on the interaction
   between India and the United States.},

Abstract = {The period that has passed since the official proclamation of the
   Russian `pivot to the East' allows us to draw preliminary conclusions
   about its nature, achievements, problems, and prospects. At present, the
   qualitative differences between this current course and earlier stages
   of Russian foreign policy looking towards an eastern direction at can
   also be noted. In particular, it is worth noting the more structurally
   complex profile of the `pivot to the East', due to the clear
   identification of several components at the junction of domestic and
   foreign policy, as well as the regional and global dimensions of the
   Russian foreign policy strategy. The first component regards political
   and economic interaction internationally, including the aggregated
   motives for searching for additional sources of economic growth and
   technology, and the search for alternative energy markets and political
   and economic alternatives which arose after 2014, under expanding
   sanctions by the US and the EU; Russia's key partners in Asia (China,
   India, the Republic of Korea, Southeast Asian states) refused to join
   anti-Russian sanctions, while Japan paid them only lip service. The
   second component regards internal political and institutional
   development, which is connected with the intention to reassess Russian
   Siberia and the Far East development against the background of external
   milieu's radical transformation and growing economic and demographic
   asymmetry between the European and Asian parts of Russia. The third
   component includes further development of the Greater Eurasia conceptual
   framework, which could have helped Russia to retain and ideally to raise
   its integrationist potential as one of the leading states in the
   international system, via institutionalized political and economic
   partnerships primarily with Asian states. While the first component's
   development is evident and can be subject to qualitative and
   quantitative assessment presented in this paper, the contours of the
   second and third are still in the making.},

Abstract = {The representative democracy is one of the paradigms of modernity that
   manifests in the field of politics and law. As in other scientific
   fields, by dissimulating their connection with a specific legal culture,
   the modern European model reached abstraction level necessary to impose
   itself as a universal standard and to colonize the political processes
   of the peripheral countries. The juridical systems established in these
   countries favored the diffusion of representative democracy,
   criminalizing traditional practices, however, unable to suppress them,
   as evidenced in the recent constituent processes of Bolivia and
   Venezuela. Such experiences reveal the limits of Eurocentrism in the
   understanding of reality and claim decolonial epistemologies that allow
   to question the colonizing canons and to recognize new paradigms, such
   as community democracy or communal democracy, both indications of the
   possibility of insurgents normativities in the Latin American continent.},

Abstract = {For years, observers have been warning of wars over sovereignty rights
   and resources in the Arctic as a result of climate change. This fear is
   exaggerated. There are currently no territorial conflicts, nor is there
   a battle over resources. The geophysical and climatic conditions also
   make war in the Arctic an unlikely prospect. However, the competition
   between the USA, China and Russia on the global political stage could
   also spill over into the Arctic. The alienation between Russia and the
   West is making it impossible to establish a common security architecture
   for all Arctic states. The USA and Russia are increasingly including the
   interface between the western Arctic Ocean and the northern Atlantic in
   their deterrence plans. And if Russia were to prevent ships from sailing
   through its coastal waters in the northern sea passage region and the
   USA were to insist on its right to passage, a situation similar to that
   in the South China Sea could arise in the Arctic Ocean.},

Abstract = {This essay opens with a discussion of the Black commons and the
   possibility it offers for visioning coherence between Black land
   relationality and Indigenous sovereignty. Two sites of history - Black
   slavery and Black migration prior to the twentieth century - present
   illuminations and challenges to Black and Indigenous relations on Turtle
   Island, as they expose the ``antagonisms history has left us{''} (Byrd,
   2019a, p. 342), and the ways antiblackness is produced as a return to
   what is deemed impossible, unimaginable, or unforgivable about Black
   life. While the full histories are well beyond the scope of this paper,
   I highlight the violent impossibilities and afterlives produced and
   sustained by both - those that deserve care and attention within a ``new
   relationality,{''} as Tiffany King has named, between Black and
   Indigenous peoples. At the end of the essay, I return briefly to Anna
   Tsing's spiritual science of foraging wild mushrooms. Her allegory about
   the human condition offers a bridge, I conclude, between the
   emancipatory dreams of Black freedom and Indigenous sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article presents key results from a comparative qualitative Social
   Policy study of nine African regional economic communities' (RECs)
   regional health policies. The article asks to what extent has health
   been incorporated into RECs' public policy functions and actions, and
   what similarities and differences are evident among the RECs. Utilising
   a World Health Organization (WHO) framework for conceptualising health
   systems, the research evidence routes the article's arguments towards
   the following principal conclusions. First, the health sector is a key
   component of the public policy functions of most of the RECs. In these
   RECs, innovations in health sector organisation are notable; there is
   considerable regulatory, organisational, resourcing and programmatic
   diversity among the RECs alongside under-resourcing and fragmentation
   within each of them. Second, there are indications of important tangible
   benefits of regional cooperation and coordination in health, and growing
   interest by international donors in regional mechanisms through which to
   disburse health and -related Official Development Assistance (ODA).
   Third, content analysis of RECs' regional health strategies suggests
   fairly minimal strategic ambitions as well as significant limitations of
   current approaches to advancing effective and progressive health reform.
   The lack of emphasis on universal health care and reliance on piecemeal
   donor funding are out of step with approaches and recommendations
   increasingly emphasising health systems development, sector-wide
   approaches (SWAPs) and primary health care as the bedrock of health
   services expansion. Overall, the health component of RECs' development
   priorities is consistent with an instrumentalist social policy approach.
   The development of a more comprehensive sustainable world-regional
   health policy is unlikely to come from the African Continental
   Free-Trade Area, which lacks requisite social and health clauses to
   underpin `positive' forms of regional integration.},

Abstract = {By examining how Turkey has strategically leveraged its immigration
   detention practices in its relationship to the EU, this article draws
   scholarly attention to the neglected international dimensions of
   detention policy-making. While narratives of national security bolster
   the justification for detention of asylum seekers and other migrants,
   this article focuses on additional roles that Turkey calls on detention
   to play in its relationship with the European Union. In particular, the
   article discusses `transit migration' as a policy discourse Turkey has
   strategically adopted and leveraged to its advantage when dealing with
   the EU. As form of `premature labelling', this discourse undermines the
   claims of belonging that foreign nationals labelled as transit migrants
   have in Turkey. Thus, it provides a narrative for justifying detention
   expansion. This international dimension of detention policy-making must
   be taken into account for future discussions around how to curb or
   abolish the practice at the borders of Europe and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Examining medical tourism, especially in countries with publicly funded
   and organised healthcare systems, offers a gateway into an understanding
   of the changing role of the state in contemporary societies. Drawing on
   a comprehensive documentary review, this article examines the evolving
   role of the state in transforming Turkey into a global medical tourism
   destination. The article identifies two stages of state involvement in
   medical tourism: the period after the 2003 healthcare reform and the
   rise of an entrepreneurial healthcare state since 2013. The article
   suggests that the state, in the first period, performed a facilitator
   role by supporting privatisation in healthcare provision; in the second
   period, it assumed an entrepreneurial role, establishing large hospital
   complexes through a public-private partnership and created a public
   corporation to capitalise on the export of healthcare services. The
   Turkish case demonstrates that the role of the state in medical tourism
   is subject to change over time, depending on shifts in governmental
   strategies for healthcare and government-business relations. The article
   also offers evidence on the continued relevance of the multidimensional
   engagement of the state in healthcare that cuts across economic and
   social policy commitments. This engagement has recently extended into
   the domain of healthcare provision in the context of medical tourism.},

Title = {Democracy in context: using a distributional semantic model to study
   differences in the usage of democracy across languages and countries},

Abstract = {Cross-cultural survey research rests upon the assumption that if survey
   features are kept constant, data will remain comparable across
   languages, cultures and countries. Yet translating concepts across
   languages, cultures and political contexts is complicated by linguistic,
   cultural, normative or institutional discrepancies. Such discrepancies
   are particularly relevant for complex political concepts such as
   democracy, where the literature on political support has revealed
   significant cross-cultural differences in people's attitudes toward
   democracy. Recognizing that language, culture and other socio-political
   variables affect survey results has often been equated with giving up on
   comparative research and many survey researchers have consequently
   chosen to simply ignore the issue of comparability and measurement
   equivalence across languages, cultures and countries. This paper
   contributes to the debate, using a distributional semantic lexicon,
   which is a statistical model measuring co-occurrence statistics in large
   text data. The method is motivated by structuralist meaning theory,
   stating that words with similar meanings tend to occur in similar
   contexts, and that contexts shape and define the meanings of words.
   Compared to other methodological approaches aimed at identifying and
   measuring cross-cultural discrepancies, this approach enables us to
   systematically analyze how the concept of democracy is used in its
   natural habitat. Collecting geo-tagged language data from news and
   social online source documents this paper descriptively explores
   varieties in meanings of democracy across a substantial number of
   languages and countries, and maps ways in which democracy is used among
   online populations and regions worldwide.},

Abstract = {How does past political violence impact subsequent development and
   practices, long beyond the life of the regime that perpetrated violence?
   Prior research focuses on physical destruction without much attention to
   weapons left behind in conflict zones. I contend that unexploded
   ordnance create direct and imminent threats to rural livelihoods.
   Individuals respond by shortening time horizons and avoiding investment
   in activities for which there is an immediate security cost but a
   distant return. Short-term adjustments in agricultural methods
   accumulate to long-term underdevelopment and poverty. In Cambodia, I
   find that the historic bombing of high-fertility land, where impact
   fuses hit soft ground and were more likely to fail, reduces contemporary
   household production and welfare. Counterintuitively, the most fertile
   land becomes the least productive. This reversal of fortune qualifies
   the presumption that post-war economies will eventually converge back to
   steady-state growth.},

Abstract = {The association of political brand relationship management and voters'
   citizenship behavior is a relatively new concept in political marketing
   research. The relationship between voters and political parties is more
   complicated in modern times, due to both the sophisticated trends of the
   current political scenario and voters' high expectations. This study
   investigates how political brand identification, political brand
   relationship investment, political brand relationship quality, and
   psychological contract violation influence voter citizenship behavior.
   Currently, the literature examining the effects of these factors on
   voter citizenship behavior, in conjunction with psychological contract
   violation, is fairly sparse. Using a sample set of 520 Indonesian
   voters, the study was able to determine that the political brand
   relationship quality has the strongest impact on voter citizenship
   behavior, followed by the political brand identification and political
   brand relationship investment. Further results imply that a
   psychological contract violation is not directly related to voter
   citizenship behavior but that it does significantly moderate the
   relationship between the political brand relationship investment and
   voter citizenship behavior. This research adds new insights into the
   field of political marketing and provides strategic branding guidelines
   for politicians and others planning to implement political branding to
   build a relationship with voters.},

Abstract = {At the forefront of American democracy lies the representative. There
   has been ample debate over congressional representation and how members
   of Congress are to act in response to their constituents. We take on the
   task of assessing the path to congressional representation by analyzing
   eight institutional dimensions of representation during the founding. We
   uncover why term limits, recall, annual terms, small constituencies, and
   the right of instruction were rejected under the Constitution after they
   had been so highly regarded a short time earlier. The Federalists sought
   to promote their view of good representation through institutional
   design, rejecting prior views of representation used in state
   governments. Instead, the Constitution was designed to encourage
   representatives to serve according to their own judgment as trustees.
   This analysis contributes to our understanding of how institutions were
   created to shape representation and provides insight into the
   development of the electoral connection.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the public's involvement in the search for a nuclear
   waste repository in Germany in terms of the process's democratic quality
   and the institutional conditions of its success. It focuses on the
   initial phase of the search process, during which the ``final storage
   committee{''} received input from various citizen participation forums.
   The study shows how institutional complexity, high normative standards,
   and well-designed coordination mechanisms can aid in moderating the
   classic weaknesses of participatory procedures-selectivity and lack of
   impact. Based on input-oriented democratic theory, participatory
   governance, deliberation, and negotiation studies in particular, the
   study questions the usefulness of random choice and discusses the
   targeted selection of affected groups as an alternative mode of
   participant selection. It also presents mechanisms of aggregation and
   transmission that can contribute to integrating societal voices and
   embedding them into the political process.},

Abstract = {The 2018-19 Commonwealth House of Representatives franking credits
   inquiry demonstrates the problems that can occur when public engagement
   in parliamentary processes is facilitated by parliamentarians acting
   with political motivations, rather than by the Parliamentary service,
   which fulfils an administrative mandate. The committee chair used a
   partisan third-party website to collect submissions and register
   attendees for public hearings, resulting in a high level of
   participation, but causing damage to public perceptions of the committee
   and the Parliament, at a time when Parliaments are struggling to rebuild
   trust. This paper looks firstly at what constitutes effective public
   engagement, through the theoretical lenses of participatory and
   deliberative democracy. It then draws on the work of theorists John
   Rohr, John Uhr and others to argue that that facilitating effective and
   ethical public engagement in committee inquiries is work best done by
   parliamentary departments (administrators, rather than politicians),
   many of which have yet to fully embrace this role.},

Title = {Rejecting representation? Party systems and popular support for
   referendums in Europe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Under what conditions do citizens favor deciding political issues by
   popular vote? Models of support for popular vote processes usually
   consider the influence of individual attitudes such as political trust
   and interest in politics. But much less is known about the effect of
   institutional variables on support for popular vote processes. This
   article builds on research showing that disaffection with elected
   officials shapes support for referendums by considering the influence of
   the party system. First, an analysis of multilevel data from twenty-four
   European democracies indicates that individuals are more supportive of
   referendums in countries with fewer effective political parties. Second,
   a mediation analysis provides evidence that the number of parties
   influences referen-dum support through individual-level political trust
   and external efficacy. Where there are fewer viable parties, feelings
   that elected officials are unresponsive tend to increase popular support
   for referendums. These findings suggest a trade-off between available
   representation by political parties and support for direct influence
   over public policy.},

Abstract = {What explains election turnout in authoritarian regimes? Despite the
   significant energy, resources, and time ruling parties devote to
   improving the participation rates of citizens, there exists
   extraordinary variation both within and across authoritarian regimes.
   This paper hypothesizes that election turnout is explained by
   contes-tation, coercion and clientelism. To test this theory, the paper
   uses an original dataset capturing turnout rates for 548 legislative
   elections in 108 countries between 1960 and 2011. The resulting
   empirical analysis confirms these Hypothesis - with one notable
   exception. Instead of encouraging turnout amongst citizens, clientelism
   discourages it. This counterintuitive finding occurs because citizens
   lack the optimum incentives for participation and ruling parties lack
   effective monitoring strategies of that behavior. The conclusion of the
   paper addresses its implications for existing theories of authoritarian
   politics and proposes several avenues for further research on election
   turnout under authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects across the world, yet
   different countries have had varying degrees of success in their
   attempts to manage it. One of the reasons behind the different outcomes
   observed so far lies in the strengths and weaknesses of different
   governance arrangements leveraged to tackle the crisis. In this article
   we examine what we can learn about the operational capacity of different
   democracies through their early responses to the crisis. We provide a
   framework of four positive qualities of multilevel governance that might
   lead to greater chances of positive practical outcomes and present an
   illustrative case study of the experiences of Switzerland and the United
   Kingdom (UK). We conclude with some areas for further research and
   investigation.},

Abstract = {Arms procurement highlights tensions within British industrial policy.
   Once seen as an economic sanctuary to be preserved in the name of
   `strategy', in the 1980s, it became a symbol of neoliberalization.
   However, how can contemporary procurement in the UK be characterized? To
   answer this question, this article analyses `political work' carried out
   by politicians, bureaucrats and military officers within the MoD and
   DE\&S, the state agency in charge of defence equipment and support since
   2006. Beyond the protectionist/liberalized dichotomy, our documentary,
   interview and lexical analysis reveals the development of a new policy
   frame that we label `value management'. We first show how the issue of
   procurement has been reproblematized around the term `capability' to
   provide a new set of regulatory organizing principles and social
   relations. The way in which this frame has been equipped with managerial
   and policy instruments is then analysed. Finally, we show how this
   `problem' and these instruments have been legitimized in a way that
   transcends the polar opposites of neoliberal cost-cutting and
   interventionist industrial policy. Overall, we conclude that `value
   management' is currently proposing the basis for a new British defence
   consensus.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has shown the world that public policies tend to benefit the
   most privileged among us, and innovation policy is no exception. While
   the US government's approach to innovation-research funding and patent
   policies and programs that value scientists' and private sector
   freedoms-has been copied around the world due to its apparent success, I
   argue that it has hurt poor and marginalized communities. It has limited
   our understanding of health disparities and how to address them, and
   hampered access to essential technologies due to both lack of
   coordination and high cost. Fair and equal treatment of vulnerable
   citizens requires sensitive and dedicated policies that attend
   explicitly to the fact that the benefits of innovation do not simply
   trickle down.},

Abstract = {This short article discusses how the COVID-19 crisis has affected
   solidarity. It starts by defining solidarity in such a way that it can
   be distinguished from other types of support and pro-social practice,
   and by arguing that solidarity can manifest itself at three different
   levels: at the inter-personal level, the group level, or at the level of
   legal and contractual norms. Drawing upon findings from two ongoing
   studies on personal and societal effects of the COVID-19 crisis, I then
   go on to argue that, while forms of inter-personal solidarity have been
   shifting even during the first weeks and months of the crisis, the
   importance of institutionalized solidarity is becoming increasingly
   apparent. The most resilient societies in times of COVID-19 have not
   been those with the best medical technology or the strictest pandemic
   containment measures, but those with good public infrastructures and
   other solidaristic institutions.},

Abstract = {The irruption of the Covid-19 pandemic on the world stage generated
   unknowns, marches and counter marches both in the scientific and
   communicational fields. The traditional model of scientific
   dissemination, based on the transmission of proven results, in some
   cases became insufficient to account for the communication processes
   required during those months. The new coronavirus presented unique
   characteristics for whose treatment and cure there were no medications
   or vaccines, and the communication of the investigations made visible
   the progress along with its controversies and debates. The work raises
   the reflections generated from the need to communicate sciences from a
   dialogic perspective with society and from the public university in a

Abstract = {American local government financing shifted from taxation toward user
   fees and charges (UFCs) in the late 1970s, with substantial efficiency
   and equity implications. Normatively, the shift aligns with the benefit
   principle; positively, the shift is often attributed to tax revolts. We
   test the two associations via a difference-in-differences design and a
   fiscal stringency measure of tax and expenditure limitations (TELs); we
   also test the moderating effects of overrides on TELs. Our results
   confirm that state-imposed TELs caused the shift in local public
   finance; the results are robust to change of sample and empirical
   strategy. This article helps explain the relationship between tax
   revolts and non-tax revenue and provides evidence that fiscal
   constraints imposed by a higher level government on a constituent level
   can have significant effects, including effects beyond the intent of the
   constraints' framers.},

Abstract = {Democratic governments have argued that their ability to counter hybrid
   threats-threats that come from irregular agents such as violent
   extremists, criminal networks, and cyber attackers-depends on their
   ability to monitor all forms of online communication. This presents a
   conundrum for democratic citizens: either governments surveil their
   communications or they risk endangering the security of their societies.
   To assess the tradeoffs people make between freedom, privacy, and
   security, we analyze survey data from seven NATO countries in Europe to
   assess whether, to what extent, and why European citizens are willing to
   trade privacy for security. We find that women (rather than men) and the
   internationalists (rather than the nationalists) are the people who most
   sharply draw a distinction between targeted surveillance, which is
   acceptable to them, and blanket surveillance, which is not. We also find
   that favorable views of the United States and confidence in President
   Obama make European citizens more willing to support US surveillance
   programs targeting not only terrorist suspects but also ordinary people
   and their political leaders. Pro-US attitudes may ease US statecraft,
   but they do not necessarily foster a healthy balance between freedom and
   security in the age of asymmetric threats.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {32-61},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {In Power Without Knowledge, Jeffrey Friedman develops a critique of
   technocracy and in doing so makes an epistemic case for exit over voice.
   He argues that a technocracy that fails to take people's ideational
   heterogeneity into account is unlikely to possess the knowledge required
   to solve social problems, and that the alternative of ``exitocracy{''}
   may, in some cases, overcome these limits. By creating the conditions
   under which individuals can exit from undesirable social situations, an
   exitocracy may allow people to escape their social ills without knowing
   their society-wide causes or solutions. As Friedman recognizes, however,
   an exitocracy still requires technocratic knowledge, and this paper
   explores these requirements in further detail. First, it investigates
   the limits of exit as a solution to social problems, and the extent to
   which technocratic policies can be substituted for exit. Second, it
   considers the need for technocratic knowledge in the promotion of exit
   opportunities, and how this undermines Friedman's defense of exitocracy.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1152-1167},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Much attention is paid to how mechanisms for selecting political
   officials shape which types of officials hold positions of power, but
   selection procedures do not always produce the desired outcomes. In the
   context of the judiciary, many expected ``merit{''} selection procedures
   to facilitate the selection of women justices to the bench, an
   expectation that has not been realized. Applying theories of procedural
   fairness to judicial selection procedures, I argue that observers'
   beliefs that merit selection procedures are more ``fair{''} (relative to
   unilateral selection procedures) makes observers more accepting of
   all-male benches. Survey experimental evidence demonstrates that
   respondents do perceive merit selection procedures as more fair than
   gubernatorial selection procedures, a priori. In turn, respondents are
   less critical of all-male courts when judges are selected through a
   merit selection procedure. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of the ways in which (1) selection institutions shape
   prospects for gender diversity, (2) institutional design can have
   unintended consequences, and (3) procedural fairness can obscure
   accountabilituy for suboptimal outcomes.},

Abstract = {In recent years, data structures in political science have changed and
   are now more diverse. Social media and digital trace data broaden the
   set of sources and the methodological portfolio in the social sciences.
   Here, we review and summarize these recent developments in the context
   of teaching political science methods. We argue that (i) teaching
   methods should be more connected to theoretical and substantive
   questions. Further, (ii) this should take place in the format of project
   seminars, which allows students to conduct independent research. Through
   new data sources, (iii) students are able to follow the entire research
   process - from generating data to analyzing the information. Only parts
   of the learning will take place in typical classroom teaching; (iv)
   programming skills will be supplemented through e-learning elements. The
   high focus on active learning elements and individual learning speed
   should raise the interest for quantitative methods among students of
   political science.},

Title = {What drives citizens' evaluation of democratic performance? The

   democracy},

Abstract = {Alongside citizens' belief in the legitimacy of democracy, public
   support for the political regime is crucial to the survival of
   (democratic) political systems. Yet, we know fairly little about the
   relationship between citizens' democratic knowledge and their evaluation
   of democratic performance from a global comparative perspective. In this
   article, we argue that the cognitive ability of citizens to distinguish
   between democratic and authoritarian characteristics constitutes the
   individual yardstick for assessing democracy in practice. Furthermore,
   we expect that the effect of citizens' democratic knowledge on their
   evaluation of democratic performance is moderated by the institutional
   level of democracy. We test these assumptions by combining data from the
   sixth and seventh wave of the World Values Survey and the third
   pre-release of the European Values Study 2017, resulting in 114
   representative samples from 80 countries with 128,127 respondents.
   Applying multilevel regression modeling, we find that the higher a
   country's level of democracy, the more positive the effect of democratic
   knowledge on citizens' assessment of democratic performance. In
   contrast, we find that the lower the level of democracy in a country,
   the more negative the effect of citizens' democratic knowledge on their
   evaluation of democracy. Thus, this study shows that citizens who are
   more knowledgeable about democracy are most cognitively able to assess
   the level of democracy in line with country-level measures of democracy.
   These results open up new theoretical and empirical perspectives for
   related research on support for and satisfaction with democracy as well
   as research on democratization.},

Abstract = {In the European context, the Commission is responsible for monitoring
   and enforcing states' compliance with EU legislation. However, the
   Commission often entrusts external actors to monitor and assess
   implementation. To what extent does the Commission withhold, partially
   or fully disclose compliance assessments? Drawing on reputational
   accounts of bureaucratic performance, it is expected that the Commission
   is confronted with competing incentives. On the one hand, the Commission
   needs to justify enforcement decisions based on expert evaluations. On
   the other hand, disseminating information about non-compliance could
   exacerbate relations with the member states and threatens to damage the
   Commission's unique reputation as the main guardian of the EU treaties.
   Employing a novel data-set on the transparency of compliance
   assessments, it is found that the Commission discloses compliance
   assessments prepared by highly competent external actors only partially.

Abstract = {Populism is everywhere in Europe today: in politics and in research.
   Most research on populism has neglected the relationship between gender
   equality and populism. The aim of this symposium is precisely to
   scrutinize the relationship between feminist politics and right-wing and
   left-wing populist parties in Europe. The contribution of the symposium
   is twofold: to empirically investigate the relationship between feminist
   politics and both left and right populism, so as to provide a more
   holistic picture of their impact on feminist politics; and to study
   populist political parties both at the national level and at the level
   of the European Parliament. The symposium demonstrates the centrality of
   gender issues in the politics of populist parties and documents the
   effects populism has on gender relations, gender equality policies, and
   feminist politics.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the debate on contemporary political
   theory, a baseline for how to live together within diversity settings,
   by incorporating interculturalism into the normative theorizing of
   citizenship. Interculturalism's nuclear philosophy lies in privileging
   people-to-people relations, and hence for a micro-identity politics. I
   will focus interculturalism as a strategy for citizenship-making and
   place-making policy with a pro-active defining feature, which transforms
   diversity into a public good. Following the identity citizenship
   politics, I will defend that conceptually it is better grounded within
   the republican normative tradition. After reviewing the intersection of
   interculturalism and citizenship, I will dig into republicanism, and
   especially its involvement in turning public spaces into public
   diversity-contact settings. My final intention is to exentuate the
   potential these public spaces have to become hubs for the promotion of
   intercultural citizenship. At the end this will help me to argue for a
   republican normativity of intercultural citizenship.},

Abstract = {In 2014, Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly (NCA) almost
   unanimously approved the country's first democratic constitution despite
   significant identity-based divisions. Drawing on the Tunisian case, the
   article explores the role of an inclusive constitution-making process in
   fostering constitutional agreement during democratization. Emerging
   studies that link different process modalities to democracy have so far
   brought only limited illumination to how inclusive processes matter, nor
   were these propositions systematically tested. Using process tracing,
   and building on original interviews gathered in Tunisia between 2014 and
   2020, this article traces a causal mechanism whereby an inclusive
   constitution-making process allowed for a transformation of
   interpersonal relationships between political rivals. It demonstrates
   that more than two years of regular interactions allowed NCA deputies to
   shatter some of the prejudices that initially separated especially
   Islamist and non-Islamist partisans and develop cross-partisan ties,
   thus facilitating constitutional negotiations. However, I argue that the
   way these transformations contributed to constitutional settlement is
   more subtle than existing theories envisaged, and suggest alternative
   explanations. The article contributes to the debate about
   constitution-making processes by unpacking the understudied concept of
   partisan inclusion and applying it empirically to trace its effects on
   constitutional agreement, bringing precision and nuance to current
   assumptions about its benefits.},

Abstract = {This project investigates how voters hold government electorally
   accountable for perceived untrustworthiness, and particularly how this
   accountability is conditioned by institutional context. Studies show
   that political distrust is associated at least as much with attitudes
   toward the legislative branch as with attitudes toward the executive.
   With this in mind, I consider two contextual factors. First, whether a
   party that controls both branches of government may affect the degree to
   which its candidates face electoral accountability for distrust in
   government. Second, whether voters who are being asked to elect a
   representative to the legislative branch as opposed to the executive may
   affect which institution's ruling party is more likely to be held
   accountable. I analyze these relationships using survey data from the
   American National Election Study covering over half a century. The
   results demonstrate that institutional context conditions both when and
   whom voters hold accountable for their distrust in government.},

Abstract = {We develop and estimate a model of learning that accounts for the
   observed correlation between economic development and democracy and for
   the clustering of democratization events. In our model, countries' own
   and neighbors' past experiences shape elites' beliefs about the effects
   of democracy on economic growth and their likelihood of retaining power.
   These beliefs influence the choice to transition into or out of
   democracy. We show that learning is crucial to explaining observed
   transitions since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, our model
   predicts reversals to authoritarianism if the world experienced a growth

Abstract = {The rise in support for anti-political-establishment parties (APEp),
   especially since the beginning of the 2008 Great Recession, has put
   democracy in peril. Some scholars have warned us about the negative
   implications the recent rise of APEp might have for the development of
   democracy in Western Europe. For that reason, it is important we begin
   to understand what generates APEp's electoral success. Drawing on a new
   comparative dataset that examines all Western European democracies from
   1849 until 2017, the current article attempts to provide an explanation.
   In particular, our analyses examine three alternative explanations put
   forward by the literature: economic, institutional, and sociological.
   Our results show that it is not economic performance but both
   institutional and sociological change which together can help to
   understand the current wave of support for APEp.},

Abstract = {Intergroup relations are fundamentally based on the idea of `us' and
   `them', and this categorization has driven political loyalties and
   social ties in India, particularly the relations between Hindus and
   Muslims. Contemporary nationalist politics have often combined patriotic
   love for the country along with suspicion of minorities, particularly
   the Muslims. Given the history of tense relations between the Hindus and
   Muslims, the role of positive intergroup relations becomes paramount in
   sustaining peace among the groups. Based on Allport's intergroup contact
   hypothesis, this article tests whether having a Muslim friend reduces
   prejudicial attitude among Hindus. Additionally, the article also tests
   the notion of education being a harbinger of liberal values and its role
   in reducing prejudice. The results indicate that having a Muslim friend
   is significantly correlated with a more positive outlook towards the
   Muslim community, but education does not reduce prejudice.},

Abstract = {This article aims to connect cognitive and institutional theories to
   explain how policies evolve. Because of the limits to the model proposed
   by cognitive theories, the article shows that this framework can be
   complemented with the model of institutional change proposed by
   historical institutionalism theories. Therefore, it centers on the
   dynamics of change beyond theories based on critical junctures or
   exogenous shocks, focusing on continuities rather than changes. The
   study is based on two policy change case studies-tax policy in Brazil,
   and environmental policies in Chile. We suggest a model that can explain
   gradual cognitive changes by proposing two different forms of policy
   change: ideational anchorage and cognitive layering.},

Abstract = {A major contradiction in party research is between the saliency theory
   and the logic of issue convergence, or what is often referred to as
   issue avoidance vs. engagement. Extant research shows that parties both
   emphasize only their own issues and engage each other's issues. This
   study addresses this contradiction and argues that both perspectives
   have merits. The key to unlocking the puzzle is to unwind the electoral
   cycle. As far as possible into the electoral cycle, parties apply a
   long-term strategy and talk past each other. Yet, as the election draws
   closer, parties realize that they cannot change the agenda and therefore
   switch to a short-term strategy to engage rival parties' issues. This
   argument is tested across multiple issues on a new dataset consisting of
   19,350 press releases issued by the political parties in Denmark during
   several election cycles, 2004-2019.},

Abstract = {How do different kinds of democratic backsliding affect opposition
   pushback? To contribute to the answer, this article compares two
   divergent cases in the Asia-Pacific - ``executive aggrandizement{''} in
   the Philippines and a ``promissory{''} military coup in Thailand. An
   institutional explanation focused on remaining electoral, state
   institutional, and civil societal forms of democratic accountability
   despite autocratization does not elucidate significant variations in
   pushback. In the Philippines, elections have been fairer, state
   institutions less obviously manipulated and restrictions on civil
   society less overt. But opposition pushback has been significantly
   weaker than in Thailand despite more generalized repression and
   institutional manipulation there. An alternative explanation examines
   how opposition pushback is influenced by regimes' efforts to legitimize
   autocratization. Thailand's military-monarchical rulers had little
   success in framing recent elections as democratic while legitimacy
   linked to the monarchy has also eroded. This has catalysed the formation
   of a broad civilian opposition alliance, with strong parties, regular
   protests and critical social media. By contrast, while the Philippines'
   Rodrigo Duterte acts illiberally, he claims continued democratic
   legitimacy based on competitive elections and high opinion ratings while
   ruling largely constitutionally. This has undermined electoral
   opposition and weakened civil society, with no sustained protests and
   activists out-{''}trolled{''} on social media.},

Abstract = {This article aims to delve deeper in the underexplored but critical role
   Arctic Council representations and visual images have played over its
   first 20 years of existence. Through a visual discourse narrative of
   Arctic Council publications and media platforms, the article will
   explore how the Artic Council's self-constructed visual narrative has
   evolved over the past two decades, moving from a primarily
   environmentally focused narrative in 1996 to one imbued with political
   legitimacy and power in 2016 through strategic communications. The
   research is multidisciplinary and lends its foundation to four areas of
   study: (i) international relations, power, and the esthetic turn; (ii)
   art history, identity, power, and iconography; (iii) the history and
   production of science visuals in the history and philosophy of science;
   and (iv) geography, imagined geographies, and border studies. While the
   research is positioned primarily in the first of these areas, the
   so-called Esthetic Turn of International Relations, its analysis rests
   at the nexus of all four. By offering an analysis of 20 years of the
   strategic visual communication of the Arctic Council, this article aims
   to fill a gap in current scholarship with a case study of strategic
   communication strategies in visual imagery and political iconography in
   perceptions of Northern governance.},

Abstract = {Research on the 1932-1934 famine in the Soviet Union (or Famine) has
   reached the point where some analytical and theoretical synthesis is
   needed. We present a framework that provides a structure for organizing
   demographic research of the Famine within a broader
   demographic-historical context. Elements of the framework are: (a)
   definitions of critical concepts (Famine, Holodomor, Famine losses); (b)
   population reconstruction methodology as a basis for estimating Famine
   losses; (c) a formal structure that facilitates comparative research of
   the Famine among different subpopulations; (d) elements of an integrated
   demographic-historical research strategy; (e) recommendations for
   quantification in historical research. The presentation of the framework
   is preceded by: (a) examples of the versatility of the population
   reconstruction methodology; (b) analysis of what is probably a unique
   characteristic of the Famine, i.e. the surge in rural mortality during
   the first half of 1933 in regions of Ukraine and Russia, resulting in
   about seventy to eighty per cent of all Famine losses concentrated in
   that period; (c) formulation of an analytical model of this surge as an
   example of an application of the framework. We show significant
   differences in the rural mortality surges between Ukraine and Russia,
   e.g.: (a) in two oblasts of Ukraine the number of losses in June 1933 is
   fourteen to fifteen times higher than in January of that year, compared
   to a maximum factor of eight in only one region of Russia; (b) the
   average number of daily losses at the peak of the Famine in Ukraine,
   June 1933, is 28,000, while the respective number in Russia is 12,000 in
   July 1933. Standardizing by population size, we have 12.4 daily losses
   per 1,000 population in Ukraine and 1.4 in Russia. Several examples
   illustrate the advantages of a collaborative demographic-historical
   research strategy.},

Abstract = {Although the Holodomor figures prominently in contemporary Ukrainian
   historical research, the lived experiences of the victims have attracted
   insufficient scholarly attention. In 1932-33, adult females were often
   left with no means of subsistence while holding full responsibility for
   the survival of their families. This study explores the efforts of
   mothers to ensure their children's sustenance and the various methods
   they employed to procure food in starving villages. A range of
   strategies deployed by mothers on behalf of their starving children is
   examined. This article also explores controversial aspects of maternal
   experiences under genocidal circumstances: some mothers were totally
   committed to their children's survival, some renounced their maternal
   duties in the hope of saving their offspring, while other mothers
   preferred to save their own lives at any cost. The Holodomor proved to
   be an extraordinary challenge to normative ideas and practices of
   mothering and ultimately undermined the myth of an unconditional,
   selfless mothering instinct. Scholarship on Jewish women's experiences
   of the Holocaust provides important insights and points to significant
   commonalities (despite obvious differences) of women's survival
   strategies in the context of a genocidal event.},

Abstract = {The extant literature suggests that members choose committees for
   distributive reasons and seek more prestigious committees as they move
   up the seniority ranks. But why do some members chose committees like
   Rules and Judiciary which are not distributive in nature? I claim that
   committees also offer representational benefits: namely, the ability to
   signal ideological preferences to constituents. Members from moderate
   districts seek out committees with jurisdictions over consensual issues,
   while members from extreme districts prefer committees with highly
   partisan jurisdictions. Using a unique dataset of committee partisanship
   constructed from committee roll-call votes, I show that members are more
   likely to select ideologically congruent committees and more likely to
   leave noncongruent committees, though this relationship is conditioned
   by the distributive value of the committee. This research has
   implications for committee selection and theories of legislative
   organization by demonstrating that committees offer ideological
   representation benefits as well as distributive ones.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the successful Conservative election campaign of
   2019 and how it took advantage of a fractured political and economic
   landscape. It reviews the unique circumstances around the 2019 election
   and the `surprising death' of a no-deal Brexit. We then analyse the
   divergent political communication strategies in the 2017 and 2019
   Conservative campaigns showing how the latter was much more coherent and
   politically unorthodox. Drawing on socioeconomic, demographic and
   British Election Study data, we argue that Boris Johnson's messaging was
   carefully tailored towards the demands of voters in the `red wall'
   seats. Conservative success was built around an appeal to voters in
   these economically depressed `geographies of discontent'. But while
   tremendously successful, the coalition this created is potentially
   fragile. An unconventional, `leftish' Conservative campaign built a new,
   diverse bloc of voters. It includes a number of left-wingers expecting
   change alongside traditional Conservative supporters, and will be hard
   to keep together given the economic turbulence ahead.},

Abstract = {Are people under economic stress more or less likely to vote, and why?
   With large observational datasets and a survey experiment involving
   unemployed Americans, we show that unemployment depresses participation.
   But it does so more powerfully when the unemployment rate is low, less
   powerfully when it is high. Whereas earlier studies have explained lower
   turnout among the unemployed by stressing the especially high
   opportunity costs these would-be voters face, our evidence points to the
   psychological effects of unemployment and of campaign messages about it.
   When unemployment is high, challengers have an incentive to blame the
   incumbent, thus eliciting anger among the unemployed. Psychologists have
   shown anger to be an approach or mobilizing emotion. When joblessness is
   low, campaigns tend to ignore it. The jobless thus remain in states of
   depression and self-blame, which are demobilizing emotions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the taxation legal framework applicable to the
   peer-to-peer lending platforms which manage projects that do not involve
   any kind of financial profitability. Given that there is an absence of
   specific regulations in this area, the study has been conducted by using
   as a starting point the two management models underlying the functioning
   of these kinds of platforms, as well as the functioning of the legal
   nature of their owners and the operations which they carry out. In this
   context, an analysis regarding the taxation of peer-to-peer lending
   platforms in area of direct and indirect taxes is made. The work also
   includes indications of the main legal problems that these platforms
   create. Finally, the article concludes with proposals as lex ferenda
   that may be useful for future regulations in this area.},

Abstract = {The pressures exerted by migrant workers' countries of origin, regional
   calls for migrant protection, and global initiatives have pushed the
   Malaysian government for labour reforms in line with International
   Labour Organization standards. A weak labour migration mechanism has led
   to human trafficking, debt bondage, and workers' exploitation. Since
   2018, Malaysia has concluded and renegotiated improved memoranda of
   understanding (MoUs) with countries of origin to address forced labour
   and human-trafficking. Reforming the recruitment system is formalised
   through government-togovernment agreements to eliminate agents, enhance
   ethical recruitment, and adopt a zero migration-cost model. The analysis
   shows that the newly negotiated MoUs are significant in tackling the
   issue of irregular migration in three aspects, by including a clause on
   repatriation, changing to the government recruitment model, and adopting
   the employer-pays model. This research utilises official documents,
   media statements, and secondary literature.},

Abstract = {In this study we focus on party organizational characteristics as key
   determinants of party congruence. We examine how the horizontal and
   vertical integration of parties is linked to representation in
   comparative perspective. We further focus on how congruence is achieved
   by detailing our expectation regarding effects on the uncertainty versus
   bias in the estimates of party constituents' opinion. Exploiting a
   comparative database on political parties and data from Comparative
   Studies of Electoral Systems, we show that having a complex
   organizational structure and being leadership dominated makes parties
   less representative of their constituencies. These findings carry
   important implications for the study of political representation but
   also for the literature on political parties in crisis.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to question the variation in standing
   committees' roles and impacts and to explore how the uniqueness of their
   constitutional role can obscure a variety of approaches and practices.
   The present study reflects on the diversity of these committees by
   examining the case of the French Senate. This article demonstrates that
   the heterogeneity of Senate committees may have consequences for the
   legislative process. Considering Parliament reform through a
   re-evaluation of the role of standing committees must therefore involve
   questioning committee differences. This article considers the different
   roles committees play in the Senate and examines their influence on the
   legislative process.},

Abstract = {Emergent forms of political protest and constitution often provide limit
   cases for their contemporary theoretical models, and transnational
   protest movements from Occupy to Democracy in Europe 2025 are no
   exception. The recent special issue of the Journal of International
   Political Theory offers a number of different conceptual paths towards
   understanding these developments, revising and refreshing categories
   like civil disobedience, opposition, resistance, as well as constituent
   and destituent power. However, the plurality of perspectives in the
   special issue leads to a certain degree of uncertainty in the use of
   terms. This response to the special issue begins with a reflection on
   its major conceptual developments, addresses the missed encounter with
   Giorgio Agamben's theory of `destituent potential' and develops a
   framework for contrasting different theoretical approaches to political
   protest and constitution through their relation to potentiality. This
   taxonomy of emergent forms of political protest and constitution
   complements the substantial theoretical developments undertaken in the
   special issue by making the important conceptual relationships between
   them more readily visible. As well, by demonstrating the applicability
   of potentiality to the study of International Relations, this framework
   contributes to the project of the theoretical investigation of
   international politics.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {As illustrated by the cases of white supremacists Dylan Roof and Robert
   Bowers, most ideological mass murderers in the US cannot be charged with
   any federal terrorism offence, even when their attacks clearly qualify
   as terrorism under federal law. Yet relatively minor offences committed
   to support a Foreign Terrorist Organisation can be charged as terrorism.
   Accordingly, nearly all those charged with terrorism are Muslim. This
   perverse result necessarily furthers Islamophobia and discourages
   vigilance against right-wing terrorism. To determine whether this
   imbalance exists in other jurisdictions, this article analyzes terrorism
   laws in all 50 US states and in 34 other countries. Results indicate
   that broad terrorism statutes, allowing any major crime fitting a
   general definition of terrorism to be charged as a terrorism offence,
   are extremely common (though not universal). The US government's
   approach is thus highly anomalous. In addition, exploratory data
   collection was conducted to investigate whether these statutes are in
   fact utilised to charge right-wing terrorists with terrorism offences. A
   number of cases are identified in which prosecutors (in 6 US states and
   12 countries) have charged right-wing terrorists with terrorism. The
   implications of these findings for theory and counterterrorism policy
   are explored},

Abstract = {How does electoral manipulation affect elected officials' willingness to
   satisfy their constituents? Although the literature has highlighted the
   role of elections as mechanisms of accountability, we do not know how
   elections whose integrity is compromised influence elected officials'
   actions in office. We present a model of accountability that allows for
   electoral manipulation and derive three results: (i) rent extraction
   increases with the level of electoral manipulation, (ii) the value of
   holding office is positively related to rent extraction for high values
   of office, and (iii) electoral manipulation increases with the value of
   office. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that exploits
   rules determining the sizes of polling stations in Colombia, we estimate
   a positive causal effect of vote buying on the likelihood of the
   election winner being sanctioned for violating the disciplinary code of
   public officials. Consistent with the theory, we find that higher values
   of office are not linked to fewer sanctions but are associated with more
   vote buying.},

Abstract = {Formal institutions in dictatorship are known to improve authoritarian
   governance and promote power-sharing. Yet institutions also act as tools
   of information propagation and can be used by autocrats for signaling
   purposes. In this article, I argue that in times of weakness, dictators
   follow an expand-and-signal strategy, expanding the ruling coalition to
   decrease the relative power of coup plotters and then create visible
   formal institutions to signal strong support. Doing so decreases (1) the
   probability that a coup is launched and (2) that one succeeds if staged.
   I propose a formal model to unpack the mechanisms of my argument and use
   the case of the Dominican Republic during Rafael Trujillo's rule to
   illustrate my theory.},

   Democratic presidential nominations},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the modern era of US presidential nominations, every election cycle
   we witness around 20\% change in delegate selection system types. This
   variance remains unexplained and for the most part unexplored. At the
   same time, prior formal and empirical models offer contradicting
   expectations of party leader behavior in their choice of system. This
   paper looks to bridge this divide. We argue state party leaders use
   delegate selection systems to select candidates favorable to their own
   ideological position. When the median partisan is ideologically left
   relative to the position of state Democratic leaders, the leaders of the
   Party will open up the delegate selection system to dilute the voices
   furthest on the left. We employ maximum likelihood estimation as a
   method to show that left positioning of citizens relative to state
   Democratic leaders increases the likelihood the state Democratic Party
   will use a primary system as opposed to a caucus.},

Abstract = {We empirically identify the considered views of the Northern Ireland
   public on the relative merits of two possible models of a united
   Ireland: an integrated united Ireland in which Northern Ireland is
   absorbed into an all-island polity, and a united Ireland in which
   Northern Ireland continues to exist as a devolved entity. We use data
   from a specially designed one-day citizens' assembly. We report analyses
   based on quantitative examination of pre- and post-deliberation surveys
   and qualitative analysis of the transcripts of participants'
   deliberation. We find that, after learning about the different two
   models, citizens' support for the devolved model declined, particularly
   among Protestant participants. We elaborate the implications of our
   findings for any referendum on the constitutional future of Northern
   Ireland.},

Volume = {54},
Number = {6},
Pages = {923-955},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Vigilantism is theoretically and empirically important for political
   science, because it is closely related to core concepts like power,
   order, state-building, and collective action. Yet although political
   scientists are increasingly interested in vigilantism, our discipline
   has never developed a sustained, cumulative research agenda on
   vigilantism. I argue this is largely because existing definitions of
   vigilantism are contradictory, tautological, and not easily
   operationalized. This article cuts through the conceptual muddle,
   equipping and motivating political scientists to study vigilantism.
   First, I define vigilantism as the extralegal prevention, investigation,
   or punishment of offenses. Next, I provide a crisp conceptualization of
   vigilantism, and I situate vigilantism in relation to other concepts in
   political science. I conclude by addressing methodological and ethical
   issues in the study of vigilantism.},

Abstract = {In this article, I undertake an ideology critique of reforms to the
   English NHS within the neo-liberal era. The critique draws primarily on
   the writings of the Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor Adorno. I use
   the method of ideology critique to explain the influences on and reasons
   for the reforms, the contradictions in government discourse and policy
   and the potential reifying effects of the reforms. I also use the method
   as a basis for conceiving alternatives. Adorno thought that ideology was
   becoming more positivistic, thereby rendering critique more difficult. I
   identify both liberal and positivistic elements within the discourse of
   successive governments pertaining to healthcare. Liberal norms (such as
   freedom and equality) within government discourse, and the law,
   concerning healthcare, continue to enable the critique of ideology and
   are a basis for conceiving alternatives to current neo-liberal policies,
   which have the potential to reify healthcare and undermine the
   solidarity underpinning the NHS.},

Abstract = {In the past decade Bangladesh has witnessed incremental, yet
   consequential decline of democracy. Two consecutive rigged elections in
   2014 and 2018, adoption of legal measures to restrict freedom of
   expression, increasing occurrences of extrajudicial killings and
   allegations of infringing on the judiciary bear testimony to the
   democratic backsliding. This article traces the pathway of this
   backsliding. As Bangladesh's democratic journey began two decades after
   its independence, this article focuses on the post-1990 development with
   special reference to the rapid debilitation of the democratic
   institutions and practices after Bangladesh Awami League (AL) came to
   power in 2009. I argue that the country has transformed from an
   electoral democracy to an electoral authoritarianism. Drawing on the
   stages of democratic backsliding offered by Steven Levitsky and Danile
   Ziblatt, this article shows that the process of backsliding in
   Bangladesh began with the constitutional amendment in 2011, followed by
   severe persecution of the opposition, critics of the incumbent and media
   through legal and extralegal measures and taming the judiciary.},

Abstract = {We explain the referendums on British membership of the European
   Communities and European Union from a principal-agent perspective
   between the Prime Minister and the rank-and-file. We show that
   announcing a referendum on the Prime Minister's membership proposal
   helps the incumbent party to win the general election when the
   rank-and-file is divided on the terms of membership. When the Prime
   Minister overcomes the rank-and-file's mistrust of her effectiveness in
   negotiating new membership terms with other member states, the voters
   are more likely to follow her proposal. However, when intra-party
   controversies reveal principal-agent problems, the initially uninformed
   voters can learn about the dysfunctionality of the terms and are more
   likely to reject the Prime Minister's proposal.},

Title = {Understanding public constructions of counter-terrorism: an analysis of

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse how lay members of the public
   conceptualised security politics in France within the context of the
   two-year-long state of emergency implemented after the Paris attack in
   November 2015. Building upon research on everyday narratives of
   security, this article examines the online comments written by readers
   of two major French newspapers on what should be done to counter
   terrorism. It first investigates the narratives constructed by the
   measures and policies they put forward, and second, whether the duration
   of the state of emergency affected them and, if so, how. It reveals the
   dominant conceptualisation of security as disciplining and taming the
   national body, with the Muslim migrant other and liberties the central
   elements to neutralise, and finds that this stance hardened over the
   period. This article argues that in challenging their authorities to go
   much further in their fight against terrorism, online readers not only
   legitimated their security discourse but also facilitated the existence
   of political subjects for the purpose of governmental logics, paving the
   way for authoritarian-driven and unfettered state power.},

Abstract = {Do we need a theory of urban justice? If so, what desiderata would such
   a theory have to meet? This paper makes a programmatic point, namely,
   that urban justice is a field of political philosophy in its own right,
   and that the recognition-theoretical approach is capable of expressing
   what is at stake there. A revised version of Axel Honneth's theory of
   recognition meets the three desiderata of a theory of urban justice:
   relationality, spatiality and diversity. Whereas justice-related
   questions on the domestic level typically refer to the basic structure
   of society-concerning issues of basic rights and wealth distribution-on
   the city level such questions are concentrated mainly on the way urban
   space is organized. Ultimately, what is at stake is to articulate a
   vision of the city as an embodiment of human space; a space that is
   structured in such a way that it meets the demands for recognition. The
   paper tests if the framework is capable of expressing the key moral
   challenges of two justice-related issues of contemporary cities, namely,
   segregation and gentrification.},

Abstract = {Are more politically knowledgeable registered voters more likely to cast
   their ballots prior to Election Day when given an option to do so? We
   argue that individuals with high political knowledge are more likely to
   take advantage of convenience voting opportunities because they have
   command over static-general facts, enabling them to make informed
   choices when voting. Drawing on five Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study (CCES) pre- and post-election national surveys and an original
   survey of registered voters in Florida conducted in 2017, we test if
   political knowledge affects the method of voting. Estimating a series of
   multinomial logistic regression models with fixed-effects for voters
   registered in American states that permit convenience voting, and
   controlling for socio-economic, political, and campaign effects, we find
   that voters with greater static-general political knowledge are more
   likely to vote early, and those with low political knowledge are more
   likely to wait until Election Day to cast their ballot.},

Abstract = {Francis Lieber (1800-1872), professor at South Carolina College and
   Columbia College, New York City, spent his career grappling with the
   nature of political organization. A German emigre, Lieber's political
   theory of the state grew around a critique of social contract theory,
   which he believed fostered a ``Gallican liberty{''} prone to
   centralization and democratic absolutism. He contrasted this tradition
   with one premised on a healthy ``Anglican liberty{''} that diffused
   power through societal institutions and cooperative government
   structures. This transatlantic perspective informed Lieber's response to
   the primary threats confronting the American political system at
   midcentury: Calhounite states' rights theory and Democrats' amoral
   understanding of ``popular sovereignty,{''} both of which opened the
   door for slavery's expansion. Preserving institutional liberty and the
   Union led Lieber to a full-throated defense of the United States as an
   organic nation-state capable of squashing secession and advancing
   civilization and freedom through constitutional reform and international
   law.},

Abstract = {Why do young people choose to identify with a political party? While
   existing accounts emphasize the importance of political socialization,
   we propose that young people's self-perceptions also influence the
   adoption of partisan identities. Using survey data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we show that self-esteem plays an
   important role in the development of partisanship among young people,
   where those with higher self-esteem are more likely to adopt a partisan
   identity than those with low self-esteem. Using responses from the
   2012-2013 American National Election Study, we further show that the
   effects of self-esteem are concentrated among young adults, promoting
   the adoption of partisan identities during one's impressionable years.
   By focusing on the inheritance of partisanship from one's parents,
   scholars have underestimated the importance of young people's traits in
   influencing the development of partisan identities.},

Abstract = {The importance of mutual learning between providers and recipients of
   development assistance has been emphasised for decades. Nevertheless,
   its practical implementation remains limited, primarily due to
   organisational issues and unequal power relations in development aid.
   Using the `design-thinking' approach, this study demonstrates the
   possibility of mutual learning utilising the example of the Swiss Red
   Cross and the Village Health Committees in the Kyrgyz Republic. Based on
   the related project documentation and interviews with relevant partners,
   this article provides an insight into the factors enabling mutual
   learning in practice. It suggests that decentralisation of the
   organisation, its leadership and response to failures, continuous
   contact between provider and recipient of development assistance, and
   emphasis on local expertise contribute to learning. Although
   context-specific, these findings are essential to understanding the
   mutual learning in general and taking this phenomenon from theory to
   practice.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to ameliorate the conceptual ambiguities surrounding
   the concepts of race, racialisation, and racism within Critical
   Terrorism Studies (CTS), as well as encourage the use of these concepts.
   Race is a key signifier in counter-terrorism discourse, yet its meaning
   is often taken for granted or left unexplored in CTS. Hence, this
   article proposes definitions of race, racialisation, and racism that
   make the concepts into an analytical lens. In developing these
   definitions, it employs a marginally adapted version of Gerring's
   criterial framework for concept formation. The article argues that the
   core attributes of the concepts race, racialisation, and racism are: (A)
   their socially constructed nature; (B) categorisation of a group as the
   ``other{''}; (C) naturalisation; and (D) being concerned with
   community-like groups. The proposed definitions build on similarities
   and navigate differences in how the concepts are currently given meaning
   in CTS research. Considering that CTS is embedded in the context of
   9/11, the concepts of race, racialisation, and racism may help to place
   counter-terrorism discourses and practices in a broader historical and
   political context and analyse the justifications supporting these
   discourses.},

Abstract = {As Covid-19 spreads around the world, international actors, including
   the United Nations, have called for a stop to armed conflict to
   facilitate efforts to fight the pandemic. At the same time, coronavirus
   may also trigger and intensify armed conflict due to its negative
   economic consequences and by offering windows of opportunity to
   opposition movements to attack distracted and weakened incumbents. We
   use real-time data on the spread of Covid-19, governmental lockdown
   policies, and battle events to study the causal short-term effect of the
   pandemic on armed conflict. Our results suggest that both the spread of
   Covid-19 and lockdown policies exhibit a global Null effect with
   considerable regional heterogeneity. Most importantly, governmental
   lockdowns have increased armed conflict in the Middle East. In contrast,
   reported combat has decreased in Southeast Asia and the Caucasus as the
   pandemic has spread.},

Title = {Policy Preferences and Policy Legitimacy After Referendums: Evidence
   from the Brexit Negotiations},

Abstract = {How do votes in direct democratic ballots translate into policy
   preferences about future outcomes and affect the perceived legitimacy of
   those outcomes? This article examines these questions in the context of
   sovereignty referendums: specifically, the 2016 referendum on British
   membership of the European Union (EU). While the referendum result gave
   the British government a mandate for Britain leaving the EU, it did not
   provide any firm guidance as to the kind of Brexit that voters would
   prefer and consider legitimate. To examine the perceived desirability
   and legitimacy of different Brexit outcomes, we conducted a nationally
   representative conjoint experiment measuring attitudes towards different
   possible negotiation outcomes. Our findings show that `Leave' and
   `Remain' voters were highly divided over what they wanted from Brexit on
   salient negotiation issues, but also that most voters did not regard any
   possible outcome as legitimate.},

Abstract = {While affective conflict between partisans is driving much of modern
   politics, it is also driving increasing numbers to eschew partisan
   labels. A dominant theory is that these self-proclaimed independents are
   merely covert partisans. In the largest functional brain imaging study
   of neuropolitics to date, we find differences between partisans and
   nonpartisans in the right medial temporal pole, orbitofrontal/medial
   prefrontal cortex, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, three
   regions often engaged during social cognition. These results suggest
   that rather than being simply covert partisans, nonpartisans process the
   world in a way different from their partisan counterparts.},

Abstract = {TThe year 2018 marked the 30th anniversary of the 1988 Federal
   Constitution and the re-democratization in Brazil after the Military
   Dictatorship. This study proposes to critically analyze the
   re-democratization, based on some concepts of Carl Schmitt and Giorgio
   Agamben, in order to show the remains of the dictatorship - via
   authoritarian and exceptional apparatus - within the constitutional text
   itself. It is not a question of minimizing the advances introduced by
   the new constitutional text in 1988, especially in relation to the
   fundamental rights and guarantees introduced, but to seriously analyze
   the constitutional order through the bias of the exception and the
   problems caused by the inscription - and permanent use - of these
   institutes in the legal system. Under the perspective of a critical
   analysis of the constitutionalism, it's adopted a method of
   bibliographic research and conceptual analysis, showing how the
   Brazilian democracy is related to the dictatorship, following the same
   logic of operation.},

Title = {Echoes of a fading past: Authoritarian legacies and far-right voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, electoral support for the far-right has increased
   dramatically across the world. This phenomenon is especially acute in
   some new democracies; however, little attention has been devoted to the
   effects of the legacies of past authoritarian ideologies. We argue that
   the ideology of the past regime affects far-right support because voters
   that were politically socialized under authoritarianism will be biased
   against its ideological brand. To test this argument, we conduct an
   individual-level analysis across 20 countries between 1996 and 2018
   using a difference-in-difference estimation and a country-level analysis
   using data from 39 democracies between 1980 and 2018. We demonstrate
   that voters socialized under right-wing dictatorships are less likely to
   support far-right parties compared to citizens that were socialized
   under different circumstances. Moreover, support for far-right parties
   is significantly lower in countries that transitioned from right-wing
   autocracies. Findings are discussed in light of the contribution to the
   far-right movement literature.},

Title = {Random votes under compulsory voting: Evidence from Brazil},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Compulsory voting is known for boosting electoral turnout, even when
   sanctions for abstaining are small or loosely enforced. Much less is
   known, however, about the consequences of compulsory voting on vote
   choice, and, in particular, about the quality of electoral decisions. In
   this paper, we explore the extent to which voters meaningfully engage in
   the electoral process or simply vote randomly because voting is required
   by law. We conducted a large online survey in Brazil during the 2018
   national elections to assess if voters engage in random voting. We
   evaluate random voting for low-profile, low-information elected offices
   (state and federal legislators) and others that receive greater media
   coverage (governor and president) and evaluate the determinants of
   random voting for each of them. We find that: 1) random voting does not
   appear to be affected by social desirability bias; 2) there is
   substantial random voting under compulsory voting; 3) more voters tend
   to engage in random voting in low-profile, low-information elections, as
   compared to elections that receive greater media coverage; and, 4)
   interest in politics, education, and disposition to vote if voting were
   to be voluntary reduce random voting. Our findings carry important
   implications for the study of citizen participation and civic competence
   under compulsory voting and for democratic representation, more broadly.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the factors that led to the victory of Peronism in
   2019 general elections. We conduct a descriptive analysis arguing that
   the economic prior context and party cohesion were the determinant
   factors that allowed Peronism to regain the presidency and legislative
   majority. In this way, the poor economic results of President Macri in
   the year before the election weakened his chances for reelection, giving
   Peronism an opportunity to build an electorally competitive coalition in
   which Kirchner and non-Kirchner sectors converged. The challenge for the
   new Peronist government is economic recovery in a context of volatility
   and potential conflicts within the government coalition.},

Abstract = {Latin American democracies have developed institutions to empower
   citizens against the state. This article brings attention to an often
   overlooked, but key, actor in these processes: the legal complex. I
   argue that the content of reforms designed to strengthen the rule of law
   partially reflects the interests of politically influential collective
   legal actors. Political influence is defined as a function of alliances
   with civil society and embeddedness within decision-making arenas of the
   state. To develop this argument, the article analyses the slow building
   of Brazil's Public Defenders' Office (PDO). I argue that the office's
   initial institutional weakness resulted from defenders' fragile
   political position relative to that of prosecutors and the bar during
   Brazil's constitutional transition. Its eventual strengthening sixteen
   years later resulted from changes to the legal complex alliance in its
   favour, the formation of connections between defenders and civil
   society, and increased PDO access to policymaking spaces.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {44},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Are ambitious women punished in politics? Building on literature from
   negotiation, we argue that women candidates who are perceived to be
   ambitious are more likely to face social backlash. We first explore what
   the term `ambitious' means to voters, developing and testing a new
   multidimensional concept of perceived ambition, from desire to run for
   higher office to scope of agenda. We then test the link between these
   `ambitious' traits and voter support for candidates using five conjoint
   experiments in two countries, the U.S. and the U.K. Our results show
   that while ambitious women are not penalized overall, the aggregate
   results hide differences in taste for ambitious women across parties. We
   find that in the U.S. left-wing voters are more likely to support women
   with progressive ambition than right-wing voters (difference of 7\%
   points), while in the U.K. parties are not as divided. Our results
   suggest that ambitious women candidates in the U.S. face bias
   particularly in the context of non-partisan races (like primaries and
   local elections), when voters cannot rely on party labels to make
   decisions.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to examine factors determining Japanese
   citizens' attitudes toward nuclear armament. Previous studies have
   suggested that Japanese citizens have been strongly opposed to the idea
   of nuclear armament. However, this study questions the robustness of the
   anti-nuclear stance among the Japanese population. More specifically, I
   contend that ethnocentric tendencies among Japanese citizens
   significantly boost their support for nuclear armament. The statistical
   analysis relying on the survey data in Japan verifies this hypothesis.
   Findings from this study are essential in understanding the current
   discourse surrounding nuclear armament in Japan. Dissecting the process
   through which Japanese citizens develop their attitudes toward nuclear
   weapons, this study significantly advances our understanding of Japan's
   identity issues in the security arena.},

Abstract = {The global threat of the coronavirus pandemic has forced policy makers
   to react quickly with totally new policy-making approaches under
   conditions of uncertainty. This article focuses on such crisis-driven
   policy learning, examining how the experiences of China and South Korea
   as early responder states influenced the subsequent coronavirus crisis
   management in Germany. The first reaction of the German core executive
   was the quick concentration of decision-making power at the top of the
   political hierarchy. Asserting the prerogatives of the executive
   included the radical simplification of the relationship between
   politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by
   recourse to a single piece of legislation-the `infection protection law'
   (Infektionsschutzgesetz)-overriding other elements of the legal order.
   They also limited the government's use of scientific expertise to a
   small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the
   appropriateness or otherwise of the government's crisis measures.
   Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier
   Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition-namely public
   willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health-that is absent in the
   German case.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {599-652},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper investigates how social media affects general voting
   patterns. Unlike previous studies investigating whether citizens' use of
   social media affects political participation, this paper considers the
   connections that social media users have with political activists on
   social media, and how this connectedness influences general voting
   patterns, using data from Ghana. With contemporary theoretical
   perspectives and exploratory techniques, trends from past literature are
   presented, from a social media-based propagated survey with 420 valid
   responses. Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual
   model, which demonstrates that the connectedness with political and
   social media activists is significant and positively influences
   modifications in voting patterns. Online political participation and
   political affect also present an effect on voting patterns. The
   relationship between connections with social media political activists
   and online political participation is significant, as indicated by a
   strong covariance observed in the model. The results of the multigroup
   analysis also indicate some cultural and social issues to shape the
   phenomena for further investigation.},

Abstract = {The research aims to critically analyze the conception of religious
   freedom from Ronald Dworkin, focused on his work called Religion Without
   God. Dworkin treats religious freedom as a right to ethical
   independence, which includes atheists and agnostics. Despite the merits
   of his proposal, the author's view is insufficient to explain and safely
   justify the issue of religious freedom in the context of a democracy.
   The research is divided into four topics: begins with the presentation
   of the core elements of Dworkin's proposal on religious freedom;
   subsequently, it indicates the virtues of its comprehensive and
   inclusivist approach; in the third topic, proposes a caveat pointing out
   possible inconsistencies of the Dworkin's conception; in the last topic,
   contrasts Religion Without God with an approach by John Rawls. The
   method used is the deductive, based on bibliographical, doctrinal and
   legislative research. It concludes that Ronald Dworkin's conception of
   religious freedom, while comprehensive, including its atheists and
   agnostics, is insufficient for the proper protection of all religious
   expressions within a democracy.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although educational attainment is one of the strongest correlates of
   mass political participation, researchers disagree about whether it has
   a causal impact on voter turnout. One prominent theory proposes the
   observed correlation between higher educational attainment and political
   participation is spurious, largely reflecting early-life factors such as
   genetics, family resources, and parental values. To test this claim we
   analyze siblings in a longitudinal survey to control for the pre-adult
   environmental effects on official measures of turnout among older
   adults. We find some support for spurious effects of education,
   particularly in a midterm election where the most politically engaged
   individuals are mobilized. Because patterns of political engagement are
   formed in childhood, early-life experiences may be more influential in
   midterm elections where fewer stimuli and resources are present to
   mobilize voters.},

   civic-military actions as a strategy of the Military Forces, especially
   of the developmental line, who designed and applied it in the national
   territory. This strategies purposal was to restore institutional
   credibility on eyes of the population and mitigate the violence origins.
   However, it was not enough to solve the underlying problems of Colombian
   society since the other institutions were not interested or coordinated
   with this strategy. Even so, they became a pioneering and developmental
   strategy to address the social and economic challenges of different

Abstract = {Do ethnic civil wars cause people to identify in ethnic terms? This
   article reports findings from a framing experiment conducted with Syrian
   refugees in Lebanon that varies the description of their civil war in
   sectarian and nonsectarian terms. Consistent with research in other
   settings, baseline results show that majority and minority group members
   identify more frequently in national and subnational terms,
   respectively. Minorities respond strongly to the sectarian treatment but
   opposite the direction expected. Rather than boosting identification
   with their subnational groups, the sectarian treatment increases
   national identification among minorities. These findings suggest that we
   reconsider what identity entrepreneurs are trying to achieve when they
   frame conflicts around ethnicity and may call into question the extent
   to which their rhetoric can influence ordinary people.},

Abstract = {What explains the type of electoral campaign run by political parties?
   We provide a new perspective on campaigns that focuses on the strategic
   use of emotive language. We argue that the level of positive sentiment
   parties adopt in their campaigns depends on their incumbency status,
   their policy position, and objective economic conditions. We test these
   claims with a novel data set that captures the emotive language used in
   over 400 party manifestos across eight European countries. As predicted,
   we find that incumbent parties, particularly incumbent prime ministerial
   parties, use more positive sentiment than opposition parties. We find
   that ideologically moderate parties employ higher levels of positive
   sentiment than extremist parties. And we find that all parties exhibit
   lower levels of positive sentiment when the economy is performing poorly
   but that this negative effect is weaker for incumbents. Our analysis has
   important implications for research on campaign strategies and
   retrospective voting.},

Abstract = {The article examines some of the actions implemented during the crisis
   caused by COVID-19, in three sub-national governments: Mexico City, the
   State of Mexico and Jalisco, which are considered as examples to study
   capacities leadership in crisis management. For this, in the first
   instance a theoretical review is carried out on the relevant aspects of
   the crisis, which will help us with the proposed analysis. Next, the
   actions implemented by the sub-national governments are exposed, with
   emphasis on two of the strategic tasks of crisis management, critical
   decision making and generating meaning. Finally, in order to elaborate a
   discussion on the data presented, the final section points out the
   importance of developing capacities for crisis management at both the
   sub-national and national levels and thus moving away from improvised
   practices.},

Abstract = {In April 2014, the new Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, proposed a
   constitutional reform to overcome the perfect bicameralism model, the
   reduction in the number of senators, the abolition of certain bodies and
   changes to the system of distribution of competences between the State
   and the Regions. As a summary, the reform was intended to promote
   political stability and institutional governance, approving the Italian
   political system and its parliamentary regime to that of other European
   countries. However, after a long parliamentary process, it was flatly
   rejected in a referendum in December 2016, causing the fall of the

Abstract = {The article looks at Rwandans' engagement with authoritarianism prior to
   the 1994 genocide and, more broadly, at life under ``soft
   authoritarian{''} settings. It argues that Rwandans did not experience
   state-society relations under pre-genocide regimes as a vertical chain
   of authority, as is often contended. Instead, they spoke of a felt gap
   between national and local levels. Engagement with authority was
   predominantly local and experienced in an ambiguous, yet functional
   manner rather than simply as coercion. It was also experienced in a more
   varied manner than is often presumed. Indeed, local experiences of
   authority were commonly about ``making do{''} with authoritarianism.
   This should lead scholars to question common frames of authoritarian
   verticality and the obedience/compliance which authoritarianism is
   presumed to foster. It should also lead scholars to question simple
   frames of resistance often proposed when studying authoritarian
   state-society relations.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the energy policy as the principal policy field in
   the fight against global warming and explores the onset of an emerging
   multi-level governance as well as its effects on human development.
   Energy policy in Argentina, with special focus on Cordoba, serves as a
   case study in order to analyze two fields of action in order to
   strengthen efficiency: energy generation and the promotion of renewable
   sources, on the one hand, and energy consumption, on the other. The
   analysis sheds light on the inconsistency of energy policies which come
   along with contradictory regulations, limiting effects regarding the
   increase of renewable energy and a rationalization in consumption. These
   features coincide with an emerging multi-level governance characterized
   by multiple actors and fragmented regulations as well as partial
   differences on the technical and ideological level between national
   governments, within the timeframe for this paper.},

Abstract = {Border arrangements are often critical to the successful negotiation of
   peace settlements and the broader politics of post-conflict societies.
   However, developing an understanding of popular preferences about these
   arrangements is difficult using traditional surveys. To address this
   problem, we used a conjoint survey experiment to assess preferences
   about post-Brexit border arrangements in Northern Ireland. We mapped
   areas of convergence and divergence in the preferences about post-Brexit
   border arrangements of unionist and nationalist communities, simulated
   the degree of public support for politically plausible outcomes and
   identified the border arrangements that both communities could agree
   upon. In so doing, we outlined an empirical approach to understanding
   public preferences about border arrangements that could be used to
   understand the degree of support for similar institutional arrangements
   in other divided societies.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The appeal of social media has transformed the ways political
   participation is experienced. As an online communication tool, social
   media platforms have changed how political content is processed and
   transmitted. These developments have stimulated political participatory
   practices even in authoritarian regimes that are less tolerant on how
   social media affect people's political consciousness. This study seeks
   to examine whether social media platforms increase political
   participation in authoritarian regimes by having Iran as its case study.
   Iran is an authoritarian regime which imposes heavy censorship in all
   sorts of media and severe limitations in the freedom of speech. By
   introducing the Social Media Political Participation Ladder, this
   article accounts for both a theoretical and an empirical contribution by
   testing its application. Using primary data from a street survey, with a
   representative sample (n = 110) conducted in three different cities
   across Iran, we find a relatively positive impact of social media use in
   online political information and participation. However, the level of
   offline political participation remains low, showcasing no significant
   influence. Thus, the article verifies the different stages developed
   under the Social Media Political Participation ladder and Iran's current
   standing on it.},

Abstract = {Many commentators argued that if elites and voters had coordinated on an
   alternative candidate, Donald Trump could have been defeated for the
   2016 Republican presidential nomination. This claim rests on the
   implicit assumption that Trump would have been defeated in a
   head-to-head contest against another candidate-that he was a Condorcet
   loser. Conventional pre-election polls, however, do not provide enough
   information about voters' preferences to assess the plausibility of this
   claim. Relying on novel data to construct individuals' complete
   preferences over the set of leading Republican candidates, we find that
   no other candidate strictly defeats Trump in pairwise majority-rule
   comparisons and-far from being a Condorcet loser-that Trump is a member
   of the majority-rule core. Our results question the plausibility of the
   coordination narrative because Trump's support was wider than political
   observers believed: it came from a broad base of the Republican primary
   electorate rather than a small but intense minority.},

Abstract = {Sub-national self-governance is on the rise across European democracies.
   This increasing decentralization changes party competition in
   multi-level governance systems, and has broad implications for voters'
   ability to assign political responsibility and to hold politicians
   accountable. Regarding the interplay between party competition and dual
   accountability - that is, the attribution of accountability to the
   relevant level - in multi-level governance systems, we propose to
   distinguish conceptually between an electoral and a governmental arena.
   Whereas dual accountability in the electoral arena is challenged by
   varying degrees of party system nationalization, the governmental arena
   is characterized by a trade-off between the wish for clear-cut dual
   accountability and the need for political stability. We discuss these
   challenges in detail and link the various contributions in this special
   issue to these challenges. We add to the existing literature that
   increasingly deals with the theoretical and empirical challenges of
   electoral accountability in ever more institutionally complex systems of
   multi-level governance.},

Abstract = {A central question in Western European electoral research is whether
   electoral changes over the past decades should be interpreted in terms
   of dealignment or realignment. Although many scholars study this
   question, they have not paid much attention to the role of generational
   replacement. This `age-period-cohort' (APC) study fills this void by
   examining the last 10 national elections in the Netherlands (1986-2017).
   The hypothesis is tested that the determinants of party choice differ
   systematically across generations. With regard to period effects, it is
   found that the association between party preference and its predictors
   has mainly weakened. Over generations, contrarily no decreasing
   associations are found. The effects of religion, social class,
   partisanship, left-right and redistribution have not structurally
   decreased with each successive generation, whereas the effects of
   education, immigration and European unification are stronger for younger
   generations. Taken together, these findings reveal how dealignment over
   time can co-exist with realignment over generations.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the power to prorogue (or suspend) Parliament
   following the 2019 prorogation controversy in the UK. We outline the
   legal basis of prerogative-based prorogation, survey its uses in the UK
   and other Westminster systems, and compare it with equivalent rules in
   other European parliamentary democracies. The comparative perspective
   highlights the outlier status of the UK among comparable European
   democracies. In the UK, the absence of explicit legal limits on the use
   of prorogation gives the executive exceptional scope to employ the power
   for political purposes to sidestep Parliament. We conclude by discussing
   the implications of these findings for current discussions about the
   desirability of reforming the UK's prorogation rules and placing express
   legal limits on the executive's power.},

Abstract = {As the incumbent Turkish administration strives to pursue more aspiring
   goals in foreign affairs, Turkeys military policy is fast developing in
   line with this vision. The nations defense technological and industrial
   base can now produce various conventional weaponry. Of these, without a
   doubt, Turkeys drone warfare assets have garnered the utmost attention
   among the international strategic community. In tandem, the Turkish
   Armed Forces (TAF) have gradually gained an expeditionary posture with
   forward deployments across a broad axis, ranging from the Horn of Africa
   to the Gulf and the Mediterranean. Turkeys proxy warfare capabilities
   have also registered an uptrend in this respect. Nevertheless, Ankara
   will have to deal with certain limitations in key segments, particularly
   5th generation aircraft and strategic weapon systems which, together,
   represent a severe intra-war deterrence gap in Turkeys defense posture.
   The Turkish administration will have to address this specific shortfall
   given the problematic threat landscape at the nations Middle Eastern
   doorstep. This study covers two interrelated strategic topics regarding
   Turkeys national military capacity in the 21st century: its defense
   technological and industrial base (DTIB) and its military policy, both
   currently characterized by a burgeoning assertiveness.},

Abstract = {Conspiracy theories (CTs) are not solely the domain of extremists and
   paranoids. They cut across demographic and political differences
   (Uscinski and Parent, 2014) and can have negative social/political
   consequences. For example, Imhoff and Lamberty (2020) find that belief
   that the seriousness of COVID-19 is being exaggerated is negatively
   correlated with self-reported preventative behaviours such as hand
   washing and social distancing, and belief that the virus was
   intentionally created by humans is positively correlated with
   self-reported hoarding of food, sanitary products, and gasoline/oil, as
   well as stocking up on weapons.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the key issue of the process of political
   activation of individuals in a state that is in the process of political
   and social modernisation, whose essential goal is the formation of a
   civil society. The subject of interest in the article is the impact of
   the type of participation in the protest, which took place in Ukraine at
   the turn of 2013 and 2014, referred to as ``Euromaidan{''} or
   ``Revolution of Dignity{''} on the political activity of individuals
   after the end of the events, in the period of systemic changes in
   Ukraine. Treating participation in protests as a function of political
   activation, surveys covered the attitudes and behaviour of individuals
   who took an active part in protests and those who only followed the
   events using social media. Surveys were carried out on the N-600 group,
   using the comparative method, analysing the impact of active and passive
   participation in protests on the attitudes of the respondents four years
   after the events (the research was carried out in the period of
   April-June 2018). The presented research results are part of the stream
   of analyses devoted to social and political protests as a form of
   political activation that supports the development of civil society. The
   presented research uses the type of participation, treating it as a
   matrix for measuring political activity, which was developed for the
   purpose of research.},

Abstract = {In much of the developed work, tendencies associated with neoliberalism,
   the ``corporatization{''} of the university, and cuts to government
   funding have led to a growing reliance on contingent or
   ``non-regular{''} faculty. Precariously employed, these non-regular
   faculty constitute a reserve of low-paid and marginalized academic
   workers, and an increase in the number of doctorates granted each year
   in Canada guarantees a continuous supply of highly exploitable workers.
   While many books, articles, and blog posts discuss this phenomenon in
   the United States, less information is available for Canada. This paper
   will measure the extent of the reliance on precariously employed
   contract faculty across Canada.},

Title = {Germany Going Postal? Comparing Postal and Election Day Voters in the
   2017 German Federal Election},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The proportion of voters casting their votes by mail days or even weeks
   before election day has risen from initially five per cent to nearly
   thirty per cent in the 2017 German federal election. At the same time,
   the differences in election results between postal and election day
   voters are increasing, reaching a record at the Bundestag election in
   2017. Against this background, it seems particularly surprising that
   there are only a small number of empirical studies on postal voting in
   Germany. For an evaluation (of the development) of postal voting, it is
   crucial to investigate the factors responsible for the different
   election results between the two voter groups. This requires more
   precise knowledge of postal voters and how they differ from voters who
   cast their ballots on election day. Using data from the German
   Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we investigate in how far
   composition effects - differences between the voter types in the
   composition of factors potentially relevant for party choice - and
   association effects - differences regarding their vote functions or
   criteria applied for vote choice - can help to explain the different
   electoral outcomes. We conclude that the voter types do not differ
   substantially from each other with regards to their decision criteria
   but that their composition differs with regards to certain
   characteristics relevant for party choice.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the state of democracy in the world in 2019. We
   demonstrate that the ``third wave of autocratization{''} is accelerating
   and deepening. The dramatic loss of eight democracies in the last year
   sets a new record in the rate of breakdowns. Exemplifying this crisis is
   Hungary, now the EU's first ever authoritarian member state.
   Governmental assaults on civil society, freedom of expression, and the
   media are proliferating and becoming more severe. A new and disturbing
   trend is that the quality of elections is now also deteriorating in many
   countries. Nevertheless, there are also positive signs: pro-democracy
   protests reached an all-time high in 2019. People are taking to the
   streets to protest the erosion of democracies and challenge dictators.
   Popular protests have contributed to substantial democratization in 22
   countries over the last ten years - including Armenia, Tunisia, and
   Ecuador. This was before the Covid-19 pandemic. Responses to the crisis,
   including many states of emergencies, risk further accelerating
   autocratization.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {42},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The project of liberal democracy is inherently marked by tensions
   between its liberal and democratic pillar. This means that liberal
   democracy needs to constantly strive for a balance between conflicting
   principles. If it does not contain these centrifugal forces, liberal
   democracies risk becoming subverted from within due to one principle
   clearly dominating the other. In this article, we start from the idea of
   liberal democracy depending on balance to systematically assess multiple
   endogenous challenges to democracy. We identify four types of
   deformations and show how they are qualitatively distinct phenomena, yet
   systematically relate to each other. We furthermore discuss what the
   co-existence of several such deformations means for the notion of
   liberal democracy understood as a state of balance. In sum, the proposed
   framework adds to existing research by providing a systematizing and
   theoretically grounded assessment of ongoing subversive tendencies in
   liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {One of the core tasks of a well-functioning state is providing fair and
   adequate criminal justice. Recent events have raised concerns that the
   US exhibits a ``culture of rape,{''} wherein victims are often
   disbelieved and blamed. Scholars have not yet examined how the public
   understands rape and how it should be punished, despite the important
   role that public pressure has played in the \#MeToo era. We present an
   empirical conceptualization of rape culture to generate predictions for
   how various attributes of rape incidents affect the likelihood that they
   are perceived as punishable crimes. In a series of conjoint experiments,
   we demonstrate that details relating to the victim's consent and
   credibility significantly decrease participants' propensities to support
   reporting to police or to recommend a severe punishment for the
   perpetrator. The results show that emphasizing certain legally
   irrelevant features of rape strongly affect whether the public views an
   incident as severe or worthy of punishment.},

Abstract = {Various United Nations organizations and representatives have released
   declarations about the deterioration of the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan
   situations since 2017. The United Nations Security Council, the
   General-Secretary, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
   Rights have been particularly active on these issues. The positions of
   the selected institutions and their representatives were diverse, and
   sometimes contradictory, and the polarized contexts in which such
   declarations have been made emphasized diversity. Based on a
   sociological approach of international organizations, this article
   demonstrates that the United Nations as an actor is not a coherent and
   unique entity. To understand the difficulties the organization faces in
   dealing with the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan crises, it seems
   indispensable to go beyond the traditional dichotomy between states and
   institutions, and power politics. Indeed, institutions are plural-the
   United Nations through states is conservative and cautious, whereas the
   United Nations through the individuals and staff is more assertive and
   critical of the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan governments.},

Abstract = {This article examines the experiences of a newly formed detached youth
   work project in Scotland and its relationship to neo-liberal ideology.
   The growth of neo-liberalism has, as with other social professions, made
   detached youth work vulnerable to a deficit-based approach. This has
   come hand-in-hand with managerial practices focused on efficient,
   targeted interventions delivered through short term budgets. The
   article, drawing on ethnographic data, describe a team of youth workers
   challenged with reconciling their deep commitment to delivering a
   programme of relational youth work with the targeted focus of the
   project on `risky' youth and associated local apparatus of community
   safety. Throughout youth work's history the dividing line between youth
   work and mechanisms of social control has been slippery to navigate. The
   article argues that emergent neo-liberal ideology presents a further
   professional challenge to youth work. In the context of austerity and a
   widening neo-liberal policy agenda from Westminster, Scottish youth
   workers are being required to work harder to demonstrate that the
   service is not simply there to target `risky' social groups or `plug the
   gaps' that the state can no longer provide. Youth workers, in this
   context, must continue to make the case in defence of well-resourced,
   universal youth work and its potential to contribute to tackling social
   injustice and inequality.},

Abstract = {The demise of colonial-apartheid created a heightened sense of euphoria
   that was accompanied by great expectations in South Africa. Inevitably,
   the broad spectrum of South Africans expected the new dispensation to
   birth a fertile social, political and economic ground for national unity
   and reconciliation and social cohesion through a just and equitable
   democratic society. In this regard, various institutional frameworks
   were transformed to be in sync with the new requirements placed on a
   democratising society. Historically, racial social engineering had
   profoundly fractured the South African society and made it difficult for
   society to cohere. Among these transformed institutional frameworks was
   the legislature, which is one of three arms of government that works in
   conjunction with the executive and judicial branches. At the core of the
   legislative branch is legislation (creating or amending new laws),
   oversight (control over the executive and custodian of natural
   resources) and deliberation (representative between the people and
   government). In this article, we contend that given the centrality of
   the legislature in driving the direction of the country, this
   institution has betrayed the hopes, aspirations and sensibilities of
   South Africans by being ineffective and irresponsible in its functions.
   Methodologically, the paper uses desktop research, and draws from
   primary and secondary documentary evidence. Structurally, it covers the
   following: the role of the legislature during colonial-apartheid; the
   new dispensation and the new role of the legislature; and the challenges
   faced by the legislature under new determinant conditions. The article
   reaches the conclusion that the failure of South Africa to transform
   into a just and cohesive non-racial, non-sexist society is, to a great
   extent, a function of the dismal performance of the legislature.
   Therefore, pursuant on the re-imagination of South Africa from its
   colonial-apartheid past, the legislature will have to perform its roles
   and functions effectively and take its responsibilities seriously in
   order to ensure social cohesion through inclusive development.},

Abstract = {Why have decades of high and rising inequality in the United States not
   increased public support for redistribution? An established theory in
   political science holds that Americans' distrust of government decreases
   their support for redistribution, but empirical support draws primarily
   on regression analyses of national surveys. I discuss the untestable
   assumptions required for identification with regression modeling and
   propose an alternative design that uses randomized experiments about
   political corruption to identify the effect of trust in government on
   support for redistribution under weaker assumptions. I apply this to
   three survey experiments and estimate the effects that large,
   experimentally induced increases in political trust have on support for
   redistribution. Contrary to theoretical predictions, estimated effects
   are substantively negligible, statistically indistinguishable from zero,
   and comparable to estimates from two placebo experiments. I discuss
   implications for theory building about causes of support for
   redistribution in an era of rising inequality and eroding confidence in
   government.},

Abstract = {Multidimensional concepts are non-compensatory when higher values on one
   component cannot offset lower values on another. Thinking of the
   components of a multidimensional phenomenon as non-compensatory rather
   than substitutable can have wide-ranging implications, both conceptually
   and empirically. To demonstrate this point, we focus on populist
   attitudes that feature prominently in contemporary debates about liberal
   democracy. Given similar established public opinion constructs, the
   conceptual value of populist attitudes hinges on its unique
   specification as an attitudinal syndrome, which is characterized by the
   concurrent presence of its non-compensatory concept subdimensions. Yet
   this concept attribute is rarely considered in existing empirical
   research. We propose operationalization strategies that seek to take the
   distinct properties of non-compensatory multidimensional concepts
   seriously. Evidence on five populism scales in 12 countries reveals the
   presence and consequences of measurement-concept inconsistencies.
   Importantly, in some cases, using conceptually sound operationalization
   strategies upsets previous findings on the substantive role of populist
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article explores left critiques of neoliberalism in light of the
   Black Lives Matter movement's (BLM) recourse to the notion of `racial
   capitalism' in their analyses of anti-Black oppression. Taking a cue
   from BLM, I argue for a critical theory of racial capitalism that
   historicizes neoliberalism within a longue duree framework, surfacing
   racialized continuities in capitalism's violence. I begin by revealing
   how neo-Marxist and neo-Foucaultian approaches to neoliberalism,
   particularly that of David Harvey and Wendy Brown, respectively,
   partition race from the workings of contemporary capitalism. Such
   analyses obscure neoliberalism's differential impact on non-white
   racialized populations, while simultaneously casting anti-racist
   struggles as divisive. In contrast, I then trace how the Movement for
   Black Lives policy platform invokes Cedric Robinson's work on racial
   capitalism, investigating the utility of this framework for the
   movement's demands. Building on BLM's turn to the concept of racial
   capitalism, I finally offer an outline of a critical theory of racial
   capitalism to better theorize neoliberalism. By historicizing
   neoliberalism within racial capitalism's historical arc, such a theory
   unravels the qualitatively different mechanisms through which racialized
   populations are pressed into circuits of capital accumulation. It also
   paves the way to move past the entrenched class-versus-identity debate
   on the American left.},

Abstract = {A recent wave of research has engaged with gender-focused bodies within
   parliament studying their status, organization, and function. One type
   of body scarcely studied is issue-based parliamentary groups such as the
   Speaker's Gender Equality Group in the Swedish Parliament. This article
   focuses on the form and function of this body, as well as its potentials
   and pitfalls. On the basis of secondary sources, two waves of interviews
   with men parliamentarians (MPs) and inside observations the Speaker's
   gender equality group is analyzed from the 1990s until today. We
   conclude that despite lacking formal legislative power, this body has a
   key symbolic and informal role, manifested in the political will and
   engaged leadership to ensure that equal working conditions for women and

Abstract = {In urban spaces, racial profiling is a widespread police practice that
   dramatically reveals who is not considered a citizen of the nation. As
   the so-called majority society tends to see racial profiling as an
   indispensable police measure to maintain `order' and `security',
   initiatives of solidarity with people experiencing this form of
   institutional racism are rare. Nevertheless, a movement against racial
   profiling has emerged in Switzerland since 2016, protecting People of
   Color against local border policing and challenging the racialized
   boundaries of national citizenship. To analyze the convergence of
   differing solidarity practices, I propose the concept of `infrastructure
   of solidarity'. As I show in the empirical analysis, this
   `infrastructure of solidarity' contesting racial profiling consists of a
   diverse set of actors deploying various forms of (counter-)knowledge and
   different political, social and spatial registers: from being involved
   in direct actions within urban citizenship struggles to artistic
   interventions and activist research to highly professional strategic
   litigation; and from solidarity as intimate, friendship-based care
   relationships to more strategic political relationships.},

Abstract = {At the root of techno-capitalist development - popularly marketed as
   ``modernity,{''} ``progress{''} or ``development{''} - is the continuous
   and systematic processes of natural resource extraction. Reviewing wind
   energy development in Mexico, coal mining in Germany and copper mining
   in Peru, this article seeks to strengthen the post-liberal or structural
   approach in genocide studies. These geographically and culturally
   diverse case studies set the stage for discussions about the
   complications of conflictual fault lines around extractive development.
   The central argument is that ``green{''} and conventional natural
   resource extraction are significant in degrading human and biological
   diversity, thereby contributing to larger trends of socio-ecological
   destruction, extinction and the potential for human and nonhuman
   extermination. It should be acknowledged in the above-mentioned case
   studies, land control was largely executed through force, notably
   through ``hard{''} coercive technologies executed by various state and
   extra-judicial elements, which was complemented by employing diplomatic
   and ``soft{''} social technologies of pacification. Natural resource
   extraction is a significant contributor to the genocide-ecocide nexus,
   leading to three relevant discussion points. First, the need to include
   nonhuman natures, as well as indigenous ontologies and epistemologies,
   into genocide studies to dispel an embedded anthropocentrism in the
   discipline. Second, acknowledges the complications of essentializing
   identity and the specific socio-cultural values and dispositions that
   are the targets of techno-capitalist development. Third, that
   socio-political positionality is essential to how people will relate and
   identify ecocidal and genocidal processes. Different ontologies,
   socio-ecological relationships (linked to ``the Other{''}), and radical
   anti-capitalism are the root targets of techno-capitalist progress, as
   they seek assimilation and absorption of human and nonhuman ``natural
   resources{''} into extractive economies. Genocide studies and political
   ecology - Anthropology, Human Geography and Development Studies - would
   benefit from greater engagement with each other to highlight the
   centrality of extractive development in sustaining ecological and
   climate catastrophe confronting the world today.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the political consequences of occupational
   change in times of rapid technological advancement and sheds light on
   the economic and cultural roots of right-wing populism. A growing body
   of research shows that the disadvantages of a transforming employment
   structure are strongly concentrated among semiskilled routine workers in
   the lower middle class. I argue that individual employment trajectories
   and relative shifts in the social hierarchy are key to better understand
   recent political disruptions. A perception of relative economic decline
   among politically powerful groups-not their impoverishment-drives
   support for conservative and, especially, right-wing populist parties.
   Individual-level panel data from three postindustrial democracies and
   original survey data demonstrate this relationship. A possible
   interpretation of the findings is that traditional welfare policy might
   be an ineffective remedy against the ascent of right-wing populism.},

Abstract = {How do citizens' experiences with public schools shape their feelings
   about politics? Over the past two decades, public schools have closed at
   an increasing rate across the United States. In 2013, US history was
   made in Chicago, Illinois, when the most public schools in a single year
   were closed. Despite the large number of school closures nationwide,
   there is a little research on what citizens think about them and their
   potential political effects. Utilizing qualitative data from community
   meeting transcripts, ethnographic observations, and interviews related
   to the historic school closures by Chicago Public Schools, this paper
   reveals that the inconsistencies experienced by citizens affected by
   school closures contribute to distrust of the real objectives behind the
   policy. Citizens' mistrust of the policy, likely shapes negative
   perceptions of the policy implementers and politics, at large. This
   paper has important implications for studies that seek to understand how
   and why citizens oppose policies that are framed as advantageous to
   them. Additionally, this paper provides significant insights into the
   ways in which citizen engagement with educational policies can act as a
   process of political learning, specifically related to public trust.},

Abstract = {In an era of apparent ``post-democracy{''}, political participation is
   challenged on multiple levels. On the one hand, traditional
   understandings of democratic participation appear to be out of sync with
   current socio-political realities. The rise of multinational
   corporations has introduced a strong and dominant influence into the
   balance of politics, with implications for the way social, economic, and
   political issues are prioritized, represented, and understood. At the
   same time, demands from citizens for self-determination are growing.
   Responding to multiple inputs, new forms of participation are rising,
   which appear to reconcile complex demands and problems. This article
   explores the role of eco-consumerism in this post-democratic setting,
   asking how and why eco-consumerism is understood as political
   participation. It analyses levels of autonomy for citizens within
   eco-consumerism, questions the extent to which responsibility is applied
   to consumers for solving complex socio-ecological problems, and debates
   charges that eco-consumerism depoliticizes socio-political issues to
   economic transactions.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the impact of separation from marital and cohabiting
   relationships on political party preferences. Relying on longitudinal
   data (1999-2017) from the Swiss Household Panel, it examines to what
   extent differences in party preferences between partnered and separated
   individuals are the result of a selection effect (with individuals who
   separate having different party preferences prior to their separation
   compared with partnered individuals) or of a causal effect (with
   individuals changing their party preferences following separation). The
   analyses show that partnered individuals are significantly more likely
   to support a party with Christian values (the CVP) compared with
   separated individuals, and indicate that this is due to a selection
   effect. For populist right (SVP) voting, we find a causal effect of
   separation. Interestingly, the event of separation increases the
   likelihood of supporting the populist right SVP. While separated
   individuals are more likely to support the social democratic party (PSS)
   than married individuals, we do not find a significant selection or
   causal effect of separation on support for the PSS. Overall, our results
   confirm the relevance of taking a dynamic approach distinguishing
   selection and causal effects and reveal that the effect of separation on
   voters' party choice is modest but significant.},

Abstract = {That governments may not always keep their election promises or that
   they change policy positions may be unsurprising. However, failed
   promises, backing down on threats or flip-flopping on policy positions
   may be associated with a loss in support. Bringing together literature
   on the politics of electoral promises, policy shifts and audience costs,
   we examine the conditions under which a political leader can back down
   on a promise, using the EU referendum in the UK as a case study. Based
   on a survey experiment conducted in the aftermath of the 2015 general
   election, we examine whether justifications grounded on electoral
   motives, internal and external opposition would have allowed then Prime
   Minister David Cameron to avoid paying audience costs for going back on
   his campaign promise. Our results indicate that domestic audience costs
   might have been manageable, with only slightly more than a quarter of
   the participants in our study punishing executive inconsistency
   regardless of the justification employed. Of particular interest for
   European Union scholars, justifying backing down due to opposition from
   other EU member states is particularly effective in mitigating domestic
   audience costs.},

Abstract = {Where it concerns traditional political knowledge, on average, men have
   outscored women. Research indicates that part of the knowledge gap
   originates before adulthood, and convincing work indicates it is likely
   the result of unequal returns to education. Yet, no research that we
   know has examined the role of educators. Given research about
   representative bureaucracy and how a gender match between student and
   teacher improves girls' performance in fields that they may otherwise
   perceive as dominated by men, we examine the theory's application to
   political knowledge. Using administrative data from five cohorts of
   public school students in North Carolina, we test the hypothesis that
   female students will do better on a state exam in civics and economics
   when their teacher is a woman. Results of our analyses support the
   hypothesis by revealing a small but significant narrowing of the gap in
   test scores when students have a female teacher.},

Abstract = {This article diagnoses and critiques pervasive forms of teleological
   thought about basic structures of political organization in modern and
   contemporary political thought: arguments that the sovereign state, the
   nation-state, or some variant of a cosmopolis both represents the
   unfolding of history's moral logic and offers us full moral personhood,
   agency, and maturity. Despite the received wisdom that modern political
   thought broke with teleology, I argue that early modern social contract
   theory was deeply teleological. The emergence of the normatively
   self-contained sovereign state from the state of nature represented both
   decisive historical-moral progress from the medieval European non-state
   polities and the possibility of true moral personhood, thanks to the
   unity of will and judgment created by a unified authority structure. The
   article then argues that this over-attachment to unity, both as an
   historical culmination and as a prerequisite to full personhood, was
   carried over into subsequent nationalist and cosmopolitan thought, where
   we see over-moralizations of historical processes, excessive claims for
   the teleological causal force of moral progress, and critiques of the
   immaturity of those persons who do not live in the recommended political
   form. The article closes with a sustained critique of both historical
   and individual-moral teleologies of these sorts.},

Abstract = {During the 1810s and 1820, officials in the War Department engaged in
   military state building, which transcended partisanship and contributed
   to the development of executive autonomy. The process revealed the
   ability of the executive to shape national security, while also
   foreshadowing Progressive Era trends toward expertise-based bureaucratic
   autonomy. The activities of the Ordnance Department suggest that the
   connection between war and early American state building was forged in
   the efforts to bolster the armaments industry. Ordnance officers
   established autonomy partly through arms expertise, and they were not
   necessarily coalition builders like the late nineteenth-century Post
   Office and Department of Agriculture bureaucrats, especially because
   they generated more hostility. Thus, there were different routes by
   which autonomy was and is established, but in the first decades of the
   nineteenth century, this autonomy depended on national security and war
   preparations. This article uses War Department papers, armory records,
   and congressional debates to show how certain bureaucrats developed the
   ability to work against congressional limits to their functionality.
   Ordnance ultimately succeeded because its leaders executed a nonpartisan
   military agenda and demonstrated an ability to effectively manage the
   nation's security apparatus, especially in times of peace.},

Abstract = {This article estimates the position of the main provincial leaders
   according to their political style, ``Low{''} (informal-popular) or
   ``high{''} (sober-refined), in terms of Pierre Ostiguy's framework. To
   achieve this, a expert-survey was carried out in each province. 191
   experts were consulted. The work offers the average estimate of 117
   provincial politicians, as well as the standard error of those
   estimates, and tests the hypothesis that differencesin style are
   associated with the leaders's political space. In other words, Peronist
   politicians tend to have a ``Lau){''} style and non-Peronist ones, and
   especially those of Cambiemos, a ``High{''} style.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The U.S. led the world in environmental policy in the 1970s, but now
   lags behind comparable nations and resists joining others in tackling
   climate change. Two embedded, entwined, and exceptional American
   institutions-broad private property rights and competitive
   federalism-are necessary for explaining this shift. These two
   institutions shaped the exceptional stringency of 1970s American
   environmental laws and the powerful backlash against these laws that
   continues today. American colonies ensured broad private rights to use
   land and natural resources for profit. The colonies and the independent
   state governments that followed wielded expansive authority to govern
   this commodified environment. In the 1780s, Congress underwrote state
   governance of the privatized environment by directing the parceling and
   transfer of federal land to private parties and of environmental
   governance to future states. The 1787 Constitution cemented these
   relationships and exposed states to interstate economic competition.
   Environmental laws of the 1970s imposed unprecedented challenges to the
   environmental prerogatives long protected by these institutions, and the
   beneficiaries responded with a wide-ranging counterattack. Federalism
   enabled this opposition to build powerful regional alliances to stymie
   action on climate change. These overlooked institutional factors are
   necessary to explain why Canadian and American environmental policies
   have diverged.},

Abstract = {Prime Ministers who want to improve the likelihood of their political
   survival must increase their approval ratings. To do so, they must rely
   on their party's popularity, their own reputation for competence and
   their ability to strategically set the public agenda. This paper focuses
   on strategic agenda setting and its contribution to Prime Ministers'
   approval rating. Strategic agenda setting includes heresthetic moves
   that set the public agenda and rhetoric that frames the policy options
   that the agenda includes. Prime Ministers in competitive political
   environments use heresthetic moves to anchor the public agenda around
   policy dimensions they dominate and use rhetoric to frame policies as
   hopeful and certain in comparison to competing policies. I verify this
   claim using an extensive dataset of British Prime Ministers' approval
   ratings between 1960 and 2000.},

Abstract = {This article develops the menu of autocratic innovation to account for a
   perceived transformation in the nature of autocratic rule. Drawing from
   an original list of 20 techniques intended to cultivate the pretence of
   accountability without permitting the actual practice of it, the article
   describes how autocratic innovation takes different forms
   (informational, legal, political, reputational and technological) and
   concerns different targets (citizens, civil society activists,
   opposition members and foreign policymakers). This theoretical framework
   is tested against nine autocratic regimes in Southeast Asia from 1975 to
   2015. The evidence shows substantial variation in terms of the form and
   target of at least six distinct techniques: libel and defamation suits,
   anti-civil society measures, mock compliance to human rights agreements,
   public relations firms, think tanks and zombie monitors. The article
   concludes by discussing three possible explanations for why autocratic
   innovation occurs: waves of autocratization, density of international
   linkages and leadership turnover.},

Abstract = {In 2018, the state of Israeli citizenship completed a long-anticipated
   transformation. The passage of the Nation-State Law represented a formal
   and substantial reordering of the Israeli political sphere and the
   long-held contention that it prioritized democratic citizenship.
   Redefining the Israeli state in exclusively ethnic terms, the new law
   places its Palestinian citizenry in a precarious position, neither fully
   stateless, nor fully citizen, and in a state which dangerously
   approaches `inhuman.' Drawing on the works of Jewish humanist
   philosopher, Hannah Arendt, we further develop the conceptual category
   to which she alludes in The Human Condition and Origins of
   Totalitarianism - `half-statelessness.' Applying Arendt's arguments to
   the Palestinian case, we deepen previous analyses of the new Basic Law
   and citizenship studies more broadly, demonstrating how Israeli
   citizenship's continuous evolution has reached its legislative apex and
   produced a phenomenon which transcends the typical prototypes of citizen
   and state and effectively de-humanizes its Palestinian citizens.},

Abstract = {The paper uncovers determinants of turnout in Iran by studying the role
   of institutional and socio-economic variables in parliamentary politics
   since the 2000s. The paper argues that Iran's electoral system has
   dichotomized the pattern of participation between center and periphery.
   The dynamic of participation in the center stems primarily from national
   shifts in the factional rule. However, in provincial peripheries, Iran's
   electoral system promotes the personal particularistic demands of voters
   in the MP-citizen linkage. In this environment, the discretionary power
   of local state machinery over the daily lives of provincial citizens
   lays the ground for the role of local bureaus to influence
   participation. This argument draws on statistical analysis of
   parliamentary turnout and the study of several Iranian newspapers and
   official reports. The findings of the paper suggest a new mechanism by
   which institutional settings may shape the pattern of participation more
   generally.},

Abstract = {In The People's Duty, Shmuel Nili employs the concepts of collective
   integrity and public property to amplify and clarify popular intuitions
   about political wrongs, providing his readers with a powerful theory of
   `liberal democracy with no excuses.' Here I extend Nili's analysis to
   environmental justice: overuse of the global carbon sink is like theft
   of public property, while exporting polluting production to less
   developed countries would violate Nili's global integrity test. However,
   environmental justice seems to confound the division of collective
   political agents into discrete occupants of well-defined territories,
   and that division is one of Nili's foundational assumptions. I argue
   here that Nili's theory ought to apply to cases like the conflict over
   water extraction in New Zealand, even though some of the relevant agency
   in that case is exercised at the subnational level.},

Abstract = {Shmuel Nili's The People's Duty presents an account of political
   morality centered on the duties, rights, and powers of the collective
   people. He defends an extensive set of popular entitlements against the
   domination of elites. Nili's populism is liberal and egalitarian, an
   important alternative to illiberal and anti-democratic forms of
   populism. I introduce and discuss Nili's conceptions of popular
   integrity and public ownership, which underpin his discussion of various
   forms of corruption and injustice in domestic and international
   politics.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I develop a healthy way for aesthetics to interact with
   political society. In States of Injury, Wendy Brown argues that
   left-wing identity politics equates to Nietzschean ressentiment, which
   uses relative weakness to assume moral or ethical supremacy. Brown uses
   the expression ``wounded attachments{''} to describe politics that
   allows suffering to establish an advantaged perspective and group
   identity. I argue that a comparable phenomenon occurs in aesthetics.
   Some aesthetics are linked to a notion of a sub-group or political
   message, and proponents of that message forgive art for mediocrity.
   Borrowing Brown's nomenclature, I call this ``wounded aesthetics.{''} I
   establish the roots of wounded aesthetics in Adorno and its expression
   in such popular forms as Oprah Winfrey's book club. I contrast this with
   Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral, asserting that when modern
   culture examines only art's explicit message - its content - then art's
   value qua art and its relation to politics is problematic. Using Roth,
   Derrida, and Heidegger, I offer a modest argument in favor of healthy
   aesthetics.},

Abstract = {This article offers a novel take on the problem of judicial independence
   in nondemocracies. Some scholars hold that political fragmentation leads
   to more judicial independence; others argue that it leads to less
   independence in nondemocracies. These studies have focused on judicial
   politicization and neglected judicial corruption. Using a
   process-tracing controlled comparison of reforms in Georgia and Moldova,
   I investigate the impact of political fragmentation on judicial
   corruption. I argue that politicians in less fragmented regimes, as in
   Georgia, have stronger incentives to reform corrupt courts, and utilize
   anticorruption measures for establishing long-term political control. In
   more fragmented regimes, as in Moldova, politicians have stronger
   incentives to resist anticorruption measures and instead utilize corrupt
   courts for short-term private gains. These findings suggest that
   political fragmentation in hybrid regimes can propel politicians to
   delegate neither more, nor less power to courts, but instead to use
   distinct avenues, or ``entry-points,{''} to influence judicial outcomes.},

Abstract = {The problem of the legitimacy of administrative decisions adopted
   through algorithms has been the object of considerable attention from
   legal doctrine and administrative jurisprudence in Italy. Indeed, while
   legislation does not offer suitable solutions to the new challenges, the
   administrative judge is defining the conditions of admissibility in
   algorithmic decisions, applying the principles of administrative
   procedure to the new problems. Following an initial phase in which
   jurisprudence seemed to come to exclude the admissibility of automated
   decisions, more recent jurisprudence seems to be directed towards
   admitting these kinds of decisions, although it requires appropriate
   guarantees, above all in transparency. With its latest judgement,
   enacted in December 2019, the Council of State defines these conditions
   in a more general way, as such beginning to delineate some initial
   `commandments' of algorithmic legislation which are significantly
   inspired by the principles relating to the automated processing of
   personal data contained in the European regulations on the protection of
   personal data.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the politicization of European integration in
   Italy. Has the euro crisis catalyzed a new electoral supply, which may
   have been matched by voters' responses? After the crisis, Italian
   parties have increased their entrepreneurial efforts to prime EU issues
   into the political debate, trying to win over votes. This pattern may
   have led to a full politicization of European integration. To study the
   transformations in party strategies and voting behavior, I analyze the
   fluctuations in EU issue entrepreneurship and EU issue voting between
   2009 and 2014. The findings reveal mixed results: parties have actually
   developed new strategies on EU issues, but without significantly
   changing voter preferences along the pro/anti-European dimension.},

Abstract = {Analysts emphasize that nothing will be the same after the pandemic and
   refer to the `new normal' that is likely to prevail everywhere in the
   world. It would be a legitimate question to ask if this would provide a
   conducive environment for Turkey and the United States to reset their
   relations that have much deteriorated lately. This article will, first,
   highlight the contours of the `new normal' narrative by referring to the
   views expressed by politicians, academics, analysts, journalists and
   intellectuals from around the world. Second, the article will assess the
   implications of the parameters of the `new normal' for key actors in
   world politics, such as the United States, China, the European Union and
   Russia, as well as Turkey's Middle Eastern neighbors, with respect to
   the issues that will be at stake in the international security
   environment. Finally, the article will make a call for a reset in
   Turkish-American relations in order for the two long-standing allies to
   adapt themselves better to post-COVID international politics.},

Abstract = {China and the United States are among the most important external
   stakeholders in Africa's peace, security, and prosperity. The African
   continent, with some of the world's fastest-growing economies, an
   expanding consumer base, and an exploding youth population, has recently
   witnessed intensifying China-U.S. competition. In economic and trade
   terms, the United States is playing catch-up as Beijing has long ago
   overtaken Washington as the continent's largest trading partner and
   investor. While China regards Africa's adherence to the ``One China{''}
   principle as the only political prerequisite for its engagement with the
   continent, the United States views greater democracy and rule of law in
   Africa as in the best interests of both. China's security presence in
   Africa pales in comparison with that of the United States, as Washington
   boasts an extensive network of military bases on the continent while
   Beijing's peace and security engagement mainly involves multilateral UN
   peacekeeping operations and bilateral security cooperation, such as arms
   sales and training programs. However, growing China-U.S. competition
   does not necessarily crowd out shared interests or preclude closer
   coordination in specific areas, for example, market development,
   infrastructure building, anti-piracy, health capacity-building, and so
   on. By fending off a senseless ideological contest, respecting each
   other's core interests in Africa, accommodating Africans' development
   aspirations and security concerns, Beijing and Washington can find more
   common ground than many believe.},

Abstract = {Well established in the literature is that social context, like the
   racial or partisan composition of neighborhoods, affects individual
   political behavior. Less understood is how the design of neighborhoods
   may also influence these behaviors. This article seeks to improve how
   physical context is measured and to examine how the built environment
   subsequently affects individual political participation. Using a
   nationally representative survey with measures of the frequency of
   neighbor interaction and individual voter turnout and to which I merged
   respondents' census tract information and then used Google Maps images
   to code respondents' neighborhood design features, I show how the
   physical structure of residential places-whether homes have porches,
   streets are tree-lined, neighborhoods have natural gathering
   places-promotes neighborly exchanges that subsequently affect individual
   voter turnout.},

Abstract = {The main and general thesis of this work is as follows: the aspiration
   toward the absolute and unconditioned seeks to be realized in two ways,
   either in the field of the supersensible through reason -as Kant
   claimed- or in the field of the sensible through power's invasiveness
   and `compellingness'. In other words, either as a determination of the
   supreme objects of rea-son, being owners of an unrestricted necessity as
   Kant stated on the faculty of reason in the Transcendental Dialectic, or
   as the group of beings in the will of will just as Heidegger claimed.
   Both movements as the determination of totality and `unconditionedness'
   amount to modern subjectivity's structure itself, whose ambition is the
   achievement of an unrestricted and high fullness also known as power.
   Heidegger will read the search for this unrestricted fullness as a lack
   of indigence.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {How did anxiety influence vote choice in the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election, when both major candidates faced substantial voter
   disapproval? Drawing from the model of affective intelligence (Marcus et
   al. 2000), I argue that anxious voters will base their vote choice more
   strongly on issues and candidate qualities and less on partisanship
   relative to non-anxious voters. This study uses a registered report as
   part of the 2016 Election Research Preacceptance Competition, wherein a
   complete analysis plan was submitted for review prior to the 2016
   American National Election Study's release. In so doing, it serves as a
   model for other preregistered and potentially preaccepted research.
   Consistent with past findings, this study shows that anxious voters in
   2016 were less likely to rely on past partisanship and more likely to
   base decisions on personal qualities. However, anxiety did not condition
   the effect of issues in the election. Further, Donald Trump faced no
   more anxiety among Republican voters than Mitt Romney did in 2012 due to
   a rise of in-party enthusiasm. The non-conditional effect of issues and
   a relatively narrow gap in partisan anxiety served as unique features of
   the 2016 election.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Value-form is a theory Marx first developed in Capital vol.1 to solve
   the mystery of money. He seemed convinced that he had finally solved the
   mystery of money by reducing the money-form to the general value-form.
   However, his explanation of the transition from the latter to the former
   with the phrase `by social custom' is not satisfactory. I consider that,
   as long as a logical derivation of the money-form from the general
   value-form is unsuccessful, the mystery of money is not yet completely
   solved. I attempt first to rehabilitate the simple value-form, comparing
   it with real value expression in price (money-form), emphasizing the
   distinction between the expression of value and the measure of value,
   and the asymmetry of the value-form. Thereby, I explain that Marx's
   complicated exposition of the value-form stems from his postulate of the
   labor substance of value in the first chapter of Capital vol.1, which
   can be proved and developed later in the production process of capital.
   Rehabilitation of the value-form can expose a fundamental difference
   between the general value-form and the money-form, and provide a logical
   derivation of the money-form. To achieve this aim, it is necessary to
   reformulate the logical structure of the theory of commodity based on
   the concept `the world of commodities', which comes to appear more
   frequently as Marx's theory of value-form advances.},

Abstract = {Globally, there is a demand for basing education policy decisions and
   practice on solid evidence. While the same applies in Iceland, some have
   claimed that there is a dearth of evidence-based publications targeted
   at education. This article considers this claim by examining the
   availability and nature of evidence-based publications with a focus on
   upper secondary education in Iceland. In total, the main characteristics
   of 316 publications were studied over the period 2003-2012. These
   publications included peer-reviewed articles, non-reviewed scholarly
   work (articles and reports), master's and doctoral theses, external
   evaluation reports, and innovation reports. The findings reveal a hidden
   treasure of a number of publications targeted at upper secondary
   education in Iceland. Some educational fields are still weakly
   represented in the evidence spectrum, such as vocational studies, and
   the data collection methods are relatively few. Furthermore, the main
   stakeholders are isolated from one another to a degree. Such isolation
   is problematic, as evidence-based publications are intended to inform
   both policy and practice. Thus, the study suggests an increased need for
   cooperation among the main stakeholders in upper secondary education.},

Abstract = {Both the 2016 US presidential election campaign and Donald Trump's later
   presidency have entailed, in several aspects, a break with the
   traditional practices, uses, modes and forms in Western politics. The
   constant appeal to voters' feelings (and low passions), the
   relativization of facts, the racist, xenophobic, sexist statements and
   those others hostile to minorities, a home policy rupturist with the
   past and a grandiloquent foreign policy have all been elements of a
   government action usually described as chaotic and impulsive, or even as
   childish and irrational. President Trump is usually accused of being a
   populist. This article aims at offering an approach to Trump's political
   thought checking it against a series of elements deemed characteristic
   of populism. This will, in turn, allow to assess the extent to which the
   current host of the White House can be considered as a populist or not.
   Ultimately, the conclusion is reached that it is certainly possible to
   do so.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article investigates the combined effect of experiential and
   reflective learning on student learning in international politics. It
   proceeds from the premise that students need a more realistic view of
   decision-makers so as to understand the logic and context of foreign
   policy-making better. A board game was used to model the foreign policy
   decision-making environment, and written and oral reflections were
   utilised to link students' personal experience to abstract concepts of
   foreign policy analysis. Using a quasi-experimental design, both
   qualitative and quantitative data were used to test the hypotheses about
   students' altered views of decision-making and their interest in and
   learning about foreign policy analysis. Results show that, in comparison
   with the impact of traditional lecturing combined with discussions, the
   benefits of experiential and reflective learning are very small. The
   little support for the existence of such benefits that was uncovered
   comes from qualitative data and a few statistical measures based on
   student self-evaluation. Quantitative analyses based on objective
   measures provided little evidence for a difference between the two
   teaching approaches. The article concludes with a call for improving the
   effectiveness and evaluation of reflective learning methods and putting
   the theories of reflective learning into practice more profitably in
   international relations.},

Title = {Imagining Modernization: The Symbolic Embrace of GDP in China},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In China, economic development has been almost exclusively defined
   through the lens of gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, the
   indicator is deeply ingrained in national and local policymaking.
   Despite its power, we know almost nothing about how GDP gained such a
   politically prominent position in China. This paper therefore asks: how
   was GDP embraced politically and integrated into the Chinese governance
   system in the mid-1980s and 1990s? The paper argues that in China GDP
   appropriated a symbolic function. Chinese politicians used the indicator
   as an `instrument of imagination' and conceptualized the political goal
   of achieving modernization in terms of GDP. GDP improved the practical
   applicability and persuasiveness of the modernization narrative by
   reducing uncertainty and strengthening China's socialist identity.
   Furthermore, the symbolic appropriation shaped the adoption of GDP
   targets in Five-Year Plans as well as the uptake of GDP in the local
   performance assessment system as a control tool. The Chinese case shows
   that macroeconomic indicators have different social functions, which
   make them dynamic tools that can be adjusted to a diverse range of
   societies. The empirical analysis is based on personal interviews with
   statisticians in China and the World Bank and extensive document
   analysis.},

Title = {Don't Republicans Tweet Too? Using Twitter to Assess the Consequences of
   Political Endorsements by Celebrities},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-160},

Abstract = {Michael Jordan supposedly justified his decision to stay out of politics
   by noting that Republicans buy sneakers too. In the social media era,
   the name of the game for celebrities is engagement with fans. So why
   then do celebrities risk talking about politics on social media, which
   is likely to antagonize a portion of their fan base? With this question
   in mind, we analyze approximately 220,000 tweets from 83 celebrities who
   chose to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election campaign to assess whether there is a cost-defined in terms of
   engagement on Twitter-for celebrities who discuss presidential
   candidates. We also examine whether celebrities behave similarly to
   other campaign surrogates in being more likely to take on the ``attack
   dog{''} role by going negative more often than going positive. More
   specifically, we document how often celebrities of distinct political
   preferences tweet about Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary
   Clinton, and we show that followers of opinionated celebrities do not
   withhold engagement when entertainers become politically mobilized and
   do indeed often go negative. Interestingly, in some cases political
   content from celebrities actually turns out to be more popular than
   typical lifestyle tweets.},

Title = {Revolution or legality? Confronting the spectre of Marx in Habermas's
   legal philosophy},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-95},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As early as 1962, Jurgen Habermas was convinced that Karl Marx's
   theoretical attempt to `turn Hegel the right side up' had resulted in a
   one-sided embrace of revolution and a perilous rejection of legality and
   rights. Habermas would restate these remarks thirty years later in
   Between Facts and Norms, noting that the collapse of state socialism,
   with its characteristic disdain for legality and rights, culminated in
   the discrediting of revolutionary Marxism. This article revisits
   Habermas's theoretical dichotomy between revolution and legality in view
   of his ambivalent relationship to `Marx's spectre' and shows its
   significance for Habermas's ongoing debate with Wolfgang Streeck
   concerning the tension between democracy and capitalism. Using textual
   evidence from Marx's neglected journalistic writings before, during, and
   after the 1848 revolutions, the article offers a competing perspective
   of Marx's views on legality and rights at a time when their respective
   fates were critically at stake. A careful reconsideration of Marx's
   reflections and a confrontation with his spectre offers Habermas
   fruitful resources for responding to Streeck's critique and for reviving
   the project of `radical reformism' at a time when the liberal
   constitutional order finds itself under attack.},

Title = {Constructing the Herder-Farmer Conflict as (in)Security in Nigeria},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-76},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The recent spate of violence mostly in north-central and southern
   Nigeria, typically credited to conflicts between herders and farmers,
   and the reactions, narratives, and representations that have attended
   them, calls for an examination of core security questions: who or what
   is to be secured, from what threat and by what means. In fact, it could
   be further contextualized as: how is the conflict between farmers and
   herders constructed, framed, and represented as (in)security within the
   Nigerian context? Several existing works have approached the evolving
   conflict between pastoralists and farmers in Nigeria from a range of
   perspectives, mostly accounting for the reasons or causal factors
   driving such conflicts. This commonly includes references to ecological
   factors as responsible for the uncontrolled north-south migration of
   herdsmen which encourages the struggle for - and access to - land and
   its resources between herders and farmers. At the same time, some
   studies point to the rise of herdsmen militancy and in doing so draw
   inconclusive links to other security issues in Nigeria such as terrorism
   and secessionist movements. However, there have been significant efforts
   by state officials and interest groups to describe the conflict, either
   as producing insecurity or to refute such claims of insecurity. This
   study employs critical constructivism as advanced by Jutta Weldes to
   examine how the conflict is framed and represented as insecurity. It
   finds that the discourses produced by the federal and state governments
   as well as interest groups, constructs it in specific ways by linking
   specific factors to offer possible explanations of the conflict. As
   such, the discourses that frame the herder-farmer conflict in Nigeria
   are: securitization, fulanisation, and sedentarisation. This study
   presents an important contribution to understanding the framing,
   constructions, and representations of the herder-farmer conflict in
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {This article advances the case for `normative behaviourism' - a new way
   of doing political philosophy that tries to turn facts about observable
   patterns of behaviour, as produced by different political systems, into
   grounds for specific political principles. This approach is applied to
   four distinct problems at the heart of the ideal/non-ideal theory and
   moralism/realism debates: (1) How to distinguish good from bad
   idealisations; (2) how to rank options of variable feasibility, cost,
   and danger; (3) how to distinguish legitimate acceptance of a given
   political system from acceptance based on coercion or false
   consciousness; and (4) how to translate abstract principles into
   concrete institutions. Objections against the general viability of
   normative behaviourism, and against the types of behaviour it tracks,
   are also considered.},

Abstract = {Is state power or control over financial markets really withering? Most
   narratives/analyses of financialisation see a growing penetration of
   private capital into everyday life that runs parallel to the increasing
   power of private financial capital over state policy. Yet housing
   finance ? mortgages ? sits at the centre of banking, and banking sits at
   the centre of the financial system. Large-scale mortgage markets only
   function where the state wraps around the banking system to remove
   maturity risks and to limit excessive credit creation. Partial
   deregulation in the 1990s and 2000s created a crisis that states
   resolved by re-nationalising much of mortgage finance. This renewed and
   overwhelming state presence suggests that financialisation is a
   state-driven story, and that private financial power, stability and
   instruments require state support above and beyond contract enforcement
   and prudential regulation.},

Abstract = {The ``developmental state{''} has become a prominent alternative
   development model defended by contemporary Western aid donors,
   particularly in Africa. Purported ``developmental states,{''} such as
   Ethiopia and Rwanda, are argued to possess strong-willed, visionary
   leaderships whose commitment to delivering on ambitious development
   plans renders them attractive donor partners. These leaderships are
   also, however, often authoritarian and unapologetic when criticized for
   democratic backsliding or human rights abuses. For many Western donors
   this represents a tolerable trade-off. The purpose of this article is to
   interrogate, critique and explain the assumptions and ideas underlying
   this trade-off. Using the case study of Ethiopia, we argue that donor
   officials' understandings of ``developmental state{''} are varied, vague
   and superficial, the main commonality being a ``strong{''} regime with
   ``political will{''} and a non-negotiable approach to domestic
   governance. We suggest that donors have too readily and uncritically
   accepted, internalized and deployed these notions, using the
   ``developmental state{''} concept to justify their withdrawal from
   serious engagement on democratic reform. This derives from a systemic
   donor preference for depoliticized development models, as well as from
   Ethiopian officials' own savvy political manoeuvrings. It has also,
   however, weakened donors' position of influence at a time when the
   Ethiopian regime is debating major political reform.},

Abstract = {The rise of the `gig' economy has placed a spotlight on employment
   status, leading to challenges over the nature of working relationships
   and attendant rights from increasingly diverse groups. The predominant
   image of the struggle against `bogus self-employment' features the
   mostly young, male riders and drivers engaged in platform work. This
   article examines the distinctive campaign of foster carers to be
   recognised as workers, focusing upon the emergence of the campaign and
   the imaginative solidarities forged with seemingly disparate groups of
   precarious workers. Drawing from interviews and observation, this
   article explores the tactics used in contesting `bogus' self-employment,
   the achievements and challenges faced. The concept of legal mobilisation
   is used as lens, capturing the blend of strategic litigation, organising
   and legal enactment. This article concludes by considering how this
   solidaristic project might be further broadened to provide fully
   inclusive protections for all those who work for a wage.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},

Abstract = {The special rights and responsibilities of the great powers have
   traditionally been treated as a key component - even a primary
   institution - of international society in the English School literature.
   Recent interpretivist work has focused on the meanings of special
   responsibilities in contemporary international society with far less
   scholarly attention being given to the corollary of this - special
   rights. This article uses an interpretivist approach to attempt to
   uncover what recent debates over China's right or otherwise to a sphere
   of influence in East Asia tells us about understandings of great power
   rights in contemporary international society. The argument advanced is
   that if Beijing's right to a sphere of influence is successfully
   rejected by the rest of international society without repudiating its
   status as a great power more broadly, China will indeed be a great power
   without historical precedent.},

Abstract = {Airbnb, the short-term rental (STR) company that operates in 65,000
   cities and 191 countries is the most disruptive and transformative force
   in urban housing and planning in recent memory. On any given day, in
   Germany the company lists approximately 100,000 accommodations primarily
   in the larger cities. In Berlin the company lists nearly 38,500 beds in
   20,000 accommodations or 27 per cent of the city's entire hospitality
   market. Airbnb is a major player in other German cities as well
   including Munich, Cologne, and Hamburg where the online company holds 20
   per cent, 16 per cent, and 15 per cent shares in the hospitality market,
   respectively. Drawing on the experiences of Germany's ten largest
   cities, the article examines three questions. How do German city leaders
   understand the public problem posed by STRs? What are the economic,
   political, and administrative challenges to regulating STRs? And
   finally, how are Germany cities regulating STRs and what explains the
   variation across cities?},

Abstract = {The Greens made spectacular gains in the 2019 Swiss federal elections.
   In a campaign that was dominated by the climate change issue, the party
   outperformed the Christian Democrats to become the fourth largest party
   in the lower house. This status enabled the Greens to legitimately
   request a seat in government (the Federal Council). However, their
   attempt to unseat a member of the Liberals failed due to the resistance
   of the right-wing parties. It thus turned out that the Green wave was
   not strong enough to change the composition of the federal government.},

Title = {Protests of Abundance: Distributive Conflict Over Agricultural Rents
   During the Commodities Boom in Argentina, 2003-2013},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1223-1258},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Whereas the scholarship on rural contention mostly focuses on austerity
   and busts, we study protests by agricultural export producers in times
   of high agricultural prices. Aware of price volatility, farmers seek to
   take advantage of cycles' upswings to maximize their income and resist
   sharing the rents generated by higher prices. When farmers lack the
   formal political influence to avert redistribution, they are more likely
   to protest as their tax burden increases although they benefit from
   higher prices. Their strongest protest tool is lockouts, which halt
   commercialization activities and have significant economic consequences,
   but require coordination by farmer associations. Membership homogeneity
   and lower exposure to state retaliation by these organizations heightens
   contention. We test this argument using a local-level data set on rural
   lockouts across Argentine departments between 2003 and 2013, a time of
   high prices for Argentina's key export commodity: soybeans. We
   complement our empirical strategy with in-depth, semi-structured elite
   interviews.},

Abstract = {Voters use various cues to make their decision. We examine the impact of
   the cue of candidate position on Brexit. Brexit is still on the agenda
   and we explore how this topic continues to divide the electorate. We
   test this by assessing the general preference of candidates among
   respondents in a series of surveys providing variation in the
   information regarding candidates' positions on Brexit and party
   identification. In contrast to existing literature, we find strong
   evidence that candidates can utilise either their own previous voting
   behaviour or that of their opponent to provide an electoral advantage.
   Leave supporting candidates are highly rated by leave voters and poorly
   rated by remain voters, and vice versa for remain candidates, although
   it is dependent on the party label of the candidate. The issue of Brexit
   has a strong impact, but partisanship is mostly of equal importance for
   the respondents.},

   understand the frontier of civil rights for LGBT+ people. While Ghosh's
   analysis of covering brilliantly exposes the oppressive potential within
   the concept as Yoshino conceives it, Ghosh himself fails to fully avoid
   some of the criticisms that he advances. Moreover, he perpetuates a long
   and regrettable tradition of queer analyses of LGBT+ issues that
   privilege the experiences of gay men, say less about lesbians, and
   particularly neglect bisexual and trans{*} perspectives.},

Title = {Antifa without fascism: the reasons behind the anti-fascist movement in
   Ireland},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-137},

Abstract = {The anti-fascist movement is generally viewed as a reaction to the
   extreme right by concerned left-wing activists. Therefore we would not
   expect the Antifa to feature in countries where extreme right activism
   is not a feature of the politics. However, Ireland has no significant
   extreme right but it still has an anti-fascist movement that plays an
   influential role within radical left circles. By treating Ireland as an
   outlier in relation to the existing reactive explanation for
   anti-fascist mobilisation this paper takes a deviant case analysis
   approach to generate novel hypotheses behind the reasons for the
   anti-fascist movement. First, anti-fascism acts as a site of left
   convergence, an area of unity that transcends the usual ideological
   divisions that can impede other types of political collaboration in a
   fragmented radical left activist base. Second, in the absence of
   effective extreme right forces, anti-fascism acts as a form of
   prophylactic action. In effect, the aim of this activism is to deny
   political space to extreme right micro groups before they become a
   popular force or a more serious political threat. Finally, a close
   cultural lineage between elements within the left and a past
   revolutionary tradition will increase the appeal of anti-fascist
   activism among left-wing activists.},

   analysis demonstrates that one of the linkages among them is provided by
   their rejection of European integration, and that Putin-sympathizer
   parties tend to display ideological radicalism on both ends of the
   left-right ideological continuum, thus falling into the category of
   anti-system parties. At the same time, one of the important shared
   characteristics of Putin-sympathizer parties is populism.},

Abstract = {This article investigates Germany's role in the European Union's (EU)
   foreign policy towards Russia. It argues that Germany has been a leader
   in EU relations with Russia since the late 2000s, most notably through
   attempts to upload its long-standing policy of dialogue and cooperation
   with Moscow - known as Ostpolitik - to the EU level. During the Ukraine
   crisis, German leadership in this field became hegemonic. Economic and
   institutional power, the consent of its European and transatlantic
   allies and supportive domestic politics allowed Germany to profile
   itself as the main EU negotiating partner for Moscow. By highlighting
   the long-term German quest for leadership in the EU's relations with
   Russia, the article makes the argument that Germany is not a
   `reluctant', but rather an assertive hegemon in this policy area.
   Furthermore, the article highlights how the Ostpolitik tradition and its
   self-conception as a civilian power enabled Germany to lead Western
   diplomacy in the Ukraine crisis. At the same time, Germany's hegemonic
   leadership in EU-Russia relations faces several challenges and
   limitations, which relate to the nature of Germany's power, the consent
   of its allies and evolving domestic politics.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze some dimensions related to the implications of
   the production of extreme energy in the geological formation of Vaca
   Muerta, in particular in the Province of Neuquen, through the use of the
   fracking technique. For this, we start from a general intellection
   budget: the energy issue can be analyzed as a system where the different
   actors are in constant tension and dispute for a resource that is vital
   for economic production and to satisfy the welfare conditions of the
   population, but it is appropriate asymmetrically. Likewise, the
   extraction and production of energy takes place in different territories
   and the socio-environmental, political and economic impacts are
   distributed unevenly and problematically. With this purpose we will
   organize the writing from two levels of inquiry: 1) ``from above{''},
   the conception of the Vaca Muerta megaproject as a public policy of
   government, centrally from 2012 onwards, warning continuities and
   ruptures in the proposals, programs and official conceptions regarding
   their exploitation and 2) ``from below{''}, giving an account of the
   attributes and particularities of the collective actors and of the
   social conflicts that have arisen around this extractive process.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, parties in many parliamentary democracies have
   radically reshaped what it means to be a party member, making it easier
   and cheaper to join, and giving members greater direct say over party
   decisions. This article explores some implications of such changes,
   asking whether membership costs and benefits influence which supporters
   take the step of joining their party. In particular, it considers the
   impact of net membership benefits on membership demographics and on
   members' ideology. The investigation examines patterns of party
   membership in 10 parliamentary democracies, using opinion data from the
   European Social Survey and data on party rules from the Political Party
   Database project. Our analysis shows that party supporters are more
   sensitive to political benefits than to financial costs, especially in
   terms of the ideological incongruence of who joins. As a result, parties
   offering higher benefits to their members have lower ideological and
   demographic disparities between members and other party supporters. This
   is a positive finding for party-based representation, in that it
   suggests that trends toward more inclusive decision-making processes
   have the potential to produce parties with memberships that are more
   substantively and more descriptively representative of their supporters.},

Title = {NETWORK VS MESSAGE IN PROTEST DIFFUSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA: THEORETICAL AND
   DATA ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {73-91},
Abstract = {Social media can act as an environment that accumulates and concentrates
   protest sentiment before it brings people to the streets. The social
   ties that connect people online are similar to their offline ties, and
   the structure of social ties can affect the diffusion of both the
   protest-related information and the protest itself. In addition, social
   media can serve as core platforms or environments for articulating
   collective goals and identities. This article builds on previous
   scholarship that has developed these ideas, and extends it with an
   empirical analysis of the Venezuelan Twittersphere during the political
   unrest in that country. Short messages - tweets - are the basic building
   blocks of online protest behavior on Twitter. Some of these tweets get
   virally retweeted so can achieve very broad audiences. These viral
   tweets are arguably of key importance for the articulation of protest
   sentiment. However, what kind of tweet tends to become viral? Is it a
   tweet posted by someone with a fortunate position in the social media
   network, or one that stands out as particularly catchy or emotional? We
   formalize and test these competing hypotheses using two groups of
   empirically observable features characterizing either the author of a
   tweet or its content. The first group of features includes the average
   number of followers the retweeting users have, the total number of
   followers the author of the original tweet has, whether the author or a
   retweeter are verified Twitter users, etc. The other group describes the
   content of the tweet and includes binary indicators of whether the tweet
   contains links to external platforms, emojis, or question or exclamation
   marks. The dependent variable is the total number of retweets. We
   analyze over 5.7 million unique tweets using modern data science
   approaches and methods (e.g. a LASSO-regression model, cross-validation,
   etc.) and find that the first-group features are much more informative
   for modeling the dependent variable. This finding turns out to be very
   robust and holds for both OLS and LASSO models. In addition, given the
   increasing importance that social media bots - i.e. automated accounts
   that are able to post retweet, among other things - have recently gained
   for political communication, we also perform robustness checks by
   removing bots from the analysis. We find that the network
   characteristics matter more than the content-related features under
   study.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to carry out a retrospective analysis of the
   legal acts on the legalization of private detective activities in
   Ukraine and, at the same time, consider the characteristics of training,
   retraining and advanced training of private detectives in order to to
   further improve legislation in this area. The subject of the study is
   essentially the process of training, retraining and advanced training of
   private detectives in Ukraine. During the research, the following
   scientific methods were used: dialectical method, methods of synthesis
   and analysis, methods of induction and deduction, statistical method,
   historical and legal and formal and legal methods. The peculiarities of
   the Law of Ukraine ``On the Activity of Private Detective (Search){''}
   were considered, its advantages and disadvantages were described. By way
   of conclusion, he emphasizes that the existing legal education system,
   introduced in civil educational institutions, is not adequate for the
   training of private detectives. For these and other political and legal
   reasons, the need to train private detectives in the system of higher
   education institutions with specific learning conditions in the heat of
   the requirements imposed by reality itself is argued.},

Abstract = {The present article is seeking to evidence existent connections between
   the ideology of guerrilla and paramilitary groups, and the rebel
   governance models that these armed actors have consolidated in Colombian
   insured territories. On this matter, there is a reference to the
   principal concepts and planning of existing theoretical perspectives to
   discuss and contrast them with the Colombian context. For that, it has
   been used a qualitative methodology and documentary review as an
   investigative tool. It was found that the relationship between rebel
   governance and ideology can be understood through: (a) Interests
   exercised by armed groups over territorial control, (b) Employed
   elements to exercise that control, (c) Legitimacy of civil population to
   the consolidated rebel governance (d) the relationship between armed
   actors and civil population. These findings are offering a new starting
   point to get deeper, theoretically, over behavior of other armed groups
   in other contexts than Colombian.},

Title = {Individual and collective agency of women union leaders in the mining
   industry in Chile: an articulated analysis from gender and capability
   approaches},

Abstract = {This article approaches the issue of women's union participation in a
   masculinized industry, such as mining in Chile, focusing on the question
   of agency, from the standpoint of Sen and Nussbaum's capabilities
   approach. Women's union participation is an emerging phenomenon, both
   due to the recent quota regulations, which is pushing for a greater
   presence of women in trade unions, as well as the visibility acquired,
   although being a minority in trade unions. By using a qualitative
   methodology that involved the application of eleven in-depth interviews
   to union leaders and the triangulation of capabilities and gender
   approaches, we analyzed narrated experiences, which show the existence
   of inequalities, conflicts and gender discomforts, together with agency
   expressions. These translated into ``freedom of agency{''}, as getting
   what you want - is affected by the trade union quota or by training -
   and, secondly, into ``achievement of agency{''}, as the achievement of
   goals, being elected and staying in office -. The hypothesis that guides
   this article is that, in the masculinized industry of mining, the
   development of female leader's agency, it is not a linear process and
   implies paradoxes and nuances, since achieved freedoms and goals are
   prominently anchored in an exceptional individual dimension. However, in
   its collective dimension, that is in an intra and inter women network
   which facilitates gender transformation processes, agency is weaker,
   manifested in fragile articulation and bonds of solidarity, which hinder
   the expansion of capabilities for all women in the sector.},

Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the new political course of the Russian
   Federation, aimed at overcoming the economic blockade of the countries
   of Europe, as well as the United States. Effective management of food
   enterprises should take into account the new economic conditions for the
   functioning of the food economic subsector. In view of the crisis
   associated with the spread of coronavirus, falling oil prices, the ruble
   situation, the development of an economic course to adapt the Russian
   food industry becomes paramount. Therefore, the purpose of this article
   is a set of government measures to regulate the dairy food complex of
   the Russian Federation, both federally and regionally for the period
   2008-2018. An analysis of the dynamics of milk industry indicators
   showed that the level of self-sufficiency for the period 2008-2018 was
   below the standard: 0.90. The study correlated the economics
   ``import{''} and ``self-sufficiency{''}. Based on the data, it is
   concluded that the Russian Federation needs global innovation in the
   food industry mainly to the effective management of the agricultural
   dairy subsector.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the definition of the State as an institution
   (Anstalt) that holds the monopoly of the legitimate use of
   force/violence (Gewalt). It is divided into three parts: the first one
   discusses some chief scholarly contributions on the topic. The second
   focuses on Weber's use of ``monopoly{''} within his work, with the aim
   of showing that the expression ``monopoly of the legitimate use of
   force/violence{''} can be better understood if conceived and explained
   within the much wider employment of this term. The third part analyses
   the expression ``monopoly of the legitimate use of violence
   (Gewaltsamkeit){''} in Weber's Intermediate Reflections. Religious
   Rejections of the World and Their Directions. Trying to grasp the
   meaning of the expression within this text can be helpful in order to
   better illustrate its sense within the entire Max Weber's work.},

Abstract = {It analyzes the evolution of Brazil, emerging power, between its rise
   with Lula and its important process of decline, which begins under the
   first government of Rousseff, continues with his impeachment and remains
   under the presidency of Temer. The hypothesis is sustained in the
   rise-decline cycle of international projection and regional leadership
   and the emergence of the Pacific Alliance that does not represent the
   integration model that Lula promoted. It is concluded that the
   government of Bolsonaro will put in confrontation the political
   tradition of Itamaraty with the foreign policy that it proposes. The
   methodology is based on the analysis of secondary sources and the

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},

Abstract = {There is a tendency both in academia and in popular understandings to
   posit emotions against rationality and to judge them as an expression of
   intellectual inferiority. This could not be more evident than in current
   accounts of populism, which often describe populist supporters as
   overtaken by passions rather than relying on rational deliberation.
   However these arguments hardly stand up to scientific scrutiny. As I
   will show by reviewing the state-of-the-art, advancements in disciplines
   such as political psychology have now provided systematic evidence of
   how, contrary to what is traditionally rooted in the public imaginary,
   emotions and cognition work in concert. If emotionality is an integral
   part of decision -making and is vital to any type of political
   engagement, the question we should rather ask is what is peculiar about
   the relationship between emotions and populism. In the second part of
   the article, I will explore how the emotional `supply and demand'
   intersect in our contemporary societies, where capitalism, individualism
   and globalisation have created particular affective states that provide
   fertile ground for the populist appeal to resonate. By examining the
   emotions -populism relationship based on three broad dimensions -
   structural, subjective and communicative -, this article provides a
   multilevel analysis that unpacks the significance of emotions for the
   emergence, diffusion and success of populism.},

Abstract = {The continuing occurrence of state-sponsored cyber attacks against
   liberal democracies, including private sector and civil society targets,
   shows that deterrence efforts have been less than successful. Elisabeth
   Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding
   behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily
   difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence
   directed against hostile actors, they propose `personalised deterrence',
   with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to
   individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally
   responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.},

Abstract = {In this article, it is explored the possibility of using La Razon
   Populista to interpret political phenomena that have nothing to do with
   classic populist movements, but rather with unquestionably political and
   historical movements. More specifically, we raise the question of
   whether Laclau's theory of populism is valid to interpret a historical
   phenomenon such as the text of a declaration of independence. Thus, the
   question guiding this essay is: is Laclau's populism, as the author
   himself indicates, a theoretical framework that can be used to interpret
   various political phenomena, and not only those related to the images of
   classical or traditional populism?},

Abstract = {During the 70 years since its founding and the 40 years since its reform
   and opening-up, modern China has recorded a series of remarkable
   historic achievements, especially its miracle of highspeed economic
   growth over a long period. Socialism with Chinese characteristics, under
   which these achievements have been registered, is unquestionably a
   socialist system, and has entered a new era of national prosperity and
   greatness. We should attach particular importance to the socialist
   factors involved here, since the superiority of the socialist system has
   lent a unique support to the economic miracle and to the development
   achievements. A number of these socialist factors, and their unique
   advantages, deserve especially close attention. These include the
   achievements of China's economic development and of the socialist system
   itself; China's socialist economy and politics; its socialist market and
   government; the socialist market economy and the planning that is
   inherently involved in it; the public and non-public economy at the
   primary stage of socialism; socialist modernization and the world
   economy; China's internal and external markets; the goals of socialist
   production and its driving forces; socialist workers and human
   resources; socialist economic theory and practice; and so on.},

Abstract = {The article presents the activities of the counterintelligence in a
   context of doctrinal update, in order to establish the operational
   procedures that allow this activity to be more visible, given that it
   defends state interests and therefore should be associated with
   activities governed by legality, as well as public control. A
   descriptive process of such activities is proposed, considering some
   countries in the Andean region, North America and Europe, as well as the
   availability of legal and doctrinal sustenance. This allows knowing the
   trends currently in force in this field. it also allows to describe and
   propose possible strategies and the corresponding lines of action in the
   field of counterintelligence, systematically controlled by the states
   that require them. With this background, there is a need to configure
   counterintelligence strategies and lines of action, which would improve
   security and external support to better address risk factors and threats
   that would affect the society, the state and its institutions.},

Abstract = {The article explores the effects of populist polarization in creating
   strong and long-lasting institutions based on the rule of law. It
   focuses on politics and not on the political economy of populism or of
   natural resource extraction. The first section briefly explains how we
   understand the contested notions of populism and the rule of law. The
   second focuses on the paradigmatic case of Juan Peron's first two
   administrations (1946-1956) to explore the ambiguous legacies of
   populist inclusion for the creation of long-lasting demo-cratic
   institutions. The third section focuses on how Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales
   and Rafael Correa appealed to the un-bounded will of the people to
   convene participatory constituent assemblies. The last section focuses
   on Ecuador's post-populist succession. Different from Evo Morales that
   was ousted by a coup, or Nicolas Maduro that killed democracy, Lenin
   Moreno, who was Correa's former vice-president, abandoned populism,
   ditched his mentor, and used a referendum to clean the state and
   political institutions from Correa's allies. Appealing to the people
   directly, his administration assumed exceptional powers to name new
   authorities of control and accountability. His institutional reforms
   however might not last because they were based on the exclusion of
   Correa and his followers. The conclusion explores the reasons why actors
   continue to use laws instrumentally making it difficult to create
   long-lasting institutional arrangements based on the rule of law, and
   hence on the possibility of deepening democracy.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the current political and economic changes in
   Central America and how these policies determine the way this region can
   react to the coronavirus pandemic. We point out that conservative and
   right-wing governments have re-emerged in Central America over the last
   few years and are committed to consolidating neoliberal reforms in these
   countries. Poverty and inequality produced by neoliberal reforms set the
   scenario in which the region confronts the pandemic. We argue that the
   consequences of the pandemic and the neoliberal reforms will be dramatic
   if Central American elites do not change their selfish and authoritarian
   attitude towards the poor.},

Title = {The Nordic Council of Ministers: Aspirations for More Political
   Relevance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {11-20},
Abstract = {Due to changing circumstances and new challenges, the Nordic Council of
   Ministers underwent an incremental process of change and some modest
   transformation since the 1990s. However, there has never been a major
   overhaul of structures and contents owing to considerable inertia. The
   most recent modernisation process, aiming at more political relevance
   and flexibility, has been ambitious but whether it has been a success
   remains unclear thus far. Weaknesses and limits in cooperation in the
   Nordic Council of Ministers are obvious, i.e., no majority voting or
   `opting-out' system, a lack in supra-national structures and policies
   and no common immigration, foreign, security and EU policies.
   Nonetheless, the organisation has at least some relevance and meaning
   for the Nordic countries and the potential to promote and facilitate
   cooperation in policy areas in which common interests exist, such as
   environment, climate, research and social affairs. Therefore, rather
   than constituting a common political order of its own, Nordic
   cooperation, as it is conducted within the Nordic Council of Ministers,
   is best characterized by differentiated integration, promoting full
   integration only to a limited extent but respecting integration to
   different extents and speeds by fostering cooperation and coordination
   of certain policies where possible and desired.},

Abstract = {Some of the most enduring and dangerous territorial disputes often
   involve claims of historical ownership by at least one side of a
   dispute. Why does historical ownership lead to more hardened bargaining
   stances than in other territorial disputes? Do such uncompromising
   positions lead to more military conflict? We investigate these questions
   in this study. After developing a theoretical argument for how
   historical ownership may lead to a perception of territorial
   indivisibility, we test the hypotheses derived from the theory with a
   survey experiment implemented in China. We find that a historical
   ownership treatment increases the number of respondents who view the
   indivisible outcome of a hypothetical dispute as the only acceptable
   outcome. Furthermore, those who perceive a territory to be indivisible
   are more likely to favor economic sanctions and military solutions to
   the dispute and are much less likely to support bilateral negotiation or
   arbitration by an international organization.},

Abstract = {Measuring high-level corruption is subject to extensive scholarly and
   policy interest, which has achieved moderate progress in the last
   decade. This article develops two objective proxy measures of high-level
   corruption in public procurement: single bidding in competitive markets
   and a composite score of tendering `red flags'. Using official
   government data on 2.8 million contracts in twenty-eight European
   countries in 2009-14, we directly operationalize a common definition of
   corruption: unjustified restriction of access to public contracts to
   favour a selected bidder. Corruption indicators are calculated at the
   contract level, but produce aggregate indices consistent with
   well-established country-level indicators, and are also validated by
   micro-level tests. Data are published at
   http://digiwhist.eu/resources/data/.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature in distributive politics suggests that parties
   are advantaged nationally when they control office at the local level.
   But is this invariably true? Whatever advantage control over the local
   patronage machinery may offer, local governments might under some
   conditions tarnish their parties' labels and thus hurt up-ticket
   candidates. Using a regression discontinuity design in mayoral races in
   Brazil, exogenous variation in fiscal resources, and a survey
   experiment, my analysis demonstrates the critical role that party labels
   play in linking national and local elections. I show that the
   presidential tickets of parties with strong brands suffer an electoral
   penalty in municipalities governed by copartisans, especially when
   voters are dissatisfied with the local government. Loosely organized
   parties with weak party labels do not suffer a similar disadvantage.
   Hence, this study shows that for programmatic parties with strong party
   brands, mayors can sometimes be a burden rather than an asset.},

Abstract = {The scientific production of articles in the field of Law occupies a
   prominent place in the arbitrated journals of high impact, either by the
   volume of articles published in each issue or by the transcendence of an
   area of knowledge that deals with architecture of the rule of law, the
   functioning of democratic institutions, the enjoyment and enjoyment of
   fundamental rights and the management of social conflict, among other
   topics of interest. The general objective of this research is to develop
   a bibliographic balance sheet on the production of Law articles by
   researchers from Ukraine, published in the Amazonia Investiga Journal in
   2019, which subsumes to account for: a) investigated topics, b)
   methodologies and data collection techniques, c) sources used and
   theoretical references and, d) contributions to the development of legal
   science. In the methodological, it is a research close to hermeneutics,
   won to interpret the profound meaning of 31 legal texts investigated in
   the framework of documentary observation, as a technique for collecting
   and organizing the information collected. Among the most notorious
   conclusions are that, the scientific production in Law of Ukrainian
   researchers is in tune with the current problems and trends that
   identify legal science in the world today.},

Abstract = {We study the distribution of preference votes across politicians with
   different behaviors and attitudes. There are two main findings. First,
   preference votes are concentrated to politicians who are more active in
   communicating their policy proposals and policy priorities. This
   suggests that preference voting may incentivize more transparency and
   communication among politicians, and, hence, be positive for
   accountability. Second, preference votes are concentrated to politicians
   who are more-not less-loyal to the party in their voting decisions, and
   to politicians who's ideological and policy positions are
   mainstream-rather than extreme-compared to their party colleagues.
   Together with the first finding, this suggests that preference voting
   can strengthen the bond of accountability between voters and politicians
   without undercutting parties' ideological cohesion.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},

Number = {15},

Abstract = {this article aims to show Universal Basic Income as an investiment
   instead of an expense. Universal Basic Income is a preventive tool which
   effectiveness is invaluable. It avoids incurring in multiple situations
   that lead people in an incipient state of need to others whose effects
   are frequently irreversible. Since Adam and Eve committed the original
   sin, our society has been structured by work, even though work is no
   longer a guarantee of a dignified life. Tackling poverty with Basic
   Income would not only eradicate it, but also serve to distribute wealth
   at a time when inequality in its distribution is at an all-time high. It
   would give people the freedom that the social policies of the last forty
   years have not provided and would make it possible to guarantee the
   right to a dignified life.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {67, SI},
Pages = {277-285},
Abstract = {This article explores the features of the implementation of individual
   parliamentary rights by members of the Federation Council, the upper
   house of the Russian legislative assembly. The relevance of the study is
   since in recent years there has been a transformation in informal
   practices of political influence on parliamentarians. In this sense, the
   object of the study was the analysis of individual legal norms, the
   regulations of the Federation Council and the practice of holding
   parliamentary hearings. The authors focused on the negative consequences
   expressing the responsibility of senators, considering the ambiguous
   statutory regulation of such measures in modern Russian politics. During
   the development of the scope of activities carried out by the upper
   house of the Federal Assembly, the reasons by which its members could
   lose their powers were significantly expanded. By way of conclusion, it
   was noted that, despite the rarity of the application of such sanctions,
   the authors recorded a systematization of forms and measures of
   responsibility used for political purposes. Such tendencies create
   artificial barriers to the implementation of certain senatorial powers
   and acquire a political character.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-228},
Abstract = {Climate change is considered by policymakers as one of the most pressing
   global issues of our time. International institutions and national
   governments are, to varying degrees, committed to tackling climate
   change, but it has only been possible to define a shared system of
   collective goals across countries through the 2015 United Nations
   Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21). A growing interest in
   climate change policy has been present in the Italian political debate,
   yet we have little evidence regarding the nature of related climate
   change debates across Italian policymakers. By using discourse network
   analysis (DNA) to investigate Italian policymakers' discourses in the
   Chamber of Deputies during the 17th Italian Legislature (2013-2018),
   this study shows that debates on climate change-related strategies are
   largely un-polarized, except for certain issues, and that coalitions
   emerge over time around core strategies. Groups of policymakers with
   similar policy beliefs emerge independently from their political
   affiliations. Our analysis is thus the first to apply DNA to provide
   empirical evidence of the convergence across Italian policymakers and
   the potential for the bridging of political discourses on climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The ``favelas{''} of Rio de Janeiro and the ``poblaciones{''} of
   Santiago de Chile were usually visited by external actors. It is through
   the accounts of social workers, students, political activists or
   volunteers that we know about the histories of these places. With the
   beginning of the cold war, the presence of these individuals took on a
   new meaning. In this backdrop, the conflict between the communists and
   the Catholic Church for the hegemony over the low-income neighborhoods,
   which sometimes led to violent confrontations, took a central stage.
   Yet, the activities developed by these institutions strengthened the
   organization of the inhabitants and physically improved these
   neighborhoods, fostering their urban, social and political integration.},

Abstract = {The rise to prominence of Daesh and its expert exploitation of extremist
   propaganda has brought in to focus the role of strategic communications
   in counterterrorism (CT) and countering violent extremism policy.
   Nonetheless, strategic communications tends to be discussed largely in
   relation to counter-recruitment and counter-radicalisation. Using the

Abstract = {Existing theories of electoral targeting focus on voter partisanship and
   thus are at odds with the significant vote switching and weakly
   institutionalized parties that characterize young clientelistic
   democracies. We propose and test a theory of group-level targeting
   driven by groups' capacity to coordinate votes and parties' differential
   information about such capacity. Unlike current theories, ours assumes
   that most groups are nonpartisan and respond to prior targeting as a
   function of their coordinating capacity, often reflecting broker
   effectiveness. We empirically exploit the context of Senegal where new
   incumbent parties are less well-informed than outgoing incumbents about
   groups' coordinating capacity but, to maximize future support, learn
   from local vote tallies and refine targeting strategies over time. Using
   village-level electoral and public goods data, we show our theory can
   account for new incumbent parties' learning and targeting patterns
   across groups and over time, thus contributing to understanding
   electoral targeting in young clientelistic democracies.},

Title = {THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE IN REALIST TRADITION OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Pages = {54-66},
Abstract = {The role of language in political realism has been studied rather
   poorly. Moreover, in general researchers rarely pose such a question.
   Although there has recently been a tendency to revise the prevailing
   stereotypes that reduce realism to naive materialistic ontology,
   primitive correspondent epistemology and ethical cynicism, there are
   still few works aimed at analyzing the linguistic dimension of realism.
   Moreover, even in those works where this issue is touched upon, no
   attempts are made to identify certain general trends of this direction
   in the theory of international relations. Meanwhile, without taking into
   account this dimension and its historical modifications, it is hardly
   possible to fully comprehend this centuries-old tradition of political
   thought.
   To fill the gap, the authors turn to the analysis of the views of a
   number of major theorists of the realist school - from Thucydides and
   T.Hobbes to classical realists, neo-realists and neoclassical realists.
   Their research shows that language plays a significant (although not
   always clearly defined) role in realism, and it can be considered not
   only as a political tool, but also as the foundation of a specific
   community's worldview or as the footing of a scientific model. At the
   same time, the realist approach to language is not without its flaws
   that make it vulnerable to criticism. This is primarily about its
   inattention to the constructive relationships of linguo-political
   communities and the correlation between different scientific models or
   even the absolutization of their incommensurability. According to the
   authors, realism's inherent focus on pluralism and conflicts has
   linguistic reasons as well.},

   early termination of the exercise of power of elected officials in
   legislative positions. The objective of the article is therefore to
   analyze the legal and political responsibility of the officials of the
   democratically elected state before their voters. In the process on the
   subject of the study, the formal-legal and comparative-legal methods
   were used, which allowed to formulate the following conclusions. The
   subjects of the above responsibility may be elected officials of the
   legislative (representative) bodies of state power. The constitutional
   status of elected persons exercising public authority on behalf of
   individuals suggests the possibility of terminating their powers as
   sanctions only on the basis of the rules of law enshrined in the
   relevant acts and establishing clear reasons and procedures for
   liability. The current legislation of the Russian Federation provides
   for various types of constitutional and legal sanctions. They consist of
   depriving elected officials of their powers.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Perceived discrimination (PD) is reliably and strongly associated with
   partisan identity (PID) among US immigrant minorities such as Latinos
   and Asian Americans. Yet whether PD causes PID remains unclear, since it
   is possible that partisanship influences perceptions of discrimination
   or that other factors drive the observed association. Here, we assess
   the causal influence of group-level PD on PID using five experiments
   with Latino and Asian American adults. These experiments varied in
   important ways: they took place inside and outside the lab, occurred
   prior to and during Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and tested
   different manifestations of PD and partisan attitudes (total n = 2,528).
   These efforts point to a simple but unexpected conclusion: our
   experiments and operationalizations do not support the claim that
   group-targeted PD directly causes PID. These results have important
   implications for understanding partisanship among immigrants and their
   co-ethnics and the political incorporation of Latinos and Asian
   Americans.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses the situation of confessional associations in the
   Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Tatar during the period of mass
   political repressions de in the late 1930s. The methodological basis was
   the civilizational approach, as well as the principles of objectivity,
   historicism, and social focus, which allowed the most effective
   development of the issue raised. The specificity of the period and the
   object of study are determined by the heyday of Stalinist repression and
   religious consciousness, which was carried by believers and clergy, and
   was not correlate with communist ideology. The very fact of the
   existence of the aforementioned believers and the clergy and the
   presence of Orthodox churches, mosques, Catholic churches and
   functioning religious buildings of other religions was fundamentally in
   line with the goals and objectives that the state authorities
   established during this period. By way of conclusion, the authors
   provide detailed statistical information (in support of their scientific
   arguments and conclusions) on the dynamics of the number of prayer
   buildings in the republic during the study period and at the same time
   account of the general conditions of mass repression that characterize
   the historical context.},

Abstract = {This article explores precarity as a conceptual framework to understand
   the intersection of migration and low-waged work in the global south.
   Using a case study of cross-border migrant domestic workers in South
   Africa, I discuss current debates on framing and understanding
   precarity, especially in the global south, and test its use as a
   conceptual framework to understand the everyday lived experiences and
   strategies of a group that face multiple forms of exclusion and
   vulnerability. I argue that a form of negotiated precarity, defined as
   transactions which provide opportunities for survival but also render
   people vulnerable, can be a useful way to make sense of questions around
   (il)legality and (in)formality in the context of poorly protected work,
   insecure citizenship and social exclusion. Precarity as a negotiated
   strategy shows the ways in which people interact with systems and
   institutions and foregrounds their agency. But it also illustrates that
   the negative outcomes inherent in more traditional notions of precarity,
   expressed in physical and economic vulnerability, and discrimination in
   employment relations, mostly hurt the poor. This suggests the importance
   of an intersectional approach to understanding precarity in labour
   migration studies.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},

Abstract = {This article looks at the literary re-elaboration of the round-up
   occurred in Rome between 16 and 18 October 1943 in La Storia by Elsa
   Morante. It considers Morante's Jewish origins and impegno in writing of
   World War II and re-reads her description of this event in the light of
   cultural memories studies. It summarises key events of her life, as they
   related to World War II and to the German occupation of Rome, and
   examines her commitment to interrogate the past through literature.
   Literature is, indeed, a bearer of historical knowledge and a medium of
   memory; literary texts are not only an outcome of remembrance, but also
   an active ingredient in the ongoing process of cultural memory.
   Morante's literary representation of the events of 16 and 18 October
   1943 is also read through the lens of her depiction of the sensory
   perceptions of the main characters, Ida e Useppe. This analysis shows
   how and to what extent the author fosters what Alison Landsberg calls
   ``prosthetic memory{''}.},

Abstract = {Many of the criticisms commonly made of modern political parties concern
   their alleged lack of transparency and use of informality in their inner
   organization. Yet, little is known about the extent to which parties
   really bend their rules. This article investigates whether and how
   political parties use informality in one central aspect of intra-party
   life: candidate selection. More specifically, selection procedures for
   European elections are examined since party actions at the European
   level are still under little scrutiny from the media and the voters,
   hence granting them much leeway. To compare rules with practices, actors
   and levels cited in 51 party statutes are matched with their uses in
   2014, gathered through a survey and interviews of Members of the
   European Parliament (MEPs). Even though informal processes are found to
   be generally less inclusive than the rules prescribed, divergences are
   often modest, suggesting that parties do not necessarily rely on
   informality in their day-to-day functioning.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to attune to the musical theme in Hartmut Rosa's
   Resonance, not in the sense of singing from the same sheet but in a
   spirit of jamming and improvising, developing a fugue. Music, something
   close to Hartmut Rosa's heart, grounds us; and simultaneously, music,
   like all works of art, originated in the service of magical-religious
   ritual, and the aura of the sacred is still essential to secularized
   ritual. Music springs from anthropologically deepseated needs, and music
   transports us towards a higher, spiritual plane of ideals. How Resonance
   may help us to respond to dissonance caused by the loss of grounds and
   horizons is attended to in the case of the EU's anthem.},

Abstract = {The League against Imperialism was established in 1927, after the
   Brussels Congress, as an organization linked to the Communist
   International (Comintern). It was established as a united front entity
   with ramifications throughout the world: thus, the representation in
   Latin America was the Anti-imperialist League of the Americas. In 1929
   the Frankfurt Congress took place and there was a realignment of the
   League's strategy from the adoption of the axes of the Third Period and
   the ``Class against class{''} scheme.},

Pages = {174-197},
Abstract = {Relations between African militaries, civilian authority and the public
   have undergone significant transformation over the past decades. Much of
   previous scholarship on civil-military relations tended to approach the
   subject through the idiom of the coup. Analysts in the 1960s initially
   presented the military in positive terms as a modernising agent, a
   representation cast aside in the throes of coups d'etat, instability and
   rights violations at the behest of armed forces. This article revisits
   the conceptual and theoretical terrain in light of recent sociopolitical
   changes and in the wake of the peak of military coups on the continent.
   In reconceptualising civil-military relations, this article proposes a
   typology that combines the nature of modal relations with civilian
   authority and relations with the civilian public. The article analyses
   the different models of relations, tracing the domestic reconfigurations
   and external influences that structure news ways of civil-military
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Problems of civil-military relations have been at the centre of
   recurring political crises in contemporary Africa. Routine military
   intrusion in politics characterised the first four decades of
   independent Africa. Citizens suffered at the hands of the armed forces,
   infamous for widespread human rights violations. One key response to
   this dual civil-military problem was to pursue a strategy of
   politicising the armed forces in order to make them a) subordinate to
   civilian authority and b) organically close to the public and protective
   than predatory. This also entailed the militarisation of politics
   ostensibly to bring the political class into closer conversation and
   collaboration with the military. To what extent did this strategy
   contribute to transforming civil-military relations? Taking the Ugandan
   case, this article argues that transformation was attained in making the
   military more respectful of citizens' rights while simultaneously
   creating a fusion with the ruling class thereby subverting the very goal
   of professionalism.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how visual manipulation is employed on the
   Facebook page of a far-right party; and whether manipulation evokes
   different forms of engagement from Facebook users. The study takes as a
   case the Facebook page of the British National Party (BNP), which has
   recently been censored from the social media platform. It therefore
   provides a rare insight in the visual practices of the party's online
   political communication. A manual coding of 342 images into factual,
   funny, fallacious or fabricated content finds that completely fabricated
   information in images is rare. However, most images do contain
   information that is presented in a fallacious or misleading manner. The
   results show how deliberate manipulated images evoke more engagement in
   the form of comments and more negative emotional responses than images
   that present information in a factual or funny manner.},

Abstract = {Several studies have been dealing with the question of whether
   state-sponsored Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya are biased. Their findings
   suggest that the message of both media reflects the interests of their
   respective state-sponsors. This article aims to validate this
   assumption, however in contrast to already existing literature it will
   test the hypothesis on a non-conflict related case study: the coverage
   of Muslim Summit which was held in December 2019 in Kuala Lumpur. To
   achieve the objective, we seek to first identify Al Jazeera's and Al
   Arabiya's bias, its specific features and the message delivered by means
   of comparative discourse analysis, namely manipulative strategies and
   ideological square as defined by Blass and van Dijk, respectively.
   Afterwards, we examine how the identified bias fits into the strategic
   interests of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, their respective state-sponsors.
   The analysis shows that both media, when covering Muslim Summit, used
   manipulative techniques to deliver the opposite message about the
   Summit, which is in line with their state-sponsors' often incompatible
   regional ambitions and foreign policy. This article contributes to
   already existing literature on Arab media discourse analysis by focusing
   on a specific non-conflict-related issue not covered by other studies
   making thus the hypothesis applicable more broadly.},

   jurisdiction, pointing to a crisis of representation and the need to
   construct a new space-time for Constitutional Law, more effective,
   inclusive, dialectical, reflexive, dialogical, disputable and open. It
   was pointed out that constitutionalism will necessarily have to face the
   issue of constitutional dialogues, of substantive interpretation. A new
   institutional arrangement capable of adequately addressing the lack of
   sufficient motivation for decision-making, intersubjective
   contentability, deliberation and debate, and strong argumentation. It
   was argued that the STF must face the absence of institutional capacity
   for collaboration and a pre-defined agenda and democratic discussion on
   what will integrate the agenda. It ends by pointing to the absence of a
   constitutional court identity in the Supreme Court and the need to
   reformulate its structure tomeet the demands adequately for contemporary

Title = {Can EU Civil Society Elites Burst the Brussels Bubble? Civil Society
   Leaders' Career Trajectories},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {86-96},
Abstract = {The Brussels-based civil society organizations (CSOs) have been
   conceived by the EU to act as a bridge between the bureaucratic elites
   and the citizens of Europe. The institutionalized presence of the major
   EU-based CSOs has, however, called their legitimacy into question, as
   exemplified by notions such as `revolving doors' implying homogeneous
   social, educational, and professional backgrounds shared by both EU
   officials and CSO leaders. This article therefore asks the following
   questions: To what extent do the leaders of EU-based CSOs merely
   reproduce the types of capital that mirror those of the political elites
   in the so-called `Brussels bubble'? To what extent do the CSO leaders
   bring in other sets of capital and forms of recognition that are
   independent of the Brussels game? How can we explain differences in the
   salience of EU capital found across policy areas, types of leadership
   positions, and types of organizations? Empirically, this article
   qualitatively analyzes the career trajectories of 17 leaders of EU-based
   peak CSOs that are active in social and environmental policy areas.
   Despite the highly integrated and institutionalized characteristics
   shared by all organizations, we find diversity in the composition of the
   leaders in terms of the extent to which their career trajectories are
   embedded in the EU arena.},

Title = {Trotskyism against the Argentine agrarian question. The case of Politica
   Obrera in the 1970s},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {4041-4062},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The convulsed 1970s in Argentina was marked by an increase in social
   conflict in different areas. Historiography has studied in depth the
   conflicts of the working and student world, and the actions of the left.
   However, there are only a few studies on the agrarian insurgency and the
   updating, since the 1950s, of the so-called ``agrarian question{''}. In
   this work we examine the treatment that this problem received from a
   Trotskyist party, Politica Obrera, in the 1970s. We study the way in
   which he described the Argentine agrarian structure, identified the
   problems of the revolution in that area, and developed a specific
   intervention in the field. To do this, we selected a documentary
   heritage nurtured from the internal documents that emerged from
   congresses, and its periodic press that allows us to reconstruct their
   positions linked to the political situation. Our hypothesis is that,
   based on a tradition in which the peasantry had an accessory role (as
   opposed to other traditions such as Maoism and Guevarism), those who
   were affiliated with Trotsky's ideas, gave little importance to agrarian
   problems. nationals. However, the socio-economic structure of the
   country forced them to adopt definitions on the matter, which ultimately
   led to a superficial analysis that was very closely related to those
   rival traditions (Maoism, Guevarism and Stalinism).},

Abstract = {Based on the proposal of disciplinary opening of the social sciences,
   breaking with the compartmentalization of knowledge of Wallerstein
   (2006), in this article an approach to the Spanish Childhood and
   Adolescence Protection System (SPIA) is carried out from a close
   critical-constructive approach to the Epistemologies of the South (ES)
   of Boaventura de Sousa Santos. For this decolonial approach, the south
   is a metaphor for human suffering, a consequence of the current
   socio-political context that is in its phase of neoliberal capitalist
   globalization that encourages the emergence of a corporate fascism that
   expels the different and / or denies their existence. In the case that
   concerns us through an expert government of the other non-families, from
   the establishment of hegemonic forms of parenting, the result of a
   certain system of values and beliefs, which subjugate, colonize and
   dominate profane knowledge based on everyday life and adaptive common
   sense. These self-organized families in conflict with the SPIA
   articulate non-violent actions of resistance, interpreting the
   confrontation as the engine of social transformation.},

Abstract = {The article evaluates the evolution of the Cuban economic reform
   embodied in the Guidelines on the Economic and Social Policy of the
   Party and the Revolution. Almost a decade after its approval, we assess
   progress and shortcomings while pointing out obstacles for the process
   to advance, together with suggestions on courses of action to continue
   the reform. After referring to previous attempts of economic change, we
   analyze the advancement of the Guidelines until 2019, a key year for
   Cuba since a new Constitution was approved. For this assessment were
   examined macroeconomic indicators, policy makers' public discourse and
   academic papers published by renowned scholars of Cuban economy and
   society. The analysis of the international situation was considered with
   an emphasis on Cuba's condition as Small Island Developing State -a
   factor that has often been underestimated by policy makers as well as by
   critics of the Cuban model.},

   voter choices were strongly shaped by support for or opposition to the
   national parties in general and President Donald Trump in particular.
   Nationalization reached a new peak in its influence on state legislative
   elections in 2018, while cross-state variation in the extent of
   nationalization was associated with legislative polarization and the
   quality of the state-legislative-information environment.},

Abstract = {This article provides an interpretation about the political practice of
   the Spartacus Communist League (LCE, by its spanish acronym) during its
   political presence. From the disperse knowledge about it and first hand
   sources I propose a preliminary balance, extract some conclusions and
   point out several ways to develop future research. Such and organism
   constitutes a case that shows an aspect of the reconfiguration of global
   consciousness about revolutionary change of society in the decade of
   1960. Making revolution in its own country meant not only to build up a
   political direction instrument but also to root in social tissue, task
   that the LCE directed with a great development among the student
   movement. The political organization systematized the given experiences
   in this social segment and the new struggle forms that emerged,
   considering the need of recurring to all forms of fight -from the
   electoral way up to the armed confrontation-. The course and ending of
   the student-popular movement of 1968 required it to consider the
   development of mass politics in a period of the sharpening of repression
   coming from the State. But external pressures did not crush this
   political expression, but tensions not solved in the internal
   discussion. Thus, the LCE faded living behind political cadres that
   became part of several social and political processes in forthcoming
   decades.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the study of Soviet identity, which the authors
   refer to as Homo sovieticus. The research is developed in the
   spatio-temporal explications of the successor states of the Soviet
   mentality and former satellites of the Soviet system, presented by
   ideological and semantic intentions from different periods of the Soviet
   Union's existence to the present day. Therefore, the topicality of the
   research is due to cultural and civilizational transformations caused by
   changes in identification processes in Eastern Europe, as well as
   socio-political threats generated by them.
   The peculiarity of the article is its methodological basis: the
   principles of phenomenology and hermeneutics. The specificity of the use
   of philosophical hermeneutics was the need to reveal and interpret
   hidden or sharpened (overly expressive) meanings-expressions of texts,
   because the authors in their original theses set the task to rely solely
   on texts of artistic content and journalistic nature. The authorship of
   texts of these types determines the peculiarity of the phenomenological
   approach: own experience of a number of problems related to the identity
   of Homo sovieticus. Important in this context is the topic of time: the
   combination of retrospective view with modern experiences to meet the
   future. Based on these guidelines, the authors propose the concept of
   utterance to denote these literary and journalistic experiences in the
   broadest sense.
   The objective of the article is to determine the general image of Homo
   sovieticus in terms of retrospection and modernity. The peculiarity of
   this definition are the sources: (1) artistic and journalistic works of
   those authors who managed to escape from this method of
   self-identification (emigrant refugees); or (2) victims of violence with
   such an identity ({''}court poets{''}); respectively (3) those who in
   every way fixes in the past or continue to do so today, thus resisting
   this value orientation in the outlined region (modern
   intellectuals-writers). The authors of the article define such tasks as
   (1) the description of the contexts of the existence of the Soviet man
   as determining factors of the formation of Homo sovieticus identity; (2)
   formulation of the main constant features of Homo sovieticus; (3) modem
   receptions regarding the value matrix of Homo sovieticus in the dynamics
   of current challenges.
   The authors conclude that the entire post-Soviet space is experiencing
   contextual metamorphoses regarding the restoration renewal of the Homo
   sovieticus identity type to varying degrees. The means of identifying
   these processes is a clear articulation of the constant features of this
   type in the comparative context with modem events of cultural and
   political nature. Finally, the authors argue that the best way to
   objectify these processes is artistic and scientific-journalistic
   literature.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to assessing the state of Russian soft power. The
   author was prompted to address this topic by a contradiction. On the one
   hand, a review of the scientific literature shows that experts
   appreciate the level of development ot' Russia's soft power in the near
   abroad. On the other hand, international political analysts state that
   the CIS States have chosen one or another form of multi-vector activity
   in the international arena, and Moscow's influence in the post-Soviet
   space has been declining in the past few years. Based on a Grounded
   theory developed by A. Strauss and J. Corbin, which analyzed the policy
   documents of political parties that passed national parliaments, the
   author comes to a number of conclusions. The attitude of party and
   political elites to Russia differs from one country to another and is
   inversely dependent on the attitude to the EU. When assessing the impact
   of Russia's soft power, it is necessary to follow an ``individual{''}
   (country) approach rather than a region-wide one.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {The rise of Bolsonaro is the latest episode of what seems to be a
   Brazilian tradition of electing rightwing populists as a response to
   corruption, bad economic management, and disenchantment with mainstream
   political parties. In previous opportunities, Brazilians elected Janio
   Quadros (1960) and Fernando Collor (1989). However, Bolsonaro, although
   very similar to both Quadros and Collor on their hostility to parties
   and legislative institutions, brought novel elements. To identify the
   distinguishing features of Brazil's new president, we systematically
   compare Quadros, Collor, and Bolsonaro along 13 dimensions encompassing
   political context and attributes, policy choices, and institutional
   relations. Our findings indicate that throughout 2019, Bolsonaro led an
   unstable minority administration that governed for a minority in society
   and emphatically excluded some relevant sectors. Moreover, he
   established close connections with Evangelical groups and the military,
   and attacked the press and the Supreme Court at an unprecedented level.},

Abstract = {The Uruguayan political system underwent major changes during 2019. The
   Frente Amplio (Broad Front, FA), a center-left party that had been in
   office since 2005, lost the national elections against a coalition of
   center-right parties. This article illustrates the importance of
   economic variables in presidential elections in Uruguay. The latter
   coalition was named Coalicion Multicolor (Multicolor Coalition) and was
   led by Luis Lacalle Pou from the Partido Nacional (Partido Nacional,
   PN). The 2019 national election results yielded not only a government
   turnover but also a restructuring of the parties on the political right.
   A new rightist party, Cabildo Abierto (CA), had a meteoric rise. Led by
   a former Army Commander-in-Chief, CA managed to win 10\% of the votes
   and has become a key actor in the government coalition.},

Abstract = {The share of parliamentarians of non-European origin in the parliaments
   of Western Europe is steadily increasing given mass immigration in the
   recent decades. Studying distinguishing features of the political
   behavior of immigrants is becoming particularly relevant. Does the
   expansion of the representation of ethnic minorities in the highest
   authorities lead to the radicalization of their demands or, on the
   contrary, stimulate integration into the host community? In order to
   answer this question, the author turns to the experience of Great
   Britain, which has more than a century-long history of the presence of
   immigrants among its parliamentarians (MPs).
   Having carefully analyzed the life trajectories of British MPs of
   non-European descent since their first appearance in the House of
   Commons, the author reveals a clear tendency that the share of
   particularists, those focused on aggressively defending the narrow
   interests of their own ethnic group or immigrant communities per se, was
   decreasing, while the number of generalists, who position themselves as
   Britons and aim to represent all their constituents, regardless of their
   race, ethnicity or religion, was increasing. While back in 1987,
   particularists and radicals constituted 100\% of all non-white
   parliamentarians in the English Parliament, in 2017 they constituted
   only 8\%. His research suggests that increasing the participation of
   immigrants in the political life of their new homeland helps to weaken
   group thinking and reduce demand for particularist policy.},

Title = {A New Model of Corporatism in States Governed by Populist Political
   Parties: The Cases of Poland and Hungary},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-195},
Abstract = {Between 1945 and 2010 three main types of corporatism were discussed in
   the political science literature: the `classic' and `lean' corporatism
   that existed in the West European countries and the `illusory'
   corporatism that dominated in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989. The
   aim of the paper is to examine whether a new version of corporatism,
   which I call `patronage' corporatism, emerged in Hungary and Poland
   during the first term of the governments formed by populist political
   parties (in Hungary between 2010 and 2014 and in Poland between 2015 and
   2019). In patronage corporatism the authorities autonomously conduct
   heterodox economic policy. They enter into alliances only with
   ideologically close trade unions. While their cronies legitimize
   authorities' decisions at the governmental level vis-a-vis the citizens
   and at the international level, the government fulfils some of their
   socio-economic and organizational demands. Furthermore, the government
   cooperates with its allies to destroy other trade unions that are
   perceived as hostile towards the authorities. The paper shows that the
   capture of power by populist parties in Hungary and Poland led to the
   development of patronage corporatism in these countries.},

Abstract = {Over the last decades, extreme right parties in Europe have experienced
   a fast growth that, in some European countries, situate them as possible
   governing parties. They are political formations with a sharp xenophobic
   and populist discourse, which seeks benefit from the weaknesses of the
   ``traditional parties{''} to climb in the power structures. In countries
   such as France, The Netherlands or Austria, these political formations
   have reached a strong popular support, while in other countries such as
   Spain or Portugal, the radical right barely gets political space and its
   discourse has very limited impact among electorates. Howewer, the
   emergence of VOX substantially modifies the spanish political
   chessboard. The objective of this article is to analyze the factors that
   have hindered the emergence of far-right parties in Spain through the
   analysis of data and the comparison with some other European countries.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a multi-dimensional crisis that
   encompasses both the realm of public health and political economy. The
   divergences in the public health and economic policy responses among
   countries have resulted in an unleashing of a propaganda war. This paper
   is concerned with hegemonic narratives advocated by the mainstream media
   about China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the facts thereof.
   After examining in broad outline the temporal trajectory of the public
   health response in China and its underlying factors, the paper goes on
   to critically examine some contentious issues concerning the public
   health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China that have been
   highlighted in the hegemonic narrative in the propaganda war over the
   COVID-19 pandemic. It is submitted that the divergence in the public
   health response of different countries is intimately related to the
   varied state of the neoliberal project therein. The paper concludes with
   a brief engagement with the political economy of the hegemonic narrative
   in the propaganda war.},

Abstract = {Otto Hintze was an excellent example of the cultural turmoil that hit
   historical and political studies in the great crisis between nineteenth
   and twentieth centuries, with respect to the destiny of the European
   tradition and its projection in a political world dominated by new
   universalistic perspectives. Hintze moved thus between a historiography
   which was for long time attentive to the Prussian case - which he
   considered almost a paradigm of the modern State - and political
   science, in constant tension with Weber's contemporary foundation of a
   comprehensive sociology. The essay attempts to investigate the
   foundational question of legitimacy as the deepest and most innovative
   character of Hintze's work.},

Title = {Depriving the Debtor's Essential Obligation of its Substance and its
   Remedies under the Provisions of Article 1170 of the French Civil Code},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {129-143},
Abstract = {In 1994 and thereafter, the French judiciary set a trend by utilizing
   the causation theory to revoke the exemption clauses of liability that
   constitute a violation of the contract's essential obligations. This
   utilization was intended to restore economic equilibrium to the
   contract, in order to achieve the benefit each party seeks from
   concluding a contract. However, in 2016, the new amendments of the
   French civil code -which were issued by decree no: 131-2016- abolished
   the causation theory in general. Nevertheless, they retained the
   previous French judicial trend based on causation theory, where Article
   1170 of the new amendments states clearly ``any contract term which
   deprives a debtor's essential obligation of its substance is deemed not
   written{''}. However, Article 1170 of the new amendments did not specify
   what is meant by an essential obligation? When does the contract's term
   result in depriving the debtor's essential obligation of its substance?
   Moreover, Article 1170 consolidates an individual penalty which may
   cause many legal problems. These problems are: the matter concerns an
   essential clause in the contract and not a secondary one, the other
   clauses of the contract remain valid as they have been, without any
   modifications or replacements and, in some cases, abolishing the clause
   itself might lead to further imbalance in the contract. Therefore, the
   legal provisions of Article 1170 should be analyzed in an analytical
   approach along with the previous French judicial trend with respect to
   these provisions. As a result, the research illustrates the urgent need
   to amend Article 1170 of the new amendments, in order to contribute to
   the stability of the economic contractual equilibrium.},

Abstract = {At Bank Melli Iran, which is the site of research, there are different
   opinions and views on quantum leadership, each of which is representing
   a specific intellectual model on the subject. These diverse opinions
   form a space for discourse. This study will identify this discursive
   space in detail and also analyze it in order to reveal organizational
   models to present strategies to plan the improvement of Bank Melli's
   policies and plans. The methodology used in this research is Q-sort or
   Q-methodology. This methodology was able to reveal several courses in
   the speech forum. Studying discursive space, 74 factors were detected.
   In analyzing these propositions, finally, 59 factors formalized Q
   expressions. These propositions that form the Q order, were written by
   paras on 59 cards. A sample of Bank Melli managers was then selected
   using Q-sort arrange for these cards on the Q-chart using defined
   instructions. In interpreting and the results obtained, three large
   models were identified including the ambassadors of change, the pioneers
   of protection and the drivers of stability.},

Title = {Decentralisation and central-local relations: the case of policing and

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {254-271},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, British governments have advocated a combined
   policing and health policy based on the premise that everyday more
   people come to police attention due to mental illness issues. Central
   authorities emphasise co-produced local community initiatives including
   street triage and clinical liaison and diversion programmes as
   mechanisms for better managing mental health issues. The model of
   governance of policing and mental health developed by the Conservative
   governments emphasises a decentralisation of services as a means of
   better managing local demands. Consequently, much of the policy burden
   falls upon local police forces and the austerity-afflicted NHS
   overstressing the front lines of delivery. We argue that this rationale
   challenges the traditionally established model of central-local
   governance which saw local authorities implementing national policy.
   However, whilst central government has shifted responsibility for
   services to local deliverers, the structural and policy barriers to an
   integrated approach to mental health and policing have proven difficult
   to change when directed from the centre of government. The executive's
   continuous direction of policy in a climate of austerity politics
   triggers not only a debate on the sustainability of local governance but
   also with regard to what power of delivery local institutions have. We
   conclude that the nature of governmental decentralisation on
   cross-sectorial policymaking can jeopardise the creation of sustainable
   local governance practices.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {The article attempts to polemically challenge the main methodological
   approaches to the specification of politics and power, developed and
   promoted by the authors of the monograph ``Domination versus politics:
   the Russian case. The effectiveness of the institutional structure and
   the potential of strategies for political change{''}, published in 2019
   by the ``Political Encyclopedia Publishers{''}. The assessment of this
   work is generally positive. At the same time, the authors of the
   monograph use the Aristotelian-Arendian paradigm, which carries visible
   signs of historical and theoretical fatigue, as a cognitive basis for
   characterizing the modem space of politics and power. As part of the
   polemic with the authors of the monograph, the article notes that the
   colonization of official structures and institutions of power in a
   modern state by informal networks of the ruling elite increasingly
   limits the tools of public policy in making state decisions. Assumptions
   are made about the main trends in the evolution of relations between the
   elite and non-elite strata in the modem state, and about the further
   narrowing of the social space for ``citizens' politics{''}.},

Title = {Is the European Migration Crisis Caused by Russian Hybrid Warfare?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {44-53},
Abstract = {Recent developments in European security situation, starting with the
   Russia-Ukraine conflict, followed by the complicated Brexit and
   political instability in the Middle East and North Africa, have given
   rise to instability in the European Union. Yet, none of the other
   factors could be compared with the risks caused by the massive influx of
   refugees into the EU that challenges both solidarity and responsibility
   of the member states. In this context, it is extremely important to
   understand the actual security threats related to the refugee crisis and
   the root causes of growing refugee flows. This article discusses the
   roots of large-scale migration flows in the European Union (EU) over the
   present decade and investigates the potential link between migration
   flows and modern hybrid warfare, referring to the coordination of
   various modes of warfare, such as military and non-military means,
   conventional and non-conventional capabilities, state and non-state
   actors with an aim to cause instability and disarrangement. It is
   intriguing to investigate whether the increase in migration flows could
   be linked to present confrontation in the global arena on the
   Russia-West axis. Common patterns of migration flows from Syria and
   Ukraine to the EU are discussed, as well as policy recommendations are
   given to diminish the negative impact of similar events in the future.},

Abstract = {The set of investigations and operations that under the name Operacao
   Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) carried out in Brazil in recent years,
   culminated in the imprisonment of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da
   Silva. The political situation created, with the impeachment of
   President Dilma Rouseff, and the appointment of her Vice-President
   Michel Temer as President, set the stage for the triumph of President
   Jair Bolsonaro. Based on the assumptions about the systemic code
   ``power-not power{''}, and the autonomy of the powers (Executive,
   Legislative, Judicial), the objective of this work is to describe and
   identify these processes in the analysis plane of communications between
   the political-administrative and legal systems. As conclusions, we
   formulate the hypothesis about the limited autonomy between the powers
   and the porous limits between them, as a cause that stops an effective
   fight against corruption.},

Abstract = {Economic globalization has been accompanied by the cross-border
   development of class relations. Resting on large-scale cross-border
   operations by transnational corporations, capital is accelerating the
   formation of a transnational capitalist class. The capitalist world has
   formed new, contradictory relations based on a multitude of existing
   inherent contradictions, rendering the world situation still more
   complex. In the late twentieth century, a number of scholars began to
   focus on this phenomenon, discussing various of its aspects such as the
   gap between rich and poor brought about by the formation of a
   transnational capitalist class on a global scale; the transnational
   capitalist class and the question of global hegemony; and the relation
   between the transnational capitalist class and the world system. Their
   discussions have since attracted the attention of Chinese scholars. This
   paper presents a basic theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon
   using the methodology of historical materialism, while also summarizing
   and commenting on the opinions of representative scholars.},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-40},
Abstract = {Of all the past efforts to reconcile Marxism and religiosity, the
   ``god-building{''} episode within the Russian Social Democratic Labor
   Party (RSDLP) is especially fascinating. Situating god building in its
   historical context, amidst the reaction that followed the revolutionary
   defeat of 1905, this essay reconstructs the intellectual drama which
   subsequently ensued. Maksim Gorkii and Anatolii Lunacharskii emerge as
   the progenitors and main protagonists of the god-building current, in
   debate with more orthodox Marxists like Plekhanov and Lenin. God
   building was articulated in a number of different literary forms, from
   poems and letters to novels, articles, and even philosophical treatises.
   Ultimately, the objections raised by Lenin and others are found to be
   more in line with the views of Marx and Engels, though god building does
   pose important questions about the redeemable content of religious
   belief.`},

Abstract = {The logic behind redistribution theories is that incumbents target
   benefits to build and sustain linkages with voters. However, a recent
   literature shows that some benefits can have a countervailing effect in
   environments plagued by clientelism: by permanently boosting voters'
   incomes, irrevocable and durable benefits might reduce their dependence
   on incumbents. This article explains how parties strategically allocate
   these benefits when trading off the income effect relative to the
   standard electoral rewards of redistribution. The theory highlights a
   previously unstudied rationale to target opposition areas: to weaken
   voters' dependence on machines. The framework is tested with
   administrative data on the allocation of cisterns by state governments
   across Brazilian semi-arid municipalities, where clientelism is rampant.
   States favor areas governed by copartisans, but only where local
   clientelistic mobilization is weak. Where it is strong, states favor
   municipalities led by the opposition, while avoiding their own local
   strongholds.},

Abstract = {Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971) is perhaps the best known North American
   theologian of the twentieth century. Over the course of his life he was
   a Christian socialist, pacifist, a staunch anti-communist, and an
   architect of vital-centre liberalism. Niebuhr wrote on themes as diverse
   as war, democracy, world order, political economy and race. So
   significant was Niebuhr's intellectual influence that George Kennan once
   described him as `the father of us all'. Indeed, from the thought of
   Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter, Martin Luther King Jr. to Arthur
   Schlesinger Jr., Hans Morgenthau to Kenneth Waltz, E.H. Carr to Jean
   Bethke Elshtain, Niebuhr has helped shape International Relations.
   Bringing together intellectual historians and international political
   theorists, this special issue asks whether Niebuhr's thought remains
   relevant to our times? Can he help us think about democracy, power,
   race, the use of force, and cruelty in a moment when ethnonationalism
   appears ascendant and democracy in decline?},

Abstract = {Love has been long lauded for its salvific potential in U.S. anti-racist
   rhetoric. Yet, what does it mean to speak or act in love's name to
   redress racism? Turning to the work of the North American public
   intellectual and theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971), this essay
   explores his contribution to normative theory on love's role in the work
   of racial justice. Niebuhr was a staunch supporter of civil rights, and
   many prominent figures of the movement such as James Cone, Jesse
   Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., J. Deotis Roberts and Cornel West drew
   on his theology. Indeed, Niebuhr underscores love's promise and perils
   in politics, and its potential to respond to racism via the work of
   critique, compassion, and coercion. Engaging with Niebuhr's theology on
   love and justice, then, not only helps us recover a rich realist
   resource on racism, but also an ethic of realism as antiracism.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democrats have abandoned the ideal of consensus in favour
   of a range of different, more realistic alternatives. But these
   alternatives provide little anchorage to guide or even evaluate
   deliberative practice - something acutely problematic given the
   contemporary context of accelerating polarization in many advanced
   liberal democracies. In this article, we turn to Stalnaker's account of
   the `common ground' - the shared pool of information that is agreed upon
   by the parties to a discourse - to reassert a distinct ideal standard
   for democratic deliberation which remains malleable enough to apply
   across messy contexts of real-world political contestation and debate.
   Our account offers an appropriate normative yardstick by which to assess
   deliberative practices across different discursive contexts, as well as
   impetus for further experimentation and innovation in efforts towards
   democratic renewal and reform.},

Abstract = {Deinstitutionalization heavily implicates Medicaid policy since waivers
   for home and community-based services have provided the means to realize
   the community integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act
   (1990) and the Supreme Court's Olmstead (1999) decision. Despite
   tremendous advances toward community living, several components of
   Medicaid's design and implementation continue to create barriers for
   people with disabilities who want to live independently in the
   community. This article draws on knowledge produced from the lived
   experience of disability to identify five issues with Medicaid policy
   that prevent it from living up to the promise of the ADA and the
   Olmstead ruling: (1) institutional bias, (2) federalist structure, (3)
   work disincentives, (4) red tape and administrative burden, and (5) low
   reimbursement rates for personal care attendants. The wider implication
   of the analysis is that deinstitutionalization involves more simply
   closing institutions. Active measures to promote community integration
   are also vital.},

Title = {From chasing populists to deconstructing populism: A new
   multidimensional approach to understanding and comparing populism},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This paper challenges some widespread theoretical assumptions and
   practices in the study of populism and proposes a new multidimensional
   approach to generate and analyse data on this latent construct. Rather
   than focusing on categorising subjects as populists or not, it
   recommends reaching a better understanding of what populism is, the
   salience and relative weight of its attributes and how they interact
   creating an inner populist logic.
   Despite the increasing media and academic attention, historical
   discrepancies in how to conceptualise and operationalise populism have
   hindered cumulative progress in the literature. Initially most efforts
   were devoted to the study of specific movements, without a clear
   comparative angle, and the concept of populism was often conflated with
   that of nationalism. When the literature started to pay more attention
   to the analysis of the attributes associated with populism serious
   disagreements emerged concerning its true essence. Populism has been
   conceptualised as an ideology, a cynical strategy, a performative style
   and a discursive logic of articulation. The disputes between these
   competing interpretations have arguably slowed down the generation of
   comparative data.
   Although this article is meant to be a critique of the current state of
   the field and a call to make it pivot into a slightly different
   direction, it does not adopt an iconoclast stance and largely tries to
   reconcile the different existing research traditions - ideational,
   discursive, performative and strategic. It shows that their efforts are
   to a great extent complementary but mostly operating on different rungs
   of the ladder of abstraction. This paper argues that shifting from
   minimal definitions into a multidimensional approach may stimulate the
   generation of comparative data on a wider range of attributes and
   facilitate the identification of degrees and varieties within populism.
   This paper develops a new analytical framework which deconstructs
   populism into five dimensions: (1) depiction of the polity, (2)
   morality, (3) construction of society, (4) sovereignty and (5)
   leadership. These dimensions, that synthesise the most influential
   conceptualisations of populism, are empirically and theoretically
   interconnected and encompass ideational, discursive and performative
   attributes suggested in the literature. These dimensions are in turn
   composed of lower order attributes forming a multilayered network
   structure. This multidimensional framework provides a heuristic template
   that can be adapted and operationalised in diverse ways depending on the
   hypotheses, type of data and subjects of the analysis. Some examples of
   how to turn these dimensions into variables to capture supply- and
   demand-side populism are introduced. Future empirical research could
   help map and better understand the network of interactions and
   intersections among these dimensions and attributes. This could be the
   key to settle some of the current conceptual debates about populism and
   its varieties.},

Abstract = {The following paper presents a new political speech analysis tool,
   focused on persuasion, the relationship between speaker and audience,
   and the use of power throughout the spoken word. The speech analysed has
   been A New Beginnings, delivered by Barack Obama on 2009. The tool,
   developed firstly for Rodriguez de las Heras in 1983 and adapted
   secondly by Bermudez Vazquez on 2016, includes seven categories of
   rhetorical strategies, which have been detected along the speech. The
   results confirm the established understanding about Obama ` s message,
   the beginning of a new and friendly political relationship with Muslim
   people's countries, however it shows a leadership factor as well from
   the United States within the friendship.},

Abstract = {This article examines Canada-US relations through their shared
   membership in a pluralistic security community (PSC). While the
   bilateral relationship has been turbulent for decades, the Trump
   presidency has damaged the Canada-US PSC by (1) exacerbating a
   decades-long trend of weakened shared identity and mutual trust between
   Canadians and Americans, and (2) undermining the democratic norms and
   institutions that uphold American domestic stability and Canadians'
   expectations of peaceful change. Assessing the combined implications of
   the decline in shared identity, mutual trust and democratic stability, I
   argue that the Canada-US PSC cannot endure if the United States does not
   also consider Canada's national and security interests or if the United
   States itself poses a threat to those interests. Given current trends,
   the future absence of war in North America may reflect American
   domination over a weaker and dependent Canada rather than their
   continued membership in a bilateral PSC.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the COVID-19 crisis has brought to light the
   importance of state democratic capacities linked with humanist
   governance. This requires securing individuals' silent freedoms as
   embedded in the way ``developmental{''} institutions that constitute
   social relations and well-being are governed. I argue health and
   well-being inequalities brought out by the crisis are but a
   manifestation of the way, in the context of the competition paradigm in
   global governance, states have become relatedly more punitive and
   dis-embedded from society. The answer lies in providing a more explicit
   defence of the features of a human development democratic state. An
   implication is to move democratic theory beyond the concern with
   redistributive and participatory features of democracy to consider
   foundational institutional properties of democratic deepening and
   freedom in society.},

Abstract = {Perception aggregated indicators like Corruption Perception Index have
   low specificity and actionability and even lower sensitivity to change
   due to their nature of aggregates of experts cores.
   The 2017 Index for Public Integrity, although more specific, is also not
   optimal to trace change across time due to its aggregation. After
   tracing each component of the index separately this paper proposes a
   trends analysis and a forecast based on disaggregated IPI component
   rather than the index itself. Using 12 years as a time interval and a
   three steps method a set of improvers, stationary and declining cases
   are proposed. The paper also suggests how the new tools should be used
   by promoters of good governance.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research shows that women legislators outperform their
   male counterparts in the legislative arena, but scholars have yet to
   examine whether this pattern emerges in non-policy aspects of
   representation. We conducted an audit study of 6,000 U.S. state
   legislators to analyze whether women outperform or underperform men on
   constituency service in light of the extra effort they spend on policy.
   We find that women are more likely to respond to constituent requests
   than men, even after accounting for their heightened level of policy
   activity. Female legislators are the most responsive in conservative
   districts, where women may see the barriers to their election as
   especially high. We then demonstrate that our findings are not a
   function of staff responsiveness, legislator ideology, or responsiveness
   to female constituents or gender issues. The results provide additional
   evidence that women perform better than their male counterparts across a
   range of representational activities.},

Abstract = {Identifying the sincerity of shifts in public opinion is difficult:
   survey settings involve social pressure to provide seemingly popular
   answers. Names for newborn children in the United States provide an
   alternative, behavioral measure that can indicate the presence of
   social-desirability bias. First names typically exceed middle names in
   visibility and hence sensitivity to social-desirability effects. First
   names should therefore be more likely to change when name-givers wish to
   conform to widespread sentiments they do not share. This hypothesis is
   explored during foreign-policy crises (rallies): French-derived first,
   but not middle, names declined as anti-French sentiment rose around the
   2003 Iraq War, yet no analogous divergence emerged after the 11
   September 2001 attacks. Treating all rallies as equally meaningful may
   then produce misleading analyses of public opinion; seeming waves in
   political views may reflect conformist dissimulation rather than actual
   attitudes.},
