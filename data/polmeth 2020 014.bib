Abstract = {This article is about the relationship between legal activists,
   foundations, and social movements. It is a study of the Mexican American
   Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) the largest and oldest
   Latino civil rights law organization in the United States. Established
   in 1968, MALDEF is an organization of cause lawyers, attorneys who
   devote most or part of their professional lives to or who are closely
   identified with social justice movements. MALDEF is primarily dependent
   on the Ford Foundation, which issued the first grant that created the
   organization. This essay is a study of MALDEF in its first five years of
   operation a time when community activists pressured its lawyers for
   legal representation while the Ford Foundation insisted that it
   concentrate on legal reform. These irreconcilable demands and MALDEF's
   compliance with the Ford Foundation's demands illustrates the impact
   that lawyers and philanthropy can have on the course of Latino social
   movement politics. This research also points to the impact that
   foundations, corporations, or wealthy individuals can have on the
   representation of minority political interests.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that a conception ofvulnerable
   recognitionaddresses both the shortcomings of conventional
   understandings of recognition and Patchen Markell's provocative critique
   (and abandonment) of recognition theory inBound by Recognition. First, I
   outline Markell's critique of conventional recognition theory and his
   call for the politics of recognition to be replaced by a politics of
   acknowledgement that turns toward the self and welcomes contingency.
   Second, I propose a reframing of recognition as vulnerable in response
   to conventional recognition theory's limitations. This more agonistic
   conception of recognition recaptures the dynamism of Hegelian
   recognition that has been lost in recent decades. It draws attention to
   the desires, structures, and practices that underpin misrecognition and
   calls for an embrace of vulnerability, ambiguity, and political risk.},

Abstract = {Without a strong state, how do institutions emerge to limit the impact
   of one group's predation on another's economic activities? Motivated by
   the case of northern Somalia, we develop a model that highlights the
   monitoring challenges that groups face in making cooperation
   self-enforcing, and two key factors that influence their likelihood of
   overcoming this challenge: the ratio of economic interests across
   productive and predatory sectors, and the existence of informal
   income-sharing institutions. Our model explains why conflicts between
   pirates and livestock traders can be resolved in the region of
   Somaliland, where the ratio of economic interests favors the productive
   sector and traditional institutions promote income sharing between
   groups, but not in the region of Puntland, where these conditions do not
   hold. The model also accounts for several of the empirical patterns in
   the relationships between piracy, livestock exports, and conflict in
   both regions.},

Title = {Domestic migrants' responsiveness to electoral mobilization under
   authoritarianism: Evidence from China's grassroots elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study examines citizens' responsiveness to electoral mobilization
   under authoritarianism by studying the turnout of domestic migrants in
   China's grassroots elections. While a large literature on authoritarian
   elections has focused on coercion and material benefits as tactics
   dictators often use to promote turnout, we argue that social pressure
   from the community and its leaders plays a crucial role in mobilizing
   authoritarian constituents. Employing data from the China Labor Dynamics
   Survey (2012), we show that migrants who share traits with local
   residents, such as dialect, are more likely to be mobilized to vote,
   because they are more responsive to local cadres' mobilization efforts
   and feel more connected to the community. Conversely, we find no support
   for an explanation rooted in channels of communication. We confirm the
   findings using an instrumental variable approach. Our findings imply
   that street-level mobilization for authoritarian elections takes
   advantage of various social factors in more subtle and embedded ways
   than is typically assumed.},

   the implementation of at least five alternative mechanisms for dialogue
   and negotiation with international participation. Their results have

   other hand, the British context, characterized by higher welfare
   provision relative to the USA, exhibits a narrowing and closing of the
   gender gap for younger generations, for two out of three indicators of
   spending preferences. These findings provide some, albeit mixed,
   evidence that women are more consistently in favour of social spending
   and redistribution than men in contexts characterized by low welfare
   provision such as the USA. Where there are higher levels of social
   support, we argue women could become increasingly more likely to express
   a preference for levels of spending and redistribution that is similar
   to men's, narrowing the gender gap among younger generations.},

Abstract = {The article examined the influence of the European crisis politics on
   French labour market regulation. The European crisis management has
   resulted in institutionalised interventionism, that restraint the
   European Union member states' ability to regulate her national labour
   markets. France was less affected by the crisis but it was also in the
   focus of the European interventionism. On the basis of the labour market
   reforms `Loi Macron' and `Loi El Khomri', the article investigates what
   role the European institutions play and how big was the influence of the
   European Union in the national negotiation process.},

Abstract = {We identify situations in which conditioning on text can address
   confounding in observational studies. We argue that a matching approach
   is particularly well-suited to this task, but existing matching methods
   are ill-equipped to handle high-dimensional text data. Our proposed
   solution is to estimate a low-dimensional summary of the text and
   condition on this summary via matching. We propose a method of text
   matching, topical inverse regression matching, that allows the analyst
   to match both on the topical content of confounding documents and the
   probability that each of these documents is treated. We validate our
   approach and illustrate the importance of conditioning on text to
   address confounding with two applications: the effect of perceptions of
   author gender on citation counts in the international relations
   literature and the effects of censorship on Chinese social media users.},

Title = {The hostile media: politicians' perceptions of coverage bias},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Politicians seem to be increasingly criticising the traditional news
   media for being biased. While scholars usually argue that politicians
   make such claims out of strategic concerns - they try to undermine the
   credibility of the potentially harmful media - it might as well be that
   they actually believe there is a bias in traditional news coverage.
   Though this so-called hostile media effect - the idea that news content
   is biased against one's own ideas or party - is often studied with
   citizens, it has rarely been examined among politicians. However, in
   this paper it is studied, drawing on a unique survey in which 183
   Belgian politicians were asked to what extent they perceived different
   media outlets to produce (un)favourable coverage about their party. The
   exploration shows that politicians, in general, have the tendency to
   perceive the news media as slightly biased against their party.
   Importantly, media hostility perceptions are more outspoken among
   politicians from right-wing parties and among politicians in high-level
   functions. Interestingly, politicians' perceptions of partisan bias
   differ across outlets; especially the outlets that are used by non-party
   voters are considered to be biased.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {502-520},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is widespread agreement that both tiers of a mixed-member
   electoral system do not operate independently of one another and that
   instead they interact, producing contamination effects. These tend to
   raise the number of parties away from what Duverger's Law or theM + 1
   rule suggest. However, the field has not yet determined an undisputed
   methodological approach to answer the following question: raised by how
   much, exactly? This paper identifies and differentiates amongst three
   major measurement techniques, herein titled the Difference Approach, the
   Likeness Approach, and the Simulation Approach. By doing so, it provides
   a more concise map of each of their logics, their varied
   implementations, their drawbacks, as well as possible ways forward.},

Abstract = {Robert Mugabe's dominance in Zimbabwean politics post-independence has
   led critics to argue that politics in Zimbabwe is personal and
   patriarchal. Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
   Front (ZANU PF)'s alleged use of violence, violent discourse, and other
   unorthodox power retention strategies have been used to justify claims
   that Zimbabwean politics is the politics of chaos. In this post-colonial
   (mis)reading of African politics, ZANU PF and Mugabe discourses have
   been labeled nativism, patriotic history, Mugabeism, grotesque
   nationalism, etc. However, these studies have either been uncritically
   pro- or anti-ZANU PF (Moore 2012). The paper, through an analysis of
   ZANU PF's rebranding of Mugabe in the July 2013 elections, suggests a
   new multitheoretical approach to overcome this uncritical reading of
   Zimbabwe's political branding practices. The suggested approach utilizes
   insights gleaned from sign theory, political branding and/or advertising
   theory, post-colonial theory, and decolonial theory.},

Abstract = {The intent of the paper is to analyze two narratives about the
   remarkable turn-around of Germany in the 1990s as sick man of Europe to
   today's most successful economy in the EU. Ordoliberalism is used by
   German policy makers and elites to account for the economic success
   story without taking into account the Euro currency regime which has
   overwhelmingly favoured Germany's export-orientation. Ordoliberalism as
   an ideational concept has limited value as an explanatory force. As a
   result, German ordoliberal ideas have little current value to uphold it
   as a panacea for indebted peripheral countries to become more
   competitive. Nor are stories about theordoliberalization of
   Europejustified. The recourse to ordoliberal positions is a highly
   superficial adaptation of ordoliberalism by German policy makers lacking
   greater theoretical potency. Thus neither in law nor in economics are
   authors to be found who represent a genuinely ordoliberal approach to
   explain the German success story or for that matter the Eurozone crisis
   management.},

Abstract = {A growing body of empirical work suggests that identifying the actors
   formally tasked with implementing policy can focus attention away from
   incumbent politicians. We examine the effects on blame attribution and
   voting intention of (a) the identifiability of a responsible policy
   worker (administrator), and (b) the evaluability of the policy work or
   outcome (policy failure), in the context of programs at two federal
   agencies (loans by the Small Business Administration and inspections by
   the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Using a set of online survey
   experiments with 1105 US adults, we find that the evaluability of a
   (negative) outcome generally reduces voting intention, but that the
   identifiability of a policy worker (administrator) tends to shift blame
   away from the incumbent politician and thus to increase voting
   intention. These experimental findings provide at least partial support
   for our theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {It is a well-established empirical finding that governments on average
   lose votes during their time in office. This exploratory analysis
   examines whether all members of coalition governments suffer the
   electoral cost of governing equally. Using electoral data from 20
   parliamentary systems from 1961 to 2015, I compare the electoral
   performance of junior coalition members, the prime minister of a
   coalition, and single-party governments. Furthermore, I examine the
   conditioning effects of economic performance, legislative institutions
   as well as party ideology and size. I find that there are substantial
   differences in the electoral cost of governing for different types of
   coalition participation. The evidence suggests that the prime minister
   in a coalition is partially insulated from the penalties of government
   and thus should try to attract junior coalition members whenever
   possible.},

Abstract = {The confrontational or adversarial approach is one of the main factors
   that forms the basis of the criminal justice system. However, its
   application in the pre-trial phase is limited. Therefore, this document
   aims to demonstrate the importance of analyzing theoretical and
   practical problems. The choice of documentary and casuistic methodology
   allowed the following conclusions to be reached: Currently, the Russian
   police are undergoing changes that aim to humanize the criminal process,
   to solve fundamental challenges in the protection of the rights, liberty
   and interests of a person in the pre-trial investigation that will
   guarantee the confrontation system in criminal proceedings. We conducted
   a comparative legal investigation and analyzed criminal case files, as
   well as the results of questionnaire surveys conducted among
   investigators and attorneys. Overall, the results represent the actual
   state of cases in the pre-trial phase and help determine areas of
   development. We propose feasible changes to the criminal procedure
   legislation of the Russian Federation that will eliminate the disparity
   between some of its regulations and the requirements of the
   confrontation system in general.},

Abstract = {Scholars of electoral behaviour regularly link political dissatisfaction
   to two types of behaviour: voting for populist parties and unstable
   voting behaviour. It is therefore not surprising that the electorates of
   populist parties are generally assumed to be rather volatile. In this
   article, we argue that this is not necessarily the case - in particular
   in a context of increasingly strong and viable populist parties. We make
   use of data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems project to
   show that voters for populist parties are neither more nor less volatile
   than voters for mainstream parties. Political dissatisfaction among
   voters for populist parties even increases the likelihood of stable
   voting for populist parties. The supply of populist parties further
   conditions the stability of the populist vote, as voters in systems with
   established populist parties are more likely to vote stably for populist
   parties. Finally, we find that in a context of strong and stable
   populist parties, the effect of political satisfaction on vote switching
   is somewhat reduced.},

Abstract = {Indigenous Americans are unique in the American political landscape.
   They are citizens of sovereign tribal nations as well as the US. The
   relationship of the tribes and their citizens with the US has a unique
   and sordid past. This has led many to argue that Indigenous Americans
   will be unique in their political behaviors. To test this expectation as
   well as to fill a void in our understanding of the voting rates of
   Indigenous Americans in US National elections, we compare the voting
   rates of Indigenous Americans from 2006 through 2016 to other Americans,
   and compare the correlates of their voting with that of Americans
   generally. Using Current Population Survey and Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study data, we find little evidence that the voting rates of
   Indigenous Americans are particularly unique, their voting rates near
   that of other racial or ethnic minorities, and the correlates of their
   voting are not unique.},

Abstract = {The problem of political action has its roots, arguably, in the sixth
   book of theNicomachean Ethics, where Aristotle seeks to describe an
   intellectual virtue -phronesis- that is different from the faculty of
   theoretical reason but that is nonetheless capable of producing
   genuinely objective, rational knowledge, i.e., knowledge of what is
   true. The problem, specifically, is to understand how such a thing is
   possible, and much of the recent literature appears to suggest that
   perhaps it's not. Since rhetoric, persuasion, interest and emotion are
   obviously central features of political life, it may seem that some kind
   of non-intellectualist and non-rationalist perspective must be the way
   to go. I argue, nonetheless, that any such account is, and cannot but
   be, deeply problematic; and I defend, by way of contrast, a decidedly
   intellectualistic understanding of political enterprise.},

Abstract = {Using a modified theoretical model derived from the work of Joseph Nye,
   this paper argues that Russian media have conducted a soft power
   campaign in Germany that targets that country's Russian-speaking
   population. Among a portion of the target group, Kremlin-funded outlets
   have succeeded in encouraging skepticism of German culture and
   authorities while presenting Russian culture and government as
   representative of a superior alternative value system. These conditions
   have helped generate political disruption (significant Russian-German
   support for the right-wing populist party Alternative fur Deutschland)
   and physical unrest (a protest over the purported rape of a Russian girl
   by migrants).},

Abstract = {In the post-9/11 era and now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   meaning of security and the means of ensuring it have radically changed.
   As a NATO member state situated in a geography that poses multiple
   threats to its security and even existence, Turkey seeks to maintain its
   own domestic and regional security while contributing to a global
   environment of peace and order. The unique threats posed to Turkey by
   domestic and regional terrorism and the ongoing conflict in Syria in
   particular have prompted Ankara to invest in projects focused on the
   development of new technologies and, more broadly, in improvements in
   the country's indigenous defense industry. This commentary highlights a
   number of these projects, along with the factors that contribute to
   Turkey's present security outlook.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The philosopher Zhao Tingyang argues that some 3000 years ago there
   existed a meaningful Chinese tianxia, at the time of the classical Zhou
   Dynasty. But what does the term mean today? And what does it (or should
   it) mean in English? Just as the Greek word hegemonia became the English
   hegemony and the Latin word imperium became the English empire, the
   Chinese word tianxia is entering English-language political discourse as
   something related to, but distinct from, its original Chinese
   meaning(s). Like hegemony and empire before it, the English-language
   term tianxia is likely to lose its cultural specificity while retaining
   its structural implications. As a distinct form of secular international
   society organized around a central state, tianxia is less authoritative
   than hegemony, which is itself less authoritative than empire. As a
   result, a tianxia presupposes a certain community of spirit among its
   member states. One possible source of such community is world society,
   the society of all the individual people in the (or, in the past,
   ``a{''}) world. New political structures call for new terms to describe
   them, and tianxia may emerge as a useful supplement to empire and
   hegemony as a term to describe a more spiritual form of international
   society coordinated, but not dominated or ruled, by a single, central
   state.},

Abstract = {The unitary-federal dichotomy is used as a standard means for
   taxonomizing state forms. However, its classificatory power has been
   increasingly stretched by heterodox cases such as Spain, Italy, South
   Africa and, most recently, Bolivia. This article contends that Bolivia's
   constitutional changes have definitively challenged the long-standing
   assumption that the unitary-federal divide best serves the goal of an
   accurate taxonomization in the field of comparative federalism. Despite
   the noise Bolivia's latest constitutional reform has caused in the
   otherwise settled framework of comparative federalism's most basic
   concepts, scholarship is opting for the most comfortable choice by
   squeezing Bolivia into the unitary compartment. Subsequent to the
   screening of different types of taxonomic approaches, a new
   classificatory framework for state forms, based on a dichotomy that
   combines legal theory and the methodological tools of political science,
   is proposed and tested on the Bolivian case.},

   Democracy Must Necessarily Fail},

Abstract = {This article asks whether the analogy between state and firm is a
   promising strategy for promoting workplace democracy and provides a
   negative answer, explaining why analogical arguments are not a good
   strategy for justifying workplace democracy. The article contends that
   the state-firm analogy is misguided for at least three reasons: (1) it
   is structurally inconclusive, (2) it is based on a category mistake, and
   (3) it leads us away from the central question we should ask, which is:
   What would concretely imply, and what is required, in order to
   democratize the workplace? I begin by offering an interpretation of the
   state-firm analogy which shows that use of the analogical argument in
   Dahl's justification of workplace democracy engenders excessive and
   unnecessary theoretical costs which bear negatively on his conclusion. I
   then proceed to examine more recent contributions to the debate and show
   that supporters and critics of the state-firm analogy alike do not
   advance our understanding of the analogical argument. In the last part
   of the article I provide a general theoretical explanation of why
   arguments based on the state-firm analogy are not good candidates for
   defending workplace democracy.},

Abstract = {Contemporary writing on North African borderlands invokes the idea of a
   general, unregulated porosity through which small-scale informal traders
   of food or textiles move alongside drug smugglers and terrorists. I
   challenge that conception, demonstrating that the vast majority of
   smuggling activity is in fact highly regulated through a dense network
   of informal institutions that determine the costs, quantity, and types
   of goods that can pass through certain nodes, typically segmenting licit
   from illicit goods. While informal, the institutions regulating this
   trade are largely impersonal and contain third-party enforcement, hence
   providing a direct empirical challenge to common characterisations of
   informal institutions in political science. I argue that revisiting the
   characteristics associated with informal institutions, and understanding
   them as contingent on their political environment, can provide a new
   starting point for studying institutions, the politics of informality,
   state capacity, and the regulation of illegal economies.},

   Choice?},
Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {With the wrap-up of the S-400 deal with Russia in December 2017, critics
   argue that Turkey is caught between a rock and a hard place due to the
   adamant opposition of its NATO allies, the United States in particular,
   which has threatened Ankara with imposing severe sanctions. Would this
   be the correct representation of the situation at hand? Does it make any
   sense for Turkey to engage Russia, an archrival nation, to enhance the
   security of the country? Is the S-400 deal worth the risk of alienating
   the allied nations whose projected sanctions may have wide-ranging
   political, economic and military repercussions? With these questions in
   mind, this paper will try to shed light on the specifics of the S-400
   deal that make one think that it may indeed make sense for Turkey to
   bear the brunt of engaging Russia. In the same vein, the paper will
   assess the impact of the S-400 deal on Turkey's defense industries. The
   paper will also present the author's conception of the current
   ``international political non-order{''} as an underlying factor behind
   the deal. Finally, the paper will suggest that the S-400 deal must be
   approached from a wider perspective so as to grasp the extent of the
   service it has done in bolstering Turkey's military-industrial complex.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing awareness of the impact of informal activities in
   shaping political outcomes, scientific interest did not work in favor of
   conceptual clarity, and there have been no entirely successful efforts
   to classify informal institutions or other types of informal phenomena.
   The primary objective of this study is to offer a new descriptive
   typology of informal institutions, based on two variables: the
   compatibility between formal and informal rules, and the impact of
   informal activities on the functioning of the formal system. Two
   categories of the proposed typology capture situations of compatibility
   (complementary and substitutive informal institutions) and two refer to
   configurations of incompatibility. The latter differ regarding the
   impact of informal rules, which can either increase (deviant informal
   institution) or decrease the performance of the formal institutions
   (competing informal institution). Furthermore, the study formulates some
   critical remarks concerning existing conceptualizations of informality
   in political science, and argues for the use of the broader concept of
   ``informal practices{''} next to that of the narrower ``informal
   institutions{''}. The new typology delivers clear criteria to
   differentiate both between various forms of informal institutions and
   informal practices, and it is suitable to accommodate salient forms of
   informal activities practiced in different political systems, which is
   illustrated through a large set of cases.},

Title = {The Danish `Competition State': Still Along the Third Way?},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},

Pages = {119-127},

Abstract = {This brief review article addresses the question of whether the
   so-called ``competition state{''} was ``abandoned{''} during the recent
   Danish election of 2019, which brought the Social Democrats back in
   government under the leadership of Mette Frederiksen. During the prior
   Social Democratic government of 2011-2015, led by Helle
   Thorning-Schmitt, this concept was introduced as a highly controversial
   policy concept and came to summarize the government's program of
   economic reforms and recovery. The concept was subsequently strongly
   criticized in broader public political discourse as well as by the
   Social Democratic party and Mette Frederiksen herself. It is thus worth
   considering, whether the competition state reform program has been
   ``buried{''} with the recent election, as this might imply a more
   radical break or discontinuity away from the ``third way{''} competition
   state reform program embarked upon by most western European Social
   democrats since the 1990's. This article will, first, briefly review the
   public discussion about the competition state in Denmark, before it,
   second, will recapitulate the academic debate about the competition
   state and clarify the concept. Third, it will review central tenets of
   the economic policy of the Thorning-Schmitt government of 2011-2015, as
   well as, fourth, the announced reform program of the new Social
   Democratic government. Finally the article will contrast and compare the
   two programs, and conclude that the ``competition state{''} to a large
   extent endured the election of 2019, even if the Frederiksen government
   seems to lead the Danish competition state into reform trajectory
   towards increasing dis-universalization of social security and pensions.},

   Spain},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper shows the pattern of diffusion of a tool of protest - blank
   and null voting (BNV)- in the context of Spanish national elections. It
   shows how the 2004 protest mobilization by Batasuna (a Basque
   nationalist party) predicts null voting by identifying the relationship
   of this form of protest with both the level of grievance of the
   population and the political resources of the mobilizers. The paper then
   demonstrates that this large and visible use of a protest tactic is
   followed by a heterogeneous diffusion process after the main mobilized
   protest event and beyond the supporters of the original mobilizer. In
   the 2008 national election, across Spain, citizens with grievances
   toward the political system and, most importantly, with political
   affinity with the initiators were the ones to update their individual
   protest repertoire with this electoral protest tool.},

Abstract = {The establishment of a democratic political system has been declared as
   one of the main priorities of Ukraine since gaining independence in
   1991. Yet, three decades on, Ukraine's democracy remains ineffective and
   superficial. It is thus productive-and apposite-to seek an alternative
   method for studying such a complicated and multidimensional problem.
   This article employs ``causal layered analysis{''} (CLA), developed in
   Futures Studies to gain additional insight into the reasons for
   Ukraine's incomplete and halting democratization. CLA aims to get to the
   underlying causes of problems and involves analysis at four
   ``layers{''}: litany, system, worldview, and myth/metaphor. As we
   demonstrate here, this method can be fruitfully applied to better
   understand Ukraine's democratization-or, rather, its lack of it. At the
   layer of litany, the main facts and data concerning democracy in Ukraine
   are summarized. The second-systemic layer-is related to the study of
   democratic transition based on the approaches of various academic
   disciplines and theories. The research at the third layer is concerned
   with interpretation of the problem within the framework of five
   worldviews. At the deepest layer, we identify and characterize some of
   the myths underlying the aforementioned worldviews. Based on these
   analyses, key problems are identified and prospects for the future
   democratization of Ukraine are outlined.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the change in Turkey's defense and military
   strategy stems both from Turkey's changing security landscape following
   the post-Arab spring regional disorder and Turkey's quest to be an
   assertive regional player. The reasons behind the change in Turkish
   defense and military strategy also include a desire to gain political
   influence in the international arena and improve Turkey's military
   capabilities to deter emerging security threats near its borders and
   abroad. The article seeks to unpack Turkey's growing assertive military
   and defense strategy by taking into account its main drivers, primary
   objectives and essential pillars, as well as its tangible repercussions
   on the military mindset. The article has two main sections. The first
   section contextualizes Turkey's new military and defense strategy by
   taking into consideration its main drivers, objectives and pillars. The
   second empirically scrutinizes Turkey's military strategy by focusing on
   its military activism in extra-territorial domains. In this section,
   Turkey's military interventions in Syria following the failed military
   coup and its strategy of power projection are examined to explain the
   question of how Turkey operationalizes its new military and defense
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Major crises can act as critical junctures or reinforce the political
   status quo, depending on how citizens view the performance of central
   institutions. We use an interrupted time series to study the political
   effect of the enforcement of a strict confinement policy in response to
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we take advantage of a unique
   representative web-based survey that was fielded in March and April 2020
   in Western Europe to compare the political support of those who took the
   survey right before and right after the start of the lockdown in their
   country. We find that lockdowns have increased vote intentions for the
   party of the Prime Minister/President, trust in government and
   satisfaction with democracy. Furthermore, we find that, while rallying
   individuals around current leaders and institutions, they have had no
   effect on traditional left-right attitudes.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether a president's place in Stephen
   Skowronek's theory of political time affects the likelihood that the
   president will use his power as commander-in-chief to take discretionary
   military actions abroad. The study presents a new approach to an age-old
   question: what makes the president more or less likely to decide to use
   military force abroad? The study's theory section combines Skowronek's
   framework and the larger political time the literature with insights
   from literature on diversionary theory, foreign policy decision-making,
   and executive-legislative relations. The political time literature
   argues that the president's relationship with the dominant party regime
   of their day, and the strength of that regime, creates systematic
   incentives for presidents who serve during similar places in political
   time. The theoretical framework presented in this study argues that
   presidents who are unaffiliated with the dominant party regime of their
   day will be more likely than others to engage American armed forces in
   minor military conflicts. The study uses two datasets to test this
   argument and finds evidence that presidents who serve during the
   politics of preemption and the politics of reconstruction are more
   likely than other presidents to order the military into relatively
   small-scale, minor international conflicts. This finding builds on
   Skowronek's argument that presidents who serve during the politics of
   articulation are the most likely to engage in major wars.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of electoral uncertainty on a legislature's
   preference for bureaucratic insulation? Previous research argues that an
   increase in electoral uncertainty results in an increase in a
   legislature's preference for bureaucratic insulation, delegation of a
   program to an independent agency or multiple agencies, for a
   government-regulated program. However, there is disagreement among
   political scientists on how to conceptually or empirically measure
   electoral uncertainty and bureaucratic insulation. I use the common
   conceptual definitions of electoral uncertainty and bureaucratic
   insulation from the legislative delegation literature in a
   within-subject experiment of U.S. state legislators and legislative
   staff to assess the causal effect of electoral uncertainty on their
   preference for one of the four strategies of bureaucratic insulation.
   Once a legislature is subject to electoral uncertainty, I find that the
   respondents are more likely to delegate to an independent agency and
   multiple agencies that collectively implement a program.},

Abstract = {This article explores diverse views on both the current challenges and
   limits as well as the reforms and innovations of existing democracies at
   the beginning of the twenty-first century. First, it argues that
   socioeconomic inequality, new populism, new forms of communication, and
   globalization have stimulated a renewal of interest in analyzing the
   ``frontiers of democracy.{''} Democracies have reacted with different
   innovations and reforms in order to meet these challenges. The authors
   trace the phases of respective research from studies on singular,
   standalone instances to normative as well as empirical work on
   participatory (direct democratic and deliberative) systems. Finally,
   they advocate for combining the conceptual approach of defining
   democracy by the fulfillment of democratic values with rigorous
   empirical evaluation of the contributions (old and new) that
   institutions and procedures provide in order to fulfill these values and
   meet the mentioned challenges.},

Abstract = {In the UK, as in many other countries, welfare reform in the aftermath
   of the 2008 financial crisis has had a detrimental effect on gender
   equality. Between 2010 and 2015 the UK Coalition government initiated
   far-reaching cuts to public spending, as well as an increase in welfare
   conditionality. These reforms have hit women harder than men as women
   are more likely to rely on welfare benefits and services due to unpaid
   care responsibilities. Many have suggested that the way in which issues
   are represented by policymakers can limit what can be conceived as
   appropriate policy solutions. In line with this, Bacchi's What's the
   problem represented to be? (WPR) approach is used in this article to
   interrogate the way in which welfare was problematized by the UK
   Coalition government. Findings suggest that the Coalition represented
   reform as necessary to make work pay, with ``work{''} promoted as paid
   work and unpaid care work (predominantly undertaken by women) ignored.
   It also highlights the ways in which the Coalition's promotion of paid
   work silenced the necessity and value of care, allowing for the
   implementation of welfare reforms which have disproportionately
   disadvantaged women and exacerbated gender inequality.},

Title = {Coming a long way: Switzerland's transformation from a majoritarian to a
   consensus democracy (1848-2018)},

Abstract = {How did relevant key events shape the long-term transformation of Swiss
   democracy in terms of horizontal and vertical power-sharing? And why did
   existing systems, that is ``role models{''}, inspire this
   transformation? Renowned for being one of the oldest democracies in
   Europe, Switzerland offers a unique, case-based research opportunity to
   scrutinize the evolutionary process of democratization. We argue that
   Lijphart's seminal ``consensus-versus-majoritarian{''}-democracy model
   constitutes a suitable tool to study the long-term evolution of
   democracies. In order to make it applicable across time, however,
   conceptual pitfalls need to be tackled. The conceptual part is thus
   concerned with the problem of identifying relevant time periods.
   Empirically, Switzerland's 170 years of democratic change are analysed
   based on Lijphart's framework. Moreover, mechanisms of transnational
   diffusion that explain why ``role models{''} (the United States, the
   Weimar Republic, and the Netherlands) inspired the transformation of
   Swiss democracy are explored. The analysis draws on new, historic data
   going as far back as the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.
   The longitudinal design reveals a long-term transformation of
   Switzerland from an almost purely majoritarian democracy to post-war
   ``paradigmatic consensualism{''}. The article thereby offers new
   insights into how changes in the formal-institutional setting are
   related to the paradox of democratization.},

Abstract = {China's presence in the Tajik Pamirs is a paradox. While Chinese
   capital, geopolitical interests, and grandiose plans for new Silk Roads
   shape ambitions and fears, actual encounters with Chinese business
   people, engineers, or tourists remain rare and brief. In this context,
   people in the Pamirs find themselves waiting for pending futures
   conjured up in relation to China. Considering a future free economic
   zone, China trade across the Kulma Pass, and an old silver mine recently
   bought by a Chinese company, I analyze the paralyzing limbo Tajikistan's
   Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region is facing at this particular
   historical conjuncture.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the concept ``career politician.{''} It seeks to
   clarify, systematize, and measure this ambiguous multidimensional
   concept in order to facilitate testing theories and hypotheses
   associated with it. We argue that career politicians are full-time
   politicians who lack significant experience in the wider world and have
   other distinguishing attributes for which they are both appreciated and
   criticized. From claims and critiques put forward by political
   scientists, journalists, publics, and politicians, we extract four
   principal dimensions: Strong Commitment, Narrow Occupational Background,
   Narrow Life Experience, and Strong Ambition. These dimensions and their
   indicators fit Wittgenstein's family-resemblance conceptual structure,
   which is how we analyze, measure and validate them with data from a
   longitudinal study of British MPs spanning 1971-2016.},

Abstract = {Beliefs about the incidence of voter fraud inform how people view the
   trade-off between electoral integrity and voter accessibility. To better
   inform such beliefs about the rate of double voting, we develop and
   apply a method to estimate how many people voted twice in the 2012
   presidential election. We estimate that about one in 4,000 voters cast
   two ballots, although an audit suggests that the true rate may be lower
   due to small errors in electronic vote records. We corroborate our
   estimates and extend our analysis using data from a subset of states
   that share social security numbers, making it easier to quantify who may
   have voted twice. For this subset of states, we find that one suggested
   strategy to reduce double voting-removing the registration with an
   earlier registration date when two share the same name and
   birthdate-could impede approximately 300 legitimate votes for each
   double vote prevented.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at the development of the North Coast 500 (NC500) route
   as a key initiative contributing to the increase of tourism in one of
   the least visited parts of Scotland. Drawing upon data on visitor
   numbers within the area between 2014-2018 it considers whether the NC500
   has catalysed and encouraged tourism to an area of the country that has
   for many years been a peripheral region in terms of visitation. The
   findings highlight that the route seems to have had an impact upon a
   number of different aspects of tourism within the area generating
   increased expenditure and employment.},

Abstract = {Representative democracy entails governments that are both responsive
   and responsible. Mair argued that political parties find it increasingly
   difficult to balance these two tasks. With an increase in international
   commitments and interdependence, governments cannot always follow the
   wishes of their citizens but need to be responsible instead. Our study
   examines the responsiveness-responsibility link from the angle of
   citizen perceptions. We argue that when governments are seen as
   responsive they build a ``buffer{''} of support, allowing them to make
   decisions that are not necessarily responsive but possibly responsible.
   By being responsive, governments build a reservoir of goodwill, which
   they can use to survive more difficult periods. Using data from the 2012
   European Social Survey, we test whether perceived responsiveness feeds
   into this reservoir and whether this reservoir consequently increases
   perceived responsibility. We find support for this link, suggesting that
   responsiveness and responsibility do not need to be trade-offs but can
   complement each other.},

Abstract = {The Indian Ocean is a space in which international trading converge with
   illicit activities that convert the Horn of Africa into a region of
   conflict. The main challenge of this strategic maritime area is piracy,
   favoured by the lack of good governance, poverty, social and State
   restructuring, corruption as well as over-exploitation of resources.
   These factors, common to every country of eastern Africa, prevent
   various peace and progress initiatives from being viable. Despite the
   decline in piracy in Somalia, as a result of international
   interventions, instability in the region persists, which poses a risk to
   the interests of the different actors operating in this part of the
   world. So far, the response to contain piracy has been the military
   deployment, now questioned by the reduction of the risk. The objective
   of this article is to determine whether the actions of the European
   Union are guided by the threats to maritime safety or if, on the
   contrary, they represent a projection of their own interests in a power
   game where the lack of presence would result in the loss of regional and
   international influence.},

Abstract = {The German government recently made a large number of changes to
   migration legislation, in relation to asylum seekers and refugees who
   have immigrated since 2015. While the impact of some reforms may be
   socio-political, most of them also have fiscal implications. This study
   uses generational accounting to analyse the effects of these legislative
   changes on the German fiscal system. The results show that these reforms
   will likely have overall positive effects on future German public
   finances; they also highlight the importance of successful integration
   in general and the positive financial contributions accruing from the
   immigration of relatively young and skilled workers.},

Abstract = {There is no better time than now to take stock of the trajectory of
   ``democratic innovations{''} in Western democracies, amidst the
   burgeoning clamour of democratic dissatisfaction and the populist threat
   to liberal democratic institutions. This article takes the opportunity
   to discuss the concept of democratic innovations, reflecting on what is
   truly so democratic about democratic innovations when these practices
   have also emerged in the unlikely places of authoritarian systems. To do
   so, it briefly revisits the normative assumptions of these democratic
   innovations, as well as discusses and assesses the conditions under
   which such novel institutional ideas function. At the same time, a look
   at democratic innovations in authoritarian systems uncovers a more
   nuanced discourse. By examining the contributions of democratic
   innovations beyond the usual democratic systems, this review article
   provides a thoughtful premise for reconsidering the rationale,
   motivation, and functions of democratic innovations that-in the
   end-might not be so different in democratic and non-democratic systems.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years here has been a proliferation around the world of
   parliamentary bodies with a gender equality mandate. Yet they are often
   overlooked because they don't fit easily into existing frameworks for
   comparing national machineries for the advancement of women or women's
   policy agencies. Nor have they been made visible in much of the work on
   the substantive representation of women, even as such work has broadened
   out from a focus on individual critical actors to encompass
   collectivities. This paper looks at existing theoretical frameworks in
   order to identify which elements can best be applied to the study of
   gender-focused parliamentary bodies. In doing so, it seeks to make such
   bodies more visible as a form of feminist institution-building and
   presents a checklist of elements to support the ``feminist{''} label. As
   a case study, it examines the work of the parliamentary groups on
   population and development that now exist in some 65 parliaments around
   the world and at regional levels. Overall, the paper argues the
   importance of going ``beyond numbers{''} to explore the institutional
   settings that facilitate the substantive representation of diverse
   groups of women.},

Abstract = {The diagnosis of our present age as ``post-political{''} have become
   commonplace among political theorists and other scholars. This diagnosis
   is critiqued here on the grounds that it offers an account of
   temporality and hegemony that are fundamentally misleading. While these
   authors' critical stance toward technocratic managerialism is warranted,
   the post-political diagnosis itself serves to narrow our political
   imagination and weakening our ability to perceive opportunities for
   change. Following Sheldon Wolin, a ``fugitive{''} conception of
   democracy can offer greater insights into the shifting and unpredictable
   dynamics of politicization and depoliticization. This analysis is
   advanced with particular attention to the ways the post-political
   diagnosis plays out with respect to environmental politics, climate
   change, and arguments that we are now living in the epoch of the
   Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {A significant number of children with ties to the jurisdiction of the
   Netherlands through their Dutch nationality or for other reasons, are
   currently trapped in camps in Syria, Turkey and Iraq, often under poor
   or life-threatening conditions. Like many other governments, the
   Netherlands Government is not actively engaged in returning these
   children to the Netherlands. This article asks whether these children
   fall within the jurisdiction of the Netherlands pursuant to Article 2(1)
   of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and if so, whether the
   Netherlands Government is discharged from the relevant obligations that
   flow from this convention to protect these children. It sets out
   arguments in favour of a more extensive interpretation of the concept of
   jurisdiction than currently adhered to by governments and courts. Based
   on these arguments, it can be argued that the children fall within Dutch
   jurisdiction and that the Dutch Government is under the obligation to
   adequately protect their rights as laid down in the UN Convention on the
   Rights of the Child.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Analytical models of government formation typically assume
   low-dimensional real policy spaces. Behaviorally, however, politicians
   negotiate to form governments in high-dimensional discrete issue spaces.
   We model these negotiations, leveraging the fact that different
   politicians typically attach different importance to the same issue,
   allowing gains from trade when they negotiate agreed positions on large
   packages of issues. The set of issues in an agreed package is
   endogenous; politicians need not agree on every issue before they go
   into government together, ``tabling{''} issues on which they agree to
   disagree. We exercise our model computationally, calibrating it to 91
   real-world government formation settings, and mapping out the relative
   probability of Condorcet winning cabinets in different settings. This
   probability measures how hard it is for negotiators to find Condorcet
   winning cabinets in a giant high-dimensional state space. We test this
   claim empirically with a statistical model of the duration of
   negotiations after an election.},

Abstract = {Governments of all stripes have attempted to transgress ordinary legal
   limits and infringe upon rights and liberties under the cover of
   emergency powers. Are repressive policies adopted under emergency law
   less likely to comply with extant legal limits, as compared to
   repressive policies adopted under normal law? What are the mechanisms by
   which the potential abuse of emergency powers can be constrained? To
   answer these questions, we develop a game-theoretic model that builds
   upon the fact that political rulers rely on security agents to execute
   their repressive policies. We show that rulers always prefer to make
   policy under emergency law while security agents actually prefer the
   legal regime that incentivizes rulers to choose a policy more likely to
   comply with ordinary legal limits. Consequently, there is a potential
   endogenous constraint on the abuse of emergency powers given that rulers
   must rely on security agents to implement their repressive decisions.},

Abstract = {The article formulates and calibrates a formal model of risk
   communications in the framework of a risk-based community resilience
   assessment approach in transforming societies under crises and
   conflicts. It was demonstrated that perception of risks is not adequate.
   This situation is recognized as a threat, which leads to a significant
   increase of losses and to spreading of wrong crisis management
   practices. To improve decision-making at the personal, group, and
   population levels, a behavioral-based communication model has been
   proposed. The modified form of engagement into collective actions for
   substantially fractionalized society is proposed. A number of models of
   action calls and a collective decision-making under stress conditions
   with dynamic communication are put forward. On the basis of the
   developed model, ways of optimizing communication strategies are aimed
   at corresponding risk minimization are developed. Future research
   directions are highlighted.},

Abstract = {This article provides an institutional and legal history of passport
   denial in the United States from World War I to the early Cold War.
   Identifying the Passport Division as a central institution of the
   national security state, the article shows that the state was deeply
   invested in regulating the international movement of people and in
   monopolizing international connections in a globalizing age. It also
   analyzes the rise of the Passport Division as an authoritative and
   autonomous bureaucracy to provide new insight into the institutional
   development of the national security state. It emphasizes particularly
   the ways that the executive branch, the Congress, and the Passport
   Division mutually constituted travel policy as a field of state action
   in a decades-long process stretching from World War I to the Cold War.
   It explores the centrality of the reputation of the Passport Division,
   as personified by its head, Ruth Shipley, in facilitating its rise as an
   authoritative institution in the field of travel policy. And by
   analyzing the ways that the Passport Division was able to survive civil
   libertarian challenges in the 1950s, it explores the surprising
   longevity of national security bureaucracies.},

Abstract = {Our research on bias in family formation is rooted in the extant
   literature of gender and academia but moves beyond discussion of the
   ``leaky-pipeline{''} metaphor to explore less frequently addressed
   issues including pregnancy loss, illness, lactation, and challenges
   faced by academic parents who are the partners of those who have given
   birth. We explore the lower-order processes that inform the gap in
   professional achievement between men and women in political science
   specifically and in academia more broadly. In turn, these lower-order
   processes manifest as more observable higher-order outcomes such as the
   disparate rates of tenure and promotion. We conducted a 100-question
   survey from November 2017 through July 2019 involving more than 300
   respondents. Through analysis of open-ended survey responses, we
   identified a common theme uniting faculty experiences at a range of
   universities: family formation and parenting can be isolating processes
   for academics, and there often is a gross lack of both formal and
   informal support within universities, which creates the potential for
   setbacks in both personal and professional life. We highlight the
   challenges confronting academic parents-especially women-and suggest
   potential avenues to a more inclusive and balanced approach to academia.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined one key factor in the process of
   deliberation, namely, perceived procedural fairness. Another important
   factor, perceived disagreement, which has played a mixed role in
   deliberation, was used to test its interactive relationship with
   perceived procedural fairness. A field study utilizing cross-sectional
   survey data showed that perceived procedural fairness positively related
   to both enjoyment and perceived institutional legitimacy of
   deliberation. Perceived disagreement positively related to perceived
   institutional legitimacy. Meanwhile, perceived disagreement functioned
   as a moderator that conditioned the influence of perceived procedural
   fairness: disagreement strengthened the positive relationship between
   procedural fairness and enjoyment, while weakened the positive
   relationship between procedural fairness and perceived institutional
   legitimacy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed at the
   end of the paper.},

Abstract = {Core social movement research argues that large-scale challenges to
   authority build upon preexisting organization and civil society
   resources. How do dissenters mobilize masses in repressive settings
   where, given curtailment of civil society, autonomous associations
   scarcely exist and norms discourage trust more than encourage it?
   Testimonials from the Syrian uprising illustrate how protest can become
   widespread under such conditions, yet occurs through processes different
   from what dominant theory expects. Activists get demonstrations off the
   ground by planning around awareness of their organizational deficits.
   Once in motion, contention propels both organization and increasing
   organizational sophistication. To be effective, mobilization sometimes
   evades or obscures established social relationships, even as it produces
   new forms of sociability. Bridging literatures on mass and clandestine
   mobilization, this research reconsiders the assumed sequential logic of
   movement development from organization to protest, rather than vice
   versa. It also shifts attention from movement antecedents toward the
   resourcefulness and strategy that enable mobilizing both from scratch
   and at grave risk.},

Abstract = {We examine gender provisions in national constitutions and their
   significance for women's rights advocacy in Latin America and southern
   Africa. There is considerable debate about whether constitutional rights
   are merely ``parchment barriers{''} or if they have the potential to
   further social change. Those who argue that law does matter generally
   assert that its effect is mediated by social and political actors. What
   is less understood is how constitutional provisions aid rights
   advocates' efforts. What do constitutions enable them to do? We seek to
   shed light on this question by focusing on the strategies and behavior
   of women's rights advocates given a particular set of constitutional
   provisions. Using archival research and interviews with women's rights
   advocates, we examine how gender has been constitutionalized and how
   constitutional provisions have informed their efforts. Where
   constitutional provisions for gender equality are substantive, as they
   are in South Africa and Argentina, these provisions are central to the
   activities of civil society actors both for policy change advocacy and
   legal mobilization. In Botswana and Chile, on the other hand, the
   absence of egalitarian provisions has encouraged advocates to reach
   around the national constitution and rely on international law as a
   means to legitimate their claims and fight for favorable policies and

Abstract = {Studies of party activism highlight that party activists are driven by
   various motivations and that these affect their level of activism.
   However, it remains unclear whether policy-motivated activists are more
   engaged in party activities than those motivated by other incentives and
   whether the motivation-activism link varies with party characteristics.
   This article investigates these questions by focusing on political
   actors linking parties and voters in the local community. I use a party
   activist survey data set collected during recent national election
   campaigns in three Asian young democracies: Taiwan, Korea, and Mongolia.
   The results demonstrated the prominence of policy motivation as an
   impetus for activists' intraparty commitment. I also found that the
   positive effect of policy motivation is especially robust in small
   parties, while it is muted in large parties and that party membership
   increases the probability of intraparty commitment, challenging the
   widely held belief that formal membership is pointless in Asian parties.},

Abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the domestic and foreign policy agendas of
   all countries have been turned upside down. The pandemic has brought new
   problems and competition areas to states and to the international
   system. While the pandemic politically calls to mind the post-World War
   II era, it can also be compared with the 2008 crisis due to its economic
   effects such as unemployment and the disruption of global supply chains.
   A debate immediately began for a new international system; however, it
   seems that the current international system will be affected, but will
   not experience a radical change. That is, a new international order is
   not expected, while disorder is most likely in the post-pandemic period.
   In an atmosphere of global instability where debates on the U.S.-led
   international system have been worn for a while, in the post-pandemic
   period states will invest in self-sufficiency and redefine their
   strategic areas, especially in health security. The decline of U.S.
   leadership, the challenging policies of China, the effects of Chinese
   policies on the U.S.-China relations and the EU's deepening crisis are
   going to be the main discussion topics that will determine the future of
   the international system.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The nature of democratic governance is intimately connected with how
   citizens respond to candidate position taking. But when will a generally
   uninformed public base its vote choices on candidate positions? Since
   Converse scholars have argued that citizens should place greater weight
   on candidate positions on issues they consider personally important.
   However, this claim has received mixed empirical support. We revisit
   this question with compelling new evidence. First, we expand the limited
   temporal focus of existing work in our first study where we analyze all
   available ANES data on importance and issue voting between 1980 and
   2008. We then overcome endogeneity concerns through a nationally
   representative conjoint experiment in which we randomize two candidate's
   positions on five issues. Results from both studies demonstrate that
   there is scant evidence that subjective issue importance consistently
   moderates the relationship between candidate positions and vote choices.
   We discuss the implications of these results for ``issue public{''}
   theories of political engagement, for research on voting behavior, and
   for political representation.},

   ontopolitical implications of the scriptural fact in Heidegger. Starting
   from the nuclear link with Kehre, reading moves towards the relationship
   with and between Fredrich Holderlin and Karl Marx's Manuscripts, in
   order to elucidate the scope of the ``revolt{''} that is protected and

Abstract = {The article attests to the currently much-discussed theories of radical
   democracy that there is a gap in educational theory. As will be shown in
   a discussion with Chantal Mouffe and Jacques Ranciere, this
   non-thematization is primarily based on the central position in terms of
   architectural theory of an assumption of contingency postulated as
   absolute. As a result, radical democratic theories are either forced to
   ignore issues of education or leave them to chance, or to propagate a
   radical democratic education that cannot satisfy its claim to represent
   groundlessness. Based on this dilemmatic constellation, some thoughts
   will be sketched out as to what an answer to this problem might look
   like that is at least inspired by radical democracy.},

Abstract = {The May 13, 2019 midterm elections were generally seen as a referendum
   on the first three years of the presidency of Rodrigo R Duterte. The
   elections tested and consolidated the political strength of Duterte as
   the country's populist strongman president. Most of the national and
   local candidates he endorsed won their contests for the 18,066 national
   and local positions. The election also resulted in a victory for the
   administration's nine senatorial candidates (out of 12 seats) and a
   majority of its governors, mayors, and local legislators. The results
   follow the historical patterns of midterm elections in the
   post-authoritarian period. But unlike previous Philippine presidents,
   Duterte did not personally endeavor to consolidate his political support
   under his dominant party solely through the systematic mobilization of
   patronage. Duterte eschewed patronage-based political party building in
   favor of populist mobilization or the rallying of mass supporters toward
   contentious political action with minimum institutional intermediation.
   With a record high trust rating, Duterte was not only an active endorser
   of candidates, but he was also both a staunch defender of his allies and
   a relentless attacker of the opposition. In the end, the biggest winners
   in the 2019 midterm elections were not the candidates but Duterte
   himself.},

Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-125},

Abstract = {Drawing on comparative resource curse literature and American literature
   on the determinants of corruption, we argue that the impact of natural
   resource extraction on corruption outcomes is state-dependent. That is,
   in environments where corruption is already high, natural resource
   windfalls allow political actors and economic elites to take advantage
   of state brokerage, further increasing corruption. However, in
   previously less-corrupt states, increased natural resource extraction
   will not induce corruption. We rely on hierarchical linear models to
   interpret federal corruption convictions data for the fifty American
   states between 1976 and 2012 and employ generalized method of moments
   estimators to account for potential endogeneity. The findings are robust
   to alternative specifications and have implications for the management
   of new resource extraction opportunities.},

Abstract = {The still raging Covid-19 pandemic has brought sweeping and profound
   changes to the world. Having claimed more than one million lives and
   sickened many times more, the novel coronavirus has plunged the global
   economy into a deep recession, exacerbated existing political divisions,
   and changed the conception of human security. The global pandemic has
   not so much changed the basic direction of world history as accelerated
   the pace of it. The mega-trend toward greater equality and justice in
   global power distribution is unstoppable. At this moment of reordering,
   major powers need to assume the special responsibility for upgrading and
   updating the principles, concepts, and institutions for a new world
   order. Major obstacles to a smooth transition to a new order include the
   U.S. policy shift to unilateralism, protectionism, and nationalism on
   President Trump's watch, the evolving coronavirus pandemic and its
   long-lasting aftershocks, emerging powers' lack of strategic capability
   and/or political will to play a larger role, and glaring gaps between
   the mandates and means of international organizations. Just as it will
   take a coordinated global response to vanquish the virus, it will take
   complementary rather than confrontational policies of major powers to
   ensure a peaceful transition to a new world order.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-69},

Abstract = {This article examines the Community Action Programs (CAPs) of the 1960s
   to explore the generation of democratic subjectivity. Barbara
   Cruikshank's Foucault-inspired critique of the CAPs focuses attention on
   how they operated as modes of governance. These investigations enrich
   our understanding of the CAPs, but they also miss important aspects of
   their history. They miss the practices by which actors reconfigure what
   Jacques Ranciere calls the ``partition of the sensible{''} on which the
   programs were based. Focusing on such moments allows us to develop a
   different conception of the democratic subject than both the would-be
   promoters of democracy and the scholars of governmentality utilize: the
   democratic subject is neither disciplined nor resistant, but rather
   appears in activities that throw existing subject-positions and the
   existing order of sense into flux. It then becomes possible to identify
   moments of democratic emancipation within the workings of
   subject-forming powers.},

Abstract = {This paper shows that the role of national electoral dynamics on
   regional elections is highly mediated by institutional and electoral
   constraints at the regional level. Using data on statewide parties'
   electoral competition in regional and national elections in Spain and
   Italy, results show that the contamination of regional elections is
   lower in regions where decentralization has travelled further and where
   strong regionalist parties dominate electoral competition. The paper
   also shows that these two channels -more regional authority and more
   regionalist competition- shape the regional manifestos of statewide
   parties by increasing their pro-regional positions. These findings
   represent a contribution to a better understanding of the extent to
   which regional elections are a separate electoral arena from the
   national one.},

   decision-making process: (1) extra-parliamentary committee seats
   occupied by IGs (1980, 2000, 2010), (2) parliamentary (committee) seats
   occupied by IG representatives (1992-2015), and (3) consultation replies
   submitted by IGs (2008-11). We show that the Swiss system of interest
   intermediation adapted to the multiplication and organizational
   consolidation of citizen groups, which defend non-producer interests and
   do not provide selective benefits to their members (e.g. environmental
   groups). The share of access granted to citizen groups has increased in
   both the administration and parliament, across all federal departments
   and most legislative committees. Moreover, citizen groups benefit from a
   larger share of access in the recently revitalized parliament, compared
   to the administration. This suggests that economic groups' decline in
   power is also related to the rise of citizen groups.},

Abstract = {The issue of citizenship and Palestinian refugees has always been linked
   to their joint relationship to the right of return. Palestinian refugees
   were initially apprehensive towards the acquisition of citizenship, as
   many believed that this would be used to replace their right to return
   to the homes they were displaced from. As Israel insisted on
   resettlement as the only solution to the refugees' predicament, Arab
   states - with the exception of Jordan - refused to grant Palestinian
   refugees citizenship in order to preserve their Palestinian nationality
   and right to return. However, due to decades of statelessness and
   secondary displacement, increasing numbers of Palestinian refugees have
   sought citizenship elsewhere. Through a historical account as well as
   interviews with both stateless Palestinians and Palestinians with
   citizenship, this paper explores the social, political and legal
   implications of the acquisition of citizenship for Palestinian refugees,
   and the various meanings citizenship holds for those denied rights in
   their place of residence and return to their homes, from simply as a
   means to a better life to a means of resistance. It also shows that, for
   many, the acquisition of citizenship is not a replacement for the right
   of return, contrary to the views of state actors.},

Abstract = {Within a few years of the historic Arab uprisings of 2011, popular
   mobilization dissipated amidst instability in many Arab countries. We
   trace the relationship between shifting macro-political conditions and
   individual-level political values in the Middle East, demonstrating that
   a preference for democracy and political trust are not fixed cultural
   features of populations but rather can shift rapidly in the face of
   perceived insecurity. Our empirical analyses employ longitudinal data
   from the Arab Barometer covering 13 countries and data from the 2015
   World Values Survey, which includes both Arab and non-Arab countries in
   order to benchmark regional developments against global patterns. Our
   findings contribute to the growing body of research on the political
   effects of insecurity and oppose culturalist depictions of fixed
   political attitudes among Muslims in narrow perspectives on the
   relationship between Islam and democracy.},

Abstract = {Do politicians use the representativeness heuristic when making
   judgements, that is, when they appraise the likelihood or frequency of
   an outcome that is unknown or unknowable? Heuristics are cognitive
   shortcuts that facilitate judgements and decision making. Oftentimes,
   heuristics are useful, but they may also lead to systematic biases that
   can be detrimental for decision making in a representative democracy.
   Thus far, we lack experimental evidence on whether politicians use the
   representativeness heuristic. To contribute to and extend the existing
   literature, we develop and conduct a survey experiment with as main
   participants Dutch elected local politicians from the larger
   municipalities (n = 211). This survey experiment examines whether
   politician participants display two decision-making biases related to
   the representativeness heuristic: the conjunction error and scope
   neglect. We also run the experiment with a student sample (n = 260),
   mainly to validate the experimental design. Our findings show that
   politician participants neglect scope in one scenario and that they
   display the conjunction error in two of three scenarios. These results
   suggest that politician participants use the representativeness
   heuristic. Conversely, our third conjunction error scenario does not
   find evidence for politician participants displaying this bias. As we
   discuss in the article, the latter may be an artifact of our
   experimental design. Overall, our findings contribute fundamentally to
   our understanding of how politicians process information and how this
   influences their judgements and decision making.},

Abstract = {We analyze the strategic considerations inherent in legislative
   subsidies and develop an informational lobbying model with costly policy
   reforms. In contrast to other models of informational lobbying, we focus
   on the implications of a policymaker's and a lobby's resource
   constraints for lobbying activities. We allow both a policymaker and a
   lobby to gather information, and each can either fund or subsidize
   policymaking. Our analysis highlights that legislative subsidies are
   both chosen strategically by lobbyists and strategically induced by
   policymakers, dependent on the circumstances. These involve which
   resource constraints bind the policymaker's prior beliefs, the salience
   of policy, and the policymaker's and lobby's expertise in information
   gathering. Our results highlight five distinct motives for informational
   lobbying and demonstrate that for both a lobby and policymaker, there
   can be strategic advantages arising from being resource-constrained.},

Abstract = {This essay considers Denis Diderot's Letter on the Blind for the Use of
   Those Who Can See as a work that can contribute to a disability
   political theory. By recounting the experiences of visually impaired
   persons in their own words, Diderot opens up possibilities for a
   disability politics of self-representation, maintaining that sighted
   persons should listen to blind persons' accounts of their own experience
   rather than relying on their own imaginings and assumptions. By using
   blind experiences to challenge a philosophical problem that intrigued
   philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries amid
   often-unsuccessful efforts to ``cure{''} blindness through cataract
   surgeries, Diderot develops a powerful critique of the empiricist stress
   on vision as the primary source of perception and provides a remarkably
   forward-looking critique of disablist attitudes toward the blind.
   Through this philosophical discourse, he engages a political argument
   about the way knowledge is gathered, evaluated, and interpreted through
   relationships of power.},

   Privatization of US Empire},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {6},
Pages = {692-722},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This essay considers how an ``intimacy contract,{''} as a conceptual
   tool and a political reality, extends existing critiques of the social
   contract tradition by accounting for the privatized nature of the
   post-9/11 US empire. Examining critiques by Carole Pateman and Charles
   Mills, I argue that an intimacy contract uncovers the coercive power
   relations underlying neoliberal discourses of entrepreneurial freedom.
   Focusing on migrant labor on US military bases, I provide an overview of
   the racial, sexual, and settler contracts and the need to extend Mills's
   and Pateman's critiques of embodiment and spatiality. Next, I suggest
   how the intimacy contract generates a transnational, embodied account of
   the labors upholding US empire; a lens into the shifting significance of
   these labors under neoliberal imperialism; and a chronicling of desire
   and workers' interests. In conclusion, I suggest how the intimacy
   contract exposes multiple resistances to US empire and neoliberal
   capitalism.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have adopted long-term
   care social insurance (LTCI) systems to face the growing ``aging
   crisis{''} in their countries. The comparative scholarship suggests the
   diffusion of the Japanese model among East Asian states. Bridging policy
   learning, agenda setting, and historical institutionalist approaches,
   this study comparatively examines how ideational and institutional
   processes have impacted political competition and ultimately the
   adoption of LTCIs in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. I argue that each
   country's LTCI design differs greatly from one another, displaying
   distinctive forms of institutional bricolage-not institutional
   isomorphism. In this process, time has been a crucial factor. Time
   affects ideational, institutional, and political processes differently.
   The relative weight of ideational and institutional processes at a
   particular moment in time and their evolution over time has a
   significant impact on whether policy change occurs, and whether this
   change may gradually undermine the logic of welfare regimes. Related

Abstract = {Under what conditions will forcibly displaced persons return to their
   original homes after wars end? We draw on theories of labor migration to
   show that even displaced persons who have positive feelings toward their
   original location may nevertheless choose to return as regular visitors
   rather than permanent residents unless the location offers attractive
   economic opportunities. Furthermore, we argue that violence can create
   negative emotions not only toward geographic locations of bloodshed but
   also against its perpetrators. After ethnic wars, the displaced may be
   unwilling to return to intermixed locations, exacerbating ethnic
   separation. We study postwar migration among Lebanese Christians
   displaced during the 1980s and identify economic conditions using
   exogenous price shocks for olive oil, a major local export. Among policy
   implications for economic reconstruction and transitional justice, our
   most important insight is that sometimes we should help the displaced in
   their new location rather than induce permanent return to their old
   homes.},

Abstract = {Party competition over European integration is structured by two main
   dimensions of political conflict: a socio-economic dimension (market
   liberalisation vs. a more regulated economy) and a socio-cultural
   dimension (libertarian, cosmopolitan values vs. authoritarian,
   nationalist values). This article investigates the relationship between
   these conflict dimensions and parties' positions towards EU issues
   across time and space, in particular focussing on two `critical
   junctures' in the European unification process. For this purpose,
   analysis is made of the election manifestos of parties competing in
   European Parliament elections (Euromanifestos) from 1979 to 2014. First,
   it is found that the key moment of the Maastricht treaty significantly
   reshaped party competition over Europe. After Maastricht, positions
   towards European integration have become less connected to the economic
   dimension and much more related to the cultural dimension in Western
   Europe. Second, it is contended that the Euro crisis has not
   dramatically restructured political conflict over European integration.},

Title = {Competing Architects: Applying Social Contextualist Analysis to
   Negotiations on the African Peace and Security Architecture},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-27},

Abstract = {Social contextualist analysis, by contrast to much of the existing
   research on international negotiations, emphasizes the social and
   organizational environment in which negotiations take place and the
   effect that it can have on the decision-making of participants. This
   paper applies a social contextualist lens to negotiations held to decide
   upon the form and function of the African Peace and Security
   Architecture (APSA). Certain elements of the Architecture, which is one
   of the central pillars of the African Union (AU), present something of a
   puzzle for theorists, given the cession of sovereignty they represent on
   a continent where leaders have traditionally been very protective of
   their authority. After illustrating the limited value of the most
   prominent approaches to negotiation analysis, the social contextualist
   framework is outlined. The analysis incorporates negotiations held to
   decide upon a number of features of APSA. Its findings rest upon
   interviews conducted with representatives from AU member states and AU
   officials, as well as examination of a broad range of primary and
   secondary documents. In highlighting the significance of factors that
   are generally overlooked by traditional approaches, a case is made for
   greater consideration of social contextual factors in analysis of
   international negotiations.},

Abstract = {A prominent explanation of widespread popular support for referendums is
   dissatisfaction with the functioning of representative democracy. In
   this article, the aim is to gain a better understanding of how
   dissatisfaction affects support for referendums. Drawing on previous
   research, it is argued here that citizens follow a problem-based
   approach in their support for referendums, in that referendums are
   considered a suitable solution to address some specific problems in a
   political system but not all. Survey data from the 2012 European Social
   Survey (29 countries; N = 37,070) is used to show that citizens'
   expectations towards and evaluations of representatives relate to
   support for referendums. In particular, dissatisfaction with the ability
   of governments to listen to their citizens is associated with higher
   support for referendums. In contrast, citizens dissatisfied with the
   government's ability to lead are less supportive of referendums.
   Furthermore, the relationship between dissatisfaction with governments'
   ability to listen varies across countries depending on the level of
   experience with decision making via referendum. In countries where
   referendums are used more often, the expectation of referendums being
   able to solve the problem of unresponsive government is weaker. This
   study offers important insights into the different ways in which
   preferences and evaluations of representative practices relate to
   popular support for referendums.},

Abstract = {Terrorism represents a major threat to global security; however,
   psychosocial risk factors for terrorism are insufficiently explored in
   the literature. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined group
   differences in family, childhood, and personality factors, and attitudes
   towards terrorism among individuals convicted of terrorism (n = 160);
   those convicted of murder (n = 65); and a control group (n = 88). Using
   regression models, we consequently analyzed the risk factors for group
   membership, with a focus on terrorism. Compared to controls, terrorists
   had higher odds of persistent childhood disobedience, a conduct disorder
   factor, and endorsing statements on the causes of and justifications for
   terrorism, but lower odds of harsh treatment as a child. Murderers had
   greater odds of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), of endorsing
   statements on the causes of and justifications for terrorism, but lower
   odds of being easily provoked and harsh treatment before age 15.
   Compared to murderers, terrorists had higher odds of endorsing
   statements on the causes of and justifications for terrorism, but lower
   odds of ASPD, having a family member murdered, and being easily
   provoked. Although psychosocial risk factors for terrorism overlap
   significantly with violent criminal behaviors, certain factors may help
   distinguish terrorists from other groups. These factors merit further
   investigation.},

Title = {Inspiring Students to Think Theoretically About International Relations
   Through the Game of Diplomacy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-56},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {A growing literature highlights the benefits of playing the classic
   board game Diplomacy in international relations (IR) courses. But how
   exactly can it help students to learn not only about different IR
   theories, but also about what it means to use a theory in the first
   place? To address this question, I highlight my experiences overseeing
   the game during the first 2 weeks of seven introductory IR classes.
   Drawing from debriefing worksheets that 151 students completed after
   playing it, I examine whether they (1) made (implicit) connections to
   various theoretical perspectives and (2) developed a critical
   appreciation of theoretical abstraction and simplification. I find that
   the game's social and collaborative components lend themselves to
   theories beyond neorealism. More importantly, I show that by modeling
   rather than replicating world politics, Diplomacy introduces students to
   a counterintuitive idea: that theories can reveal things about reality
   even as they distort and omit parts of it. Moreover, having students
   reflect on the game's limitations encourages them to fill in the gaps,
   anticipate topics covered throughout the semester, and recognize the
   challenges of putting theories into practice.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to account for Sweden's evolving commitment to the
   international human rights (HR) regime since its inception in the late
   1940s. Where previous research has explained Nordic HR exceptionalism in
   terms of values of solidarity and democracy in domestic society, this
   article instead develops a rationalist framework focusing on how
   governments assess the sovereignty costs states incur through their
   international HR commitments - costs which may increase as the
   international regime accretes authority and domestic groups gain
   opportunities for mobilising for compliance. Empirically, the article
   adopts a longitudinal approach to determine how Swedish governments have
   committed to international human rights norms in three historical
   episodes: the emergence of the European Convention on Human Rights; the
   era of international activism from the 1960s, and the domestication of
   international human rights law since the 1980s.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the characterisation of the European Council as an arena for
   `integrative bargaining', the paper shows the importance of two factors
   that influence whether a country can act as `first among equals' or
   ('Primus Inter Pares') in a system designed to respect national
   sovereignty: alignment among the `Big Three', and `voice opportunities'
   for smaller member states. We support this argument with view of
   Germany's divergent role in two recent international crises - the 2011
   uprisings in Libya and the violent protests in Ukraine in 2014/2015. On
   the basis of these findings, we conclude that the ability to create
   consent among all Member States is both a key prerequisite and a serious
   challenge for effective leadership in EU foreign policy.},

Abstract = {How can citizens living under increasingly militarized and authoritarian
   regimes exercise political voice? Using an in-depth case study of naked
   protest in modern day Uganda, this article finds that naked bodies allow
   citizens to employ three types of overlapping power to confront a
   militarized authoritarian state: biopower, symbolic power, and
   cosmological power. The study illustrates one way in which citizens seek
   to engage militarized regimes-and in doing so, how political voice takes
   particular forms with limited capacity to instigate broader political
   claim-making that might be associated with country-or region-wide
   political action.},

Abstract = {The novelty of this work lies in analysing the conditions that favour a
   co-responsible work-life balance to men who are fathers and how it can
   be explained that some Spanish companies are innovating in this
   direction. We will focus on the qualitative analysis of 11 small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the main productive fabric in Spain. We
   have compared the evolution of companies over time and also similar
   companies in terms of economic sector. This has allowed us to understand
   the most relevant internal and external factors. The results show that
   dialoguing and transforming leadership and the organizational culture
   marked by the compromise-trust tandem are key elements for understanding
   how business policies can be implemented for co-responsible work-life
   balance.},

Abstract = {The following article main contribution falls within the domain of
   methodology as it draws attention on the strength of visual analysis
   within the field of study of populism. The work elaborates on a visual
   analy-sis of the posters published to advertise two events - a concert
   in memory of Jan Palash and the World Congress of Families - organized
   in Verona in the early months of 2019 by a set of organizations linked
   to the right and the extreme right and to conservative catholic stances.
   These politicized organizations carry out a specific type of
   cultural-political work and operate at the edge of the political sphere,
   by building alliances with (extreme) right-wing political actors and by
   lobbying political institutions. The visual analysis is geared at
   bringing agencies and ambivalences to the fore and allows to uncover (a)
   the `communicative camouflage' of these organizations who spread radical
   right and catholic conservative messages, traditionally marked by highly
   recognizable communication features and symbols, in more neutral,
   moderate and positive forms; (b) the deployment of some populist
   elements in their communication strategy, such as the reference to
   welfare chauvinism, to the first Conte government as well as the
   identification of the `natural family' as an homogenizing category
   associated with the good and moral side of society. While these features
   are per se not sufficient to define these organizations as fully
   populist actors, they are nonetheless important to underscore the role
   played by these organizations in spreading extremely polarized messages
   in a more digestible way for broader audiences by means of a
   communicative camouflage and of populist elements in their communication
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Many low and middle-income countries have either implemented or
   considered conditional or unconditional cash transfers to poor
   households as a means of alleviating poverty. Evidence from pilot
   schemes in many developed and developing economies, including those in
   Africa, suggests that cash transfers do not only alleviate poverty; they
   also promote social cohesion and reduce the propensity for violent
   responses. For example, studies have shown a direct impact of cash
   transfers on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). In some studies, the rate
   of IPV (including emotional violence) was significantly reduced when one
   of the partners was a beneficiary of cash transfer. However, there are
   limited studies on the potential of Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs)
   for stemming gang violence. Our study contributes to filling this gap.
   We examine here the possibilities of conditional cash transfers for
   stemming intractable gang-related violence in the Cape Flats.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the debate on the political professionalization
   backgrounds of executive candidates at the regional level. At this
   level, two opposing forces may intervene. On the one hand, as regional
   executive offices attain authority, more experienced politicians may
   become increasingly interested in seeking such positions. On the other,
   the concomitant presidentialization of regional elections by the major
   parties may render them attractive to well-known political outsiders.
   Using an original data set comprising the political backgrounds of
   Spanish regional executive candidates, our findings show that the
   greater the degree of authority held by regional governments, the higher
   their degree of political insiderness. However, the argument in favour
   of a greater presence of outsiders in the major parties does not seem to
   be supported.},

Abstract = {In 1992, a new trade union central was formed in Argentina: the
   Argentinian Workers' Central. In this article we analyze the modes of
   political action implemented by this organization between 2007 and 2015.
   We will research the reasons underlying its breakdown in 2010 and the
   itineraries followed by its two sections: Autonomous CTA and Workers'
   CTA. To do this, we work with various sources, among which are
   semi-structured interviews conducted to frontline leaders, union
   documents of public circulation and the informative chronicles published
   in two national newspapers. We will affirm that political autonomy and
   the will to organize workers, both union and politically, have marked
   the evolution of the CTA as a central union.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand the relationship between voter
   preferences and both media consumption and attention to political
   advertising during the last presidential election in Mexico. To do this,
   I discuss some statistical models where the dependent variables are the
   vote for each candidate and the change or stability in their
   preferences, and the independent variables are the intensity of media
   consumption, measured through weekly exposure to news about the
   campaign, and individual recollection of the candidates' political ads.
   These models do not show a significant relationship between media
   consumption and electoral preferences. Contrary to the belief that
   social media helped the winning candidate, this study finds no empirical
   support for such claim, in line with the literature that finds that the
   media has little or no effect on voter preferences.},

Abstract = {The political content on cable TV is symptomatic of the highly polarized
   era we live in. In this study of Fox and MSNBC, we sampled primetime
   evening programs on both and analyzed each major story presented. Our
   approach conceptualized each segment as a narrative and, as such, we
   coded the political arc of these stories and focused on the villains
   animating each set piece. On Fox the villains, who are harshly
   denounced, are disproportionately people of color. In contrast, on
   MSNBC, the villains are rarely minorities. Likewise, women are
   disproportionately the villains on Fox, frequently described as
   unintelligent and out of control. On MSNBC, women are almost never the
   villain. Despite the abrasiveness of its content, Fox's business model
   works as there is a substantial audience for this type of outrage
   programming.},

Abstract = {Existing arguments across political science posit that parties in
   government use domestic and international institutions to lock in their
   own policy preferences by tying the hands of successors. I demonstrate
   that these arguments contrast with the assumption of office-seeking
   parties and therefore portray an incomplete picture of the incentives of
   governments. The paper emphasizes the trade-off between implementing
   policy preferences, on the one hand, and exploiting partisan differences
   for electoral success, on the other hand: locking in a policy takes an
   issue off the table, but it also undermines a party's ability to
   leverage differences to the opposition in elections. Because
   office-seeking parties need to take into account these electoral
   consequences, they have a disincentive to tie their successors' hands. I
   advance this argument in the context of the establishment of independent
   central banks, provide empirical evidence, and suggest implications for
   the literature on international institutions.},

Title = {Gatekeeping the Plenary Floor: Discourse Network Analysis as a Novel
   Approach to Party Control},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-242},
Abstract = {In the German parliament, the Bundestag, floor time is a scarce resource
   and is allocated to MPs by leaders of their respective parliamentary
   party groups. Previous research indicates that highly salient plenary
   debates tend to be dominated by party leaders and other loyal
   frontbenchers. Plenary speeches can therefore offer only limited
   insights into party unity. Any MP can give a so-called `explanation of
   vote' (EoVs) to justify their voting decision and/or express their point
   of view. These written statements provide a more accurate depiction of
   the range of viewpoints present within legislative parties. In order to
   assess the effect of party control on observed party unity and
   parliamentary contestation, discourse network analysis has been employed
   in this study to compare legislative speech with EoVs in debates on the
   Greek crisis between 2010 and 2015. Discourse network analysis combines
   content analysis with an actor-centred approach, and this is the first
   time this method has been used to study party control and (dis)unity.
   Bundestag debates on the Greek crisis present an interesting case study,
   as the issue became increasingly controversial over time, both in the
   public and the legislature. While this became evident in declining
   voting unity and individual-level mobilisation through EoVs, the extent
   to which gatekeeping impedes contestation on the plenary floor needs to
   be assessed. In terms of representation, it is important that European
   Union issues not only make it to the plenary agenda but that these
   debates also reflect the different viewpoints of MPs.},

Abstract = {Post-truth has become a growing threat to the stability of Western
   democracies. The electoral processes that have occurred since 2016 have
   been shaped by the emergence of fake news whose influence on public
   opinion, although uncertain, has fueled a climate of distrust of all the
   information available in the public sphere. The present article, of
   theoretical nature, aims to provide a novel perspective to the academic
   debate on post-truth, by proposing an approach from phenomenology that,
   without detracting from the context and the sender, does emphasize the
   role of beliefs or referential frameworks in the human cognitive
   process. It is concluded that the loss of social mediation by informed
   or expert sources is at the base of the prevailing post-truth climate.
   This context in which the lie is the message represents a direct threat
   to the very root of democracy, to the extent that the lack of truthful
   information implies a limitation of the ability of citizens to make free
   decisions.},

Abstract = {With the coming to power of Evo Morales and el Movimiento al Socialismo,
   an indigenized language of resistance became the language of power. In
   this paper I explore how epistemological and ontological `radical
   difference' was co-opted and used to legitimize Bolivian state power. I
   argue that when institutionalized and instrumentalized within the state
   apparatus, indigeneity - as an emancipatory device of radical difference
   - implodes on itself and its radical potential is lost in the black hole
   that is coloniality. This paper provides an analytical and historical
   horizon against which recent political events in Bolivia can be
   understood.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a critical and historical analysis of the
   transformation of citizenship in China in a way that challenges both
   legal orientalism and the overall discourse on Chinese
   ``characteristics{''} and ``exceptionalism{''}. It aims to uncover how
   citizenship has been transformed `` structurally{''} (Solinger 1999) as
   well as through ``acts of citizenship{''} (Jakimow 2012). The paper will
   therefore not only look at how the One-Party State defines citizenship,
   uses it as an instrument of repression and population control, but also
   how citizens themselves can contribute to a new narrative on citizenship
   and driver of contestation in China. The paper will argue that the
   transformation of citizenship has contributed to the reinforcement of
   the fragmented and transnational nature of Chinese citizenship.},

Abstract = {The contributions of Pierre Bourdieu oeuvre to the analysis of the legal
   field do not seem to reverberate properly within the confines of the
   legal sciences, despite the existence of an already consolidated
   academic production, made from the theoretical framework of a
   Bourdieusian relational sociology that has the legal act as an object of
   investigation. Indeed, jurists and the legal field were objects of
   ancillary considerations at various times in the author's work, but it
   was in The Force of Law that Pierre Bourdieu traced a kind of general
   sociological approach of the current theories of law. Our hypothesis is
   (i) that this seminal essay should be read more as a research script,
   capable of raising doubts and hypotheses that can be verified or
   refuted, than a repository of ready-made answers about the power
   relations within the legal field and (ii) that its proper reception by
   the legal sciences in Brazil would be able to help unveiling the
   strongly genetic conservative character of the national legal field. To
   verify our hypothesis we will firstly reconstruct the author's main
   arguments, (a) about the necessity of the emergence of a rigorous
   science of law, (b) about the divisions and internal disputes within the
   field as a condition of mystification of the legal discourse and (c) its
   comprehension about the performatives powers of legal acts. These
   fundamental debates, as a rule, are absent from national legal formation
   or are extremely marginalized, what ends contributing to the
   preservation of a hegemony of traditional theories of law - these
   theories have in common the fact that they blur the political, economic
   and cultural disputes that underlie legal production and application.},

Abstract = {This study explores electoral accountability at the devolved level in
   Wales. The retrospective voting model assumes that electoral
   accountability requires that citizens assign responsibility accurately
   and vote on the basis of their evaluation of government performance.
   Drawing on data from the 2016 Welsh Election Study, we examine whether
   citizens in Wales can identify devolved policy competences and office
   holders, and identify factors that are linked to accurate attributions.
   We then examine whether voters seek to use devolved elections as a
   sanctioning tool, even if they do not have the information required to
   do so accurately. The findings indicate that there is an acute
   accountability deficit at the devolved level in Wales: few have the
   knowledge or the inclination to hold those in power to account. The
   conclusion discusses the implications of these findings for democracy in
   Wales and in other multi-level settings.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, we have witnessed a
   resurgence in nationalism, Euroscepticism and populist politics in
   Europe and the United States. Young people have borne the brunt of this
   crisis. Yet, in the 2016 UK referendum, the vast majority of younger
   citizens voted for Britain to remain in the European Union. But why did
   they do so? Drawing upon a bespoke survey of 1351 18- to 30-year-olds,
   this article investigates the relative importance of socio-demographic
   factors, post-materialist values and primary self-identification. It
   finds that positive views about cultural diversity and being a full-time
   student were the greatest predictors of a young person voting Remain,
   whilst no significant association is found between higher educational
   attainment and voting Remain at the multivariate level. Setting the EU
   referendum within the broader context of youth politics, the article
   also identifies the existence of cosmopolitan values amongst young
   Remainers. This has major implications for both our understanding of the
   success of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party amongst young voters in
   the 2017 general election, and the challenges the Conservative Party
   faces with regard to establishing support among Britain's young
   cosmopolitans for future elections.},

Abstract = {Corruption is thought to affect developed economies to a greater degree
   than developing countries. However, given our limited capacity to detect
   corruption, it may simply be harder to detect it in countries with
   stronger institutions. This article sets out to address this measurement
   challenge and to offer a tailored approach to one particular type of
   corruption: high-level corruption in government contracting. We describe
   a recently developed method to score procurement contracts for
   corruption risk. Then, using micro-level data from Hungary and the Czech
   Republic we analyze how corruption can distort public procurement
   markets, mapped as networks of buyers and suppliers. Proxying for
   corruption using a composite index of red flags derived from contract
   awards, we find that public sector buyers with high corruption risk have
   sparser network neighborhoods, meaning that they contract with fewer
   suppliers than expected. We interpret our results as evidence that
   corruption in procurement markets is fundamentally about the exclusion
   of non-favored firms. Political change has a significant effect on
   corrupt relationships: High corruption risk buyers with sparse
   neighborhoods rewire their contracting relationships roughly 20-40\%
   more extensively than other buyers across years with government
   turnover. The article demonstrates how the political organization of
   corruption distorts market competition in OECD countries.},

Abstract = {In recent years, feminist scholars have turned their attention to the
   seeming resurgence of feminism in mainstream culture. This resurgence
   coincides with a rise in feminist activism, as testified by the many
   campaigns that have mobilized millions of people around the issues of
   violence against women, sexual harassment, reproductive injustice, and
   abortion rights. This article draws on the literature on the cultural
   consequences of social movements to explore if and how the new wave of
   grassroot feminist activism influenced feminist themes in top-charting
   mainstream popular music. We conducted a thematic analysis of the lyrics
   of all female-performed songs in the Swedish Top-60 and Danish Top-40
   between 2017 and 2018. Our results show that neoliberal feminist themes
   count for the majority of the feminist themes detected. However,
   performers also employed themes ascribable to radical and liberal
   feminist traditions. We conclude with some reflections on the
   commercialization of feminist messages, pointing to openings for further
   research.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the new century and under the transformations
   unfolded in the last 50 years from the cyclical crisis of capitalism, a
   growing spatial displacement of the accumulation process towards the
   Global South (GS) takes place. Taking the latter as the unit of analysis
   (and observing in its interior the interrelation of the macro regions
   that compose it), this displacement is analyzed through variables
   associated with its dynamics, dynamism and growing capacity to control
   the production chains. global. Inserting all of this within the
   framework of the demographic explosion of the SG, the results show an
   unprecedented alteration of the hierarchical structure of capitalism
   since its birth, while opening a new map for the examination of
   hierarchies and their functioning with respect to of the usual
   analytical scheme (center - semi-periphery - periphery) diffused by the
   theory of the world system. A redefinition of the analytical and
   strategic agenda depends on it at the global geopolitical and
   geoeconomic level.},

Abstract = {The key to solving the political crisis in Belarus lies in Moscow. The
   Kremlin is not only pursuing geopolitical interests, but also fears that
   there may be fallout from the Belarusian protests that will affect the
   domestic situation in Russia. For this reason, the Russian government is
   supporting Aliaksandr Lukashenka, the Belarusian head of state of many
   years, in his attempt to hold on to power. In return, Lukashenka is
   performing a U-turn with regard to integration policy and is abandoning
   his ``see-saw policy{''} between the EU and Russia. If he succeeds in
   forming common supranational institutions, Vladimir Putin would finally
   have achieved the aim of his Belarus policy after two decades. However,
   it remains unclear whether his tactics will actually pay off.},

   group interviews related to the concept and the peace process. The unit

   distributed on three six person groups and nine teachers distributed on
   two groups). The naturalist and interpretative qualitative focus and
   descriptive-interpretative analysis. It's been concluded that there is
   an invisible link between coexistence and peace, students are oriented
   to a peace concept as longed-for status, experience in harmony, freedom
   and justice, meanwhile, teachers precise it as a construction and social
   responsibility process and they place the dialogue as a dimension of it.
   On respect to the peace process, teachers highlight the laudable effort
   of Colombian state and the Integral system of truth, justice, repair and

Abstract = {Why are two dozen Democratic candidates, ranging from a former vice
   president and well-known senators to obscure House members and a
   small-city mayor, all seeking the Democratic nomination for president in
   2020? The size of the Democratic field suggests that the formal and
   informal mechanisms that kept earlier years' fields to reasonable sizes
   have broken down, in part because party leaders want to avoid the
   appearance of favoring some candidates over others. Debate criteria may
   serve to winnow the field. Meanwhile, after years of speculation, only
   former Massachusetts governor William Weld has stepped forward to
   challenge Trump in the Republican primary.},

Abstract = {This essay presents a reflection in biopolitical terms from the analysis
   -through Panofsky's iconographic method- of five Soviet Propaganda
   Posters against alcoholism dating from 1917 to 1990. The main hypothesis
   is that among all the objectives that a government campaign against
   alcoholism can have, the Soviet Propaganda tried to make people feel
   guilty and ashamed. Finally, a discussion is presented about these
   objectives of the Soviet propaganda and its relation with concepts like
   such as power technologies and technologies of the self and especially
   its intersection that Michel Foucault calls governmentality, and is
   described its importance in the constitution of subjects that it was
   sought through the political control of the body (biopolitics) in the
   now dissolved USSR.},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute towards an understanding of the notion
   of feminism among young Iranians born after the Iranian revolution, and
   specifically in the 1990s. Building on an in-depth analysis of the
   literature and narrative individual interviews with young women and men
   belonging to the so-called Millennial generation, the paper aspires to
   shed light on how these youths interpret the feminist ideology today in
   connection with the history of the women's movement in the country. As
   the perceived lack of interest in feminism among the Millennials is a
   subject of continued debate in the international sociological
   literature, the paper captures a snapshot of the various definitions of
   feminism from the perspective of Tehran's middle-class youths. Indeed,
   it unravels some of the complexities of identifying with feminism for
   youths born and raised in the 1990s, such as the difficulty in accepting
   the feminist label, the criticisms made to the movement and the
   persisting differences between women and men.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explain the process of building
   strategic relations between China and African countries since the Cold
   War period. Then, the article focuses on Beijing's contradictory
   position regarding the principle of non-intervention in the internal
   affairs of other states. In the first part, the text explains the
   context in which the Sino-African ties have consolidated after the
   Afro-Asian Bandung Conference and then during the Chinese reform and
   opening process, in order to catapult the People's Republic of China to
   global great power status. Here, ``great power{''} is understood
   according to the postulates of Nicholas Spykman. Throughout the article,
   it becomes evident how, while China has been maximizing its power, its
   position has been contradictory with its defense of the principle of
   non-intervention from three perspectives: its position in the Security
   Council as a permanent member; its intervention in the economy of
   African states, initially in the oil industry; and its military support
   to states in internal or interstate conflict in Africa. This
   contradictory position is reiterated in recent years with its
   globalization proposal called bri (Belt \& Road Initiative) and its
   impact on African countries.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the struggles of the chilean working class, as
   an autonomous organic in the form of social corporations. First, we
   review the corporate origin of pensions in the West, as the legal logic
   underlying the solidarity distribution in cajas de pensiones. Then we
   set a general line of tension of this logic with the liberal capitalist
   one. In this sense we enter the history of the chilean working class
   since Independence, in its resistance and struggle of its autonomous
   organic pensions, until its institutionalization in 1925 as social
   rights in constitutional headquarters. We revise next, the manu militari
   rupture of this institutionality in 1973, where we review the
   dissolution of the workers' organizations, in accordance with the
   neoliberal privatist capitalist approach intervention, to end up
   confirming that this paradigm is resolved with the failure of private
   reform of pensions of 1980, which allows us to analyze the return of the
   organizational autonomy of the working class, based on the vanguard of
   the Movimiento de Trabajadores No Mas AFP which we describe in their
   initial struggles and in the current scenario of generalized social
   struggles.},

Abstract = {This article offers an overview and analysis of the concentration camp
   writings of Aldo Bizzarri, an Italian political deportee at Mauthausen
   concentration camp during 1944-1945. Bizzarri had a varied career as a
   writer, essayist and cultural diplomat before deportation and as a
   journalist and writer after the war. He wrote two important books about
   his experiences at Mauthausen and also worked on a film with a
   concentration camp setting. His experimentation in these different
   forms, it is argued, is symptomatic of the variety and complexity of
   early attempts to find an appropriate idiom to represent the Lager
   phenomenon and the Nazis' genocidal violence.},

Abstract = {The modern society necessitates the introduction of new IT-solutions to
   meet its needs. With the spread of know-how, the need for its detailed
   analysis with the further determination of the direction of development.
   The purpose is to carry out an analysis of the introduction and
   functioning of know-how, as well as to determine the vectors of its use,
   taking into account the needs of participants in legal relations arising
   in this area. The subject of research - information technologies
   (know-how) as objects of intellectual property rights in their use. The
   methodological basis consists of the method of analysis, the method of
   synthesis, the dialectical method, the comparative-legal method, the
   system method, and the logical-legal method. The result of this work is
   to identify the importance of the information technologies in everyday
   life of modern society and the level of popularity of their use,
   outlining possible vectors of development in the economics in the
   direction of digitalization and justification of the need to improve the
   provisions of current legislation within the considered topic,
   expressing the idea of the direction of innovative information policy in
   the direction of active use of blockchain and maximum compliance with

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {5},
Pages = {177-185},
Abstract = {This review was prompted by the publication of John Gunnell's latest
   book, ``Conventional Realism and Political Inquiry: Channeling
   Wittgenstein.{''} (Chicago, London: The University of Chicago Press,
   2020). Theoretically and methodologically, his approach develops the
   popular current agenda of practical and linguistic turns, and also
   illustrates well its drawbacks. The review aims to identify the
   contribution of Gunnell's work and problems in this context. We
   fulfilled three objectives - reviewing the book's main ideas; its
   particular shortcomings; and the problems representative of the
   aforementioned broad topic. The first two objectives are fulfilled in
   parallel, followed by the third. Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas,
   Gunnell unfolds his position of `conventional realism' as applied to
   politics. Gunnell systematically showed that politics largely resides in
   human collective linguistic practices, which are plural and changeable.
   They cannot be reduced to any dogmatic paradigm abusing the rhetoric of
   metaphysics, `the natural', or `science' to justify a specific policy.
   The making of multiple practices and their change manifest humanity's
   collective creative freedom; it also implies their responsibility.
   However, we note the vulnerability of the general idea, which overstates
   the unity of thinking and language. Three closely related,
   representative problems directly concerning politics are shown. The
   first and broadest one is a combination of trivialness and relativism.
   It is not clear enough how to compare different practices and grasp
   relations between them, and the risks remain of reifying the social
   `given' or trivially noting an arbitrary `switch' between `givens'; more
   attention should be paid to conceptions of rationality that are
   critical, and neither relativist nor dogmatic. The second problem lies
   in lessening the role of philosophy and political science in a rational
   and critical assessment of political practices. The third issue is that
   Gunnell himself firstly criticised the grounding of practices by
   scholars, but then largely made the same mistake himself by defending
   the normative benchmark of democracy.},

Abstract = {Transnational actors and transnational governance now form core elements
   of global environmental politics alongside intergovernmental diplomacy
   and institutions. This article explores how and under what conditions
   this transnationalism has arisen, as well as its implications for world
   politics. It considers what effects transnational actors and governance
   have had on political outcomes, their relation to states and
   intergovernmental institutions, and normative questions around their
   legitimacy and accountability. The critical role of transnational actors
   and institutions in environmental politics has made the field a
   laboratory for broader questions concerning the evolution of global
   governance in world politics more generally. As global environmental
   challenges continue to magnify and affect other spheres of political
   activity, understanding these dynamics will become increasingly
   important.},

   practices of engaging Overseas Chinese by Shanghai Municipal Government},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The number of states that have developed layered engagement policies
   aimed at co-opting various migrant or diaspora groups has exponentially
   risen in the past couple of years. The highest political leadership of
   China has also recognized the need to tackle this matter systematically
   within its national political and institutional setup. The primary
   objective of this research note is to explore the Chinese government's
   framing and capacity to shape cooperation mechanisms with Chinese
   migrant and diaspora communities abroad, through analyzing the work of
   the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs of the Shanghai Municipal
   Government. My primary aim is to trace and reconstruct locally designed
   mechanisms employed by government agents to capture certain migrant
   groups into their own structures of local programmes. I outline what the
   practical implications of such localized management practices in China
   are, specifically focusing on agency, institutions and processes, and
   assessing the impact of the resulting complexities in the current
   institutional set-up of the Shanghai Municipality.},

Abstract = {Considering that cable news has become a primary source of political
   information for many Americans, this article examines the role and
   impact of Fox News in the United States, particularly as it compares to
   other news outlets. We begin by offering a historical analysis of Fox
   News' formation and growth in popularity, including a review of existing
   scholarship on the network's impact on news consumers. Prior research as
   well as an additional nationally-representative dataset reveals that two
   policy areas are particularly potent among Fox News' consumers:
   immigration and climate change. Additionally, scholars have found
   initial evidence for the role of Fox News in shaping its viewers'
   responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We then consider the cognitive
   processing utilized by news consumers, explaining how it may differ
   among individuals who opt to consume Fox News and those who get news
   from other sources. We conclude by reviewing why three specific
   areas-immigration, climate change, and COVID-19-resonate so strongly
   with Fox News consumers.},

   Good Strategy or Pyrrhic Victory?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {In this article we analyze how media coverage for environmental actors
   (individual environmental activists and environmental movement
   organizations) is associated with their perceived policy influence in
   Canadian climate change policy networks. We conceptualize media coverage
   as the total number of media mentions an actor received in Canada's two
   main national newspapers-the Globe and Mail and National Post. We
   conceptualize perceived policy influence as the total number of times an
   actor was nominated by other actors in a policy network as being
   perceived to be influential in domestic climate change policy making in
   Canada. Literature from the field of social movements, agenda setting,
   and policy networks suggests that environmental actors who garner more
   media coverage should be perceived as more influential in policy
   networks than actors who garner less coverage. We assess support for
   this main hypothesis in two ways. First, we analyze how actor attributes
   (such as the type of actor) are associated with the amount of media
   coverage an actor receives. Second, we evaluate whether being an
   environmental actor shapes the association between media coverage and
   perceived policy influence. We find a negative association between media
   coverage and perceived policy influence for individual activists, but
   not for environmental movement organizations. This case raises
   fundamental theoretical questions about the nature of relations between
   media and policy spheres, and the efficacy of media for signaling and
   mobilizing policy influence.},

Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {333-353},
Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic is both a public health crisis and a stress test
   for global health governance. Effective health governance hinges on the
   provision of global public goods for health. Generally, the hegemon
   underwrites the operation and stability of the global public health
   architecture by ensuring the sustained supply of global public goods for
   health. But when the hegemon is unable or unwilling to shoulder this
   responsibility, global health governance may run the risk of falling
   into a Kindleberger Trap. The leadership vacuum that is opening up amid
   the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the process. At present, China
   should adopt a three-pronged approach to promote bilateral health
   cooperation with leading countries like the United States, strengthen
   regional institution-building with ASEAN, South Korea, Japan, and Belt
   and Road countries, and improve the performance, credibility, and
   integrity of global organizations like the WHO and G-20. The
   Kindleberger Trap in global health governance can be overcome by
   adapting regional health coordination to make it more agile and
   effective.},

Title = {Law against Corruption: Outcomes of Corruption Counteraction in Russia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {220-225},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the scientific analysis of efficiency of legal
   and organizational measures taken by the state to counteract corruption
   in the Russian Federation. The authors critically evaluate their
   effectiveness, pay attention to methodological gaps in choosing means
   and methods of fighting this scourge. They also substantiate the
   necessity of rigorous differentiation of legal liability for corruption
   offences depending on official capacity of the offender and the area of
   state activity or social life that is encroached by the offender.
   Examining the genesis of the state's reactions to the scope and danger
   of the present problem, it can be said that formal acknowledgment of
   corruption hazard in society and public service in particular has come
   after a considerable delay only when this phenomenon took a form that
   endangered foundations of the society and the state itself and when the
   global institutions paid attention to a high level of corruption in the
   Russian Federation.
   The article studies the impact of law as the most powerful instrument
   against corruption, the most typical and major drawbacks of legal acts
   and the degree of their preventive action. The authors emphasize
   introduction of supplementary restrictions and prohibitions in the civil
   service system and economy sector. The article draws attention to
   intensification of criminal repressions for the most dangerous crimes
   such as bribery, corruption intermediation and others.
   The conducted analysis of measures taken by the state and assessment of
   their efficiency by the public consciousness allow us to formulate a
   scientific hypothesis on the reasons and conditions that have determined
   poor performance of counteracting corruption. The authors point out some
   attempts to mobilize the civil society to fight corruption; however the
   government failed to significantly reduce its level.
   It is postulated that at present there is a necessity to refine the
   anti-corruption strategy, to optimize the balance between enforcement
   measures and stimulation as well as motivation of law-abiding behavior
   of public servants and others involved in public legal relationships,
   especially of those related to at-risk group. It is of great
   significance to intensify state and public control over certain
   activities such as government and public procurement, budget
   expenditures, the use of material resources, and others.},

Journal = {CONGRESS \& THE PRESIDENCY-A JOURNAL OF CAPITAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-337},
Abstract = {This article advances the study of presidential leadership by analyzing
   the circumstances under which Organizing for America/Organizing for
   Action (OFA) mobilized core supporters of President Barack Obama for
   policy purposes using digital tools and other resources developed for
   the president's election campaign. I argue that the policy mobilization
   efforts of such presidential grassroots lobbying organizations (PGLOs)
   are constrained by electoral opportunity costs and innate factors which
   lead PGLOs to be most effective at maintaining the support of
   presidential copartisans in Congress. These constraints are used to
   develop several hypotheses about the timing and frequency of OFA
   grassroots lobbying mobilization efforts, which are tested using a
   dataset of 245 OFA mobilization requests to supporters sent via e-mail
   from January 2009 through January 2017. The resulting analysis finds
   support for several of these hypotheses, as well as the proposition that
   PGLO grassroots lobbying efforts carry electoral costs. Furthermore, it
   supports the claim that OFA leadership were most willing to pay the
   costs of lobbying mobilization when President Obama's copartisans set
   the agenda in Congress under unified government and OFA mobilization of
   Democratic ``super-activists{''} could have most easily kept
   presidential priorities under consideration. Rather than judging them on
   their ability to mobilize the mass public and coerce opposition
   legislators to side with the President on key votes, I argue that these
   findings support a reevaluation of OFA and similar groups' effectiveness
   on the basis of their ability to unify and motivate the president's
   co-partisan allies in Congress.},

Abstract = {The politics of memory have become a weapon of the Putin regime, and are
   increasingly being used offensively and aggressively by the regime's
   representatives, both domestically and internationally. They serve to
   mobilise the population, stabilise the regime's grip on power and to
   consolidate the image of Russia as a beleaguered fortress. The subjects
   are well known: the Second World War, Stalin and the 1990s. However, the
   ways in which these policies are being implemented have changed. Places
   of remembrance are being eradicated, competition is being created
   between victim groups, and negative events are being reinterpreted as
   positive ones. All this is engendering historical myths and propaganda,
   and it makes it harder for Russia to tackle its difficult past.},

Abstract = {The economic and political processes taking place in the southern Far
   East have had a significant impact on the development of the territorial
   structure. Methodologically, a constructive and comprehensive
   geopolitical approach was used that allowed a structural evaluation of
   economic and political realities and their impact on the formation and
   development of the territorial structure, as well as its various
   orientations and typologies in the south of the country. Far East. In
   addition, its focused study allowed to evaluate the economic and
   political effect of the modernization scenario, to analyze the impact of
   external and internal economic, political and social realities with a
   focus on the restructuring and organization of the territorial
   structure, all of which allowed to identify the main problems of its
   destabilization and, at the same time, determine the prospects for
   further growth of the elements of the system to varying degrees,
   affecting the industrial, transportation, infrastructure and other
   spheres of the population's life. It is concluded that the dialectical
   interaction of a set of political and economic realities of
   transformations and modernizations, internal and external, have
   configured an arial-nodal / linear-nodal polycentric linear structure in
   the south of the Far East.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to characterize the national identity in
   an emerging information society. The multidimensionality, internal
   contradictions, and variability of the phenomenon of national identity
   led to methodological pluralism, the application of various methods and
   principles. Thus, during the research, historical and philosophical,
   dialectical, phenomenological, and systemic approaches, structural and
   functional methods were used. The article considers the problems related
   to the development of the information society and the preservation of
   national identity, including the peculiarities of this process in modern
   Ukrainian society. The development factors of the information society
   that influence national and individual consciousness and promote their
   optimal interaction are defined. In addition, some possible trends in a
   further globalization of modern society are analyzed, its cultural,
   economic, national, and political unification, as well as its
   consequences for Ukraine. By way of conclusion, it is stated that the
   positive example of several countries gives hope for a favorable
   relationship between the development of the information society and the
   preservation of national cultures through the strengthening of national
   identity and the reactivation of spiritual values.},

Abstract = {Native American governance is a political science matter, yet mainstream
   political science has largely neglected Native nations. Critical
   assessment of mainstream political theory shows that the dominant
   misconception about Native peoples as ethnic minorities has shaped
   political thinking in the United States since the nineteenth century to
   the present. Ideologies of pluralism, liberalism, and neoliberalism
   perpetuate colonial dominance over Native peoples and pose a threat to
   their survival as separate political entities. To contribute to
   political science theorizing about Native American nation building, I
   propose a case-specific theoretical framework that is sensitive to the
   different nature of the Native political world. It uses an eclectic
   combination of Native American studies perspectives, genealogical
   method, and new institutionalist approaches. I apply this theoretical
   framework to the case of the White Earth rebuilding process.},

Abstract = {Despite its centrality to human life, health, and happiness, sleep has
   never been a central topic of concern to political scientists. This
   article proposes that chronotype (a person's time-of-sleep preference)
   is a previously unidentified psychological correlate of political
   ideology. Chronotype may lead to political ideology through a motivated
   social cognitive process, ideology may shape sleep patterns through a
   desire to align with social norms, or ideology and chronotype may arise
   from common antecedents, such as genetics, socialization, or community
   influences. Analyses demonstrate a link between a morningness and
   conservatism in seven American samples and one British sample. This
   relationship is robust to controls for openness, conscientiousness, and
   demographics, including age, sex, income, and education. The article
   concludes with a call to incorporate sleep and chronotype research into
   political science across a range of topics and subfields, including
   political psychology, social networks, political geography, political
   communication, political institutions, and survey design.},

Abstract = {Socialism and communism, anarchism and Trotskyism played a leading role
   in Bolivia's social and political history in the decades before the
   April 1952 Revolution. The present article attempts to recover that
   history, through a historiographic balance in which we critically
   analyze the existing bibliography in Bolivia and abroad on these issues.
   One of our main hypotheses is that the historical development that these
   different left wing expressions had in the Bolivia ``pre-52{''}, exceeds
   what militant and academic historiography has produced about them. Thus,
   in the article we concentrate on the reasons behind this imbalance
   between history and historiography and we advance in a historiographic
   path that allows us to weigh the contributions made and the
   interpretative lines developed until the present, identify the debates
   between authors and currents, and detect unexplored topics and problems
   that deserve to be incorporated in the agenda of future research.},

Abstract = {NATO is more dependent than ever on electronic systems which are being
   targeted by increasingly sophisticated electronic warfare (EW), cyber
   and information operations. Russia has demonstrated considerable
   proficiency across these domains, in particular during the crisis in
   Ukraine. Russia is now reported to be mounting a sustained information
   operations campaign in the Baltic states and there is concern regarding
   the potential impact of its EW and cyber capabilities on the operational
   effectiveness and survivability of NATO forces, should there ever be a
   confrontation. Duncan McCrory highlights some of the challenges facing
   the Alliance in these domains to raise awareness among the non-technical
   specialist community and provide options to enhance NATO's resilience
   and counter this evolving threat.},

Abstract = {This analysis is based on the dissertation The Mexican Army
   decision-making process: The role of Military Intelligence. The original
   research is applied to the case of the Ovidio Guzman capture operation
   in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. First-hand sources of military
   intelligence are confronted with information from open sources to
   evaluate the possible intelligence and counterintelligence failures that
   can explain the Mexican government's decision to release Ovidio Guzman
   after members of his cartel committed acts of extreme violence and
   exploited social media. Based on the sources consulted, the author
   concludes the key factors that led to the failure of the operation were
   the lack of inter-agency cooperation and deficiencies in the
   decision-making process by the Security Cabinet of Mexico.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the functioning and distribution of shadow norms in

   scope and degree of danger. Legal and social mechanisms of counteraction
   to shadow norms are considered. It is concluded that the mechanisms of
   combating shadow norms in a globalized society of different degrees of
   danger differ diametrically. Thus, in order to combat shadow norms that
   exist before or in parallel with legal norms, it is advisable to use
   social mechanisms. But, measures of legal responsibility should be
   strengthened with regard to illegal shadow norms.},

   innovation as the action of generating ideas through the management of
   knowledge of the use of technology, in order to influence the
   competitiveness of companies through the generation of added value in
   the offer of products and services. The methodology of the present
   article was developed as a non-experimental design of a transversal,
   exploratory and fundamentally bibliographic type to reference different
   texts and business contexts. In essence, it was a review work close to
   hermeneutics. The most reserve conclusions include that innovation as a
   comprehensive process that, seeking to make the most of the productive
   capacities of a given company, has implications and competitiveness, on
   the one hand, increases the quantity and quality of the services and
   goods that occur at the same time reducing costs; on the other hand, it
   affects the range that SMEs give their customers for their needs and
   desires with quality offers in a context of increasing national and

Abstract = {On the morning of 25 January 1942, Curzio Malaparte, engaged in a long
   reportage on the Eastern Front for the Corriere della Sera, crossed the
   threshold of Warsaw's ``forbidden city{''}. Malaparte was the first
   Italian writer to personally visit the largest Jewish ghetto in eastern
   Europe: the literary account of that experience was included in a long
   narrative sequence in Kaputt, published in 1944. However, Malaparte was
   not alone during his visit: he was in fact accompanied by another
   Italian journalist, Alceo Valcini, whose presence was entirely
   obliterated in Kaputt. Warsaw correspondent for the Corriere, Valcini
   witnessed the German invasion in 1939, the subsequent occupation of the
   city, and the ghetto uprising in the spring of 1943. The memories of
   those events were collected in a volume, Il calvario di Varsavia
   ({''}The Calvary of Warsaw{''}), published by Garzanti in 1945 and never
   reprinted. This essay intends to propose a selective reading of these
   two atypical narratives of the Warsaw ghetto, construed by writers whose
   intellectual trajectory revealed to be, moreover, deeply compromised
   with the world of fascist ideology.},

Abstract = {In modern conditions of rapid development of international contacts and
   ties in culture, politics, economics and other spheres, practical
   knowledge of foreign languages becomes a real necessity and an
   indispensable condition for a successful career. Educators and
   researchers in recent decades have increasingly focused on the unity of
   motivational-cognitive and behavioral components in the graduate's
   personality structure. The broader concepts reflecting this unit turned
   out to be ``competence{''} and ``being competent.{''} Contextual
   analysis of the concepts ``competence{''} and ``professional
   competence{''} indicates that various approaches to their interpretation
   have now been developed. The competence-action approach could implement
   the conceptual idea of modernizing the teaching and learning process,
   that is, ensuring mastery of communicative activities through the
   development of a set of competences focused on opportunities, skills,
   needs, cognitive activity and creativity of the students with clear
   political implications. It is concluded that, the competence in foreign
   languages is based on the development of constitutive capacities, such
   as: linguistic, communicative, transcultural, sociocultural,
   intellectual, educational, professional and critical thinking.},

Abstract = {In this article, we reconstruct the axes of student criticism of the
   university model of the last dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983) and
   of its main university policies (reduction of student enrollment and
   admission, setting of tuition fees, closing of careers, elimination of
   university autonomy and co-government, among others). Likewise, we
   reflect on the place of this agenda in the process of reorganization and
   reconfiguration of the student movement of the University of Buenos
   Aires. To do this, we describe the main repertoires of action deployed
   by the student movement against these policies and analyze the place of
   the 1918 reformist ideology in the articulation of criticism of
   dictatorial university policy and in the elaboration of alternative
   models.},

Abstract = {The decision to leave the EU provoked the biggest constitutional crisis
   of recent British history. The referendum-a device for circumventing the
   parliamentary process-was followed by conflict between a minority
   government and a majority of MPs unwilling to leave the EU without
   satisfactory alternative arrangements. The courts, drawn into this
   conflict, upheld conventions that sustain the authority of Parliament
   and restrain the despotic power of ministers. The reaction of members of
   the current government was to take disreputable and anti-democratic
   positions against both the Speaker of the House of Commons and the
   courts. They now have a sufficient majority in Parliament to resume
   adherence to constitutional conventions and restore a political culture
   of debate and tolerance, but they show little sign of doing so, and
   there is a risk that they will do irreparable damage to the political
   culture that underpins democracy.},

Abstract = {The modern principles of judiciary, being an integrative
   constitutional-theoretical category, are the object of scientific
   research from the point of view of a meaningful interpretation, as well
   as the specific nature of formalization, including its the comparative
   legal aspect. In this regard, the research subject of this article is
   represented by the norms of the constitutions of the member states of
   the Commonwealth of Independent States. The article presents the
   analysis results, which allowed us identifying the nonstandard
   approaches to consolidate the constitutional principles of the judiciary
   in the focus group of acts. We associate these approaches with the
   compositional specific nature of principle reflection, as well as with
   the variably-substantive aspect, which quantitatively and qualitatively
   supplements the standard list of required fundamental ideas.},

Abstract = {The approach to fats here proposed is based on experiences from an
   ethnographic fieldwork performed in laboratories and inspired by the
   socio-technical networks of ANT and New Materialism theories. Thus, this
   paper proposes a standpoint in which fats that take part as objects in
   the relationships that make it emerge as a scientific fact and describes
   the way a semiotic-material process is set in motion in chemical and
   technological laboratories with the machines, definitions, technologies,
   pots, textures and texts for making fats. Fats emerging in their
   socio-material scientific relations due to acid fat fractionations,
   chromatographs, enzymatic catalysis, congresses, genetic sequences,
   esterifications, meetings, blenders, computer programs, emulsions,
   papers, etc. would not be a required component of the research process
   (no-agency supports), but an active assemblage in which fats become
   scientific phenomena in action.},

   DECISIONS: EAEU PROSPECTIVE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {164-176},
Abstract = {The constitutional reforms in Russia are amongst the most significant
   news for Russia's partners in international relations. The configuration
   of international law and Russian domestic legal order falls within the
   scope of the constitutional changes of 2020, and there is no chance that
   this change will be abandoned by the legislator. This particular
   amendment was not actively commented on during the nationwide discussion
   on the constitutional reform; it drew mostly experts' attention. The
   article alleges that the constitutional amendment restricting the
   applicability of international case law in Russia is both a transient
   response to the instant political tension around Russia, and a
   formalization of the positivistic trend well established in domestic
   judicial practice. The positivistic trend is part of the process shaping
   Russia's own approach to international law. The prospective amendment
   concerning international case law in the Constitution of the Russian
   Federation will not hinder the rules expressly stated in the treaties of
   the EAEU. However, the resolutions of the EAEU's structures and
   institutions, including the case law of the Court of the EAEU, are
   likely to be scrutinized in a defensive way by Russian Constitutional
   court in situations extraordinary for the Russian State, ensuring their
   conformity with the unquestionable and unconditional supremacy of the
   Russian Constitution.},

Abstract = {The article responds to the argument that Beijing has been using
   economic incentives to cause recipient nations to switch their
   diplomatic allegiances, which ultimately means breaking off ties with
   Taiwan and recognizing the PRC. It can be concluded that the empirical
   data confirm China's use of dollar diplomacy. In the case of most of the
   analysed countries capital flows and economic benefits were provided
   shortly before diplomatic ties were established. For all of the
   countries, their diplomatic recognition of the PRC enabled rich
   economic, trade, and development links with China. However, the volumes
   of capital flows were unstable and the awarding of economic advantages
   was not automatic and even in states which saw the biggest input of
   capital and the most lucrative economic deals, China's use of dollar
   diplomacy leaves several questions.},

Abstract = {Serious reflection on the regime of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil requires
   considering renewed theoretical and historical debates on fascism. This
   essay explores recent contributions by Perry Anderson, Dylan Riley, Enzo
   Traverso, Atilio Boron, and Armando Boito Jr., putting each in
   conversation with present political and socioeconomic dynamics in Brazil
   and focusing on the state form and the power bloc, with an excursus on
   the local militia state in Rio de Janeiro. The essay argues that
   Bolsonaro is unlikely to establish a fascist dictatorship, given the
   political paralysis of his regime's first several months and the
   difficulties of sustaining a political project rooted in a heterogeneous
   social base within a context of persistent world-market stagnation and
   ongoing Brazilian economic contraction. Still, the essay insists that
   the most compelling theoretical, historical, and political work on the
   prospects of twenty-first-century fascism in Brazil and elsewhere comes
   from those who do not rule out the possibility of its success.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {348-364},
Abstract = {Capital is a magnificent masterpiece that Marx spent all his life on,
   and Engels's theoretical contributions to Capital make his name
   inseparably connected with Marx's. Materialist dialectics is the
   fundamental method of analyzing the relationship between capital and
   wage labor in Capital. Engels not only completed the application of
   materialist dialectics to the field of economics with Marx in the
   process of Marx's creation of materialist dialectics, but also made a
   systematic and perfect research on materialist dialectics after Marx's
   death. Capital has enduring academic value, and Engels's theoretical
   contributions to Capital are mainly manifested in his three rounds of
   correspondence with Marx, as well as his writings, annotations and
   supplements for Capital when revising the new edition of volume 1 and
   editing and publishing volume 2 and volume 3. Capital is a sharp sword
   that stabs the heart of the bourgeoisie. Engels not only criticized the
   attitude of the bourgeoisie towards Capital by writing book reviews and
   pamphlets, thus prompting the working class to understand Capital, but
   also criticized the wrong remarks of the bourgeoisie in a direct and
   open way, thus developing Marx's theory in defending Capital.},

   presents a novel framework to answer these questions, adapting its
   analysis to the context of competitive authoritarian regimes in Africa.
   Recent literature tends to focus on whether heightened electoral
   pressure encourages more pro-poor policy interventions, for instance,
   leading to improved health services. While not dismissing the
   significance of voter demands, this article refocuses attention on the
   largely overlooked role of organized interests in shaping legislative
   action. More specifically, it examines how the distribution of power
   across more ``mass-based{''} groups as well as within the ruling elite
   jointly influence policy outcomes, including pro-poor policies consonant
   with voter preferences. The argument is two-fold: one, mass-based groups
   - unions, farmers' associations and the like - can help galvanize MPs to
   demand more pro-poor policy; two, elite divisions, especially within the
   ruling party, help create the opening for activists to lobby
   effectively. Using a process-tracing methodology, the article
   demonstrates this theory through two case studies of semi-successful
   legislative interventions in Uganda and one failed attempt in Tanzania.
   For evidence, it draws on a mix of elite interviews, party and
   parliamentary reports, and press reviews.},

Abstract = {This article reevaluates the Iranian polymath Ali Shariati's most
   controversial lectures. Scholarly consensus reads 1969's Ummat va Imamat
   as derivative, comprising an imitation of Sukarno's guided democracy and
   hence an apology for postcolonial authoritarian rule. Shariati's
   rhetorical performance suggests otherwise. The lectures address a
   postcolonial iteration of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's paradox of founding-a
   call for self-determination alongside the external intervention needed
   to prepare for it in the wake of moral dispositions accrued during
   colonization. Shariati proposes to resolve the problem of enduring
   colonial domination by citing a fabricated French professor, a
   foreigner, as an authoritative source. He practices a noble lie,
   believable because it draws from colonized sensibilities but laden with
   hints encouraging audiences to see past it. If audiences develop the
   requisite ability to decipher the lie, Shariati wagers, they at once
   develop the autonomy implied by self-determination. On these grounds,
   Shariati theorizes the paradox of politics as decolonization.},

Abstract = {Citizen satisfaction with democracy is greater when parties offer
   choices that are congruent with voter preferences. But are citizens
   content with simply having a party that represents their views or does
   their satisfaction depend on whether that party can also be instrumental
   in implementing policies? We argue that instrumentality moderates the
   effect of ideological congruence on democratic satisfaction. Combining
   an analysis of cross-national survey data with an experimental conjoint
   design, we find that citizens able to vote for a congruent party with a
   chance of entering government are more satisfied with democracy, whereas
   congruence without instrumentality has no such effect.},

Abstract = {Cultural and political economy theories linking a vibrant civil society
   to democratic outcomes expect domestic election monitors to provide a
   vaccine against democratic backsliding. The empirical track record of
   such groups, however, is mixed. Drawing from theories of interest
   representation and social movement research, I present a novel approach
   to studying the effect of observer groups. Conceptualizing monitors as
   agenda-builders, I contend that their potential impacts rely on two
   factors neglected by previous studies: access to the public's agenda,
   and access to policymakers. I test the impact of election monitoring on
   electoral integrity using cross-national time-series data of all
   democratic backsliding and revival episodes in Asia from 1950 to 2018. I
   find that domestic monitors do have more than a placebo effect, but that
   their capacities to immunize against democratic regression are modest at
   best. When neither access to the public's agenda nor access to
   policymakers are present, monitors are unlikely to halt backsliding.
   However, public attention becomes an effective resource where groups
   have policy access. This adds to studies of democratic backsliding,
   election monitoring, and interest groups.},

Abstract = {This article aims to situate Isaiah Berlin's influential
   conceptualization of the liberal idea of liberty in negative terms in
   the history of political ideologies, thus contributing to the
   understanding of the development of liberalism as an ideological
   tradition. More specifically, the article contributes to the
   understanding of two central themes in the ideological history of
   negative liberty. First, it shows that negative liberty has repeatedly
   served as an ideological weapon against radical democratic politics,
   while also pointing to an important shift in the manner of its
   employment: between the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries, we
   argue, negative liberty had turned from a deflationary device associated
   with excessive democracy into a moderate ideal endangered by
   totalitarian democracy. The second theme that we highlight and account
   for is the late development of the association of the liberal conception
   of liberty with the idea of negativity.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often criticize psychological approaches to the
   study of politics on the grounds that many psychological theories were
   developed on convenience samples of college students or members of the
   mass public, whereas many of the most important decisions in politics
   are made by elites, who are presumed to differ systematically from
   ordinary citizens. This paper proposes an overarching framework for
   thinking about differences between elites and masses, presenting the
   results of a meta-analysis of 162 paired treatments from paired
   experiments on political elites and mass publics, as well as an analysis
   of 12 waves of historical elite and mass public opinion data on foreign
   policy issues over a 43 year period. It finds political scientists both
   overstate the magnitude of elite-public gaps in decision-making, and
   misunderstand the determinants of elite-public gaps in political
   attitudes, many of which are due to basic compositional differences
   rather than to elites' domain-specific expertise.},

Abstract = {A century ago, Progressive reformers in the U.S. introduced the
   institutional innovations of direct democracy, claiming these reforms
   would cultivate better citizens. Two decades of high-profile research
   have supported and challenged the relationship between direct democracy,
   increased attention to politics, and a higher turnout rate. We propose,
   however, that a necessary condition of the ``educative effects{''} model
   is voter familiarity with initiatives and referendums. While some
   research has examined ballot measure awareness, we suspect that that the
   standard measurements-e.g., ``Have you heard of Proposition
   X?{''}-overestimate actual knowledge. Specifically, we measure ballot
   measure knowledge in a manner requiring voters to demonstrate
   familiarity with specific measures rather than merely asserting broad
   familiarity. Our approach reveals that the public's awareness of
   statewide ballot measures, both in the abstract and with respect to
   particular measures, is far lower than past research suggests.
   Importantly, it also reveals that people with high levels of education,
   political interest, and knowledge of national politics are the most
   likely to misrepresent their ballot measure awareness.},

   media and educators to follow when conducting information campaigns:
   namely, lowering the reading level of information. Educators have long
   argued that texts can be confusing when written at a literacy level
   higher than the reader is able to digest. This article tests the impact
   of reading level on knowledge, interest and opinion on an electoral
   reform proposal. It employs an experimental design, conducted in person
   in fall 2018 with college students in Ontario, Canada. The experiment
   asked the students to read a text on a single transferable vote (STV)
   electoral system at one of three reading levels (or a control text) and
   then answer a series of questions gauging their knowledge, interest and
   opinion on the electoral reform proposal. The results provide an
   assessment of the impact of different levels of information on these
   factors and suggest concrete recommendations for election management
   bodies (EMBs) and other actors seeking to educate the public on complex
   political issues.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the barriers that people with disabilities face
   in their daily lives and in their surroundings. Using data from the 2017
   National Discrimination Survey, we performed a multinomial logit
   regression model. Our results reveal that people in situations of
   disability are less likely to access social services and educational
   opportunities, and to participate fully in work; therefore, they are
   more prone to earn a lower income to cover their basic needs. One of the
   main barriers to these individuals is the design of the urban
   infrastructure, such as streets and sidewalks, and the lack of adequate
   urban transport, which facilitates or deters transportation. Similarly,
   our study indicates that this vulnerable group has difficulties covering
   expenses related to care, therapies, and treatments, so performing basic
   activities such as bathing, dressing, or eating is difficult for them.
   In addition, the findings indicate that they perceive economic
   insecurity and discrimination. For this reason, it is necessary to
   generate inclusive policies that improve significantly the well-being of
   people with disabilities.},

   security issues that have emerged in Libya since the outbreak of the

   and energy security are still at stake within the comprehensive and
   indivisible security that the OSCE strives to bring across its area.
   Although security in the Mediterranean is linked to that of OSCE
   participating States, Libya's fragmentation has highlighted the
   challenges in adopting joint policies in the country. Therefore, the
   OSCE still faces the challenge to effectively engage with Libya in its
   ongoing debate on common security in the Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {Ever since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Union
   has aimed to increase transparency and decrease corruption in
   procurement by several directives and policies.
   In this study, we will assess whether the transposition of Directives
   2014/23, 2014/24 and 2014/25 has led to more transparency and less
   corruption in public procurement. We measure transparency through the
   presence of key information fields in tender notices, while corruption
   is measured through the risk indicator of single bidding.
   We first regress eight indicators of transparency on single bidding in
   eight different binary logistic models.
   Here we find that a ratio indicator of transparency, in which the share
   of key missing information fields on the tender notice level is
   calculated, shows the highest effect on single bidding. Using this ratio
   transparency indicator, we observe no clear increase of transparency
   after the transposition of the directives. Likewise, our models do not
   provide support for a decrease of single bidding after the transposition
   of the directives. We find that the leeway the generic nature of the
   2014 Directives provide may decrease the level of previously
   well-established procurement laws and norms in specific countries. We
   recommend increasing the monitoring and enforcement power of the Union
   to ensure proper compliance. We also propose to implement a Unionwide
   tender data repository and platform to foster research and open
   competition in tenders.},

Abstract = {In the course of their transition to a market economy, the importance of
   international knowledge transfer from developed capitalist countries to
   the post-Soviet states has increased. However, the question of what
   particular knowledge has been transferred and why in some cases
   knowledge transfer has been successful, while in others it has failed,
   remains under-researched. Using gender mainstreaming as an example, the
   mechanisms of international knowledge transfer in Russian social policy
   are discussed in detail. The authors argue that specific knowledge
   transfer could facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge, but its
   sustainable application in social policy decision-making might be
   problematic, requiring commitment of political actors as well as
   supportive institutional conditions.},

Abstract = {This analysis of issue emphasis on Twitter by the seven main German
   parties during the 2017 federal election campaign underlines the
   importance of taking a time-sensitive approach when investigating issue
   competition. We show that the attention parties give to issues they are
   associated with fluctuates frequently on social media and alternates
   with other thematic priorities that may not be `owned'. In the digital
   age, therefore, established theories of issue ownership come under
   pressure. Our findings reveal that short-term issue emphasis is driven
   by exogenous shocks and spatial considerations. The exact mechanism
   behind parties' decisions to emphasise a specific issue in the short run
   depends on the type of issue in focus. Communication on economic
   left-right and socio-cultural issues is shaped by different strategies.
   Our study reveals that when studying issue competition online different
   policy dimensions need to be distinguished just as the temporal dynamics
   need to be understood. This needs to be done instead of aggregating data
   to give a holistic account.},

Abstract = {Past research has shown that issues vary significantly in their salience
   across citizens, explaining key outcomes in political behavior. Yet it
   remains unclear how individual-level differences in issue salience
   affect the measurement of latent constructs in public opinion, namely
   political ideology. In this paper, we test whether scaling approaches
   that fail to incorporate individual-level differences in issue salience
   could understate the predictive power of ideology in public opinion
   research. To systematically examine this assertion, we employ a series
   of latent variable models which incorporate both issue importance and
   issue position. We compare the results of these different and diverse
   scaling approaches to two survey data sets, investigating the
   implications of accounting for issue salience in constructing latent
   measures of ideology. Ultimately, we find that accounting for issue
   importance adds little information to a more basic approach that uses
   only issue positions, suggesting ideological signals for measurement
   models reside most prominently in the issue positions of individuals
   rather than the importance of those issues to the individual.},

Abstract = {The paper relies on empirical evidence from Estonia and Slovakia to
   develop an understanding of populism as a performative and transgressive
   political style. We argue that populism cannot be defined in ideological
   terms nor can it be attached to particular political subjects. Instead,
   it is a political style that can be adopted and mimicked by various
   subjects from extreme right to social liberal. The performativity of
   populism presupposes forms of transgression that disrupt the normalcy of
   political routine. Populist performances thus seek and construct an
   authenticity by taking politics outside of its conventional
   institutional frameworks. We examine the cases of ekre in Estonia and
   lsns and OLaNO in Slovakia.},

Abstract = {Zuma's ascendancy to the South African Presidency coincided with the
   lingering global economic crisis of 2007-2009, which affected many of
   the Western economies. By this time, China experienced a rapid economic
   growth and became a potential partner for commodities exporting
   countries like South Africa. As such, it became a potential partner in
   the face of declining commodity demand from the West. Against this
   background, Zuma deepened South Africa's ties with China to rescue the
   domestic economy. China has since received much attention in Zuma's
   administration resulted in many scholars emanating from International
   Relations and other cognate academic disciplines and members of the
   media describing the move as a shift in South Africa's foreign policy.
   This article employs Afrocentricity as an alternative theoretical
   framework to interrogate the question as to whether closer ties between
   the two countries marked a shift or Zuma prioritised China.
   Methodologically, this is a desktop article that relied on secondary
   data and employed an Afrocentric qualitative research methodology to
   establish whether the deepening relations led to a shift in South
   Africa's foreign policy or China received priority in Zuma's
   administration.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of color revolutions has occupied a prominent place in
   Russian politics for a good reason. The major threat of color
   revolutions as modern political warfare designed by Western countries
   deeply affected the political process in Russia since 2005. It may have
   appeared that the imperative of resisting them was the result of a
   non-democratic regime reacting to neighboring countries' uprisings. Some
   portrayed it as authoritarian learning. This paper suggests that the
   counteractions stemmed from the interests of disunited Russian elite
   groups who were seeking opportunities to reinforce their dominance and
   capitalize on the idea of significant external threats. The phenomenon
   reshaped the balance within elite groups and led to the consolidation of
   law enforcement networks on the eve of Putin's third term. Further, the
   prevailing perception of color revolutions discouraged any elite splits
   that could lead to proto-democratic rules.},

Abstract = {Transnational European party federations-'Europarties'-are an overlooked
   actor of EU external relations despite their strong footprint outside
   the EU. This article discusses the activities of Europarties as networks
   of EU external relations closely aligned with the interests and values
   of EU foreign policy but conditioned by their character as transnational
   partisan actors with distinct ideological affinity and political
   commitments to partner parties in the European neighbourhood.
   Empirically, the article investigates the activities of the centre-right
   European People's Party in Georgia and North Macedonia, demonstrating
   how Europarties can act as amplifiers of EU influence in Eastern Europe
   and Western Balkans, but also how their partisan interests often come
   into tension with EU priorities. The findings carry implications for the
   theory and practice of EU relations with its neighbourhood at a time
   when prospects for further enlargement appear significantly weakened.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine the effect of local government proliferation
   on maternal mortality in Indonesia. Despite the large body of literature
   on the determinants of local government proliferation, little is known
   about the consequences of district proliferation on public health
   services and outcomes. Drawing on in-depth interviews with local
   government officials, health providers, and non-state actors as well as
   observations of health care provision in four districts in Indonesia,
   this study reveals that the lack of local state capacity in the newly
   created districts contributes to higher rates of maternal mortality in
   the new districts compared to those of old districts. Not only does the
   lack of state capacity increase the dependency of local government on
   central government resources, it also discourages the development of
   local initiatives and policies to reduce maternal mortality.},

Abstract = {At the general election of February 2020, Sinn Fein won a plurality of
   the vote in the Republic of Ireland for the first time. The party system
   remained highly fragmented and, with Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refusing
   to enter government with Sinn Fein, government formation took a record
   20 weeks. Those 20 weeks coincided with the emergence of the Covid-19
   public health emergency in Europe. A minority caretaker government
   introduced significant policy measures to address the associated public
   health and economic crises. At the end of June, Fianna Fail and Fine
   Gael entered government together for the first time, and the Green Party
   joined them in a three-party majority coalition. The government faces
   significant challenges resulting from Covid-19 and from the UK's exit
   from the EU, and other policy problems including housing and healthcare.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Because the prejudice of the ingroup builds into fear of the outgroup,
   jihadist terrorism is expected to strengthen the politicized link
   between security and immigration. I use a causal inference in a
   clustered cross-country analysis to test the simultaneous short-run
   causal impact of the jihadist threat on security fear and ethnic
   prejudice of the public in Israel, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden,
   France, and Germany. In line with common wisdom, jihadist attacks
   significantly increase security fear. Against it, jihadist attacks
   non-significantly decrease ethnic prejudice. This empirical pattern
   holds in across different types of immigration attitudes, ethnic groups,
   intervals of time and terrorist events, and is robust to placebo
   treatments, placebo policy preferences, fake and failed terror attacks.
   These findings challenge extant consensus, and suggest that jihadist
   attacks, particularly at the local level, induce risk-aversion rather
   than desire for retaliation.},

Title = {Laughter as dissensus: Kant and the limits of normative theorizing
   around laughter},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {795-814},

Abstract = {Political theorists have traditionally grappled with laughter by posing
   a simple, normative question: `What role, if any, should laughter play
   in thepolis?' However, the outsized presence of laughter in contemporary
   politics has rendered this question increasingly obsolete. What good
   does determining laughter's role in thepolisdo when thepolisitself is to
   a large extent shaped by laughter? The present essay argues that Kant's
   aesthetic investigations of laughter in theCritique of
   JudgmentandAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of Viewoffer a much
   needed alternative to the normative discourse. Kant theorizes laughter
   as an intensely dialectical experience - at once an aesthetic
   judgmentandan affect. Laughter in Kant enacts dissensus: it disrupts and
   transformssensus communis, or the ways subjects see and hear the world
   in common that organize and structure a political community. The essay
   illustrates the advantages of a Kantian conception of the politics of
   laughter over the normative discourse by examining Dave Chappelle's
   controversial 2019 stand-up comedy specialSticks \& Stones. It concludes
   that the dissensus enacted by laughter, while not necessarily
   democratic, provides a privileged opening for democratic politics.},

Abstract = {States in Africa are labeled ``system ineffectual,{''} inconsequential
   to global politics, and lacking material and ideational capabilities to
   structure their foreign relations. The result is a portrayal of a
   passive Africa at the whims of its bilateral partners-be they China, the
   United States, or Russia. Contra this impolitic framing of Africa, this
   article explores how states in Africa are strategically shaping the
   norms of development paradigms promoted by foreign powers and
   influencing external actors to legitimize their preferred norms.
   Empirically focusing on China's development model in Africa, the article
   examines how norms related to the model are being shaped and diffused;
   and how through the ingenuity of political elites, China is making the
   China model ``on the go.{''} The main argument is that political elites
   in Africa are strategically reconstructing the China model, creating
   their own multifaceted versions that delicately balance their own
   domestic interests and their bilateral relations with China while
   deriving maximum benefits from the People's Republic of China.},

Abstract = {Referendums figure prominently in discussions about democracy and
   democratic innovation. Whereas much of the literature is focused on
   binary versions of the referendum, this article centralizes the
   non-binary or multi-option referendum, paying special attention to its
   modalities and the leverage they give to citizens in the ballot
   agenda-setting stage. Studying agenda-setting in multi-option
   referendums contributes to our understanding of civic democratic
   empowerment. For this purpose, we distil from practical experience the
   process steps and actors involved in triggering multi-option referendums
   and formulating ballot options. We map them in six main models of
   agenda-setting processes, three of which are legally institutionalized
   and triggered through bottom-up processes, allowing for competing
   proposals by citizens and legislators; three other models are
   characterized by top-down, ad hoc triggering and entail variation in the
   involvement of political parties, experts, societal groups and citizens
   in suggesting or selecting ballot options. Our procedural typology
   ultimately contributes to the body of research on referendum triggering
   and option formulation in the context of democratic innovation.},

Abstract = {Energy and other factors of production are the primary inputs in the
   context of sustainable economic growth. This makes energy relatively
   strategic in the development stage and in the energy importers
   economies. In this study, the effect of elasticity of substitution on
   economic growth is investigated for 31 OECD countries over the period
   from 1990-2014. Although the effect of elasticity of substitution
   between capital and aggregate energy consumption on economic growth has
   been examined in many studies, the issue of how this effect changes
   between the different sources of energy has not been adequately
   addressed. The research is aimed at contributing to the related
   literature in this regard. The effect of elasticity of substitution
   between capital and different energy sources on economic growth is
   examined within the neoclassical Solow-Swan Growth model. In this model,
   technology is defined by a variable elasticity of substitution (VES)
   production function. The empirical model is estimated by the non-linear
   least squares (NLLS) method. The results show that oil and primary
   energy consumption are substitutes; natural gas, coal, and
   hydroelectricity consumption are the complement in the final production
   of output.},

Abstract = {The importance of replication has been a major matter of discussion
   among political scientists for decades. However, in the past five years,
   the issue has gained greater traction, with many major journals adopting
   official standards for Data Access and Research Transparency (DA-RT). At
   the same time, scholars suggest the pivotal role that replication might
   play in methods training for students. Unfortunately, these
   conversations have been limited in that they emphasize quantitative
   methods and training of graduate students. This article seeks to fill
   this gap by offering commentary on the author's experience in
   introducing a qualitative replication project in an upper-division
   undergraduate course. The students in the course replicated Ross's
   (2004) influential article on the ``resource curse,{''} but the
   assignment framework can be adopted for various topics and contexts.},

Abstract = {Whilst much has been written about the opportunities and perils of Green
   participation in national coalition governments, analysis of Greens
   supporting minority governments is less common and has not focused on
   comparative-historical trends as this article does. We look beyond
   single case studies of Green-supported minority governments in order to
   establish historical party trajectories and policy impact over time in
   three countries with different political systems. The extent of the
   comparative work here has never previously been undertaken and
   establishes that repeat instances of such support can provide the basis
   for more stable and effective future interparty governing relationships.
   However, we argue that, whilst trust can build between parties to
   minority government arrangements over decades, it is not assured, and,
   whilst Green parties may achieve ministerial control after repeat
   instances of supporting minority governments, the benefits of doing so
   are not guaranteed.},

Abstract = {The risk of popular protest is one of the few deterrents against
   election manipulation in authoritarian regimes and unconsolidated
   democracies, but why are some fraudulent elections met with popular
   protest while others are not? We use data from elections in 108
   countries, from 1980 to 2004, to show that the regime's choice of
   election manipulation tactics affects the likelihood of post-election
   protest. Leaders signal their strength and resources by manipulating
   elections, but some manipulation tactics send stronger signals than
   others. We find that opposition groups are more likely to protest when
   relatively cheap administrative fraud is employed, but not when more
   costly forms of manipulation - extra-legal mobilization and voter
   intimidation - are used. This study demonstrates the importance of
   accounting for variation in electoral manipulation tactics, and the
   information communicated by those tactics, in explaining post-election
   protest and the stability of electoral authoritarian and newly
   democratic regimes.},

Abstract = {While scholars often portray Chinese political thought and tradition as
   standing in opposition to Western notions of political liberalism,
   little consideration has been given to compatibility between liberalism
   and Daoism, a prominent religion and long-standing alternative school of
   thought among Chinese peoples. Addressing this gap in the literature,
   this study in comparative political thought compares Laozi'sDao De
   Jingwith John Stuart Mill'sOn Libertyto illustrate certain core
   political ideas in theDao De Jingand their treatment in Mill's landmark
   text on political liberalism. Although the two texts diverge in terms of
   advocacy of popular representation, public contestation, and legal
   rights, both reject authoritarianism, uniformity, patriarchy,
   censorship, harm, violence, and wastefulness. A reasonable
   interpretation of these affinities is that a unique, indigenous, and
   non-Western model of liberalism existed in China via Laozi's thought for
   centuries before the advent of modern Western liberalism.},

   Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment of a failed election in Sweden},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Contemporary research on electoral integrity has focused on the
   functioning, evaluation, and legitimacy of electoral processes in
   emerging democracies. By contrast, this study investigates whether a
   failed election in a well-established democracy can affect individuals'
   evaluations of the electoral management body, the Election Authority,
   and whether those evaluations affect satisfaction with democracy. Using
   the case of a Swedish regional election in 2010 that had to be rerun due
   to procedural mistakes in the vote handling, we found that, in the short
   term, individuals' confidence in the Election Authority was reduced
   after it was announced that the election had to be rerun because of the
   mistakes. Subsequently, this decreased confidence was strongly
   associated with less satisfaction with democracy at the regional and
   national level. As good news for the authority, after a successful rerun
   election, confidence rebounded to the levels prior to the failed
   election.},

Abstract = {The concept of sovereignty still generates a considerable amount of
   debate in the discipline of International Relations. Using myth as a
   heuristic device, I argue that part of this confusion results from a
   mythical understanding of `sovereignty as equality'. Following the myth,
   sovereignty is seen as playing an equalising role in international
   relations, while international inequalities are depicted as existing
   despite the norm of sovereignty (and not as a result of it). The myth of
   sovereignty as equality thus enables international relations scholars to
   separate the inequalities instituted and legitimised by sovereignty from
   the concept itself. As a consequence, sovereignty is considered as
   normatively desirable since it is the best tool to offset inequalities.
   This article argues that the myth rests on three interlinked building
   blocks and that its maintenance can be explained by its normative appeal
   (more than by its dubious analytical value). Indeed, even those scholars
   who reproduce the myth acknowledge that international relations do not
   conform to it. As such, an effective critique of sovereignty requires
   both factual disproval (to reveal what the myth contributes to hide) and
   the construction of an alternative, more desirable myth.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of increased electoral competition on patronage
   politics? If programmatic appeals are not credible, institutional
   reforms that move politics from an elite- to a mass-focused and more
   competitive environment increase patronage efforts. This leads to an
   overall surge and notable spike in discretionary state hiring in
   election years. The study tests this prediction in the context of
   Indonesia's decentralized education sector. The authors exploit the
   exogenous phasing in and timing of elections in Indonesian districts for
   causal identification. They find evidence of election-related increases
   in the number of contract teachers on local payrolls and increases in
   civil service teacher certifications, which dramatically increases
   salaries. These effects are particularly pronounced for districts in
   which the former authoritarian ruling party is in competition with new
   entrants.},

Abstract = {With the approval of Articles 11 and 13 in Europe, net neutrality has
   become a contentious issue globally. These articles refer to European
   Union (EU) copyright law, which could possibly destroy the freedom of
   the internet that once existed. Throughout Europe it has become known as
   the ``meme ban,{''} referring to the censorship elements. While there is
   much opposition to these articles, its supporters consider it necessary
   for the preservation for creative works online. Opposition to the
   legislation, which includes certain websites and internet presences,
   remains of the opinion that these two pieces of legislation will mean an
   end to ``meme culture and user-generated content.{''} Along with the
   limitation to the freedom of the internet, cyber-security and
   cyber-warfare risks and vulnerabilities are imminent. This paper seeks
   to provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of neutrality on
   cyber-security and cyber-warfare.},

Title = {Protests and Voter Defections in Electoral Autocracies: Evidence From

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1926-1956},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A large literature expects that as protests unfold in electoral
   autocracies, voters who supported the ruling regime in the past will
   withdraw support and shift to supporting its opponents. Yet there are
   only a few empirical tests of how opposition protests influence voter
   defections in these regimes. To gain empirical traction on this
   question, I draw on evidence from Russia. Tying together evidence from a
   protest-event dataset and a panel survey of voters conducted prior to
   and during the 2011-2012 protest wave, I examine how voters who
   supported the ruling regime in the past respond to anti-regime
   mobilization. Results reveal differentiation in defections. While
   opposition protests dampen support for the ruling regime and depress
   engagement, they do not necessarily translate into greater support for
   the regime's challengers. Findings, which have implications for debates
   on defection cascades in autocracies, speak to the literatures on
   authoritarian endurance and the legacies of (attempted) revolutions.},

Abstract = {This essay reads John Locke'sTwo Treatisesthrough its nonhuman animal
   presences, especially the emblematic figures of cattle and ``noxious
   creatures{''} like ``lyons,{''} ``tygers,{''} and wolves. It argues that
   the real ground of Lockean human equality is an ongoing practice of
   subjugating nonhuman animals, and not any attribute of the human species
   as such. More specifically, the Lockean social compact founded on this
   equality relies on a ``dominion covenant,{''} an existential
   ``agreement{''} in which God lends the power of dominion to man and any
   threats to this order require punishment. This dynamic enables violence
   toward humans, in the name of their humanity, if they do not properly
   exert their power of dominion. Critics have connected Locke's theory of
   property to indigenous dispossession and his theory of punishment to
   carceral systems; both processes, I argue, intimately rely on the
   dominion covenant. Lockean racism is the fulfillment of, and not a
   deviation from, his account of human equality.},

   ``Schumpeterian{''} theories of entrepreneurship},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article reinterprets Schumpeter's theory of entrepreneurship in a
   decidedly un-{''}Schumpeterian{''} way, and argues that continued
   emphasis on Schumpeter's alleged glorification of the entrepreneur
   constitutes a missed opportunity for democratic critics of capitalism
   and neoliberalism. I demonstrate that Schumpeter did not exalt the
   individual entrepreneur as the paradigm for economic and political
   leadership in capitalist societies, and I show that he offers a
   surprisingly robust resource for reconceptualizing entrepreneurship.
   Schumpeter theorized entrepreneurship: (1) as a phenomenon that could
   not be exemplified by either individual persons or strictly private
   entities; (2) as a conceptual mechanism for analyzing change in the
   history of capitalism; and (3) even as evidence that political and
   economic leadership should not be conflated in modern democratic
   societies. By contextualizing Schumpeter's discussions of the
   entrepreneur, I suggest that a reconsideration of Schumpeter's actual
   theory of entrepreneurship would invigorate contemporary debates about
   the role of leadership in capitalist economies and liberal-democratic
   polities.},

Abstract = {This conceptual article argues that COVID-19 poses myriad global
   collective action challenges, some of which are easier than others to
   address. COVID-19 requires numerous distinct activities - e.g., vaccine
   development, uncovering treatment practices, imposing quarantines, and
   disease surveillance. The prognosis for effective collective action
   rests on the underlying aggregator technologies, which indicate how
   individual contributions determine the amount of a COVID-19 activity
   that is available for consumption. Best- and better-shot aggregators are
   more apt to promote desired outcomes than weakest- and weaker-link
   aggregators. The roles for public policy and important actors (e.g.,
   multi-stakeholder partnerships) in fostering collective action are
   indicated.},

Abstract = {Where nationality, coupled to minority language, forms a key factor of
   identities, and there is a history of conflict, it may be difficult for
   the police to command trust. In north-west Wales, Welsh is the language
   of the majority. Against the background of historic experiences of
   exploitation, oppression, and perceived neglect by English authorities,
   many locals have a negative view of the UK police. But what
   characterises those who are most in opposition? A total of 283 students
   at Bangor University participated in a questionnaire study. Results show
   that students who prefer to communicate in Welsh rather than English are
   more likely to distrust the UK police. While there are deep rooted
   tensions based on national identity, the police may gain trust from
   different sources compensating the cultural divide. They include mass
   media reports and experiences with the police. Overall however, the
   results support the group position theory applied to relations between
   people identifying with different nations.},

Abstract = {Does local exposure to refugees increase right-wing support? This paper
   studies a case uniquely suited to address this question: the allocation
   of refugees to the rural hinterlands of eastern Germany during the
   European refugee crisis. Similar to non-urban regions elsewhere, the
   area has had minimal previous exposure to foreigners, but distinctively
   leans towards the political right. Our data comprise electoral outcomes,
   and individual-level survey and behavioral measures. A policy allocating
   refugees following strict administrative rules and a matching procedure
   allow for causal identification. Our measurements confirm the presence
   of widespread anti-immigrant sentiments. However, these are unaffected
   by the presence of refugees in respondents' hometowns: on average, we
   record null effects for all outcomes, which we interpret as supporting a
   sociotropic perspective on immigration attitudes. Masked by these
   overall null findings, we observe convergence: local exposure to
   refugees appears to have pulled both right- and left-leaning individuals
   more towards the center.},

Abstract = {Existing explanations for the Russian annexation of Crimea do not pay
   enough attention to changes in the representation of the Ukraine crisis
   throughout its duration in Russian foreign policy discourse. This paper
   provides an additional interpretation, contending that the annexation
   became possible due to a particular context in which the events in
   Ukraine were presented as a threat to Russian compatriots. It also
   argues that due to the external shock of February 2014 events, the
   ``threat to compatriots{''} narrative became a dominant one and was
   adopted by Russian authorities, which likely contributed to the decision
   to annex Crimea.},

Abstract = {As foreign actors' disinformation campaigns continue to increase, it is
   now more important than ever to ensure factual information is not only
   available to, but also reaches citizens. In 2015, in response to this
   emerging threat, the East StratCom Task Force was established under the
   European External Action Service. By detecting, analyzing, and exposing
   malign influence operations-especially Russia's manipulative
   interferences the Task Force has been countering disinformation and
   supporting EU's wider communication efforts in its Eastern neighborhood.
   This article sheds light on the Task Force's responses in the cases of
   Ukraine and Belarus, while underlining the vital role of democracies and
   democratic institutions in addressing the threat of foreign
   disinformation.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author clarifies and defends the democratic ideas
   implied in his analysis of Icelandic politics and political culture
   before and after the financial collapse. The criticism of two Icelandic
   scholars, Jon Olafsson and Birgir Hermannsson, of Arnason's arguments
   and his use of Habermas's normative models of democracy, is evaluated.
   It is argued that Arnason's arguments need to be understood in light of
   the unique circumstances in Icelandic society around the financial
   collapse and that it is misleading to disconnect them from these
   circumstances. It is shown how Arnason steadily refers to the criticism
   in the report of the Special Investigation Commission of the Parliament
   about how poor governance and political practices were among the causes
   of the collapse. It is argued that the criticism of Jon Olafsson and
   Birgir Hermannsson, that Arnason reduces democracy to public policy and
   ignores the role of public participation, is rooted in that they ignore
   this particular context of his reasoning and thus draw misleading
   conclusions about his views towards democracy. The contention is also
   traced to a different understanding of the concept of democracy. Arnason
   rejects the understanding that the central emphasis in democracy should
   be to increase political participation of the citizens at the cost of
   emphasizing good governance and strong institutions, which protect
   democratic values and enable democratic accountability. Finally, ideas
   about civic engagement in the spirit of deliberative democracy are
   discussed in light of the threats to informed public opinion and debate
   in contemporary society.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {From 1948 to 1988, the United States failed to ratify and implement the
   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
   (Genocide Convention). In total, seven presidential administrations
   neglected to expend the necessary political capital to secure the
   Genocide Convention's passage. This article is the first comprehensive
   study of the presidential actions-and, more aptly, inactions-on the long
   road to ratification. Ultimately, of the seven presidents who failed to
   procure the Convention's ratification by the Senate, only three even
   sought the Senate's advice and consent on the important international
   accord, and in all cases, the presidents did so while working to ensure
   the act did not harm their broader legislative and foreign policy
   agendas. Ultimately, President Ronald Reagan oversaw the Convention's
   ratification, though he did so in response to the threat of a public
   relations disaster that his administration believed the ratification
   would help avert. Studying the motivations of these eight presidents
   deepens our understanding of why it took the United States 40 years to
   finally adopt the Genocide Convention.},

Abstract = {Why do common-pool problems persist over time in federations? The
   literature shows that macro institutional, economic, and political
   incentives facilitate bailouts through intergovernmental transfers and
   debt management. Little research, however, explores the legislative
   mechanisms that prevent common-pool problems from being effectively
   addressed. This article focuses on a most central mechanism: tax
   lawmaking. We argue that lawmakers, whose careers rest in the hands of
   provincial constituencies, administer the legislative process to promote
   bills that protect the federal transfers that finance vertical fiscal
   imbalances and to amend proposals that seek to change them. Using an
   expert-coded dataset designed to assess the direction and magnitude of
   tax policy change, as described by the amendments proposed by
   legislators to the full set of tax bills proposed to the Argentine
   Congress since 1983, we document the legislative dynamics underpinning
   the common-pool problems of decentralized fiscal federal arrangements.},

Abstract = {The difficult question raised by Moses' role in The Prince is whether
   Machiavelli was being ironic in suggesting that Moses was not comparable
   with his other examples of new leaders, since they succeeded through
   their own ability whereas Moses was simply carrying out God's
   commands,'as his executor'. The problem is approached here from three
   different perspectives. First, from Moses' role in the cultural debates
   in Florence, where he was both admired as a prophet and an ancient magus
   and criticized as the model for Savonarola's contentious religious
   mission. Secondly, from the perspective of Savonarola's sermons and the
   impact his personification of Moses as a political leader had on
   Machiavelli. And lastly from the wider perspective of Machiavelli's view
   of the world, God, and politics as a writer and pragmatic secretary in
   the chancery. Together they help to integrate Machiavelli's Moses as a
   man of action rather than a holy prophet, admired for his political
   acuity and his ability to seize the chance when it came to found a new
   popular state},

   systemization, displacement of decision making power and that the Equal
   Pay Certification might be an illusion. Results also showed a shift in
   the emphasis in the annual collective agreement right of employees to an
   employee interview, the flexibility of the certification is
   underutilized as well as subjective performance assessment of employees
   and inconsistencies in the procedures of the certification bodies. Even
   though, at first glance, the Equal Pay Certification seems valid and
   reliable there are certain factors which can make it possible to meet
   the requirements for Equal Pay Certification, even though there is a
   gender pay gap.},

Abstract = {To shed light on polarized perspectives regarding the virtues or
   downfalls of worker cooperatives among variants of Marxists, this
   article focuses on Marx's own Janus-faced analysis of worker
   cooperatives. Marx had great faith in the radical potential of worker
   cooperatives, properly organized and politically oriented, but he also
   was greatly critical of the tendency of cooperatives to shrink their
   political horizons and become isolated from broader labor movements.
   Although thinkers in the Marxist tradition criticize worker cooperatives
   when they operate as isolated circles of `collective capitalists' within
   the existing capitalist system, Marx himself saw important potential in
   the cooperative movement, to the extent that it was integrated into
   broader campaigns for social change. Marx believed that cooperatives
   could help point the way to an alternative system of free and equal
   producers, and could prompt radical imaginings among their advocates,
   but only to the extent that cooperative practitioners recognized the
   need for class-conscious, industrial scale organizing of workers against
   the capitalist system. In the end, Marx did not so much focus on
   promoting a certain type of labor organization as being most conducive
   to transformation (e.g. worker cooperatives or labor unions). Rather, he
   focused more on the importance of class consciousness within labor
   organizing, and on the development of radicalized class consciousness
   among workers, whether through the expansion of labor unions, worker
   cooperatives, or any other institution of worker empowerment. It is the
   nature of a labor institution's focus on developing and sustaining class
   consciousness, not the nature of the labor institution itself (i.e.
   cooperative or union), that Marx believed to most powerfully shape the
   radical or degenerative tendencies of local forms of labor activism.},

Abstract = {The `environment' is a fully devolved concern in UK governance, though
   the comparative dynamics of devolved environmental governance remain
   poorly understood. The potential for the repatriation of significant
   environmental powers from the EU to devolved administrations through
   Brexit means that the nature of devolved environmental policy-making is
   increasingly coming under the spotlight. This paper enhances collective
   understanding about the nature of devolved environmental government and
   governance by adopting a comparative approach across the devolved
   nations of the UK. Based upon interviews and policy publications it
   analyses a number of key policy-making and institutional variables in
   relation to responses to an international environmental regime. In both
   Wales and Scotland evidence was found of environmental policy-making,
   policy-innovation and institution-building that diverged from the UK.
   Wales, in particular, evidenced how `the environment' appears to be seen
   as a dynamic space for policy and institutional innovation. These
   findings highlight how the devolved-scale of governance might be
   particularly fruitful for environmental policy-innovation when the
   means, motive and opportunity are evident. It also highlights how key
   conditions are evident to ensure that devolved agencies may be empowered
   to undertake radically divergent approaches and programmes.},

Abstract = {The rise of the gig economy and the prospect of increased automation has
   led to renewed calls for the implementation of a Universal Basic Income
   scheme from a variety of spokespeople on the left, including notable
   journalists, academics and politicians. Weeks, Mason, Srnicek and
   Williams and others suggest that such a re-orientation of welfare
   distribution would not only mitigate the effects of these tectonic
   changes to the nature of labour, but it might in fact facilitate a break
   away from neoliberal capitalism and towards a post-work condition.
   Building upon the work of Universal Basic Income detractors such as
   Pitts and Dinerstein, this article brings into question the likelihood
   of these claims. Universal Basic Income's advocates speak of the freedom
   to be unlocked by Universal Basic Income: but the freedom to do what and
   for whom? The article addresses the increasing significance for the
   process of valorisation today of digital `free labour', and thus
   explores the idea that Universal Basic Income might have presented
   itself at this current juncture less to be a vehicle to a utopian future
   and more to be a handmaid for capitalism as its mode of production
   evolves. After utilising Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror to depict a
   dystopian imaginary of what a Universal Basic Income-future might thus
   really look like, the article concludes by questioning how we might
   rescue the scheme as a leftist project: attending to Guattari's insights
   into how to resist capitalism's subjectivation, as well as Fuchs' vision
   for an `alternative Internet'.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom assumes the best way to mobilize public support for
   military action is through the lens of national security. Humanitarian
   justifications provide a helpful substitute when US interests are not at
   stake, but are less reliable. However, US presidents have provided
   humanitarian explanations for every military intervention of the
   post-Cold War period. What, if any, power do humanitarian justifications
   have in security-driven interventions? The article answers this question
   by developing a domestic coalition framework that evaluates
   justifications in terms of whose support matters most in the build-up to
   intervention. Survey experiments demonstrate that humanitarian
   narratives are necessary to build the largest possible coalition of
   support. However, presidents risk backlash if they stretch humanitarian
   claims too far. Data from thirteen waves of Chicago Council surveys and
   an original dataset of justifications for US interventions confirm that
   humanitarian justifications are a common and politically relevant tool.
   The findings challenge both the folk realist expectation that the public
   responds primarily to threats to its own security and the constructivist
   tendency to limit the power of humanitarian justifications to cases of
   humanitarian intervention. Instead, humanitarian justifications are
   equally, if not more, important than security explanations for
   mobilizing domestic support, even in security-driven interventions.},

Abstract = {The rise of female chief executives appears to signal gender progress,
   but this may not be unequivocally so. This article advances a contextual
   theory for the role of gender on leaders' approval ratings, a key
   measure of ``success{''} and source of executive power. I argue that
   because of gendered expectations and discourse, female presidents will
   receive lower approval ratings in contexts of corruption. The study
   focuses on Latin America, known for its powerful, masculinist
   presidential regimes and its democratically elected female leaders. I
   first trace the gendered construction of President Michelle Bachelet's
   image as an honest mother. Upon a presidential scandal, higher standards
   and gendered discourse resulted in deeply disappointed citizens,
   significantly undermining her popularity. Models of eighteen Latin
   American countries next reveal a negative impact of being a
   female-rather than a male-president on approval ratings. Marginal
   effects plots show that female presidents score worse than their male
   counterparts in contexts of at least one presidential scandal and higher
   executive corruption. This article contributes to the growing literature
   on gender and corruption. It also challenges some conventional wisdom on
   the pro-women consequences of female leadership in providing a more
   nuanced account of the role of gender in the executive branch.},

Abstract = {Notions of relative autonomy shape the discourse on voluntary
   recruitment of women and girls to terrorist networks. This article
   discusses voluntariness of women in Al-Shabaab recruitment, using
   feminist theories of relational autonomy based on an ethnographic study
   of sixteen selected Al-Shabaab women returnees in Kenya. The study
   analyses women's autonomous decision-making in volunteering for the
   Al-Shabaab network. Women participate on their sheer will independently
   of religiously inclined cultural values at one end, and on the other
   end, participation is shaped via gender-dynamics of submission and
   subordination within families and the community. However, due caution is
   exhibited in understanding different aspects in autonomous
   decision-making in volunteering, where some women had joined these
   networks as a struggle to exercise agency within systems of oppression
   in patriarchal setups with the lure for emancipation within the
   Al-Shabaab network and the utopian caliphate.},

Abstract = {Existentialist philosophy offers an understanding of how trying to
   eliminate ambiguities that inevitably mark the human condition only
   seemingly leads to freedom. This existentialist outlook can also serve
   to shed light on how democratic politics may similarly show tendencies
   which aim at overcoming immanent tensions. Such tendencies in democratic
   politics can be clarified using Sartre's notion of ignorance - and truth
   as its counterpart. His concept of ignorance goes beyond merely facts or
   knowledge and refers to a mode of being. It expresses a subject's desire
   to avoid, rather than confront, resistances stemming from the world.
   Based on a distinction of different forms in which this orientation can
   manifest itself, this article shows how democratic politics, too, can be
   threatened by ignorance as a way of doing politics. This ignorance comes
   in different guises which all express a desire to eliminate tensions
   that democratic politics cannot overcome without undermining itself.},

Abstract = {What are the conditions for establishing solidarity after a period of

   depends on establishing a relatively independent civil sphere, the
   effective functioning of whose institutions depend, in turn, on a shared
   sacred discourse of civility. To speak such a shared language, however,
   requires much more than engaging in speech acts. It depends upon a
   deeply emotional and highly symbolic process, one in which public
   performances of reconciliation create new structures of feeling and
   identification. This theoretical argument is elaborated empirically with
   reference to post-Holocaust Germany, post-Franco Spain, and
   post-Apartheid South Africa.},

Abstract = {Neo-classical liberals aim to offer a more consistent, coherent, and
   morally ambitious form of liberalism than the traditional classical and
   social liberal alternatives by providing grounds for a strong commitment
   to both individual economic liberty and social justice. The key
   neo-classical liberal claim is that the stringent protection of negative
   economic liberty does not conflict with, but is rather an essential
   component of, a commitment to political and social justice. My focus in
   this article is not on this key neo-classical claim itself, but rather
   on the conceptually prior question of the meaning and institutional
   implications of the negative conception of individual economic liberty.
   In addressing this question I trace some lines of argument which derive
   from the classical political economy of the late eighteenth and early
   nineteenth centuries. Drawing in particular on ideas and arguments
   developed by the American economist and social critic Henry George, I
   argue that a fully coherent and defensible conception of negative
   economic liberty is compatible with a commitment to a strongly
   conditional form of private landownership, but is incompatible with a
   commitment to absolute private property in land.},

Abstract = {Drug traffickers sometimes share profits peacefully. Other times they
   fight. We propose a model to investigate this variation, focusing on the
   role of the state. Seizing illegal goods can paradoxically increase
   traffickers' profits, and higher profits fuel violence. Killing kingpins
   makes crime bosses short-sighted, also fueling conflict. Only by
   targeting the most violent traffickers can the state reduce violence
   without increasing supply. These results help explain empirical patterns
   of violence in drug war, which is less studied than are interstate or
   civil war but often as deadly.},

Abstract = {This manuscript helps to resolve the ongoing debate concerning the
   effect of information communication technology on human rights
   monitoring. We reconceptualize human rights as a taxonomy of nested
   rights that are judged in textual reports and argue that the increasing
   density of available information should manifest in deeper taxonomies of
   human rights. With a new automated system, using supervised learning
   algorithms, we are able to extract the implicit taxonomies of rights
   that were judged in texts by the US State Department, Amnesty
   International, and Human Rights Watch over time. Our analysis provides
   new, clear evidence of change in the structure of these taxonomies as
   well as in the attention to specific rights and the sharpness of
   distinctions between rights. Our findings bridge the natural language
   processing and human rights communities and allow a deeper understanding
   of how changes in technology have affected the recording of human rights
   over time.},

   challenge for the democratic institutions. The aftermath of the Peace
   Accord, signed in 1992, has allowed the gradual development of the

   efforts have been made to institutionalize the use of democratic
   channels for decision-making. This article tackles the interaction

Abstract = {The US government creates astonishingly complete records of policy
   creation in executive agencies. In this article, we describe the major
   kinds of data that have proven useful to scholars studying interest
   group behavior and influence in bureaucratic politics, how to obtain
   them, and challenges that we as users have encountered in working with
   these data. We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov,
   which contains comments on draft agency rules, and newer sources of
   data, such asex-partemeeting logs, which describe the interest groups
   and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats are meeting face-to-face about
   proposed policies. One challenge is that much of these data are not
   machine-readable. We argue that scholars should invest in several
   projects to make these datasets machine-readable and to link them to
   each other as well as to other databases.},

Abstract = {Changing national alphabets is significant and controversial because of
   its connection to the legitimation of power in the past and present.
   Writing system revisions in Central Asia present intriguing variations.
   Latinization in Turkmenistan achieved the most notable recognition. In
   Uzbekistan, the government instituted some degree of Latinization, but
   the scope of the new alphabet remains limited. In Kazakhstan, the script
   change seems politically ambitious, but slow in its implementation. This
   article scrutinises how modern autocracies incorporate alphabetic
   alterations within their domestic and international legitimacy projects,
   places current Latinization efforts in historical context.},

Abstract = {In the 2017 Bundestag election, the recently reformed mixed-member
   proportional system (MMP) produced an enlarged parliament with 111
   additional seats. As could happen in the future, the Bundestag may even
   increase in size, so the parliamentary parties committed themselves to a
   renewed reform in order to curb seat enlargements. This was nonetheless
   to be done without major changes of the existing MMP. The article
   analyses the frontiers of such ``minimally invasive{''} reform. Each
   modification of ``personalised PR{''} that reliably maintains the
   Bundestag size would compromise one or other of its fundamental
   features: personalisation or proportionality. We illustrate this by
   exploring the effects of various single-member district (SMD) reforms
   that are widely considered the ``least harmful{''} minimally invasive
   approach. Comprehensive simulations based on survey data demonstrate
   that the SMD share would have to decrease substantially for maintaining
   parliamentary size as reliably as two-member districts would do. Thus,
   any SMD reform would either substantially affect the MMP's conventional
   personalisation or curb seat enlargement less effectively.},

Abstract = {How and why do the activities of members of parliament (MPs) change in
   response to electoral constraints? In this article, we draw on unique
   and newly collected data from the Swiss federal chambers and two
   cantonal parliaments (Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land) to explore the effects
   of electoral constraints. Leveraging variation in mandatory term limits,
   we study the extent to which term-limited MPs engage in shirking-that
   is, move away from their principal, whether it be the party and/or
   voters-and slacking-that is, reduce their parliamentary activities. Our
   analysis, which draws on a combination of novel roll-call votes and
   speech data, yields mixed results: while there is no evidence of
   shirking by term-limited MPs in the cantonal parliaments, we find some
   indications of such behavior among term-limited legislators in the
   federal chambers. These latter legislators also engage in some limited
   slacking, which is not observable in the cantonal parliaments. Our
   findings shed light on the (political) implications of term limits and
   the effect of electoral constraints on legislator behavior.},

Abstract = {Various academic authors have analyzed the implementation and the impact
   of the permanent campaign strategy by political executives in
   presidential and parliamentary systems, notably the United States and
   United Kingdom. This article builds on this literature and extends the
   research on the permanent campaign in the European parliamentary
   majoritarian context by examining contemporary Greece as a national case
   study. The research focuses on the cases of three successive Greek prime
   ministers: the center-left Kostas Simitis (1996-2004), the center-right
   Kostas Karamanlis (2004-2009), and the left-of-center George Papandreou
   (2009-2011). In particular, the article addresses two issues: whether
   these premiers exercised a permanent campaign strategy and what effect
   the permanent campaign had on their popularity. The conclusion is that
   all three did adopt a permanent campaign strategy, yet the impact on
   their public approval was weak, aligning themselves with their British
   and American counterparts.},

Abstract = {Coincidence Analysis (CNA) is a configurational comparative method of
   causal data analysis that is related to Qualitative Comparative Analysis
   (QCA) but, contrary to the latter, is custom-built for analyzing causal
   structures with multiple outcomes. So far, however, CNA has only been
   capable of processing dichotomous variables, which greatly limited its
   scope of applicability. This paper generalizes CNA for multi-value
   variables as well as continuous variables whose values are interpreted
   as membership scores in fuzzy sets. This generalization comes with a
   major adaptation of CNA's algorithmic protocol, which, in an extended
   series of benchmark tests, is shown to give CNA an edge over QCA not
   only with respect to multi-outcome structures but also with respect to
   the analysis of non-ideal data stemming from single-outcome structures.
   The inferential power of multi-value and fuzzy-set CNA is made available
   to end users in the newest version of the R packagecna.},

   2015-2018: Undermining or Realising the Democratic Foundations?},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {The growth of political lobbyism in democratic countries in recent years
   is characteristic of Israel as well. This activity makes it possible for
   private and business entities to influence decision-making processes and
   the shaping of public policy in these countries. Side by side with its
   contribution to important democratic principles such as representing
   interests and political participation, it is also strongly criticised
   and said to be a real danger to democracy; due to this hazard, many
   countries, including Israel normally regulate this activity by means of
   the law. In contrast, some argue that this activity reflects one of the
   basic tenets of democracy, which includes freedom of occupation and
   equal opportunities. This study examines measures of commercial lobbying
   in Israel during the 20th Knesset's term, presenting the number of
   lobbies, number of clients and degree of centralisation in this
   commercial industry and weighing the research data against democratic
   principles in general and Israel's values. The research findings show an
   increase in Israel's lobbyist activity during the 20th Knesset's term
   (2015-2018), both with regard to the number of lobbyists and with regard
   to the number of clients represented by them.},

Abstract = {Few observers notice that Beijing and Taipei espouse virtually identical
   policies vis-a-vis the South China Sea. When they do they see it as
   ironic, the two being mutually hostile. There are good reasons for this:
   Taipei's claims bolster Beijing's. They arguably support one-China.
   Taiwan's military leaders see their position alone as unenforceable.
   Taiwan's government and residents resent the UN's demeaning attitude and
   exclusion of ldiwan from involvement.},

Title = {How partisanship and sexism influence voters' reactions to political
   \#MeToo scandals},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Influential theories of motivated reasoning, as well as real-world
   anecdotal examples, would suggest that voters do not always penalize
   legislators from their own party for alleged immoral behavior, such as
   sexual harassment. But very little empirical evidence exists on how
   voters react to sexual misconduct allegations, especially since the
   start of the \#MeToo movement. We examine how partisanship and sexist
   attitudes shape individuals' reactions to sexual harassment allegations
   about a politician. Using a pretest-posttest online experiment, we
   randomize both the party affiliation of the accused legislator as well
   as the severity of the allegations. Overall, we find some evidence of
   partisan bias, but that there may be a limit. Subjects were more
   forgiving of an accused co-partisan legislator than a legislator of the
   opposing party in their overall evaluation and their perceptions of
   punitive repercussions, but their levels of electoral support decreased
   just as much for co-partisans as they did for opposing partisans.
   Importantly, these reactions are strongly conditioned by sexism; as
   subjects' levels of sexism increase, the otherwise large and negative
   effect of allegations on evaluations of favorability and electoral
   support disappears.},

Abstract = {Liberal and republican political theorists have not paid much attention
   to a theory of public administration or policy implementation. To the
   extent that they have, they have tended to endorse an ideal-typical
   Weberian model of bureaucracy and impersonal ethics of rules to limit
   street-level discretion. This article argues that the Weberian
   bureaucratic ethics is inconsistent with core liberal and republican
   values and, in fact, dominating at the street level. In order for laws
   and policies to be implemented in a manner consistent with liberal and
   republican principles, an alternative public ethics is proposed-a public
   ethics of care. Building on earlier research, this article argues that a
   public ethics of care represents an important supplement to liberal and
   republican ideals, as well as a better alternative to Weberian
   bureaucratic ethics, for implementing laws and policies at the street
   level in limited and responsive, nondominating ways.},

Abstract = {Traditional theories of representation posit that political parties have
   incentives to respond to public opinion, which, in turn, is reflected in
   public policy as parties come together to form governments. Absent from
   this chain of representation, however, is the notion of costs. We
   advance the study of policy responsiveness by arguing that the
   government's cost of responding to the electorate is marginal under
   conditions of strong economic growth but considerable during hard
   economic times. Cross-national analyses of voters and government welfare
   policies produce results that are consistent with this expectation. The
   findings imply that democratic performance, expressed as responsiveness,
   is conditional on economic growth.},

Title = {Party Domination and Base Mobilization: Donald Trump and Republican
   Party Building in a Polarized Era},

Abstract = {Since the 2016 election, President Trump has achieved unparalleled
   dominance over the Republican Party. He has also given his party a
   central role in his reelection campaign and invested heavily in its
   organizational capacities. This dual approach to party leadership -
   domination paired with organizational investment - bears a strong
   resemblance to the way every Republican president since Eisenhower
   interacted with his party, different only in degree. Where Trump's party
   leadership diverges qualitatively from past patterns is in its apparent
   purposes. Previous Republican presidents dominated and invested in their
   party for the explicit purpose of building a new majority in American
   politics. Reaching out to new demographic groups and trying to persuade
   them to join the party was integral to this project. Trump, in contrast,
   has (thus far) predominantly pursued a base-mobilization strategy.
   Rather than fan out horizontally in search of new groups to join the
   party coalition, Trump's strategy drills down vertically to penetrate
   and deepen his base. Instead of trying to diversify the GOP and extend
   its reach, his strategy aims to swell the number of like-minded
   supporters who are active in electoral and party politics (while
   suppressing, demobilizing, and delegitimizing the opposition party). By
   setting into motion a mutually reinforcing cycle of party domination and
   base mobilization, and amplifying its effects through organizational
   investment, Trump has turned his party into a formidable vehicle for
   advancing his personal purposes and augmenting his power - while raising
   troubling questions about the stability of American democracy. This
   article examines Trump's party leadership to date, compares it to
   previous presidential party leadership projects, and considers the
   implications.},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan's narrative
   between the years 1944 and 1948. With this aim in mind, I analyse ten
   speeches by the political leader which have been classified in two
   moments that we denominate !Por la restauracion moral de la Republica!
   (1944-1946), and !Por la reconquista! (1946-1948). Understanding the
   lasting centrality of Gaitan in Colombian political life, it is
   necessary to understand his specific way of constructing the political.
   Thus, we start from the hypothesis that Gaitan's discursive articulation
   is populist. This proposition doesn't guide us towards its ordinary
   meaning, but to Laclausian theory of hegemony and populism, which guides
   our analysis. Thereby, linking discourse theory with narrative
   semiotics, we locate Gaitan in a frame that allows us to understand him
   politically and to open new paths that would help us explain the
   centrality of his figure.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the expectations of secularization theory, religion remains
   socially important and affects politics in multiple ways-especially
   regarding conflict between religious communities. Theoretically,
   religion can increase altruism, but belief in the superiority of one's
   faith may facilitate intergroup discrimination and related conflict.
   Previous findings remain inconclusive, however, as specific religious
   ideas have hardly been tested. In this article, we argue that the
   content of religious ideas has causal effects on intergroup
   discrimination. We hence test the impact of two opposing, prominent
   religious ideas on altruism and discrimination: universal love and the
   notion of one true religion. Conducting dictator games with Christians
   and Muslims in Ghana and Tanzania, we find causal effects: Whereas the
   idea of one true religion increases intergroup discrimination, that of
   universal love fosters equal treatment. The policy implications hereof
   are obvious-promoting tolerant religious ideas seems crucial to avoiding
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Do political parties respond to interest group mobilization? While party
   responsiveness to voters has received widespread attention, little is
   known about how interest groups affect parties' policy agendas. I argue
   that political parties respond to interest groups as lobbyists offer
   valuable information, campaign contributions, electoral support and
   personal rewards, but that party responsiveness is conditioned by voter
   preferences. Based on a novel longitudinal analysis studying the
   responsiveness of German parties to interest groups across eleven issue
   areas and seven elections from 1987 until 2009, it is shown that parties
   adjust their policy agendas in response to interest group mobilization
   and that interest groups are more successful in shaping party policy
   when their priorities coincide with those of the electorate.},

Abstract = {While much research focuses on social media and urban movements, almost
   no research explores its potentially divergent effects in rural areas.
   Building on recent work emphasizing the multidimensional effects of
   online communication on vertical and horizontal information, we argue
   that while the Internet may facilitate large-scale urban movements, it
   inhibits large-scale rural movements. Because social media increases
   vertical information flows between government and citizens, the central
   government responds quickly to rural protests, preventing such protests
   from developing into a large-scale movement. By contrast, social media
   does less to change the vertical information flows in urban areas. We
   explore the plausibility of our argument by process tracing the
   evolution of protests in urban and rural areas in Vietnam in the
   preInternet and in the Internet eras.},

Abstract = {The contextual-level unemployment rate is often adduced to explain
   radical right support. It has been assessed before that research
   findings are mixed, but it is unknown why the association is so
   different across studies. Our meta-analysis examined 162 effects from 49
   studies, and indicated a positive overall effect, as predicted by main
   theories, but it was rather small. The positive effect was predominantly
   found among studies that theorized the effect, possibly indicating
   publication bias. The effect was positive in Western and Eastern Europe,
   but absent in Northern Europe. The positive effect was furthermore
   evident only after 2008, when the economic crisis hit Europe. Findings
   on the effect of unemployment being dependent on immigration were mixed
   as well. Our study calls for more comprehensive studies that bypass the
   focus on the main effect of unemployment and extend theorizing about the
   conditions under which unemployment affects support for the radical
   right.},

Abstract = {This study explores political elites' self-conceptualisation of
   parliamentary representation by using data on nearly 7000 candidates
   encompassing 18 elections in 15 countries. We examine the relevance of
   institutional features, closeness to the sources of representatives'
   mandates, party family, as well as candidates' personal characteristics,
   with a modelling strategy that accommodates the understanding of role
   orientation as a two-stage process. We posit that choosing between being
   loyal to a party or to voters is not equivalent to prioritising one's
   own agency in the first place, and suggest that self-conceptualisation
   of parliamentary representation happens in two different stages. We find
   that individual-level characteristics such as gender and ideological
   proximity to one's party, but also party family, play a key role in
   shaping views on authority versus independence. The effects of political
   environment and institutions are limited to shaping a choice between
   responding to one's party or constituents.},

Abstract = {A new party led by politicians of immigrant background entered Dutch
   parliament with three seats after the March 2017 national elections.
   This article investigates the success of DENK-an immigrant party
   promoting a clear pro-diversity agenda-and shows how this success is
   largely thanks to Dutch voters of Turkish and Moroccan background, using
   polling data by Ipsos and ScoRE. It also illustrates how these votes
   disproportionally increased with the number of residents of Turkish and
   Moroccan background in a neighborhood, using aggregate voting data from
   the statistical bureaus of Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the Dutch press
   agency ANP. That said, immigrant background does not fully explain the
   party's success; DENK voters' distinct ideological profile melds
   progressive and conservative attitudes in a combination thus far
   underrepresented among other parties' followers, which is illustrated by
   additional analyses of the polling data. Similar immigrant electorates
   exist elsewhere in Western Europe. Meanwhile, mainstream parties have
   turned sharply to the right on immigration, integration, and Islam,
   alienating substantial segments of this electorate. Whether these
   circumstances lead to the rise of more successful immigrant parties
   depends on how open political institutions are and how mainstream
   parties behave.},

Abstract = {This article examines the creation of political parties in Congress with
   a focus on ties between emerging party leaders and members, 1789-1802.
   Using an egocentric selection model, we examine who John Adams,
   Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison tied with as a
   function of the characteristics of the emerging leader, a member of
   Congress, and dyadic relationships between the two. We also examine
   whether ties affected the party chosen by members of Congress.
   Everything else equal, we find leaders were more likely to form ties
   with ideologically similar members, but find no evidence of them tieing
   with more pivotal voters. In response, members were more likely to join
   the Federalist party if they received a Federalist tie, but they were
   not more likely to join the Republican party if they received a
   Republican tie. Understanding such relationships is an important step
   for understanding the creation of parties in the United States.},

Abstract = {The Democratic Party's declining support among white voters is a
   defining feature of contemporary American politics. Extant research has
   emphasized factors such as elite polarization and demographic change but
   has overlooked another important trend, the decades-long decline of
   labor union membership. This oversight is surprising, given organized
   labor's long ties to the Democratic Party. I argue that the concurrent
   decline of union membership and white support for the Democratic Party
   is not coincidental, but that labor union affiliation is an important
   determinant of whites' partisan allegiances. I test this using several
   decades of cross-sectional and panel data. I show that union-affiliated
   whites are more likely to identify as Democrats, a substantively
   significant relationship that does not appear to be driven by
   self-selection. Overall, these findings underscore the political
   consequences of union decline and help us to better understand the
   drivers of declining white support for the Democratic Party.},

Abstract = {While the sizeable literature on anti-immigrant parties commonly invokes
   the term ``breakthrough{''} in discussing their electoral fortunes, no
   existing study has subjected this concept to conceptual or empirical
   scrutiny. Based on an investigation of 54 anti-immigrant parties in
   seventeen Western European countries, this paper concludes that these
   parties indeed tend to establish themselves with rare breakthrough
   elections rather than by incremental growth, and to stay around once
   they achieve such success. Moreover, these breakthroughs are more likely
   when these parties have direct or indirect ties to the party system. On
   the one hand, these findings confirm an often invoked but so far
   untested suspicion about the way these parties establish themselves. On
   the other hand, they have important implications for their future study.
   They suggest that some elections are more important than others for
   understanding the success of anti-immigrant parties, and that it is
   potentially misleading to explain the failure of anti-immigrant
   politicians in some places as the necessary consequence of
   country-specific characteristics. Not only can one unpredictable
   election change everything, the failure of anti-immigrant politicians in
   the past might also pave the way for like-minded politicians in the

Abstract = {Despite years of crisis, the euro has enjoyed strong popular support
   across the Eurozone periphery. In light of the high costs of internal
   devaluation strategies, this begs the question why the public has
   remained in favor of the common currency. In this article, we propose a
   theoretical mechanism that accounts for both voters' pocketbook
   preferences and their sociotropic assessments over the noisy trade-offs
   associated with the outcomes of euro membership and euro exit. Using
   original survey data from three consecutive survey waves in Greece
   (conducted in July, September, and December 2015, respectively), we
   analyze the attitudes of Greek voters toward the euro in an environment
   of acute uncertainty, austerity, high unemployment, and economic
   recession. First, we juxtapose our uncertainty mechanism of popular euro
   attitudes against other explanations put forward in the literature and
   find strong support for our argument. Second, we conduct a survey
   experiment to tap into attitudes toward the euro-austerity trade-off and
   find that as uncertainty over policy outcomes diminishes, framing
   effects abate in significance, especially among those who votedNoin the
   July 2015 referendum. Finally, we derive distinct sets of euro
   preferences for different `vulnerability profiles'. Over time, as the
   trade-offs of euro membership become more pronounced, we find a marked
   fall in euro support between July and December 2015.},

Abstract = {Whereas Western European governments have devolved political authority
   to minority regions, governments in Eastern Europe have shied away from
   using decentralisation to accommodate national minorities. This article
   assesses how these differences affect the secessionism of minority
   parties. The theoretical section argues that both programmatic
   accommodation (i.e. when governments adopt positions in favour of
   decentralisation) and institutional accommodation (i.e. when governments
   create regions that correspond to the settlement areas of minority
   groups and transfer authority to the regional level) increase the
   likelihood that minority parties will adopt secessionist positions.
   Regression analyses of 83 European minority parties show that a higher
   level of programmatic and institutional accommodation is indeed
   associated with a higher likelihood of secessionism. However, increases
   in programmatic accommodation between 2011 and 2017 in fact decrease the
   likelihood that minority parties turn secessionist when using the method
   of first differences. Future research should therefore collect panel
   data on minority parties' positions.},

Abstract = {The goals of this paper are threefold: (1) to investigate whether
   Akirav's legislative productivity scale first developed in Israel can be
   used in the UK; (2) to determine whether it is better to analyze
   parliamentary activities separately or consider the use of all of the
   parliamentary tools available; and, (3) to examine Mayhew's electoral
   connection in the UK. We define and measure legislative productivity as
   the number of parliamentary questions asked, early day motions
   presented, and private members' bills initiated by individual MPs in the
   UK parliament. In addition, we assess the effectiveness of their
   legislative activity by the number of private members' bills that
   passed. We found that UK MPs behave in a manner similar to other
   parliamentarians in other countries with respect to the variation in
   their use of parliamentary tools and ultimately, their legislative
   productivity, defined in terms of their activity, and their
   effectiveness. In addition, in accordance with previous studies,
   individual differences such as gender and institutional explanations
   such as being a member of the government or the opposition and seniority
   explain differences in productivity levels.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis could trigger a critical juncture for several
   institutional arrangements in Canada, potentially leading to notable
   changes in fiscal federalism. This research note combines insights from
   historical institutionalism with recent economic and fiscal projections
   to explore avenues for reform in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Given
   the magnitude of the crisis, provincial governments may be unable to
   absorb the fiscal costs on their own. But vast differences in fiscal and
   economic circumstances across provinces make federal arrangements
   difficult to design. We argue that intergovernmental power dynamics and
   the principle of provincial autonomy are particularly important
   considerations in thinking about fiscal federalism post-COVID-19.},

Title = {Immigrant sentiment and labour market vulnerability: economic
   perceptions of immigration in dualized labour markets},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {460-484},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in concerns that labour market
   vulnerability and national economic performance might be interacting to
   foment more polarized opinions about immigration. This article uses
   European Social Survey and EU-SILC data from 23 countries to explore
   this potential relationship, examining attitudes about the economic
   impact of immigration. In doing so, it seeks to investigate how the link
   between labour market vulnerability and anti-immigrant sentiment may be
   shaped by both resource scarcity (in the economy as a whole) and job
   scarcity (on the labour market). Findings from the analysis are twofold.
   First, labour market vulnerability is indeed correlated with more
   negative beliefs about the economic contribution of immigrants, even
   controlling for related factors such as education and contract type.
   Second, this effect is moderated by GDP per capita (though not
   unemployment rates), with labour market insiders and outsiders holding
   more distinct attitudes in higher GDP countries; thus, although
   attitudes towards the economic contribution of immigrants are generally
   more negative in poorer countries, labour market vulnerability
   contributes to greater opinion polarization in stronger economies. It is
   therefore resource availability in the economy, rather than on the
   labour market, that appears to be crucial.},

Abstract = {Do elections improve a country's prospects for democratization? The
   theory of democratization by elections proposes that reiterated
   multiparty elections foster gradual institutional changes leading to
   progress toward democracy. Edgell et al. provide the most systematic
   evidence for this theory, but substantial disagreements remain among
   scholars studying the effects of authoritarian elections on
   democratization. In this study, I reassess the relationship between
   elections and democratization. In doing so, I account for the temporal
   structure of democratic qualities that are highly persistent. When I
   control for the dynamics of democratic qualities by adding a lag (or
   lags) of the dependent variable, the democratizing effects of repeated
   elections disappear; indeed, most evidence indicates a negative
   relationship between elections and democratization. This finding calls
   into question the causal role of elections in the process of
   democratization and demonstrates the importance of modeling the
   persistent nature of democracy in exploring the effect of a variable on
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This article begins with a theoretical tension. Radical democracy, in
   the joint work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, can be understood
   as a joint articulation of a post-foundational ontology of contingency
   and a politics of autonomy of `democratic struggles' within a hegemonic
   bloc as loci of antagonisms in their own right, while Laclau's theory of
   populism marks a shift from the autonomy of struggles to the
   representative function of the empty signifier as a constitutive
   dimension. This tension between a horizontal logic of autonomy and a
   vertical logic of representation comes to the fore not least in the
   manifold attempts to combine radical-democratic and (left-)populist
   practices in the wake of the `movements of the squares.' This argument
   is illustrated empirically in the cases of two party projects situating
   themselves in contexts of social protest-'Social Movement' in Ukraine
   and Podemos in Spain-both of which seek to combine a left-populist
   discursive strategy with some form of radical-democratic politics of
   autonomy, either by supporting local alliances independent from the
   party (Podemos) or by integrating trade union representatives into the
   organizational center, which in turn finds expression in a
   representative logic ('Social Movement').},

Title = {Increased economic salience or blurring of responsibility? Economic
   voting during the Great Recession},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There is a puzzle which emerged following the Eumzone crisis: whereas
   the salience of the economy suggests an increase in economic voting, the
   realization that economic policies have become Europeanised may blur the
   responsibility of national governments, thus decreasing economic
   perceptions' weight on electoral choices. Do these mechanisms exclude
   each other? Do they refer to different groups of the electorate? We
   first examine the longitudinal trends of economic voting from 2002 to
   2015 in three bailed out countries, namely Ireland, Portugal and Spain,
   to see if the economy's salience during the Great Recession increased
   the relevance of the economic perceptions in these countries. Secondly,
   making use of a unique media dataset of the last 16 years we test
   whether exposure to major mainstream newspapers that focus on the EU
   mitigates economic voting. On average, economic voting increased
   following the crisis. However, individuals who are more informed about
   the EU tend to use economic voting to a lesser extent, given they are
   more aware of the national government's limited mom for manoeuvre.},

Abstract = {This article discusses hospitality towards asylum seekers as a political
   and contentious act. Accommodating asylum seekers in local homes is one
   of the pro-asylum mobilisations that emerged across Europe following the
   `summer of migration'. Based on interviews with local hosts in Finland,
   this article demonstrates that offering accommodation is often motivated
   by an explicit mistrust in state asylum policies and a will to make a
   statement in support of the right to asylum. Home accommodation
   challenges the norm of housing asylum seekers in reception centres,
   isolated from the rest of society. Thus, it provides valuable social and
   spatial resources in the struggle for asylum. Departing from the
   understanding that questions of asylum and home are inherently
   political, and following feminist citizenship theorisation that connects
   the domestic with the political, this article and the concept
   contentious hospitality contribute to challenging the discursive
   division between public and private.},

Abstract = {Do women candidates in the United States more openly provide the
   specific details of their policy preferences and make clear their
   political ideology? Previous research supports all manner of conflicting
   expectations regarding gender and campaign communication strategies.
   Here, with an eye toward offering evidence on the degree to which
   candidates make clear their issue positions, we consider how more than
   1,300 candidates running in the 2016 elections from fifteen randomly
   chosen states answered voter guide questions. We do so both to better
   understand the murky theoretical relationship between gender and
   communication styles and to offer insight into the practical realities
   of how women run for office. Ultimately our findings support the notion
   that women run for office differently, offering less transparency of
   their issue positions than men. The implication, consistent with a
   theory of conditional political ambition, is that women weigh more
   seriously the decision to run for office and, thus, run more
   sophisticated campaigns when they do pursue office.},

Abstract = {This article develops a framework for understanding policy-making
   responses to the crisis of the post-industrial urban economy in Britain
   through an exploration of the policy event of the 1981 English riots and
   the policy-making field that surrounded it in which the rival positions
   of `managed decline' and concerted urban regeneration became reconciled
   through a roll-out of neoliberal governance mechanisms. The value of
   this framework for contemporary analyses of urban policy in the context
   of social marginality and uneven economic development is discussed in
   the conclusion.},

Abstract = {The existing body of research on defense spending contains two main
   theses that appear in the much-debated discourse of ``guns versus
   butter.{''} The first major theoretical issue that has dominated the
   field for many years concerns `security.' In order to keep the country
   safe, primacy should be given to security within the grand strategy. The
   other argument gives priority to `butter,' since defense spending is
   considered as a wasteful and inefficient investment. Apart from these
   major arguments, scholars have also long debated the long-term
   political, military, economic, commercial, diplomatic, social and
   cultural consequences of reducing versus increasing military spending.
   In light of these debates in the literature, this paper attempts to show
   that the prioritization of defense spending during the AK Party era is
   specifically the outcome of a political preference-a pragmatic shift in
   the political landscape from idealism to realism.},

Abstract = {Attitudes towards social spending and the welfare state have been
   characterised by one of the longest standing and widest gender gaps.
   Past research suggests that parenthood deepens this divide further. Yet,
   the exact relationship between parenthood and support for social
   policies - and the gendered nature of this process - has been difficult
   to establish because it can vary across welfare policy areas and the age
   of the children, which past studies, relying on cross-sectional data,
   has found difficult to unravel. Using panel data from the Swiss
   Household Panel, we examine individual level changes in fathers' and
   mothers' views towards specific welfare state policies. We find that
   individuals' support for social spending fluctuates at different stages
   of parenthood, and that mothers' demands differ from fathers' in
   relation to care related but not in terms of educational spending. This
   implies that parents are not a homogeneous group that parties could
   target with uniform electoral pledges. As a result, building widespread
   electoral support for expanding a broad range of social investment
   policies is likely to be challenging in a context where, first and
   foremost, self-interest appears to drive (or depress) individuals'
   support for specific welfare state policies.},

   PM by the rank and file. The analysis demonstrates that the positive
   grassroots assessment of how the party is directed is influenced by
   members' engagement in the party's activities and sense of influence on
   party decisions. The paper is based on a new and unique dataset of over
   2,500 questionnaires conducted in 2016-2018 with party members of six
   Polish relevant political parties.},

Abstract = {Chile often portrays itself as Latin America's bridge to Asia, where the
   ASEAN countries have been singled out as its new priority. Yet, it is
   not difficult to see that Chile, a small and peripheral state, does not
   actually serve as a gateway between Latin America and Southeast Asia.
   This article argues that Chile has lacked consistency in its approach
   toward Southeast Asia as well as focus of purpose to become a
   bridge-builder due to the structural constraints faced by a small state.
   Based on an analytical framework of small states' foreign policies, I
   revisit Chile's relations with Southeast Asia, pointing to factors
   driving and limiting deeper engagement with the distant region. The
   analysis shows that a risk-adverse, low-profile approach of tactical
   maneuvering has served Chile's objectives even though it is insufficient
   to bridge the Pacific Ocean. The article concludes with a reflection on
   this trans-Pacific relationship.},

Abstract = {Radical democrats highlight dramatic moments of political action, which
   disrupt everyday habits of perception that sustain unequal social
   relations. In doing so, however, we sometimes neglect how social
   conditions-such as precarious employment, social dislocation, and
   everyday exposure to violence-undermine political agency or might be
   contested in uneventful ways. Despite their differences, two thinkers
   who have significantly influenced radical democratic theory (Hannah
   Arendt and Jacques Ranciere) have been similarly criticized for
   contributing to such a socially weightless picture of politics. However,
   attending to how they are each preoccupied by the social conditions of
   inequality and loneliness enables us to recognize two distinct aspects
   of democratic politics-emancipation and civility. Cultivating an
   interpretive flexibility to shift between these aspects of politics
   might enable radical democrats to more clearly picture how struggles for
   appearance are limited and shaped by the social conditions within which
   they are enacted.},

Abstract = {Northern Ireland has always been a polity noted for its strong links
   between national identity, religion, and voting, and acute British
   unionist versus Irish nationalist divisions. The constitutional question
   of whether Northern Ireland should be part of the UK or a united Ireland
   dominates. Yet, recent surveys have suggested a sizeable and growing
   section of its electorate declares itself neither unionist nor
   nationalist. This development may have assisted the growth of the
   centrist Alliance Party, which rejects unionist and nationalist
   identities and claims to be neutral on Northern Ireland's constitutional
   status. Alliance doubled its vote across three elections in 2019 and is
   now the third largest party in the region. This article examines the
   importance of ideological dealignment relative to other factors, such as
   Alliance's opposition to Brexit, in explaining the rise of a non-binary
   party in a divided society.},

Abstract = {Satisfaction with democracy has declined rapidly in Australia, reaching
   the lowest level recorded since the 1970s in 2019. Whereas Australian
   citizens used to be among the most satisfied democrats in the world,
   there is now evidence of widespread dissatisfaction. What explains this
   rapid decline in political support? Comparative studies emphasise the
   role of government performance, both political and economic, in shaping
   citizens' attitudes towards the political system. This paper examines
   the role of government performance in shaping satisfaction with
   democracy in Australia, using Australian Election Study data from 1996
   to 2019. The results demonstrate that frequent changes of prime
   minister, which a majority of voters disapproved of, and rising economic
   pessimism contributed to the decline of democratic satisfaction in
   Australia.},

Abstract = {Across Europe some individuals observe immigration with unease and feel
   threatened by immigrants. Most relevant surveys ask about `immigrants'
   in the generic sense, but some differentiate between specific immigrant
   groups. This article uses 24 questions on potential neighbours to
   systematically vary the characteristics of immigrants in a
   representative survey in Switzerland, 2013. Respondents systematically
   consider immigrants from distant cultures and those more likely to
   receive welfare benefits as more threatening. At the same time, those
   who feel threatened by one kind of immigrants also tend to feel
   threatened by others: We can validly express opposition to immigrants in
   a single dimension. Questions about immigrants in the generic sense
   likely capture the right correlates, but they may miss differences in
   the level of threat evoked by different immigrants.},

Title = {Seat enlargements in mixed-member proportional systems: evidence from
   the German Lander},

Abstract = {The German mixed-member proportional (MMP) system is considered a role
   model worldwide. Nevertheless, it has a neglected side-effect: it may
   produce greatly enlarged parliaments, like the 2017 Bundestag with 111
   additional seats. Thus, it is highly relevant to know under which
   conditions MMP systems lead to such seat enlargements. The article
   explores this question for the German Lander that have used various MMP
   versions and seen occasional parliamentary inflations. The analysis
   demonstrates that a two-stage model of party-system features and
   institutional factors explain enlargements under MMP systems in 156
   Lander elections from 1947 to 2019. Concerning the party system
   features, enlargements are driven by high seat concentrations in
   single-member districts and low list-vote shares of the largest party.
   Institutionally, high ratios of SMD seats and full levelling of surplus
   seats affect parliamentary oversize. These results have important
   implications for MMP systems in Germany and other countries.},

Abstract = {Analyses of the political and economic attitudes of the ``Nazarbayev
   generation{''} (aged 18-29) reveal the ways that young Kazakhstanis are
   distinct from older generations. Young people are more accepting of
   material inequality and less likely to make demands on the welfare state
   in favor of the poor and unemployed. They are also less likely to be
   troubled by nepotism and family rule. When compared to those who were
   socialized prior to the consolidation of presidential power, the
   Nazarbayev generation more closely reflects the values that underlie
   Kazakhstan's personalist regime and the practices and policies
   associated with it.},

Abstract = {Chinese workers have long been a hot button issue in Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan. It is commonly assumed, both in the media and much of the
   academic literature, that Chinese investors and contractors prefer to
   hire Chinese labor in both countries. This fieldnote argues that Chinese
   companies are successfully localizing their labor in Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan. Local societal and governmental pressure as well as the
   increasing cost of Chinese labor are the biggest drivers of this
   localization. There are impediments such as a lack of skilled workers as
   well as language and cultural barriers.},

Abstract = {Despite the democratic upsurge, the traditional social value system
   perpetuates oppression, humiliation and violence against the oppressed
   communities, groups and individuals. The oppressed community's struggle
   for recognition then becomes necessary in order to be able to live a
   good life. The various theories of recognition aim towards establishing
   human good as a normative ethical ideal. However, the scope of existing
   theories of recognition is limited as they propose new values without
   adequately displacing the old ones. This creates a contradiction or
   incoherence within the theory. B. R. Ambedkar's Annihilation of Caste
   exposes such a gap and seeks to devise a more capable normative
   alternative theory. The first part of this paper tries to problematize
   the idea of recognition. In the second part, it interrogates and engages
   with the different discourses of recognition. Finally, in the third
   part, it presents Ambedkar's theory of recognition as a normative ideal,
   which encapsulates the project of emancipation.},

Abstract = {When do campaign contributions matter? This article advances the claim
   that a group that gives campaign contributions to US Members of Congress
   is more likely to achieve legislative success when (1) a single
   legislator can deliver to the group (2) a private benefit (3) without
   attracting negative attention. Using an original data set based on the
   written comments of nearly 900 interest groups lobbying the US Senate
   Finance Committee on health reform legislation in 2009, I link group
   requests to corresponding legislation. The analysis shows a significant
   relationship between lobby groups' campaign contributions and their
   legislative success, and at distinct units of analysis-the group, the
   side, and the group-senator dyad. The relationship is particularly
   strong in predicting senators' amendments in committee. The rare data
   presented here offer compelling evidence that interest groups'
   legislative victories are sometimes connected to campaign contributions
   in a way that previous studies could not identify.},

Abstract = {The signing of the revised Peace Agreement by the Colombian government
   and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and its ratification by
   the Colombian Congress in November 2016, marked not only a promising
   stage in the resolution of the armed conflict but also a challenging
   stage in the sustainability of multilateral peacebuilding efforts.
   Drawing on qualitative framing analysis, this article explores whether
   differing frames projected by the United States and the European Union
   shaped cooperative or competitive efforts for peace between the signing
   of the revised Peace Agreement and the forming of President Ivan Duque's
   new Colombian government by December 2018. The results highlight
   competitive U.S. and European Union priorities regarding the agreement;
   while the United States made it a function of the war on drugs, the
   European Union maintained fundamentally a commitment to its
   implementation.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The question of regional identity in the German Lander has received only
   little attention so far. It is of great political importance, however,
   as a collective identity at the regional level is a favourable condition
   for binding decisions to be made on that level or for the delegation of
   competencies from the central to regional governments. Based on data
   from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) 2016 we show that the
   vast majority of Germans identify with their respective Land. If the
   Lander have a longer historical tradition and are donors in the
   interstate fiscal equalisation system, this regional identity is even
   stronger. We also found the compatibility of national and regional
   identity to be somewhat lower in Lander with a long historical
   tradition. Our analyses indicate that even in a seemingly rather
   homogeneous federal state such as Germany, differences in the historical
   traditions of individual regions affect regional identity - in the
   international literature this argument has so far been used exclusively
   with reference to historic nations, such as Catalonia and Scotland.},

Title = {European Citizens' Attitudes on the Return of Refugees to Their Home
   Country: Results from a Survey in 13 EU Member States},

Abstract = {European law requires member states of the European Union (EU) to accept
   refugees. It also allows them to return refugees to their countries of
   origin if the reason for asylum no longer exists. Both the reception and
   return of refugees has become a widely debated and controversial issue
   in many member states of the EU. Based on a survey conducted in 13 EU
   member states, we analysed whether citizens support the return of
   refugees when the cause for their displacement has become obsolete and
   how differences in attitudes toward the return of refugees can be
   explained. A clear majority of Europeans (70\%) support the return of
   refugees. This is also the case for those who believe that their country
   should accept refugees in the first place. These results mean that
   existing law-the acceptance of refugees in need and the return when the
   cause becomes obsolete-is being supported by a majority of Europeans.
   However, there are considerable differences in approval rates among the
   countries. The results of multivariate analysis show that ideational
   factors-both on the micro and the macro level-influence attitudes toward
   the return of refugees, whereas structural factors, recurring to
   economic interest, do not contribute substantially to the explanation of
   attitudes toward the return. The political implications of these
   findings are discussed in the last section of the article.},

Abstract = {While methodological and metatheoretical questions pertaining to
   feasibility have been intensively discussed in the philosophical
   literature on justice in recent years, these discussions have not
   permeated the debate on global democracy. The overall aim of this
   article is to demonstrate the fruitfulness of importing some of the
   advancements made in this literature into the debate on global
   democracy, as well as to develop aspects that are relevant for
   explaining the role of feasibility in normative political theory. This
   is done by pursuing two arguments. First, to advance the work on the
   role of feasibility, we suggest as intuitively plausible two
   metatheoretical constraints on normative political theorizing - the
   `fitness constraint' and the `functional constraint' - which elucidate a
   number of aspects relevant in determining proper feasibility constraints
   for an account in political theory. Secondly, to illustrate the
   usefulness of this feasibility framework, we sketch an account of global
   democracy consisting of normative principles which respond differently
   to these aspects and thus are tied to different feasibility constraints
   as well as exemplify how it may be applied in practice.},

Abstract = {Public pensions are a `social technology' at the heart of most welfare
   states. The basic goal pursued by a public pension system is to make
   sure that individuals do not outlive their savings. An increasing number
   of states have recently moved to a system that matches individuals'
   contributions over their working lives to a specific stream of revenue
   during their retirement years (i.e. defining contributions rather than
   benefits). As a result, intragenerational fairness concerns have started
   to become more relevant. In this article, we shall claim that,
   irrespective of how one conceptualises the welfare state, most public
   pension systems violate actuarial fairness and any plausible account of
   distributive justice, and that they do so for structural reasons.
   Studying the Italian case, we offer insights on this regressive
   redistributive effect, based on regional data, and offer an implicit
   policy solution to obviate this problem.},

Abstract = {The field of political marketing has majorly benefited from the use of
   social media platforms. This has been true both for eastern and western
   contexts. The primary areas in political marketing that have majorly
   benefited from the social media usage have been the political leader and
   the evaluations of the leader by the voters. In the Indian context too,
   the use of social media techniques has been hailed as the Holy Grail of
   political marketing. This estimation is quite apposite. Nevertheless,
   what must not be forgotten is that the complexities of the bonding
   between political leaders and voters are not only premised primarily on
   the efficacy of social media techniques but also include other key
   dimensions. Thus, this article focuses on the importance of credibility
   as a key dimension. This dimension is inevitable to make social media
   techniques as effective as they are in political marketing. To
   substantiate this, we have comprehensively engaged with the fields such
   as traits of political leaders, crisis management and collaboration.
   These deliberations have been contextualized to the case of Narendra
   Modi, the prime minister of India. Further, these deliberations
   culminate in an effective framework. Academicians and practitioners of
   political marketing can extensively utilize this framework.},

Abstract = {During the recent student protests in South Africa `fuck white people'
   appeared on T-shirts and walls. When understood only as anti-white
   sentiments, these words could cause panic and fear. However, we need to
   determine the extent to which these opinions are shared, by whom, and
   what should be done to people who propagated these views. To address
   these questions, an item was inserted in the 2016 nationally
   representative South African Social Attitudes Survey (n = 2988). An
   overwhelming majority of the adult population (96\%) expressed a clear
   preference for how this phenomenon should be addressed. Of this, 26\%
   recommended that those wearing/writing this phrase should be informed
   that they are hampering the prospects of peaceful coexistence between
   different race groups (the social cohesion argument), while 39\%
   advocated refrain from such rhetoric. 16\% adopted a retributive stance
   and little more than a tenth (13\%) non-interventionist. Only a nominal
   proportion (2\%) believed such behaviour `should be praised' for drawing
   attention to persisting white privilege in South African society. We
   discuss these findings and their socio-demographic variations
   discursively, as part of `white fragility' and `rainbow nation
   mythology', observing the provocative and productive dimensions of this
   phenomenon.},

Title = {Nobody seems to be fully representing me: Differential inter-attitudinal
   cohesion systems and their effects on satisfaction with the political
   system},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A shared inter-attitudinal structure of political preferences is a key
   precondition for political parties' abilities to represent citizens'
   views and, consequently, for the system's capacity to fulfil its purpose
   satisfactorily. Nonetheless, the structure of attitudes' cohesion is not
   usually included in studies exploring the elements that affect citizens'
   satisfaction with the functioning of the system. This paper aims to
   explore this gap. It distinguishes between two ways in which voters'
   structure of attitudes might be different from that of elites:
   insufficient thinking around issues, and the use of different schemes of
   thinking around political objects. Results from the European Election
   Study show that the two logics co-exist in European Union societies.
   They also demonstrate that the latter is associated with voters' lower
   levels of satisfaction with the functioning of democracy, even after
   controlling for political engagement, distance to closest party and need
   to engage in trade-offs.},

Abstract = {The anarchic international system is actually heavily structured:
   communities of states join together for common benefit; strong states
   form hierarchical relationships with weak states to enforce order and
   achieve preferred outcomes. Breaking from prior research, we
   conceptualize structures such as community and hierarchy as properties
   of networks of states' interactions that can capture unobserved
   constraints in state behavior, constraints that may reduce conflict. We
   offer two claims. One, common membership in trade communities pacifies
   to the extent that breaking trade ties would entail high switching
   costs: thus, we expect heavy arms trade, more than most types of
   commercial trade, to reduce intracommunity conflict. Two, this is driven
   by hierarchical communities in which strong states can use high
   switching costs as leverage to constrain conflict between weaker states
   in the community. We find empirical support for these claims using a
   time-dependent multilayer network model and a new measure of hierarchy
   based on network centrality.},

Abstract = {How do political rights influence immigrant integration? This study
   demonstrates that the timing of voting rights extension plays a key role
   in fostering political incorporation. In Norway, non-citizens are
   eligible to vote in local elections after three years of residency.
   Drawing on individual-level registry data and a regression discontinuity
   design, the study leverages the exogenous timing of elections relative
   to the start of residency periods to identify the effect of early access
   to political institutions. It finds that immigrants who received early
   access were more likely to participate in subsequent electoral contests,
   with the strongest effects visible among immigrants from dictatorships
   and weak democracies. It also observes evidence consistent with
   spillover effects for other aspects of political engagement. These
   findings suggest that early access to voting rights influences
   subsequent trajectories of immigrant incorporation, in particular among
   immigrants from less developed states who may otherwise face high
   integration barriers.},

Abstract = {Partisan bias and hostility have increased substantially over the last
   few decades in the American electorate, and previous work shows that
   partisan strength and sorting help drive this trend. Drawing on insights
   from moral psychology, however, we posit that partisan moral convictions
   heighten affective polarization beyond the effects of partisanship,
   increasing partisan animosity and copartisan favoritism. Testing this
   theory using data from two national samples and novel measures of
   affective polarization in everyday life, we find that people who tend to
   moralize politics display more partisan bias, distance and hostility,
   irrespective of partisan strength. These results shed light on a
   different moral divide that separates the American public and raise key
   normative questions about moral conviction and electoral politics.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, institutions across the United States have
   increasingly emphasized global education as a prerequisite to successful
   existence in a diverse yet interconnected world. At the same time, there
   is increasing awareness that the decline in international studies (IS)
   has resulted in the United States being ill prepared to address complex
   global challenges. King (2015) lamented that the United States now
   increasingly lacks regional experts who understand the country-specific
   challenges and can place them in a larger global strategic context. How
   the discipline engages students in a global environment matters;
   however, the field provides little guidance on how to design global
   studies majors. IS and global studies are apparently both important and
   neglected. This study examines the curricula for IS, international
   relations, international affairs, and global studies programs housed in
   political science. By reviewing more than 100 programs that offer
   bachelor's degrees, the authors identify similarities and differences in
   curricula and present a summative model of a typical IS program housed
   in political science departments.},

Abstract = {InInventing the Future, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams implore those on

   overturn neoliberalism. However, their argument is built upon a
   controversial philosophy which goes unnamed in the body of the text:
   accelerationism, the first principles of which would overthrow the very
   understanding of human nature on which Western democracy has operated
   for centuries. Their vision also entails a way of doing politics and
   designing policy which radically differs from representative democracy
   and grassroots movements as they seek to engineer consent and to form a
   revolutionary vanguard-not just to overthrow capitalism, but to embark
   on a journey of continually re-engineering humanity itself.},

Abstract = {In many elections around the world, voters choose between politicians
   who differ not only in personal background and policy promises, but also
   in their history of dishonest electoral conduct. While recent literature
   has begun to investigate the conditions under which voters punish
   electoral malfeasance, we know relatively little about whether they
   penalize different forms of illicit activities carried out by
   politicians differently. In this paper, we present the results of a
   candidate choice experiment embedded in a survey fielded prior to the
   2016 Romanian local election. We asked voters to choose between two
   hypothetical candidates, randomly varying several attributes, including
   different illicit electoral activities. We find that citizens tolerate
   some forms of political malfeasance less than others depending on how
   much that malfeasance infringes on voters' autonomy. Informational
   campaigns carried out by prosecutorial agencies also affect how much
   voters punish different illicit exchanges.},

Abstract = {Political preferences in the United States are highly correlated with
   population density, at national, state, and metropolitan-area scales.
   Using new data from voter registration records, we assess the extent to
   which this pattern can be explained by geographic mobility. We find that
   the revealed preferences of voters who move from one residence to
   another correlate with partisan affiliation, though voters appear to be
   sorting on non-political neighborhood attributes that covary with
   partisan preferences rather than explicitly seeking politically
   congruent neighbors. But, critically, we demonstrate through a
   simulation study that the estimated partisan bias in moving choices is
   on the order of five times too small to sustain the current geographic
   polarization of preferences. We conclude that location must have some
   influence on political preference, rather than the other way around, and
   provide evidence in support of this theory.},

Title = {Learning from Divided Parties? Legislator Dissent as a Cue for Opinion
   Formation},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Scholars have generally seen united parties as normatively desirable.
   However, little work has explored the implications of divided parties
   for public opinion. This article examines whether legislator dissent
   reduces public support for the policy positions of divided parties.
   Dissent can do this in two ways: by undermining the consistency of party
   cues sent to co-partisans of the divided party; or by providing a signal
   regarding the likely distance of the policy proposal from citizen
   preferences. These possibilities are evaluated here using a survey
   experiment. Respondents were exposed to mock news articles about a
   debate on a bill that manipulated the presence of dissent on government
   benches and its spatial location-either proximate to the opposition
   party or located on the government party's ideological flank. Legislator
   dissent appears to reduce the support of government policy for
   opposition co-partisans, but only when it is centrist and for those with
   high levels of political knowledge. These results suggest legislator
   dissent can act as a cue, if a complex one, to help citizens form policy
   evaluations in line with their preferences.},

Abstract = {Local hybrid regimes rely on a wide range of strategies intended to
   demotivate media's criticism. Why do some critical newspapers get
   coopted while others get violently re-presssed? Using evidence from
   Mexican states, I argue that these two strategies are substitutive.
   Choosing one over the other depends on the resources available to the
   governors (political, financial and violent); and also, on the costs
   associated to each strategy (reputational, monitoring, recruitment and
   visibility costs).},

Abstract = {This study discusses whether the internet contributes to the rise of
   civil society or provides the state with a means to suppress civil
   society. By examining cross-sectional time-series data of 153 countries
   from 1995 to 2018, this study demonstrates that internet censorship is a
   reactive strategy used by autocracies to suppress civil society.
   Although rapid internet diffusion might undermine internet censorship in
   autocracies, since the Arab Spring, the use of censorship as a political
   reaction to technological diffusion and contentious politics worldwide
   has damaged the development of civil society. The autocratic reactive
   approach contributes to our understanding of information and
   communication technology, civil society, and authoritarianism. A more
   nuanced illustration of internet politics delivers a warning of
   technological threats to civil society.},

Abstract = {Religious mobilization often takes the form of engagement with ``the
   woman question{''}: how should women as carriers of culture comport
   themselves? This article shows that many of the debates over the role of
   women and religion in South Asia are misunderstood when they are seen as
   instances of religious fundamentalism. Rather, the theoretical framework
   to make sense of public religion and gender debates should be through
   the lens of postcolonial nationalism. The creation and consolidation of
   the nation is what is at stake-not the creation of the religious
   community as such. In order to make this argument, the article offers
   both a review of the literature on secularism and gender as well as
   short case studies from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These three
   former British colonies have each struggled to arrive at a secular
   settlement and often the contestation over the place of religion has
   centered on the rules and roles of women in these societies.},

Abstract = {Does compulsory voting (CV) result in divergent voting paths? Using the
   heterogeneous attribution thesis, we test whether compelled voters are
   less likely to rely on egotropic perceptions of the economy than
   voluntary voters, depressing the impact of economic voting. Our results
   show that compelled voters refrain from accurately relying on egotropic
   perceptions of the economy. Our findings question whether CV does in
   fact increase accountability to the electorate. While many advocates of
   CV believe it empowers low SES voters, our findings suggest that even if
   this is the case, it does so at the expense of holding incumbents
   accountable for poor economic performance.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on political disaffection understood as a negative
   feeling towards politicians, politics and its processes, and towards a
   system incapable of facing the citizens' needs and demands. Political
   disaffection has grown significantly in Spain during the recent period
   of crisis; what contradicts the culturalist theses previously held. The
   components of this attitude-political disengagement and institutional
   disaffection-present opposing tendencies, too. Up until now, both of
   them showed parallel trends, increasing or decreasing at the same time.
   At present, however, a disruption has occurred. Consequently, and given
   the importance of the juncture, this article tries to verify whether
   changes in disaffection are more influenced by economic junctures (as it
   is widely held in literature) or by political ones. Methodologically,
   discriminant analysis is used to know at an individual level the factors
   that determine the nature and characteristics of political disaffection
   in Spain. The main conclusion points to the importance of the political
   situation in the profile of disaffected Spaniards.},

Title = {Predictive Policing: Utopia or Dystopia? On attitudes towards the use of
   Big Data algorithms for law enforcement},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {30},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The use of predictive AI tools to improve decision-making in relation to
   crime prevention and investigation is a reality. They are being
   implemented almost before we fully understand how they work, while we
   make legal decisions that may determine the progress of the technology,
   and long before we can predict their full impact. This paper addresses
   the attitudes towards this technological revolution applied to criminal
   justice, focusing in particular on its use by police. The first section
   summarizes and describes the techniques and technologies that make up
   predictive policing. Subsequently, the main part of the study analyzes
   how this technology has been received. This ranges from optimism from
   those who defend its immediate implementation as a way to improve police
   objectivity and efficiency, to pessimism from those who see its use as
   fostering a dystopia of State control and surveillance. These two
   extremes reflect the shift from optimism to technological pessimism in
   the twentieth century. The article concludes with a defense of a
   realistic, critical and informed view of the use of these predictive
   algorithms. This vision accepts that there are no neutral technologies
   yet does not fall into fatalism and technophobia. It is one that places
   the human being and legitimate policing at the centre of the algorithmic
   equation while redefining its objectives based on the scientific
   evidence applied to each individual technology.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to develop a new typology of revisionism based on the
   nature of the aims (territorial/normative/hierarchy of prestige), the
   means employed (peaceful/violent), and the level of action
   (regional/global). This will then be used to explain the escalation of
   Russia's foreign policy from regional to global claims with reference to
   its military interventions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria and to
   identify the type of revisionism involved in each of the three Russian
   military interventions undertaken both inside (Georgia and Ukraine) and
   outside (Syria) the post-soviet space. The paper is divided into three
   parts. The first examines the concept of revisionism and suggests a new
   classification of six types in relation to the means, nature, and level
   of the claims put forward by revisionist powers. The second discusses
   the interventions carried out by Russia within its regional area (in
   Georgia and Ukraine). The third analyses the intervention in Syria and
   highlights the escalation of Russian claims from the regional to the
   global level.},

Abstract = {In authoritarian states, emerging democracies, and well-established
   democracies alike, alternative accounts that contest official state
   narratives are common. Why do people believe such accounts even in the
   absence of supporting evidence? While this question has been explored in
   the United States, relatively little research has assessed it in other
   contexts. Through a survey experiment carried out in Pakistan, this
   article tests the impact of cues by political parties on belief in such
   conspiracy theories. The results provide evidence in favor of partisan
   cueing: When alternative narratives are endorsed by political parties
   viewed favorably by the respondent, they are more likely to be believed.
   I suggest that political parties are able to capitalize on
   misinformation and a lack of trust in official institutions for tactical
   advantage. Results differ by subgroup: Higher income and urban
   respondents are swayed more by their own party source than are lower
   income and rural individuals.},

Abstract = {Do interest groups prefer to interact with party political supporters or
   opponents, and why do they do so? Recent research has provided different
   explanations and mixed findings for this question, highlighting the role
   of institutional contexts and differences between interests. Here, we
   focus on the effects of issue-level factors instead. We hypothesize that
   higher levels of conflict lead interest groups to lobby both supporters
   and opponents. Our argument emphasizes that the reason to do so lies in
   interest groups' desire to gain or maintain prominence within a policy
   subsystem, rather than in persuasion attempts. Analyzing quantitative
   and qualitative data on the lobbying targets for 80 Dutch interest
   groups on more than 300 issues, we find support for our theoretical
   claims. When the level of conflict is high, prominence often trumps
   persuasion. These findings suggest that interest groups, by contacting
   many different parties, can contribute to policy making in positive
   ways.},

Abstract = {One form of accommodating historically marginalised social groups is
   through `democratic corporatism', in which government to some degree
   formalises emancipation interests' representation within policy
   processes. This article compares the corporatist trajectories of the
   emancipation interests of women and gays/lesbians in the Netherlands to
   examine why women's interests became excluded from and gay/lesbian
   interests remained included in corporatist policy processes. Existing
   studies have failed to explain why changes in corporatism differently
   affect incorporated organisations across policy arenas. This article
   examines the role of the level of formalisation of corporatist
   relations, and by extension the ability of incorporated organisations to
   combine top-down and bottom-up resources, in leading to exclusion from
   or continued inclusion in corporatist policy processes. The findings
   highlight the importance for incorporated emancipation interests of the
   ability to combine top-down and bottom-up resources to manoeuvre changes
   in corporatism and successfully maintain their inclusion in corporatist
   policy processes.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the dynamic interaction between the processes
   of globalization and regionalization within the context of the Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI). Our aim is two-pronged: first, we examine the BRI
   as a comprehensive blueprint for an alternative type of globalization
   based on a new set of economic, cultural and political ideas that are
   qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has been promoted
   under the existing US-led global system. Second, we explore the
   potential impact of new globalization on the prospects of region
   building in East Asia in terms of China's role in it. We argue that the
   BRI-driven globalization may have certain dampening and diluting effects
   on China's participation in and contribution to the East Asian
   regionalization. Thus, through this study, we hope to both shed further
   light on the nature of relationship between globalization and
   regionalization and extrapolate on the future course of regionalism in
   East Asia.},

Title = {When Do Men Represent Women's Interests in Parliament? How the Presence
   of Women in Parliament Affects the Legislative Behavior of Male
   Politicians},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the conditions affecting male Members of
   Parliaments' (MPs) proclivity for representing women's interests. It
   particularly explores whether the presence of female MPs has an effect
   on men's parliamentary behavior. Three contrasting effects are discussed
   in the literature: (1) A spillover effect which postulates that men will
   become more likely to act on behalf of women if the number of female MPs
   increases, (2) a group-threat effect which creates a hostile backlash
   among male MPs, or (3) a specialization effect which makes male MPs less
   likely to represent women because this is typically seen as a function
   that should be fulfilled by female MPs. Empirically, this paper analyzes
   the representation of women's issues in parliamentary questions tabled
   in the German Bundestag (1998-2013) by using automated content analysis.
   The results support the specialization hypothesis and show that male MPs
   reduce their intensity of women's representation if the proportion of
   female MPs is high.},

Abstract = {With industrial action recently taking place at TGI Fridays, McDonald's
   and Wetherspoons, the organisation of precarious workers within the
   hospitality industry has received renewed attention in popular and
   academic circles. The subject of this article is the result of a year's
   worth of work, research and activism alongside co-workers within the
   sector. It takes the form of an insiders' ethnography, positioning
   itself as an example of workers' inquiry into precarious workplaces and
   collective resistance. The research addresses the subject of affective
   labour in customer-facing hospitality work, with particular attention
   paid to the sociability of the labour process. It also addresses the
   issues of the composition of labour and the material conditions that act
   as the driving force of precarity, while assessing the contours of
   flexibility, control and resistance. The wider social character of the
   work and the workers themselves, as well as the community and
   camaraderie of the workplace, is also studied. Using the 2018 TGI
   Fridays strike as a key example, the article outlines how, in harnessing
   the camaraderie of such social and communal work, workers have sought to
   realise their autonomy and resist precarity through collective struggle.},

Abstract = {How do constituents respond to the president's policy decisions?
   Theories of democratic accountability posit that voters elect
   officeholders to advance their policy preferences and punish them for
   failing to do so. We investigate the accountability mechanism in the
   context of presidential unilateral action. Data from the 2018
   Cooperative Congressional Election Study provide evidence of issue-based
   presidential accountability, as presidential approval ratings are
   consistently associated with respondents' evaluations of policies
   achieved through unilateral action. These findings persist when
   accounting for respondents' partisan and ideological congruence with the
   president and across model specifications and measurement strategies.
   Our evidence indicates that presidents are held accountable for
   unilateral directives and, in the aggregate, suggests a constraint on
   presidential action.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate among practitioners and scholars about the
   security consequences of transnational migration. Yet, existing work has
   not, so far, fully taken into account the policy instruments states have
   at their disposal to mitigate these risks, and reliable evidence is
   lacking for the effectiveness of such measures. This article addresses
   both shortcomings as whether and to what extent national migration
   policies affect the diffusion of terrorism via population movements are
   analysed. Spatial analyses report robust support for a moderating
   influence of states' policies: while terrorism can travel from one
   country to another via larger migration populations, this only applies
   to target countries with extremely lax regulations and control
   mechanisms. This research sheds new light on the security implications
   of population movements, and it crucially adds to our understanding of
   governments' instruments for addressing migration challenges as well as
   their effectiveness.},

Title = {Can Economic Assistance Shape Combatant Support in Wartime? Experimental
   Evidence from Afghanistan},

Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Governments, militaries, and aid organizations all rely on economic
   interventions to shape civilian attitudes toward combatants during
   wartime. We have, however, little individual-level evidence that these
   ``hearts and minds{''} programs actually influence combatant support. We
   address this problem by conducting a factorial randomized control trial
   of two common interventions-vocational training and cash transfers-on
   combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youth in Kandahar, Afghanistan. We
   find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had
   little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes,
   producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment
   initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of
   increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to
   improve beneficiaries' livelihoods but did increase support for the
   Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention.
   These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing
   information about government resolve and competence rather than by
   improving economic livelihoods.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes the colonial problem of peoplehood that Indian
   anticolonial thinkers grappled with in their attempts to conceptualize
   self-rule, or swaraj. British colonial rule drew its legitimacy from a
   developmentalist conception of the colonized people as backward and
   disunited. The discourse of ``underdeveloped{''} colonial peoplehood
   rendered the Indian people ``unfit{''} for self-government, suspending
   their sovereignty to an indefinite future. The concept of swaraj would
   be born with the rejection of deferred colonial self-government. Yet the
   persistence of the developmentalist figuration of the people generated a
   crisis of sovereign authorization. The pre-Gandhian swaraj theorists
   would be faced with the not-yet claimable figure of the people at the
   very moment of disavowing the British claim to rule. Recovering this
   underappreciated pre-Gandhian history of the concept of swaraj and
   reinterpreting its Gandhian moment, this article offers a new reading of
   Gandhi's theory of moral self-rule. In so doing, it demonstrates how the
   history of swaraj helps trace the colonial career of popular
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes the circulation of violence in the realms of
   immigration and labor. Through Walter Benjamin, I conceptualize the
   relationship between racial violence and law, and note that although
   violence can support the authority of law, excessive violence makes law
   vulnerable to decay. This tension between authority and excess is eased
   by humanitarianism. I find clues for disrupting this circulation in
   Benjamin's twin notions of the real state of exception and the general
   strike, introduced two decades apart and invested in theorizing how
   labor and other marginalized groups threaten the stability of law
   supported by violence. This reconstruction proceeds alongside an
   examination of the contemporary US regime of immigration enforcement,
   which combines the excessive violence of detention and deportation with
   marginal humanitarian adjustments, which ultimately legitimate violence.
   On the disruptive side, a Benjaminian reading of labor activism by the
   Coalition of Immokalee Workers offers three dimensions of emancipatory
   politics: (a) practices of refusal (to engage on the terms of the
   immigration debate), (b) the establishment of historical constellations
   (of racial regulation of labor constitutive of law), and (c) divine
   violence (through exposure of lawful violence in the food production
   chain).},

Abstract = {Banking union is arguably the most important EU reform since the
   Maastricht Treaty, transferring substantial authority to European
   regulators and taking a significant step toward fiscal union. However,
   it remains incomplete, as Germany has repeatedly blocked progress on the
   European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). This opposition contrasts with
   German support for an expansive Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and
   limited Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). This paper explains the
   inconsistent German position on banking union's components by examining
   the interests of the different elements of the German banking industry
   in a multi-level governance perspective. While the savings banks and
   cooperatives have staunchly opposed any form of banking union,
   preferring local regulation, the commercial banks' position is more
   complex. They saw the SSM as a way to eliminate their competitors'
   national or local regulatory advantages both within Germany and
   elsewhere in Europe. The SRM similarly offered benefits for large banks
   by ensuring that resolution was funded at the European level. However,
   EDIS threatened their private deposit insurance scheme, so they joined
   with the other German banks in opposing its development. In doing so,
   they blocked completion of banking union.},

Abstract = {The majority party leadership has different goals for different
   committees. As such, they tailor a variety of control mechanisms to
   match different committees. When a committee is considered ``highly
   important{''} to the majority party leadership, the leadership employs
   an intra-party assignment strategy: assigning members who are
   ideologically similar to the party caucus (per conventional wisdom).
   This direct control mechanism consequently produces an unconditionally
   low level of committee bias. For ``medium importance{''} committees,
   however, the majority party leadership employs an inter-party assignment
   strategy to exert indirect control: utilizing the presence of minority
   party members to constrain their own party delegations in a way that
   serves the party in general. As such, the bias of these committees
   inevitably depends on the ideological distribution of the minority party
   committee delegations. This ultimately suggests that the majority party
   leadership adopts multiple and flexible strategies to deal with
   committee assignments and committee activities in general.},

Abstract = {In Liberalism's Religion, Cecile Laborde argues that a liberal state has
   to be a justifiable state: state action can only be legitimate if it is
   publicly justified, that is, if it is based on accessible reasons. These
   accessible reasons, she argues, are reasons that can be understood by
   all citizens. She defends a purely epistemic conception of
   accessibility. On Laborde's account, accessible reasons are identified
   by particular epistemic features, and not by their substantive content.
   In this paper, I argue that Laborde's account of epistemic accessibility
   cannot deliver on its promise of public justification. To illustrate
   this argument, I examine the case of the prohibition of same-sex
   marriage and look at two potential reasons that could be used to justify
   this prohibition: the non-accessible reference to the Bible and the
   accessible appeal to the value of tradition.},

Title = {Taking Refuge in Leadership? Facilitators and Constraints of Germany's
   Influence in EU Migration Policy and EU-Turkey Affairs during the

Abstract = {At the height of the migration crisis (between autumn 2015 and summer
   2016), Germany's role in EU migration policy and EU-Turkey affairs went
   through a period of change. Searching for effective instruments, the
   German government attempted to lead European policies, managing the
   crisis first through an `open door' approach and then through an
   agreement with Turkey. The notion of `Merkel's migration deal' and a
   `German Alleingang' became prominent in political, public and academic
   debate. With the aim of assessing whether or not these terms correctly
   describe Germany's role, this article unpacks the complex
   Ankara-Berlin-Brussels triangle. It examines how structural and
   institutional power influenced the German role. We argue that, under
   extreme time pressure, Germany took refuge in a constrained type of
   leadership. Positions of other EU member states and institutions, as
   well as domestic factors (social tension, public opinion and the rise of
   the far right) inhibited the leadership potential. Additionally, the
   paper elaborates on differences between the EU's internal and external
   crisis management. In external migration policy, German leadership took
   the form of a flexible `institutional directoire', through which Germany
   successfully negotiated an EU-Turkey statement on migration, in
   consultation with EU institutions and selected national leaders.},

Abstract = {South Africa is often viewed as a post-conflict society. It can,
   however, also be viewed as a terrain of enduring conflict characterised
   by numerous divisions. Some of these divisions are new, but others are
   inextricable iterations of historical fault-lines. As an infrastructure
   of security, the role of the South African police has always been
   contentious. It has gone from the enforcer of a racist government to a
   service perceived by many citizens as corrupt and incompetent. Crime
   levels, including theft, robbery, housebreaking and violent crimes have
   increased significantly since the advent of democracy. In this context,
   private security companies specialising in guarding and armed response
   have become a key security infrastructure working for those who can
   afford it. It draws on primary data gathered from private policing
   services and the public to interpret the meaning of private security
   firms in the post-apartheid polity. The argument pursued is that private
   security companies intermediate between populations of different strata
   and in the process, between conflict and security. This represents much
   continuity with the role of the police in the pre-democratic state. To
   stabilise the situation in the long run, greater
   desegregation/integration of adversarial population groups is required.},

Abstract = {Reports about mass atrocities are often accompanied by demands for
   action against the perpetrators. Mediation allows third parties to
   demonstrate their active involvement against civilian victimisation.
   However, whether mediators are successful in contributing to lower
   levels of one-sided violence is far from clear. Conflict actors might
   continue or even intensify violence to enhance their bargaining position
   during peace talks. Based on our tests with monthly data for intrastate
   conflicts in Africa we find no support for the expectation that
   one-sided violence declines in the aftermath of mediation onset.
   Instead, we observe rather an increase in civilian victimisation.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, a commercial and geopolitical confrontation hasbeen
   experienced in the internationaln order marked by a dispute over the
   territories of South America, which, being widely endowed with resources
   considered strategic, become nodal in the definition of a new order.
   China is a key player in this dispute, promoting in the region the
   construction of infracture corridors that connect priority territories
   and resources with the main trade routed to the Asian market.},

   deportation},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2020},
Number = {24},
Abstract = {Luce d'Eramo lived in Germany in 1944-1945, when she was 18: she arrived
   as a volunteer worker, was later interned in Dachau, escaping three
   months later to share the precarious existence of a wandering mass of
   illegal foreigners under the bombs during the Third Reich. In the
   autobiographical novel Deviation (1979), she explored little-known
   aspects of the Nazi camps, such as the social origin of inmates and
   jailers, and the condition of foreign workers. In Deviation the
   concentration camp experience is intertwined with the recognition of
   what happened afterwards: how she repressed the memory of that
   experience and how it could re-emerge and become the object of writing
   only after a long period of time. This repression is related to the fact
   that the protagonist of Deviation is a different deportee: repatriated
   due to her fascist family after a factory strike organised by the French
   Resistance, she came across a group of people captured by Nazis in the
   streets and was arrested along with them, threw away her identity papers
   and ended up in Dachau. A `blind leap forward', a story so difficult to
   tell that she ignored it for thirty years. Yet, little by little, she
   managed to face it through seeking - around herself and within herself -
   the reasons for her own silence. The unspeakable here does not depend on
   facts assumed to be beyond words, as it does for Adorno or Wiesel, but
   centres on the social context and social conscience of the protagonist,
   and gradually melts to become a vivid, precise tale, that succeeds in
   sharing an extreme experience, on the path traced by Primo Levi.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {333-352},
Abstract = {African countries have witnessed a significant decline in military coups
   since the 1990s, yet civil-military relations (CMRs) are still
   problematic and are further complicated by the episodic occurrence of
   military coups particularly since 2000. Since Ghana returned to
   multiparty politics in 1992, the country has won praise as one of the
   most successful examples of demilitarisation and democratisation. This
   paper examines the fundamental changes including norms influencing CMRs
   and lessons from Ghana's experience. It argues that the state of Ghana's
   CMRs has been a consequence of institutional change, norm diffusion, and
   changing attitudes of actors both in politics and civil-society.
   However, CMR bargain is fragile and uncertain because of the temptation
   by politicians to use the military for political ends including
   elections, to get ahead of their opponents.},

Abstract = {The article highlights the absence of a cultural dimension in the

   interacts with populist mobilization. Beginning with an original
   classification of existing schools of thought on populism that uses the
   historical figure of William Jennings Bryan as a conceptual yardstick,
   it moves on to lay out a framework for cultural analysis through the
   lens of collective action frame theory, based on an understanding of
   populism as a discursive mode of political identification.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of the APDH in the formation of young
   people in a specific historical conjuncture of the last Argentine
   military dictatorship, 1980-1981, before the massive return of
   citizenship to the public space following the defeat in the Malvinas War
   in 1982. It also inquiries - taking into account the crossing between
   their life stories, the validity of the repressive context, the
   political-ideological profile of the organization and the high risk they
   assumed with their participation - about the impact that belonging to
   this organization had on the trajectory of those young people. It is
   argued that even under the military dictatorship, the local APDH
   fostered an active and protagonist role of the youth in society in order
   to modify its present and build its future. The creative nature of the
   participation of these young people within the organization entailed a
   new way of thinking and exercising participation (and the citizen). The
   reconstruction and analysis of some individual trajectories allows us to
   observe that the passage through the APDH led to a process of political
   resocialization and the beginning of ``militant careers{''} that
   continued later in neighborhood, mapuces, union, and university
   organizations.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on ``public engagement{''} and recent modifications
   in citizen participation through a case study regarding the
   ``collaborative governance{''} of urban commons in the city of Bologna
   (Italy). Civic collaboration is an experimental partnership which is
   being implemented between public administrations and citizens in order
   to develop, treat and reuse commons with a view to improving the quality
   of life in cities. The goal of the project is to understand whether, and
   how, civic collaboration is also transforming citizen participation in
   local public policies. This article presents the results of research
   which was performed by interviewing citizens who are involved in the
   collaborative governance of urban commons. This contribution aims to
   connect the literature regarding ``open government{''} and its impact on
   participation with the consolidated debate regarding the role of culture
   in the conception of citizenship and civic engagement and, as a
   consequence, in the effectiveness of collaborative governance.
   Particular attention was paid to citizen engagement, and to the role
   performed by both public and private platforms and digital media.},

Abstract = {The work aims to analyze the theoretical aspects of the use of
   information technologies in the mediation process, as well as the
   aspects of its implementation. The purpose of the investigation is
   online mediation as a form of resolution of intellectual property
   disputes. In addition, the topic of study is the social relationships
   that arise when using information technologies and mediation to resolve
   civil conflicts in the field of intellectual property. The research
   methods used in this case are the dialectical method, the generalization
   method, the comparison method, the analysis method, the synthesis
   method, the method in administration and the deduction method, the
   modeling method, and the abstraction method. As a result of the study,
   conclusions are drawn on the state of online mediation in the real
   world, the benefits and potential problems of introducing virtual
   mediation for disputed parties, the need for support for special
   applications, along with the need for the introduction of online
   mediation at the state level to a state policy.},

Abstract = {The struggle for space is one of the relatively new phenomena that have
   become relevant in the recent decades - it has transferred from the
   field of international relations and geopolitics into the domestic
   political sphere. This tendency is especially noticeable in Russia.
   Moreover, the struggle for space itself takes in Russia various forms,
   determined by the specifics of a particular territory. While in
   metropolitan cities the primary forms are rallies and other collective
   political actions, in the relatively sparsely populated northern and
   eastern regions of the country it often takes the form of distancing, or
   going away, from the state.
   In fact, this type of social behavior has already been studied by
   researchers. However, such research was usually devoted to the question
   of marginal social groups that did not seek self-presentation. This
   article considers a different situation when distancing is a conscious
   choice rather than a forced measure, and such choice generates a new
   type of discourse about social space and a new way of its understanding.
   During the initiative field research in the Irkutsk Oblast and
   Khabarovsk Krai, L.Bliakher and K.Grigorichev found examples of a
   situation when, contrary to the conventional wisdom, remoteness and
   isolation are becoming a mechanism for the redevelopment and
   appropriation of ``empty{''} lands, rather than factors of contraction
   of the developed space. Their analysis of the genesis and structure of a
   special type of settlements that arose in the remote regions of the east
   of Russia over the past decade, their internal stratification and
   features of communication with the ``big world{''}, indicates the
   emergence of a new way to fill social space with meanings, which is only
   possible outside of political authorities' regulations and large-scale
   economic projects. Although the cases identified and investigated by the
   authors are too few to draw generalizable conclusions, they indicate the
   hidden processes of redevelopment and redefinition of ``empty lands{''}
   in the eastern part of the country.},

Abstract = {In 2017, US Congress renewed the sanctions regime to punish Russia for
   its alleged cyberattacks during the 2016 elections and asserted its role
   in foreign policy making vis-a-vis President Donald Trump. To understand
   this case of Trump's first significant foreign policy defeat, our
   analytical framework links two strands of the literature, the
   securitization concept and liberal International Relations theory.
   Previous studies underscored the ability of the executive branch to
   implement securitization discourses and practices. In this case,
   however, congressional entrepreneurs successfully securitized US-Russian
   relations despite presidential attempts to marginalize and de-securitize
   the issue. We trace the contested debates between the two branches of
   government to show how securitization processes by members of Congress
   forced the president to sign a new sanctions bill, which continued the
   policy towards Russia set by the Obama administration. Using qualitative
   content analysis, the paper highlights the ability of congressional
   actors to influence US foreign policy making despite high levels of
   polarization between the parties.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article, is to analyze the cultural proposal of a
   group of writers who signed and published in the magazine Cormoran, in
   December 1970, the document, Politica Cultural: por la creacion de una
   cultura nacional y popular, under the self-styled Taller de escritores
   de la Unidad Popular. We analyze the diagnoses made by the writers, the
   foundational premises of what the ``new culture{''} would be, the role
   that corresponded to the intellectuals in this process. It is an
   analytical exercise that delves into the process of reception,
   production and circulation of ideas on cultural policy of this group, in
   order to highlight the development of other projects that, although they
   were not considered by the government of Salvador Allende, are feasible
   to historicize, since they express representations, imaginaries and
   cultural projections of intellectuals who decided, from their adhesion
   and commitment to Unidad Popular, to contribute to the construction of
   what would be the ``new socialist culture{''}.},

Abstract = {How can we highlight the role of state institutions, including
   republican and colorblind ones, in the production of racial
   categorizations? How can we account for the creative and even contesting
   capacities of minoritized people and groups in these processes? In this
   introduction, we reveal the links between public policy and
   racialization. We rely on constructivist definitions of the concepts of
   racialization and institutional racism, which combine the analysis of
   the discursive structures of racism with that of their constant
   reformulations, in situation, through the interactions between members
   of minorities and of majorities. We then propose a literature review of
   French-language work on the issue of race in the sociology of public
   policy. Often, these authors use the notion of discrimination and
   propose a statistical demonstration, but we refer to racialization as a
   process of categorization that is shaped by, and that in turn shapes,
   power relations between the majority and minorities. Our approach is
   supported by ethnographic methodology. Finally, we have chosen to focus
   on intermediaries between the state and racially minoritized
   populations. This choice allows us to look at the capacities of minority
   groups to co-produce, reformulate, or contest the racist social order.},

Abstract = {The 150th anniversary of the birth of Lenin provides an occasion for
   rethinking his legacy. Rethinking and employing it is critically to
   understand and change modern capitalism. The author shows that all his
   theoretical elaborations and practice make up an integral system of
   scientific achievements and political acts. Lenin's elaboration of the
   development and limits of capitalism, including the contradictions of
   monopoly capital, allowed him to distinguish the system's motive forces
   and pathways of change, and to outline the main steps of constructing a
   new society. His analysis of imperialism and approach to capitalism as
   an integrated world system is the basis for his conclusion that the
   initial impulse leading to a breakthrough from this system to socialism
   would occur at the ``weakest link.{''} His use of the dialectical method
   solved Russia's crisis in 1917 through a revolutionary course with
   insufficient material preconditions, but whose victory might lead to the
   simultaneous resolving of both bourgeois-democratic and socialist tasks.
   His theory of social creativity helps identify the forces capable of
   carrying through the revolution and of retaining power. His decisiveness
   and responsibility in accomplishing theoretically validated actions
   allowed him to find the only true solutions in critical situations, and
   to triumph.},

Abstract = {Scholarly debate in the last decade intensively stresses the
   de-consolidation and de-democratisation of (some) political regimes in
   East-Central Europe, above all the Hungarian and Polish cases are
   reflected. Next to other aspects, such debate emphasized the confusion
   regarding the typology of regimes that objectively respect the basic
   democratic pre-conditions but tend to limit the liberal democracy or
   even transform into the ``less-than-fully-democratic{''} regime. The aim
   ouf our article is firstly to reflect the contemporary debate about the
   regimes located within the ``grey zone of regimes{''}, i.e. between the
   ideal types of liberal democracy and authoritarian regime. We
   specifically stress the hybridization of regimes within the theoretical
   framework and search for typology of ``hybrid{''} regimes. Secondly, we
   apply the concept of ``hybrid{''} regimes on the Hungarian case,
   understanding this regime as role model case in East-Central Europe. The
   analysis of the Hunagarian case is placed into the broader theoretical
   debate about de-democratisation and de-consolidation of democracy in
   East-Central Europe.},

Abstract = {How does single-party dominance influence interpersonal trust? We draw
   on evidence from trust games played by more than 2,000 subjects in South
   Africa, where, since Apartheid, race-based social enmity has persisted
   under democratic competition characterized by single-party dominance. We
   find that partisan-based trust discrimination is most pronounced for
   those who identify with the main opposition party and is driven by
   strong distrust of rival partisans. These findings underscore how
   electoral competition, in general, shapes trust across party lines and
   suggests one-sided competition, in particular, has asymmetrical effects
   between parties in dominant party systems. Moreover, this study provides
   additional evidence regarding the relative weights of trustworthiness
   stereotypes tied to partisanship and race.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider conflict as an interactive process in a
   specific context capable of transformation (Lederach, 2007). We start
   explaining the relationship between conflict and the culture of peace,
   emphasizing the role of communication in this transformation,
   particularly under Marshall Rosenberg's proposal regarding Nonviolent
   Communication. In this framework, the objective of this research was to
   explore the personal reflection of youth people after they resolve the
   Scale of Communication Strategies in Conflict Situations (ECSC).
   University students from Yucatan, Mexico resolve the ECSC and their
   reflections allowed us to observe that mostly their emotional control is
   the one that is related to their difficulties in moving towards a
   transformative solution to interpersonal conflict.},

Abstract = {Sports victory constitutes an important part of propaganda in
   authoritarian states. The heavy state investment in sports industries
   and sports culture in China illustrates the political importance of
   sports. However, few studies have systematically examined the exact
   impact of sports propaganda on public opinion. Using a survey experiment
   conducted in two Chinese cities, this article finds that broadcast
   highlighting national sports achievements has significant positive
   effects on general satisfaction and compliance with the local
   governments. These results expand on the small, but growing, literature
   on the effects of sports on political opinions and help detail the
   specific ways in which sports can affect political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to present a theoretical and
   methodological contribution of Critical Analysis applied to political
   discourse. The research proposes a conceptual review of the different
   orientations, plans and proposals of this qualitative analysis technique
   from a gender perspective. The corpus was set up by the selection of
   Government Plans of the political parties participating in the 2017
   election campaign in Ecuador in context with campaign spots which are
   consider as suitable context units for the interpretation and analysis
   of the texts. This research takes as its underlying fundament the
   Foucaultian theory of power and discourse, the proposal is to understand
   speech as an instrument of power. In conclusion, the findings reveal the
   limits of liberal democracy and the use of a series of discursive
   resources that legitimize prejudices and stereotypes. A range of
   qualifications and other resources such as institutionalism, religion or
   traditions were identified and subsequently analyzed in order to know
   why they are considered as principles that determine truthfulness and
   the requirements to enter the order of a discourse.},

Abstract = {Electoral rules impact the need for and ability of voters to coordinate
   around a candidate or candidates. In this paper, we examine two commonly
   used majoritarian electoral systems-the multiple nontransferable votes
   (MNTV) and single-member districts decided by plurality (SMDP). We look
   at strategic entry by elites and strategic voting by citizens.
   Coordination failures at either stage could keep teams of candidates out
   of office who might have otherwise been chosen to govern and could
   prevent voters from putting in office the candidates who would best
   represent them. For causal identification, we leverage the design of
   Brazil's senate, where both systems are alternately used. Using a
   difference-in-differences approach, we find that elites do not
   coordinate well under SMDP but do relatively better under MNTV while
   voters coordinate equally (well) across both systems.},

Abstract = {Recent studies identified gendered citation gaps in political science
   journal articles, with male scholars being less likely to cite work by
   female scholars in comparison to their female peers. Although journal
   editors, editorial boards, and political scientists are becoming more
   aware of implicit biases and adopting strategies to remedy them, we know
   less about the proper baselines for citations in subfields and research
   areas of political science. Without information about how many women
   should be cited in a research field, it is difficult to know whether the
   distribution is biased. Using the gender distribution of membership in
   professional political science organizations and article authors in 38
   political science journals, we provide scholars with suggested minimum
   baselines for gender representation in citations. We also show that
   women represent a larger share of organization members than the authors
   in sponsoring organizations' journals.},

Abstract = {The inception of AK Parti government's initiative to terminate the
   Kurdish issue in 2009 has paved the way to Dinding a political solution
   to one of the most intricate questions of modern Turkey. The political
   initiatives of the incumbent government not only ended the 40-years-long
   violence and related terrorism cycle for a short period of time but also
   promoted a heightened awareness of peace and reconciliation efforts. In
   regards to the role that they have played during the implementation of
   recent peace process (2009-2015), Kurdish youth has been frontline
   proxies of violence instigation. That said, Kurdish youth in Turkey have
   faced the implications of the conflict since early childhood. Struggling
   to survive amidst violent occurrences is a part of their daily routine
   as a result of structural deficiencies and proximate causes of
   participation in violence. Therefore, this article analyses existing
   youth peacebuilding initiatives for Kurdish youth in conflict-affected
   areas of the country. Similarly, it also intended to explore whether
   these initiatives respond to the roots causes of the conflict.},

Booktitle = {MAJORITY VOTING AS A CATALYST OF POPULISM: PREFERENTIAL DECISION-MAKING
   FOR AN INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {53-73},
Abstract = {As noted, many people believe in a form of majority rule which is based
   on majority voting. But if the (simple or weighted) majority vote is
   inadequate, and if the modified Borda count, MBC, is known to be more
   precise, democracy would presumably be enhanced if the latter were
   adopted as the international norm for democratic decision-making. As
   shown in Chap. 1, this MBC is indeed robust, inclusive and accurate; but
   it is also non-majoritarian. If therefore it were to be introduced, that
   which follows from majority voting-the crudest form of majority
   rule-should also be reformed. Thus the basis of democratic governance,
   everywhere, could be that which is often advocated for post-conflict
   societies: all-party power-sharing. Easier said than done, some might
   say; after all, many a so-called stable democracy sometimes has great
   difficulty in forming a new, post-election administration, even only a
   majority coalition let alone an all-party executive. With a matrix vote,
   however, it can be both said and done quite easily. This Chapter
   critiques current practice and (therefore) proposes an alternative.},

Abstract = {Argentina and Peru are facing the challenge of the governance of their
   intelligence services, in a context of authoritarian legacies and as
   part of their democratic consolidation processes. The use of political
   espionage, and the history of corruption incidents associated, poses the
   challenge of adjusting democratic controls. Concurrently, some countries
   have undergone substantive crisis in that sector having significant
   political impact. Countries' own defense and national security needs,
   along with the occurrence of transnational organized crime calls for
   appropriate intelligence capabilities. Therefore, this picture demands
   democratic reforms in the sector of intelligence beyond formal legal
   modifications. The paper explores the mentioned cases up to 2017,
   comparing them from a matrix based on Gill, to assess the degree of
   democratization and the level of accountability of intelligence
   services. The goal is to, based on legacies and democratic transitions,
   describe new legal instruments and the context of change, modes of
   implementation and associated crises, in order to recognize trends and
   lessons learned. This may bring us closer to understanding what
   Governments intend of their intelligence services.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2020},
Number = {24},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the evolution of the thinking of De Sanctis
   about the Renaissance and the Orlando Furioso in three steps: the early
   Neapolitan lessons, the Lezioni Zurighesi and the History of Italian
   Literature. The analysis deals with three key aspects: the relationship
   between epic and chivalry, the unity of plot, and form. The purpose is
   to demonstrate how the opinions of De Sanctis change less radically than
   we may imagine, as some fixed points remain unchanged throughout time.
   What significantly changes is the perspective through which these points
   are interpreted.},

Title = {LEADING TRADITIONAL AND RISING POWERS AS SECURITY PROVIDERS IN THE WORLD
   MOST FRAGILE STATES},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {57-74},
Abstract = {The article explores the resource capabilities and strategies the
   traditional and rising powers use to bring food, energy and
   military-political security to the world most fragile states. There is a
   certain complementarity in the relations between both the mentioned
   actors in international relations, since the negative externalities
   forming in and around fragile states require resources that could be
   provided and effectively provided by the world most powerful countries.
   The assumption that the key characteristic of a power (center) is a
   capability to translate outside military-political security allowed to
   the authors to categorize the USA, EU and, with certain restrictions,
   Japan as traditional centers of power; while Russia, China, Brazil,
   Turkey, and, to a lesser extent, India and Korea as rising ones. In
   terms of quantitative parameters, the United States, the EU, India and
   Russia have the resources to ensure food security, while Russia is the
   only major power that has a net surplus in energy foreign trade.
   Russia's comprehensive resource capability in the context of ``broad{''}
   security supports its leadership status in its efforts to stabilize and
   maintain the world order. Considering the behavioral and not resource
   aspect, the strategies of global and middle powers in the world most
   fragile states, with the exception for the EU and Turkey, correspond to
   their resource capabilities. Both deliver mineral fuels as well as
   Turkey supplies crops to fragile countries having overall deficit of
   such commodities. This may indicate that these centers of power as well
   as Russia implement the ``donor{''} strategies conceptualized in the
   literature for the rising powers of the modern world order.},

   escalation of inter-state conflicts. Others regard the Arctic as being
   an exceptional region in which shared interests and a spirit of
   cooperation prevent confrontation. To date, the eight states on the
   Arctic Council have consistently favoured cooperation. However, in 2019,
   the USA did a U-turn, declared the Arctic an arena for competition
   between the major powers and announced that it will increase its
   military involvement in the region. As a result, the potential for
   conflict has risen. Now more than ever, it is important that forms of
   regional cooperation are upheld. The change of course by the USA also
   demonstrates the high level of influence of global political
   developments on the Arctic, however.},

Abstract = {Grand strategy is hailed by some as a silver bullet for resolving policy
   drift, while others reject it as a hubristic term. William James argues
   that expectations of this concept need to be revised. The first half of
   this article addresses the study of grand strategy. James identifies and
   critiques the prominent conceptual frameworks for evaluating grand
   strategy. He offers an alternative approach for measuring the quality of
   a state's grand strategy. based on the notion of proportionality. The

   SYSTEM OF GREAT BRITAIN},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {3},
Pages = {181-191},
Abstract = {The article contains reflections on a number of the most important
   political issues raised in the book of Nataliya K. Kapitonova ``British
   Prime Ministers. Political Portraits{''}. At the center of this work are
   figures of seven heads of government, beginning with Edward Heath, with
   the direct assistance of whom the country became a member of the
   European Community on the third attempt, and ending with Theresa May,
   who unsuccessfully tried to get approval for an agreement on withdrawal
   from the European Union agreed with Brussels. The author of the article,
   when analyzing this work, focuses on a number of debatable issues that
   have emerged on the agenda of the political and international life of
   the United Kingdom against the background of lengthy agreements on
   Brexit, both with the European Union and within the country. Among such
   problems are the rapid transformation in the party-political system of
   the United Kingdom, the preferences of the electorate, the changing role
   of parliament in relations with the Prime Minister, and the growing
   importance of the very figure of the head of government. To this should
   be added the problem of the separation of elites from ordinary citizens,
   which manifested itself in the inability of the UK's political
   establishment both to assess the real chance for Brexit supporters to
   win when voting on June 23rd 2016, and to hear public demands for
   changes in the political course. The events following the referendum
   related to the long and painful period of negotiations on the ``divorce
   deal{''} and the confrontation of the Cabinet and the House of Commons
   are not properly comprehended by either the political or the expert
   community, both in the UK and abroad. It seems that it is possible to
   more deeply understand and evaluate these scenes in all their diversity
   and complexity through analysing the functionality of the Prime
   Minister's post in a long historical dynamic, using the example of
   solving the most acute domestic and foreign policy issues for Great
   Britain.},

Title = {EXPORT CONTROLS AS A TOOL TO MAINTAIN U.S. LEADERSHIP IN A CHANGING
   WORLD},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-88},
Abstract = {The article discusses the features of the American system of export
   control on dual-use products, which allowed it to become an important
   tool of foreign policy. Using system-historical and system-functional
   methodology, the author analyzed the evolution of the US export controls
   through the prism of changes in the American concept of national
   security. The task is to investigate why the system, created during the
   Cold war, is so popular today. Three periods are designated: the period
   of the Cold War, the 1990s - the first decade of the 2000s, the present
   stage. Within each stage the author analyzes significant changes in the
   export control legislation. The export control policy in the United
   States was revised in the light of new approaches to the problems of
   national and international security, as well as foreign policy
   objectives. In 1994, COCOM was dismantled. In the 90's and early 2000'
   issues of nonproliferation of WMD and prevention of WMD falling into the
   hands of terrorist groups began to occupy a key place in the policy of
   national security and export controls of the United States. This
   contributed to increasing cooperation between Russia and the United
   States. The two countries managed to improve the multilateral export
   control regimes, to hold Resolution 1540 in the UN Security Council in
   2004, which strengthened the international legal framework of the export
   controls. There is an acute internal political struggle around the
   export controls rules. Leading agencies, supported by individual groups
   of the political elite, are trying to impose their strategic priorities.
   Export controls are viewed by the business community as a restrictive
   measure. Naturally, business is lobbying for easing the export controls
   mode. Academic circles also actively support their right to free
   exchange of scientific and technical information. One can observe a
   constant tug of war between supporters of softening and tightening of
   the regime. The interpretation of US national security is qualitatively
   expanding due to dispersion of challenges and threats to its global
   leadership, the emergence of new breakthrough technologies in the civil
   and defense fields. Particular concern of the USA is the development of
   China's military and innovative potential, in connection with which
   there is a painful attitude to the possible transfers of American
   technologies to China. Export controls is considered to be the most
   important mechanism preventing such transfers. At present, the
   development of the American export control regime is undergoing a new
   toughening cycle. The position of hardliners within the US political
   elite in the implementation of such a policy is strengthening. The
   United States is looking for an enemy and trying to make it common to
   the entire Western world. The role of embargoes and sanctions in the
   American export control regime, as well as extraterritorial application
   of American rules, has increased again. The export control regime is
   used as a tool to maintain U.S. leadership in a changing world, to
   reorganize the world order in the interests of the United States.},

Abstract = {Regional politics is not at the centre of most Danes' political
   attention, but at the 2017 regional elections more than 7 in 10 Danes
   showed up at the polls to vote in the five Danish regions. Although
   several regional lists and smaller nationwide parties ran at the
   elections, the established parties already represented in the national
   parliament conquered all but two of the 205 seats. This is not to say
   that the voters simply copied their national vote - almost 3 in 10 voted
   for a different party at the regional elections than the one they would
   have preferred had they been voting at a general election.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-88},
Abstract = {y In recent times, threats to participatory democracy can arguably stem
   from a lack of strategic stability overshadowed by nuclear
   weapon-derived deterrence effects of a rising China and especially a
   relatively more belligerent resurgent Russia opposed to a Western
   alliance of democracies. This manuscript provides a scholarly analysis
   of strategic atability and illustrates some written truths that often
   seem incongruent with comments spoken by the same authors resulting from
   a hyper-politicized state of dialogue. The analysis is grounded in
   foundational concepts of deterrence and well-articulated in relevant
   policies and treaties.},

   Development in Africa},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {539-577},
Abstract = {A number of studies have found that British colonialism - specifically
   its policy of indirect rule - improved local economic development
   relative to the French policy of direct rule. There is less consensus,
   however, as to why indirect rule would produce better economic outcomes.
   This article proposes three mechanisms linking indirect rule to
   development: the devolution of power to local communities, the
   empowerment of traditional authorities, and the reification of ethnic
   identities. Using a geographic regression discontinuity research design
   on Cameroon's internal anglophone-francophone border, a legacy of the
   country's dual colonial heritage, the article finds the most evidence
   for the first mechanism, that citizens on the anglophone side of the
   border are more likely to act locally and, indeed, see their local
   institutions as more legitimate. In contrast, we find mixed evidence for
   the other two mechanisms regarding the power of chiefs and ethnic
   identities.},

Abstract = {The current historiography of the Argentine labor movement is crossed by
   the discussion on the formation of labor reformism. In this context,
   part of the debates focus on the emergence of the Peronist phenomenon as
   the most important manifestation of the Argentine working class. This
   look at Peronism accounts for the integration of workers into the
   national reality, that is, the recognition of the working class as an
   agent of transformation of the state within the capitalist order. But
   not any type of participation within the order, but one in a reformist
   key. This perspective presents an image that locates Peronism as the
   supreme moment of the passage to labor reformism; however, the pressure
   to be recognized as legal subjects, adherence to national symbols and
   common potential enemies, were not new. Even the most important emergent
   of the labor reformism was the defense of the union as a workers
   organism for the fight for the improvements exists before. So I propose
   not to see an image, but the entire historical process. This article
   presents, from a case study, the various channels through which the
   labor reformism prior to Peronism was developed, since the 1930s, and
   the place that fits the trade union current as one of the ideological
   aspects that promoted the formation of a reformist labor movement.},

Abstract = {Crisi s management and the global network were the two fundamental
   methods that Qatar has used to avoid and mitigate the negative impact of
   sanctions imposed by the so-called Anti-Terror Quartet states (Saudi
   Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt). They have also served
   in the process of recovery of security after the internal crisis. The
   research objective of the article is the presentation of Qatar's
   anti-sanction policy, one based on these two remedies (crisis management
   and global network) that turned out to be successful and as such may
   become a model useful for other states that face a similar threat.},

Title = {Rebuilding Trust in Broken Systems? Populist Party Success and Citizens'
   Trust in Democratic Institutions},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {What effect does the recent rise of populist parties harnessing an
   anti-system rhetoric have on political trust? Will citizens become
   disenchanted with and lose trust in the political system, or could
   populist party success even stimulate a growth of political trust?
   Arguing that populist parties may well be conceived as a corrective
   force giving voice to and addressing citizen concerns about the
   established political system, this contribution hypothesizes that
   populist party success will increase political trust among the general
   public, especially in countries lacking democratic quality, with weak
   corruption control, and meagre government performance. Empirically, it
   combines ParlGov data with survey data from the European Social Survey
   (2002-2016) as well as aggregate data from the Varieties-of-Democracy
   project and the World Development Indicators to investigate how
   political trust has changed in relation to the growing success of
   populist parties and how democratic quality, corruption control, and
   government performance have moderated this relationship in 23 European
   democracies. Its main findings indicate that, at least in the short run,
   political trust increases rather than decreases following populist party
   success and that this increase in trust is most pronounced in political
   systems that lack democratic quality, struggle with corruption, and
   deliver only meager government performance.},

   In this paper, we show that both the communication network and what
   people know about the network structure affect coordination. Increases
   in the number of connections between people make coordination easier and
   so does increasing the amount of information people have about the
   structure. We also demonstrate that highly connected nodes in the
   network can facilitate coordination, but only if individuals have
   sufficient knowledge to identify the presence of these nodes. Our
   results suggest the importance of understanding network knowledge and

Abstract = {In 1942, 17 Leman Street, Whitechapel, was acquired by the Colonial
   Office and converted into the only seamen's hostel for black men in
   London. For seven years, this small government-sponsored hostel provided
   thirteen beds for seamen from British colonies in the Caribbean and West
   Africa. Considering the hostel amid wider contestations of nationhood in
   London's built environment, this paper argues that the experience of
   `colonial' seamen and stowaways in the capital was characterised by
   spatial precariousness, a condition accentuated by the unwillingness of
   authorities to respond to the difficult realities of the colour bar and
   citizenship in post-war urban space.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the political reform to decentralization in Chile
   that will begin to rule in full after the regional governors' elections
   of 2021. Based on an intergovernmental relations approach, I show
   possible scenarios of lack of coordination in regional political
   dynamics that could lead to conflicts as a result of the existence of
   two new regional authorities with similar powers. In view of the
   weakness of the new institutional design, this article proposes the
   creation of a regional policy coordination body. The main conclusion is
   that the decentralization reform was conceived more as a process of
   autonomy and democratization, than as an instance of strengthening
   intergovernmental relations in order to implement better subnational
   public policies.},

Pages = {23-40},
Abstract = {In Zimbabwe, ethnicity has long informed the ways people make sense of
   their membership to the nation. Sport has since the turn of the century
   emerged as one of the major sites for the performance of `patriotic' and
   subversive notions of `unity in diversity'. This article explores the
   significance of nicknaming and name-calling by Highlanders Football Club
   fans on virtual spaces, in illuminating the ethnic threat to dominant
   conceptions of nation in post-2000 Zimbabwe. The study argues that as
   psycho-social and cultural constructs, football team nicknames reveal
   deeper states of ethnic attitudes which indicate the politics of complex
   ethnic sentiments that destabilise popular notions of belonging to a
   nation.},

Title = {THE REQUEST FOR CHANGE: POLITICAL AND VALUE DIMENSION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {6},
Pages = {103-118},
Abstract = {The social perturbations during the first half of 2020s demonstrated the
   contradictions that were accumulating in Russian society over recent
   years. One aspect of social disengagement is the peculiar attitude of
   different social groups and strata towards the long-term course of the
   contemporary government about maintaining stability; this term is
   understood as the pathway that preserves the misting political and
   economic system and ``the rules of the game{''}. Sociological data from
   monitoring studies by the Institute of Sociology of the FCTAS (RAS)
   demonstrates that Russian society is divided into approximately two
   equal parts: one wishes for change, and believes that the shortage of
   serious economic and social reforms will cause the state to stagnate;
   the other wants to maintain stability and believes that transformations
   should not be rushed, having no information about the results thereof.
   The reasons why public demands for change have formed have already been
   analyzed by the working group of the research project ``Social
   Transformation of Russian Society. the Actors of the Request for
   Change,{''}. Therefore, the author of this article focuses on the
   identification of the factors that influence subjective choice in favor
   of change or stability. The analysis demonstrates that such a choice is
   determined by political, not by social, differences between the
   supporters of either changes or of stability. These manifest,
   predominantly, when many Russians are aware that the bonier between
   private and public in modern Russia is illusory. The author, applying
   the sociological data, demonstrates the correlation between the increase
   of the number of ``self-sufficient Russians{''} and the formation of a
   request for change. The combination of this attitude with a prospective
   vision of the future becomes a key factor that forces the desire for
   change. The social request for changes, which is not accepted by the
   authorities, forms a special identity that can transform the sense of
   resentment into a collective action to uphold one's vision of the
   future.},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute both theoretically and empirically to
   the study of political parties in the EU context, focusing on party
   organisation. Theoretically, it draws on insights from various
   literatures to develop a novel typology of multilevel party organisation
   specific to the EU context. It argues that parties are goal-seeking
   actors that choose their organisation based on a cost-benefit analysis,
   involving both party characteristics and the institutional context.
   Empirically, the article applies this framework on the Flemish political
   parties. It finds that rational goal-seeking behaviour cannot fully
   account for parties' organisational choices. Results show that normative
   and historical considerations play a crucial role in parties'
   cost-benefit analysis. It therefore calls upon future research to expand
   the number of comparative studies and to further assess parties'
   goal-seeking behaviour regarding their multilevel organisation.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {136-146},
Abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the effectiveness of locally led
   processes of social change and development. However, most of the case
   studies that have been discussed in the literature are focused on
   programs run by international development agencies. This article
   examines three locally led processes of change in the Pacific. These
   include the Simbo for Change Initiative in the Solomon Islands, the
   Voice in Papua New Guinea and a regional process led by the Green Growth
   Coalition. We explore how local understandings of leadership,
   preferences for informal ways of working, holistic ways of thinking, the
   importance placed upon maintaining good relationships and collective
   deliberation fundamentally shaped each of the cases. We note how these
   preferences and ways of working are often seen, or felt, to be at odds
   with western modes of thought and the practice of development agencies.
   Finally, we conclude by exploring how these initiatives were supported
   by external agencies, and suggest further research of this type might
   provide benchmarks by which Pacific citizens can hold their governments
   and development agencies to account.},

Abstract = {Changes in the Spanish party's systems, as well as parties' deepening on
   questions related to the form of the Spanish state after 2008 Great
   Recession, make it interesting to analyse citizens' polarization on the
   centre-periphery axis and how the electoral space get reorganized in
   this respect. This article aims at analysing the distribution of
   national identities and preferences over the territorial organization of
   the state among voters of Spanish parties in the electoral context after
   2008. For this purpose, we pool CIS post-electoral studies from 2008 to
   2019 and explore them through graphics and multinomial logit
   regressions. Our findings confirm that the erosion already noted by
   Jimenez and Navarro (2015) for 2011's elections were not just
   conjunctural. In fact, there was a trend that consolidated by 2015 and
   stabilizes until 2019. More specifically, the erosion in support for the
   current Estado de las Autonomias system consolidates at the same time
   that support for centralist options increases in general. This weakening
   is not contemporary with a similar general deterioration of compatible
   identities among citizenry, despite the increase in exclusive national
   identities. Regarding the new party's system, voters get polarized in
   relation to their preferences over the territorial organization of the
   state, not their national identities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {216-233},
Abstract = {Declining rates of public participation in the United States of America
   have raised questions about the sustainability and effectiveness of U.S.
   democracy. Some scholars have called for making democracy fun through
   the use of game design to make public participation more accessible.
   Using cultural discourse analysis, this study explores the locally
   situated communication practices of a civil society organization called
   Warm Cookies of the Revolution that seeks to (re)imagine U.S. democracy
   by making public participation fun. The research employs `fun talk' - a
   specific communication practice within public participation - as an
   analytical unit and finds that fun talk served as a discursive hub of
   emotion with radiants of meaning connected to being, acting, and
   relating. In contrast to those who have argued fun democratic practices
   should employ game design to improve public administration, participants
   understood fun talk as a way to introduce them to civic affairs, form
   relationships with neighbours, and take action to improve their
   communities. The article discusses implications for theories of emotion
   and affect in civil society scholarship.},

Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},

Volume = {165},
Number = {3},
Pages = {84-94},
Abstract = {There has been persistent confusion among European and US diplomats over
   the public statements of Ayatollah Khamenei on matters of foreign
   policy. Despite significant Iranian pragmatism in negotiations,
   Khamenei's pronouncements are consistently combative. P Sadeghi and Jack
   Watling examine the evolution of the concept of velayat-e faqih, which
   underpins the position of the Supreme Leader, and how it has been
   promulgated, and argue that Khamenei has developed a narrative of
   infallibility. This, combined with the obligations pertaining to his
   office as an Ayatollah. have made him uniquely constrained in his
   ability to publicly alter his language. At the same time Khamenei has
   worked to centralise power around his office, thereby creating a paradox
   by which the most powerful decision-maker in Iran is unable to offer
   clear public leadership for fear of being proven wrong.},

Abstract = {The situation for NGOs in Russia has become more and more difficult. The
   state is becoming increasingly repressive and is exerting ever stricter
   control over them. One of the organisations that is suffering is
   Memorial. Several regional groups have been declared ``foreign
   agents{''}. They are randomly inspected, prosecuted and ordered to pay
   financial penalties. The head of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in
   Chechnya was found guilty following farcical judicial proceedings, while
   for a second time, the head of Memorial in Karelia faces prosecution on
   the basis of manipulated witness statements. The aim of the repressive
   state is to discredit, defame and destroy Memorial. However, it has
   failed to do so, and solidarity remains unbroken.},

   respect to that of the German jurist, will inevitably lead to a

   addressed the democratic issue by rediscovering and deconstructing

Abstract = {The article discusses the legal regulation of the application of civil
   law methods of non-patrimonial personal rights in the protection of
   patent rights. Methodologically, the scientific method and the technique
   of documentary research close to legal hermeneutics were made. By way of
   conclusion, everything indicates that there is no mandatory
   administrative procedure for resolving authorship disputes in the patent
   dispute chamber in Russia. In addition, it was revealed that the
   provisions of Part 4 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation with
   respect to the Protection of Non-Property Personal Patent and
   Intellectual Rights were unsuccessfully established and created legal
   uncertainty, as only part of the above methods of civil and personal
   rights have worked in non-property litigation. As a recomjunction, it is
   proposed to extend the scope of Article 1407 of the Civil Code of the
   Russian Federation ``publication of the judicial decision on patent
   infringement{''} and related administrative procedures for cases of
   violation of non-patrimonial personal patent rights.},

Abstract = {The guiding idea of the present study is that of deciphering the role of
   the Chilean State during the first two governments of the Concertacion
   in Chile. This will be done by analyzing the general determinations of
   the process of capital accumulation and the role of the State in said
   process during the nineties, whose synthesis creates a specific
   productive structure. Methodologically it will proceed by examining
   series of macroeconomic indicators utilizing the recommended variables
   of the theory in use. It concludes by explaining the economic content of
   the political action of the State.},

Abstract = {What is interdiscipline? What are the conditions that make its gradual
   extension and adoption in the world intellectual environment possible?
   What is its relationship with the technical and epistemological
   transformations of the current period? The aim here is to contribute to
   the critical mastery of the terms that accompany interdiscipline,
   fundamentally in the fields of the humanities and social sciences. The
   approach combines a review of academic promotion networks on the
   Internet with specialized literature. The study identifies that
   interdiscipline seems to respond ultimately to a technical innovation on
   work processes, oriented towards the constitution of the collective
   worker on the plane of intellectual production during the so-called
   global academic capitalism. Its fundamental feature is the cooperation
   in the integration of methods and perspectives of analysis in the
   elaboration of products of reflection and concrete intervention
   formulated towards the resolution of practical problems.},

Abstract = {The problem of the relationship of law and order is relevant to any
   modern society. The article tries to analyze this relationship, taking
   into account judicial, police and other activities. The named concepts
   are closely interconnected, but are not identical. They are correlated
   as cause and effect: there is a rule of law, there is no rule of law.
   One suggests the other. The rule of law as concrete reality logically
   precedes the rule of law as a doctrine, the connection here is hard,
   causal. The process is one. Law and order: a real indicator of the state
   of legality, reflects the degree of compliance with the laws, the
   requirements of all legal regulations. It is concluded that the rule of
   law is the end result of the implementation of legal requirements and,
   at the same time, the objective of legal regulation, since it is for the
   formation and maintenance of the rule of law that laws are issued, thus
   like other regulatory legal acts, various institutions and bodies and,
   above all, the justice system, the control system, various human rights
   organizations and social movements.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {We argue that the critical return of Karl Marx's theoretical production
   is, at the same time, the return of a categorical critique of
   capitalism. We hold that the main categories of his critique of
   political economy (namely, commodity, abstract labor, value, money, and
   capital) correspond to the basic system of critical representation of
   the structure of capitalism and of the social order of individuals in
   modernity. The ``return to Marx{''} by a diverse series of schools and
   authors is a (re) interpretation of their categories and, at the same
   time, of their theoretical production as a critique of the dominant
   modern social forms. To support our hypothesis, first, we will briefly
   follow up on the reappropriation of Marx's work based on the
   epistemological discussion about the continuity or discontinuity of his
   work. We will show how inefficient it is to divide the interpretation
   between a ``young{''} Marx ({''}protophilosophist{''}) and an ``old{''}
   ({''}scientist{''}), a debate that nowadays divides Marxologists.
   Secondly, we will present some of the central features that constitute
   the interpretation of Marx's theoretical production under the record of
   the critique of political economy and its relation to science; Finally,
   we will approach the main categories that constitute the author's
   critical support, using as bibliography, three positions, which, despite
   their differences, form a place to rethink a categorical reading of
   Marxian theoretical production, both of the Grundrisse as of Capital:
   those of Moishe Postone, Michael Heinrich and Robert Kurz.},

Abstract = {This essay brings together political theories of empire and racial
   capitalism to clarify the entanglements between socialist and imperial
   discourse at the turn of the twentieth century. I show that white labor
   activists and intellectuals in the United States and the British settler
   colonies borrowed from imperial scripts to mark non-white workers as a
   threat. This discourse was thus both imperial and popular, because it
   absorbed the white working class into settler projects and enlisted its
   support in defense of imperial logics of labor control. While white
   workers' demands of enfranchisement were part of a transnational
   imagination that was both imperial and narrowly emancipatory, this
   discourse reemerged as one of popular sovereignty and found channels and
   paths to institutionalization through national states. These
   institutional formations arose out of the encounter between capitalists
   interested in facilitating mobility of racialized laboring subjects
   around the globe, elite projects invested in sheltering settler spaces,
   and white workers concerned with protecting their own labor from
   competition by excluding exploitable non-white workers. White labor's
   embrace of racial prejudice and the exclusion of workers of color
   created segregated labor spaces that fit neatly with both capitalist
   goals of labor control and the protection of the settler status of
   emerging polities. Bringing to the forefront the imperial genealogy of
   popular sovereignty and immigration control disrupts liberal political
   theory frameworks that condemn restrictions as well as those that find
   migration restrictions permissible. The analysis also illuminates
   contemporary immigration politics.},

Abstract = {Despite being largely overlooked in the literature, Israel provides a
   rare example of what a full decade of twenty-first century populism in
   power looks like. Based on an examination of rhetoric and policymaking
   between 2009 and 2019, this article brings the writing on the subject up
   to date and highlights the unique traits of Israeli populism. In so
   doing it establishes that Israeli populism has been mainstreamed to a
   remarkable extent and currently encompasses almost all right-wing
   parties in the country's legislature. Moreover, it shows that the
   Israeli case embodies a variety of populism which has yet to be
   acknowledged in the literature - neither economic nor cultural in
   character, but rather based on national security issues. The concept of
   `security-driven populism', introduced here, could prove useful to
   researchers studying other populist regimes that do not fit neatly into
   the `culture versus economy' debate, which has dominated the field for
   years.},

Abstract = {South Africa's adopted neoliberalism framework, since democracy, has
   spearheaded industrial development such as mining and has contributed to
   eroding civil society formations for environmental justice. Although
   civil society has acted against mining developments, such actions can be
   uncoordinated due to neoliberal development influences. Neoliberalism
   can work to reconfigure the geographies of environmental justice
   struggles contributing to a fragmented `micro-politics'. This paper
   presents viewpoints from key stakeholders to examine civil society
   opposition to a mining proposal in rural Fuleni, KwaZulu-Natal, and the
   challenges that local communities may face in contesting exploitative
   mining practices in the context of neoliberal policy environments to
   secure just resilient outcomes. The paper highlights that for
   environmental justice struggles against mining to be successful and
   effective against domination and local leadership corruption, requires
   communities engaging in networking and social capital by linking up
   struggles and beyond isolated campaigns, sharing experiences and
   designing common narratives for strategies to combat mining and the
   broader neoliberal ideology producing unjust resilient outcomes. This
   also requires that campaigners include the local youth in discussions on
   and alternatives to mining, or run the risk of destabilising mining
   struggles for just resilient outcomes.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship argues that citizens' support for specific government
   programs in the United States is affected by the means through which
   benefits are delivered as well as the distributional consequences of
   these policies. In this paper, we extend this literature in two ways
   through a series of novel survey experiments, deployed on a nationally
   representative sample. First, we directly examine differences in public
   support for prospective government spending when manipulating the mode
   of delivery. Second, we examine whether information about the
   distributional consequences of two existing government programs affects
   their popularity. We find that citizens have a preference for indirect
   spending that is independent of the distributional consequences of a
   given policy and identify mechanisms that may explain this view.
   Furthermore, we find little evidence that highlighting the regressive
   effects of current government programs significantly reduces the demand
   for their policy benefits. Our findings have implications for
   understanding the political calculus of policy design and the potential
   for public persuasion.},

Abstract = {Facing the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic positions us in front of the
   first major health crisis of the last century with a significant impact
   on the social, economic, political and cultural levels, bringing out the
   critics towards globalization that were already on the discussion table.
   Although tourism has managed to recover from other crises that have
   occurred, for the first time the current pandemic caused a total
   interruption in the flow of travelers both inland and between countries.
   The pandemic -and the consequent closure of borders-, has accelerated
   and deepened the questioning of the way countries have been managing
   tourism, especially based on the negative effects on destination
   communities and their heritage, as well as on the environment.
   Sustainable tourism stands as a structuring factor for the recovery of
   tourism worldwide.},

Abstract = {The split ticket voting is an electoral phenomenon that is based on
   choosing differently in two elections held on the same election day.
   This article examines the last three major and council elections in
   Bogota, Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla, in order to find the magnitude
   of the differentiated vote at the subnational level. To this end, an
   analysis has been used with aggregated data with which the Arian and
   Weiss spin-out index could be applied. In this way, it has been
   empirically noted that in local elections, there is a split ticket
   voting in concurrent elections incentivized by factors such as different
   participation in each concurrent election, high fragmentation of the
   party system and a considerable electoral volatility.},

Abstract = {We provide and test a theory explaining how and why racial attitudes
   shape public opinion on government spending in the United States. We
   hypothesize that many people think the government allocates money
   unfairly across racial groups, and ``inequity aversion{''} leads them to
   reject spending as a result. Using data from an original survey, we find
   support for our theory in the sample as a whole, and within racial,
   partisan, and ideological subgroups. Indeed, unfairness views are
   comparable to partisanship in their relationship to opinion on spending.
   While prior work has shown that whites' racial attitudes are correlated
   with opinion on specific government programs, we show they shape opinion
   about the appropriate level of government spending writ large. We also
   move beyond the study of white opinion, measuring views of unfairness in
   the distribution of spending among racial minorities as well.},

Abstract = {The present work stems from a PhD research seminar and its subsequent
   article focused on reflecting on the fleeting adoption of face masks in
   everyday life, as a `medium' in the terms proposed by Marshall McLuhan:
   all mediums are messages. So much so, this article aims to address the
   reasons for its use, the circulation of meaning within society, as well
   as the new bonds established between people with renewed meanings of
   identity. In this way, the body, the sensesand fashion constitute
   devicesre configured by this medium and allow comparisons to be made
   with other cultures, such as Eastern ones, regarding the use of veils by
   Muslims, Islamic and Arabs as well as face masks, which have been used
   in Japan for several years.},

Abstract = {In many countries, members of parliament receive publicly funded
   allowances to communicate with the electorate. Some hope that ensuing
   parliamentary communication engages the people with politics and
   increases electoral participation. Others worry that such use of public
   funds might create an unfair advantage for incumbents and affect
   electoral results. Yet, the consequences of this practice remain
   unknown. Data from the UK House of Commons suggest that both the hopes
   and the worries are baseless: there is no evidence that parliamentary
   communication allowances increase electoral turnout or affect
   incumbents' vote share. If these allowances are not effective, both
   parliaments and their members might want to reconsider their use and
   usefulness.},

Abstract = {A large body of literature suggests that electoral system type has an
   impact on voting behaviour, but little work has been done looking at its
   effects on other forms of democratic accountability, such as contacting
   elected representatives and protesting. Using data from 36 African
   countries, we find that the type of electoral system has a significant
   relationship with these other forms of participation. Citizens in PR
   systems are significantly more likely to protest than those in
   majoritarian ones, while those in majoritarian systems are more likely
   to contact elected representatives. We argue that this is because the
   connection between citizens and representatives in majoritarian systems
   is clearer, closer, and more responsive, making contact an effective
   strategy and providing an efficient ``safety valve{''} when citizens
   want to hold their government accountable. The lack of a similar
   connection in most PR systems, in contrast, leads citizens to turn to
   protest more regularly.},

Abstract = {Previous research documents that citizens apply a ``coalition
   heuristic{''} to infer that governing coalition partners share more
   similar policies and ideologies than are implied by the statements in
   their election manifestos. We propose even simpler government-related
   heuristics citizens can apply to infer party positions on European
   integration: the current government heuristic that currently governing
   parties are more pro-Europe than opposition parties, and the long-term
   opposition heuristic that opposition parties that have never governed
   are less pro-Europe than opposition parties with previous governing
   experience. We report theoretical and empirical analyses of survey data
   from 24 European Union member states, which substantiate that citizens
   apply these heuristics, which have consequences for citizens' policy
   beliefs and their party support. We also find evidence that citizens
   respond to policy as measured through election manifestos and expert
   surveys.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Contrary to the dominant expectations of the late 20th century,
   secessionism surged in two West European minority national communities,
   Catalonia and Scotland, over the last decade. Yet, in two others
   enjoying similar degrees of autonomy, Flanders and South Tyrol,
   secessionism did not gain strength. This outcome suggests that focusing
   on the degree of autonomy afforded to minority national communities is
   misplaced. This article shows that the nature of autonomy is more
   important than its degree for understanding the strength of
   secessionism. It demonstrates that the key to autonomy regimes weakening
   secessionism is their capacity to adjust and expand over time. Dynamic
   autonomy staves off secessionism while static autonomy stimulates it.
   The article is based on a controlled comparison of, on the one hand,
   Catalonia and Scotland, where autonomy regimes have been mostly static
   during key periods of time, and, on the other hand, Flanders and South
   Tyrol, where they have been dynamic.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump has enjoyed a nearly 30-year relationship with World
   Wrestling Entertainment as a business partner, fan, in-ring performer
   and 2013 Hall of Fame Inductee. Noting this long running involvement, it
   has become a widespread contention that Trump's style as a political
   campaigner owes a debt to his experiences within the world of
   professional wrestling. Taking such claims seriously, this article
   argues that an engagement with concepts developed within professional
   wrestling studies would benefit political studies by offering new
   analytical approaches for the study of the political phenomenon that is
   Donald Trump. Providing a brief introduction to professional wrestling
   studies, this article outlines how the concepts of kayfabe, smart fandom
   and marking out help address a key question for political scholars: how
   to explain a cynical American electorate's engagement with and emotional
   investment in the campaign of such an obvious political fraudster.},

Abstract = {Anti-refugee violence often accompanies refugee migration, but the
   factors that fuel or mitigate that violence remain poorly understood,
   including the common policy response in such settings of humanitarian
   aid. Existing theory and policy debates predict that aid to refugees
   exacerbates anti-refugee violence by increasing hosts' resentment toward
   refugees. In contrast, however, aid may reduce violence in ways such as
   increasing host communities' well-being through more demand for local
   goods and services and refugees sharing aid. We test for the sign and
   mechanisms of this relationship. Evidence from original survey data and
   a regression discontinuity design suggests that cash transfers to Syrian
   refugees in Lebanon did not increase anti-refugee violence, and if
   anything they reduced violence. Exploring why aid does not increase
   hostility, we find evidence that aid allows recipients to indirectly
   compensate locals through higher demand for local goods and services,
   directly benefit locals by offering help and sharing aid, and reduce
   contact with potential aggressors.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the co-opting of neuroscientific findings
   into social work practice with infants at risk of harm. The value of
   neuroscience to our understanding of infants and infant care remains
   contested. For `infant mental health' proponents, neuroscientific
   findings have become a powerful tool in arguing for the importance of
   nurture and care in the early years. However, critical perspectives
   question the selective use of neuroscientific evidence, and the impact
   that the `first three years' agenda has actually had on families. In
   social work, much of our involvement with very young children is centred
   around risk. It is also concentrated on children born into families and
   communities experiencing multiple disadvantages. The emphasis on the
   vulnerability of infants and very young children has changed child
   protection social work in significant ways. Many of the children subject
   to child care and protection measures are very young, or not yet born.
   This paper draws upon findings from a study which followed families
   through the process of pre-birth child protection assessment. It is
   argued that it is necessary to engage critically with the `first three
   years' narrative that has become dominant in Scottish policy making and
   the impact this has had on child protection practice and the lives of
   families. The paper argues for a broader interpretation of ACEs focused
   on community and public health across the life course.},

Abstract = {Is it true that national identity increases trust, as liberal
   nationalists assume? Recent research has studied this side of the
   `national identity argument' by focusing on conceptions of the content
   of national identity (often civic or ethnic) and their links to social,
   rather than political, trust. This paper argues that if we take social
   identity theory seriously, however, we need to complement this picture
   by asking how varying the strength - rather than the content - of a
   person's sense of their national identity affects both their social and
   political trust. We break down the different dimensions of national
   identity, hypothesizing and empirically verifying that there are
   divergent links from national attachment, national pride, and national
   chauvinism to social and political trust. We do so with data from the US
   (General Social Survey) and the Netherlands (Longitudinal Internet
   Studies for the Social Sciences ), thus expanding current knowledge of
   national identity and trust to a highly relevant yet neglected European
   case.},

Abstract = {Is tough-on-China campaign rhetoric cheap talk or a signal of policy
   attention? Analyzing China-related campaign advertisements during the
   2010 midterm elections and subsequent cosponsorship of China-related
   bills, we find that campaign ads are a noisy predictor of legislative
   attention. Challengers who attacked on China were more likely to
   cosponsor China-related legislation, while incumbents who were attacked
   for being soft on China took tougher positions on China after
   reelection. By demonstrating the correspondence between anti-China
   campaign appeals and subsequent legislative attention, our findings add
   to a growing body of evidence linking campaign rhetoric to members'
   legislative agendas. This research note provides the first evidence
   demonstrating the connection between campaign appeals and legislative
   attention on a foreign policy issue like China.},

Abstract = {A large body of scholarship points to the importance of legislatures in
   authoritarian regimes, arguably making them more stable and durable.
   Legislatures could, for example, perform a co-opting function by giving
   legislative power to potential opponents of incumbents. Additional
   evidence is needed, however, to show that this legislative function of
   parliament exists in non-democracies. This article, therefore, takes a
   step back and investigates to what extent parliaments in authoritarian
   regimes have a legislative function, by focusing on the amendment of
   executive bills. Based on an innovative way of measuring parliamentary
   amendment, the analysis uses a unique original dataset with
   cross-national data on 5271 executive bills from Russia, Kazakhstan,
   Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. The figures demonstrate a high level of activity
   across all parliaments analysed here. Importantly, however, some
   legislatures are more active than others. Contributing empirically and
   theoretically to existing literature, the results show that legislatures
   on average amend executive bills for 43.2\% and that power sharing
   institutions, defined as contestation and institutional differentiation,
   constitute mechanisms causing different levels of activity. The article
   concludes by discussing the limitations of the investigation and
   indicates where future research could strengthen further theoretical and
   empirical links between legislative power sharing, co-optation and
   regime stability.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the tax avoidance behaviour of German
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Based on firm-specific data of
   state-owned and private firms from the period between 2004 and 2013
   obtained from theOrbisdatabase and public share reports
   (Beteiligungsberichte), it employs propensity score matching to analyse
   whether SOEs differ from private firms in their use of aggressive tax
   planning. Furthermore, a range of theories stemming from the Political
   Science and Economics literature that could explain SOEs' tax planning
   behaviour are tested using fixed and random effects regressions. Results
   suggest that German SOEs engage in aggressive tax avoidance. This tax
   avoidance is positively affected by the total public share, the number
   of public shareholders and the relative power of the biggest private
   shareholder within the SOE. Market competition as well as the governing
   party coalition of the public owner cannot explain SOEs' aggressive tax
   planning behaviour.},

Abstract = {The conflict in Donbas has distracted attention from broader patterns of
   interaction between Russia and Ukraine. Russia continues to use a
   variety of tactics, apart from military force, to influence Ukraine.
   Among the key tactics are coercion in the gas sector, naval blockade,
   ``passport colonialism,{''} attempts to sway Ukrainian elections,
   support for the pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, and promotion
   of religious influence through the Russian Orthodox Church. None of
   these tactics is novel, but each is evolving along with circumstances.
   Regardless of what happens in Donbas, Ukraine will continue to feel
   multifaceted pressure from Russia.},

Abstract = {Personalist regimes are more reliant on natural resource rents than
   other models of autocracy, but the direction of causation is unclear.
   Resource wealth could finance patronage and allow leaders to skip
   construction of institutionalized systems of rule, leading to more
   personalized autocracies. Conversely, personalist leaders may increase
   resource extraction, since diversifying the economy could increase the
   power of rivals. I use data on the degree of personalism and level of
   oil income to disentangle these interpretations. The results show that
   increases in oil income are associated with subsequent increases in
   personalism within autocracies. Since personalist regimes are less
   likely to successfully democratize, the results also provide important
   evidence as to why oil impedes democracy.},

Abstract = {Despite widespread belief in the efficacy of statutes prohibiting
   discrimination in public accommodations, including protections for the
   use of privately provided yet publicly available services such as
   transportation, hotels, and restaurants, we lack causal estimates of the
   impacts of these statutes on the well-being of those they are designed
   to protect. We leverage the US Supreme Court's 1883 strike of the public
   accommodations provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1875, along with
   variation in state-level statutes, to identify the impact of the Act's
   public accommodations provisions. Using a panel of repeated geo-located
   medical exams of US Colored Troops (USCT) and white Union Army veterans,
   and a series of difference-in-differences, geographic regression
   discontinuity, and placebo designs, estimates consistently suggest that
   the Court's ruling led to meaningful weight losses for USCT veterans in
   states without state-level public accommodations statutes. These
   findings suggest that statutes prohibiting discrimination in public
   accommodations can have significant positive impacts on the well-being
   of those they are designed to protect.},

   of the EU},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {31},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The EU Court of Justice recognises that accessing, holding and
   transferring electronic personal data, pretrial proceedings which are
   becoming more and more commonly used in criminal proceedings,
   constitutes interference in the fundamental rights to private and family
   life and to personal data protection, and therefore if a public
   authority attempts to obtain such data, it requires judicial
   authorisation which must in all cases respect the principle of
   proportionality and establishes, as a criterion of the evaluation of
   proportionality, the seriousness of the crimes. It seems, then, that
   access to electronic personal data in criminal investigation must be
   strictly limited to the purposes of prevention and the detection of
   serious crimes, or the trial of such crimes. This leads to the doubt
   which we attempt to resolve in this work: Can only the examining judge
   authorise obtaining electronic personal data held by communications
   service providers when serious crimes are being investigated? Or, in a
   criminal investigation, should proceedings for obtaining evidence and
   access to electronic personal data be authorised when the crime is not
   serious? The CJEU recently gave a response which requires analysis, as
   it serves to set important criteria that the examining judge must use in
   the judgement of proportionality which gives the foundation for the
   authorisation of these kinds of criminal pretrial proceedings.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {What little research exists on why party members quit has tended to find
   that exit is driven primarily by political and ideological concerns.
   This research note builds on this, framing this finding theoretically
   and arguing that such theory should allow for the role of negative
   triggers - events that cause people to quit. We focus on the example of
   changes of leadership. Using data from four Party Members Project
   surveys, we find that British party members seem to leave parties mainly
   for political and ideological reasons, and because of disillusionment or
   disagreement with their leaders. This disillusionment, in turn, is often
   based on perceived ideological differences. We illustrate this with
   tweets by Labour members cancelling (or considering cancelling) their
   membership in the immediate wake of the election of Keir Starmer as
   party leader in April 2020.},

Abstract = {This essay examines and challenges some of the theoretical arguments of
   the neoliberal attack on the concept of popular sovereignty. I argue
   that in order to resist both the neoliberal reaction against popular
   power and the subsequent resurgence of populist rhetoric, we need to
   rework the concept of popular sovereignty. I focus on three groups of
   texts written in the early years of the neoliberal shift-namely, from
   the mid-1970s to early 1980s-which deal with the question of
   sovereignty: Hayek'sLaw, Legislation and Liberty; Foucault's works of
   the late 1970s; and Lefort's reflections on the symbolic dimension of
   power. While Hayek and Foucault defend similar views on sovereignty and
   argue that it is or should be replaced by technics of management, Lefort
   proposes a de-essentialized conception of democracy based on redefining
   sovereignty as the possibility of continually refiguring the space of
   power.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {49},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Thomas Hobbes's infamously severe accounts of the phenomenon of laughter
   earned the condemnation of such varied readers as Francis Hutcheson and
   Friedrich Nietzsche, and he has maintained his reputation as an enemy of
   humor among contemporary scholars. A difficulty is raised by the fact
   that Hobbes makes ample use of humor in his writings, displaying his
   willingness to evoke in his readers what he appears to condemn. This
   article brings together Hobbes's statements on laughter and comedic
   writing with examples of his own humorous rhetoric to show that Hobbes
   understands laughter as a species of insult, but that there are
   conditions under which humor can be made to serve the cause of peace.
   Drawing on evidence from across Hobbes's works, and in particular from
   an understudied discussion of ``Vespasian's law{''} in theSix Lessons,
   this essay theorizes the conditions under which Hobbes found witty
   contumely to be conducive to peace. On this reading, Hobbes models the
   discreet use of humorous rhetoric in defense of peace, a defense that
   will be ongoing even after the commonwealth has been founded. Hobbes
   offers insight into how we can remain attuned to laughter's
   inegalitarian tendencies without foregoing the equalizing potential to
   be found in laughing at ourselves and at those who think too highly of
   themselves.},

Title = {The sociology of emotions of the protest action of Iranians on 28
   December 2017},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Emotions are an undeniable reality of human life. Many of the behaviours
   of individuals, as well as social movements and collective actions are
   driven by emotional stimuli. This article studies the emotional aspects
   of `The Protest of Iranians on 28 December 2017' and focuses on the
   question `Why did the Iranians emotional protest turn into violence?'
   Using the theoretical approach of `sociology of emotions' and the
   `descriptive-analytical' method, the hypothesis is that `the embedded
   backgrounds and interpretations, which led to generating disturbances
   and emotional reconsidering of citizens, nurtured anti-system emotions
   and, finally unfettered such angry emotions, the results of which
   brought about so many consequences'. Data were collected in three
   methods of documentary, observation and speech research. The findings
   show that the economic, social, political and cultural conditions in
   Iran have caused emotional transformation in part of the society so that
   the long-term emotional frameworks entailing the survival of the system
   such as loyalty, affection, and temperance were replaced by a new
   emotional system consisting of anger, hatred, aversion and alienation.
   Consequently, some people expressed their anger blatantly and were not
   worried about liberation being banned and anti-regime emotions because
   they had nothing to lose except breaking the chain of poverty and social
   exclusion.},

Title = {Families Formed Under Forced Marriage During the Genocide in Cambodia:
   Exploring the Perspectives of Men, Women, and Children},
Journal = {GENOCIDE STUDIES INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-190},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {This paper explores the realities of men and women forced to marry by
   the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, as well as the perspectives of
   children born of forced marriages. Forced marriage has been
   predominantly investigated in relation to violence and coercion towards
   girls and women. However, less attention has been paid to forced unions
   involving both spouses, as well as to children born of these couples.
   Data were collected from 80 participants, including in-depth interviews
   with 28 women and 30 men who experienced forced marriage, and focus
   groups with 22 children born of forced marriages. Those who experienced
   forced marriage highlighted the coercion and threats of violence that
   underlay the marriage process. However, interviews also pointed to
   spouses' key coping mechanisms and resources, such as the long-term
   acceptance of the marriage and support from larger community, which
   sustained positive familial relations. Children born of these unions,
   who regarded their parents' marriage as generally loving and supportive,
   corroborated these findings. Our study revealed the ways in which forced
   marriages within the context of genocide were not necessarily
   characterized by domestic violence and abuse. We suggest that the shared
   and widespread nature of forced marriage and post-genocide community
   support may play a role in leading to positive family relationships in
   the context of unwanted unions.},

   Anti-Semitic Incidents},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades alone, the United States has suffered well
   over ten thousand religion-motivated hate crimes. While racism and
   religion-motivated prejudice have received considerable attention
   following the ``Unite the Right{''} rally in Charlottesville that
   resulted in deadly violence, there is little systematic scholarship
   evaluating where and when incidents targeting ethnoreligious minorities
   by non-state actors are likely to occur. Utilizing the FBI's reported
   anti-Semitic hate crime data from 2001-2014, my main theoretical and
   empirical exercise is to determine which factors best explain where and
   when American ethnoreligious groups are likely to be targeted. I propose
   that there are four essential mechanisms necessary to explain variation
   in minority targeting: ``opportunity{''} (target group concentration),
   ``distinguishability{''} (target group visibility), ``stimuli{''}
   (events increasing target group salience) and ``organization{''} (hate
   group quantity). My models show that variables falling within each of
   these theoretical concepts significantly explain variation in
   anti-Semitic incidents in the United States. Of particular importance
   for scholars and practitioners alike, Israeli military operations and
   the number of active hate groups within a state play a major role in
   explaining anti-Semitic incident variation.},

Abstract = {What strategies will states pursue in managing their relations with more
   powerful neighbours? International Relations scholarship identifies a
   wide range of policy options open to ``secondary states,{''} including
   soft balancing, bandwagoning and institutional binding. We provide a
   conceptual framework to distinguish between these similar and often
   conflated institutional strategies on the basis of two dimensions:
   threat perception and inclusiveness. We then apply this framework to the
   inter-American system. Analyzing original data on treaty action between
   1946 and 2015, we find that secondary states' adherence to multilateral
   agreements increases when the United States participates and when states
   do not perceive the hegemon to be a threat. These findings suggest that
   institutional binding captures the dynamics of inter-American
   cooperation more adequately than either soft balancing or bandwagoning:
   states balance against perceived threats but bind their friends.},

Abstract = {The importance of citizen deliberation in democracy is widely recognized
   today and the current digitalized and more fragmented society may
   benefit from discussions among people with diverse opinions in a
   well-organized setting. At the same time, concerns have also been raised
   about inequality in deliberative participation. We narrowed our focus to
   gender equality and examined whether introducing an evidence-driven
   style of deliberation can mitigate gender inequality in policy
   deliberation. In our repeated measure (within-subjects) experiment,
   university students in Japan discussed divisive policy issues during two
   sessions. Half of the participants started the discussion by examining
   factual information about the topic (evidence-driven style) and the
   other half started the discussion by expressing opinions about the topic
   (verdict-driven style). In the second session, the two groups switched
   styles. We found a statistically significant gender gap in participatory
   contribution for the verdict-driven style, but no such gap existed for
   the evidence-driven style. Using causal mediation analysis, we also
   found that, compared with the verdict-driven style, the evidence-driven
   style of deliberation reduces the gender gap by lowering women's
   tendency to agree with men. One possible explanation from the viewpoint
   of gendered communication is that women were more confident in
   evidence-driven deliberations. This psychological effect is a factor
   that is harder for facilitators to control and thus the evidence-driven
   style can be effective even with the presence of facilitators. This
   paper demonstrates the importance of studying how deliberations are
   conducted and how deliberation styles can affect the content and the
   consequences of policy deliberations.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to demonstrate that there are both ethical and
   practical considerations for enabling refugees to manage the coronavirus
   disease (COVID-19 pandemic). Given that a majority of refugees live in
   highly congested environments, particularly urban areas, an outbreak
   would swiftly spread through their local communities. Our argument is
   twofold: (i) That a new approach is needed to cope with the COVID-19
   pandemic -one that recognizes mounting challenges facing refugees and
   relies on international cooperation rather than the myopic rhetoric and
   sentiments of xenophobic right-wing politicians; (ii) That helping
   refugees to curb the spread of the current coronavirus cannot be
   divorced from social contexts, hence the necessity of improving
   employment, basic health services, and educational opportunities for
   refugees.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to examine Hartmut Rosa's account of
   `resonance'. To this end, the analysis is divided into four parts. The
   first part elucidates the concept ofresonance, including Rosa's
   differentiation between horizontal, diagonal, and vertical `axes of
   resonance' and their role in the construction of different
   `world-relations'. The second part centres on the concept ofalienation,
   notably the degree to which it constitutes an integral element of modern
   life forms and, in a larger sense, of the human condition. The third
   part grapples with the dialectic ofresonance and alienation, shedding
   light on the assumption that they are antithetical to each other, while
   contending that their in-depth study provides normative parameters to
   distinguish between `the good life' and `the bad life'. The final part
   scrutinizes Rosa's attempt to defend his outline of a sociological
   theory of resonance against objections raised by hiscriticsand comprises
   a point-by-pointassessmentof his plea for a resonance-focused sociology
   of world-relations. The paper concludes by suggesting that,
   notwithstanding its limitations, Rosa's approach represents one of the
   most promising developments in twenty-first-century critical theory.},

Abstract = {One reform considered for increasing voter turnout rates is to lower the
   voting age to 16 years old. Advocates of such a reform argue that young
   people would vote for the first time while they are still in school and
   living with their parents, which would provide a social context that is
   supportive of their electoral participation. However, opponents argue
   that 16- and 17-year-olds are not mature enough to take part in
   elections. Using data from a 2018 Quebec election survey that included a
   subsample of individuals aged 16 and 17, this study provides mixed
   evidence for both arguments.},

Abstract = {Academic research focuses on political communication of populist radical
   right parties and on their discourses about the political mainstream.
   Yet, we know less about how the political mainstream talks about radical
   right populists. Scholars assume a demonisation of populist radical
   right parties by the mainstream, which portrays the far-right outsiders
   as Nazis or fascists. This study assesses whether demonising discourses
   are indeed a common communicative element of Western European mainstream
   parties by analysing parties' messages on Twitter in ten Western
   European countries during election campaigns. The findings indicate that
   demonising discourses are not as widespread as assumed in the literature
   but occur exclusively among some centre-left parties. In the article it
   is argued that historical contexts (experiences with fascist rule) and
   electoral breakthrough of radical right parties might explain why
   certain centre-lefts demonise their far-right competitors while others
   do not.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Philadelphia is the poorest, large city in the United States, with
   approximately 26\% of the population living below the poverty line (Pew,
   2018). Consequently, the city also has some of the highest rates of food
   insecurity across the nation. To address this need, Philadelphia has a
   robust anti-hunger community that fills the gap where government
   programs prove insufficient. Nevertheless, the anti-hunger community has
   been limited in its ability to effectively reduce the rate of food
   insecurity among Philadelphian households. Based on interviews with
   forty-two leaders of Philadelphia's anti-hunger community, we argue that
   the concept of ``scarcity{''} best explains how community leaders are
   making decisions in Philadelphia. The lack of resources in the
   anti-hunger community means that community leaders must focus the
   majority of their attention on feeding the poor. We contend that this
   focus on providing food comes at the expense of time and energy that
   could be directed at political and structural changes that might reduce
   the number of people who are hungry in the first place. We identify two
   barriers that have impeded an efficient, coordinated effort to reduce
   food insecurity in Philadelphia: 1) time spent responding to the state
   political climate; and 2) competition for resources in a scarce
   environment.},

Abstract = {What is the role of legislative term limits in the structure of
   legislative institutions? Using Mooney's collective action problem
   theoretical framework on legislative leadership power, I claim that
   legislative term limits should be a key determinant in a state Speaker's
   power via the delegation of institutional tools that control the
   lawmaking process. Speakers can use these tools to influence policy
   outcomes and their colleagues. I test this expectation in an analysis of
   lower chamber rules in nearly all states between 1981 and 2015. The
   results indicate that states with implemented term limits are associated
   with a more powerful Speaker. These findings suggest that a more nuanced
   relationship between legislative term limits and leadership power exist
   than previously thought.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual (FM 3-24) has
   received near-universal praise for stabilizing Iraq. Yet few have
   examined whether FM 3-24 is generalizable to other conflicts. This paper
   explores this question, assessing its applicability to the war in the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo's North and South Kivu provinces.
   Although FM 3-24 offers useful historical insights on counterinsurgency
   that are largely applicable to the Kivu Conflict, both the Congolese
   government and the UN peacekeeping mission face notable political
   constraints that would undermine their ability to operationalize its
   prescriptions.},

Abstract = {Censorship has traditionally been understood as a way for dictators to
   silence opposition. By contrast, this article develops and tests the
   theory that certain forms of censorship-in particular, prohibitions on
   popular culture-serve not only to limit political information but also
   to reward dictators' supporters. Using text analysis of all 8,000 films
   reviewed for distribution during Chile's dictatorship, I demonstrate
   that rather than focusing only on sensitive political topics, censors
   banned movies containing content considered immoral. Through a
   combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence, I show that these
   patterns cannot be explained by masked political content, distributor
   self-censorship, or censor preferences. Instead, they reflect the
   regime's use of censorship as a reward for supporters, particularly
   conservative Catholic groups. My findings suggest that even repressive
   measures can be used in part to maintain support for authoritarian
   regimes.},

Abstract = {The political culture literature is afflicted with an orientational and
   attitudinal bias in which cultural dynamics reign supreme, while
   political values and beliefs are relegated as an epiphenomenon. The
   present article arrogates the `political' as the superior analytical
   variable in estimating political culture in Pakistan. While political
   culture studies attend to the behavioural methodology focused on
   individual cultural attitudes and orientations towards the political
   system, analysis of Pakistan's political culture is attempted at the
   meso-level, that is, political parties and is in this sense a top-bottom
   approach. A seminal focus on political parties attends to a major gap in
   the political culture literature: the non-attention to agency. That is,
   while the literature thrives on cultural attitudes and orientations that
   feed into the political system, it is largely silent on the much
   thornier question of how such attitudes and orientations are engendered
   in the public sphere in the first place. In this sense, the article
   attributes agency to political parties as shaping and influencing
   political culture, that is, how do people view and think about politics
   in the country. Finally, in conformity with the political culture
   literature, the fact that political culture is never uniform and
   homogenous rather stratified into various competing political
   sub-cultures is brought out with respect to three mainstream political
   parties in Pakistan as manifested in their 2018 election manifestoes.
   Because political parties are ideational agents that shape beliefs and
   values in the public sphere, it makes sense to deep dive into
   competitive political sub-cultures placing `politics' at the core of
   political culture analysis.},

Abstract = {In nineteenth-century United States politics, vote buying was
   commonplace. Nowadays, vote buying seems to have declined. The
   quantitative empirical literature emphasizes vote buying, ignoring the
   micro-dynamics of vote selling. We seem to know that vote buyers can no
   longer afford this strategy; however, we do not know what American
   voters would do if offered the chance to sell their vote. Would they
   sell, and at what price, or would they consistently opt out of vote
   selling? A novel experimental dataset representative at the national
   level comprises 1479 US voters who participated in an online list
   experiment in 2016, and the results are striking: Approximately 25\%
   would sell their vote for a minimum payment of \$418. Democrats and
   Liberals are more likely to sell, while education or income levels do
   not seem to impact the likelihood of vote selling.},

Abstract = {Shifting racial dynamics in the U.S. have heightened the salience of
   White racial identity, and a sense that Whites' social status and
   resources are no longer secure. At the same time, the growing size of
   non-White populations has also renewed attention to skin color-based
   stratification and the potential blurring of racial boundaries. We
   theorize that Whites with darker skin will be motivated to protect the
   boundaries of Whiteness due to the loss of status they would face from
   blurring racial boundaries. Consistent with growing evidence of skin
   color's importance for Whites, we demonstrate that darker-skinned
   Whites-measured via a light-reflectance spectrophotometer-identify more
   strongly with their White racial identity and are more likely to hold
   conservative political views on racialized issues than lighter-skinned
   Whites. Together, these findings offer new insights into the evolving
   meaning of race and color in American politics.},

Abstract = {Whose voter registration requires further verification and why? And why
   are some prospective registrants left out from voter records? These
   questions can uncover challenges in the voter registration process, and
   potential implementation issues with federal and state law. In this
   article, I analyze ``on hold{''} voter registration applications
   processed between November 2007 and September 2008 in Florida's
   Hillsborough and Miami-Dade Counties. I evaluate why individuals were
   left out of the voter rolls, by matching their records to snapshots of
   the counties' voter records from December 2008. I find that ``on
   hold{''} applicants face persistent challenges in successfully
   registering to vote, particularly depending on when they attempt to
   register and what type of information they omit from a voter
   registration application.},

Title = {When ethnic prejudice is political: an experiment in beliefs and

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {When the immigration issue has been strongly politicized, prejudice
   toward minority out-groups can be profoundly imbued with politics, to
   the point that citizen responses to partisan cues about immigrants tend
   to operate on the basis of a `political sympathy/antipathy bias'. This
   article demonstrates that there is a direct causal relation between the
   nature (i.e. contents and sources) of political communication over
   immigrants and voters' responses. Drawing on an experimental design
   based on ITANES (Italian National Election Studies) 2018 election survey
   data, it isolates the effect that the voters' ideology and party
   alignments, as well as the partisan source of a message, exert on
   manifestations of ethnic prejudice, operationalized as the refusal to
   accept a plausibile and counter-stereotypical statement about
   immigrants. It concludes that even a mere symbolic change in
   communication by those party actors (i.e. the League) which `own' the
   issue would suffice to attenuate hostility toward out-groups, to the
   extent that it results from sustained partisan rhetoric and
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {In this article, I critically reassess Iris Marion Young's late works,
   which centre on the distinction between liability and social connection
   responsibility. I concur with Young's diagnosis that structural
   injustices call for a new conception of responsibility, but I reject
   several core assumptions that underpin her distinction between two
   models and argue for a different way of conceptualising responsibility
   to address structural injustices. I show that Young's categorical
   separation of guilt and responsibility is not supported by the writings
   of Hannah Arendt, which Young draws on, and that it is also untenable on
   independent systematic grounds. Furthermore, I argue that several of
   Young's other criteria fail to clearly demarcate two distinct phenomena.
   I therefore propose to transcend Young's distinction between two models
   in favour of a related, but conceptually different distinction between
   two forms of responsibility: interactional and structural. Embracing
   this terminology facilitates the conceptualisation of the general
   features of responsibility that are shared by both forms, including
   their retrospective and prospective time-direction and their
   applicability to individual, joint and group agency. The distinction
   between interactional and structural responsibility also yields a more
   compelling general account of the role of background structures, and of
   blame within ascriptions of political responsibility.},

Abstract = {The increase in the level of awareness and knowledge of public officials
   and senior managers of the community about the need to formulate an
   appropriate public cultural policy indicates its role and importance in
   improving social life. This research was established with the main
   objective of identifying the components of the implementation of
   cultural policies. The descriptive survey was used methodologically and
   the data collection instrument was a questionnaire with the statistical
   population, including experts, which was carried out using the two-step
   Delphi method. The statistical population of experts included cultural
   managers and university professors in the field of management and policy
   formulation. The sampling was non-random and deliberate, with 7
   interviews carried out. Based on Delphi's two-stage results, panel
   member consensus, and achievement of theoretical saturation, experts
   identified 44 components. In conclusion, the results also showed that
   the dimensions of ``management factors{''} and ``software{''} had the
   highest average and the dimensions of ``structural factors{''} and
   ``activation of cultural centers in the university{''} had the lowest
   range.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the exercise of public spending in
   health programs in Mexico, in the presence of the CoVid19 pandemic. The
   context of public resources allocated to health programs is explained,
   at the time of emergence of the pandemic and the question is answered:
   How were public resources for health allocated, in the context of the
   pandemic, in the entities of the Mexican Republic? The hypothesis from
   which it is based suggests that there were not enough resources to
   attend, with quality, the repercussions of the pandemic in our country
   and that the distribution of resources followed inertial criteria and
   population size (among others), maintained inequity towards the
   inhabitants of the entities of the Republic. The findings found show a
   real decrease in spending on personnel in the health sector in 2020, as
   well as a higher per capita and total spending in the states with more
   population and more relevant economic activity. Although the
   Contribution Fund for Health Services (FASSA, for its acronym in
   Spanish), seeks to compensate for the inertial inequities in federal
   health spending, it does so in a restricted manner. This work is the
   result of a quantitative, exploratory, and descriptive research that
   takes the databases of the Government of Mexico on CoVid19, the Timely
   Finance System of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the State
   Public Finance System, the Economic Census and the INEGI Population
   Counts. The INFOSTAT statistical program was used to process the
   information, performing hypothesis tests and linear regression
   exercises.},

Abstract = {This text compares the repressive policies that the states of Chile and
   Argentina are applying to the Mapuche people. To do that, it proposes
   the concept of securitization process of the Mapuche territorial demand.
   The comparing is made from three axes: i) the stigmatization -and
   criminalization in terms of ``terrorist threatness{''}-; ii) the
   judicialization of activists; and iii) the militarization of the
   territory. In addition to highlighting divergences and convergences
   presented by the two repressive places, the article concludes that, to
   end these policies, it is necessary to simultaneously operate on the
   three aspects of the security process.},

Abstract = {To what extent do consumers' preferences change when they learn about
   firms' partisan allegiances? We address this question by conducting a
   series of experiments in which Democrats and Republicans were presented
   with factual information about corporate political donations. Outcomes
   were measured through expressed shopping intentions as well as a
   revealed consumer preference. Respondents became significantly more
   (less) likely to patronize chains that support (oppose) their party. The
   effects are found for both convenience samples and representative
   national samples and when information is conveyed in the context of a
   survey or unobtrusively via direct mail. Effects are especially large
   among those with strong partisan attachments. We conclude by arguing
   that the potential for partisan consumerism has risen with the advent of
   social media but may be undermined by a campaign finance system that
   increasingly allows for undisclosed corporate donations.},

Abstract = {Globalization has been one of the biggest driving forces of the last
   half century. There has been substantial disagreement about the impact
   that increased international integration has on income inequality.
   Though most agree that globalization positively affects economic output,
   it is no surprise that it leads to relative winners and losers within
   nations. The question that remains is where in the income distribution
   are these relative gains and losses occurring? We offer a broader
   picture of globalization's effects on inequality by using a dynamic
   compositional approach to test the impact of globalization and relative
   factor endowments on the composition of income. Using data from four
   countries, we model the effects of globalization on quantiles of the
   income distribution. Our findings suggest that globalization has
   substantial (and divergent) effects across income strata, and that these
   effects differ across nations based on relative factor endowments.},

Abstract = {Rules design the field of political actors and condition their
   strategies. For the implementation of democratic and republican
   principles, legislation needs to be clear, consistent and consistently
   applied. However, since the 1988 Constitution, Brazil has lived a
   constant instability in the standards governing election. In view of
   this situation, this work intends to review how the various changes in
   electoral legislation from the 1988 Constitution to the most recent one
   in 2017 have drawn the rules of the electoral game with respect to
   political propaganda. It is assumed that the regulation drastically
   reduced street advertising and was transferred to the digital field,
   leading to a decrease in information. The analysis is carried out with a
   descriptive methodology, comparing changes in the revised laws, which
   occurred between 1992 and 2017.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {Do politicians demand change if party support is slipping in opinion
   polls? If so, should a party change its program or just the way it
   communicates with voters? To investigate this, we conducted a survey
   experiment with 1236 Swedish politicians. We exposed them to a frame in
   which their party was losing in the polls, or a frame in which their
   party was gaining in the polls without using deception. Our results
   demonstrate that losing politicians seek change, both in terms of
   program and communication. However, the effects of the most recent polls
   are typically stronger than our experimental treatment. Along those
   lines we also find that politicians who are losing in recent polls, but
   not in our experimental treatment, favor ideological radicalization more
   than moderation or staying put. With these results our study paper
   speaks to the discussion on how representation is achieved and whether
   opinion polls are good or bad for democracy.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {The article shows that Germany established a short-lived but fully
   operative parliamentary system of government in its first democratically
   elected national parliament in 1848 some 70 years earlier than usually
   assumed. Qualitative evidence shows that the cabinet was responsible to
   the assembly and that parliamentary majorities forced cabinets to
   resign. Roll-call analysis reveals behavioural patterns that are typical
   for parliamentary government such as high party unity, cohesive voting
   by the governing coalition and substantially higher success rates for
   cabinet parties. These findings challenge claims of a `German
   exceptionalism' and demonstrate the danger of hindsight bias in reading
   historical processes of parliamentarisation backwards. Instead, they
   suggest that successful parliamentarisation critically depends on the
   balance of power between democratic and autocratic forces and the degree
   to which old elites can be integrated in the new democratic order.},

   developed with reference to aspects of works by both Jurgen Habermas and
   the young Hegel, and to examine them according to the propositions of
   Rene Girard's mimetic theory. In sum, we intend to demonstrate how the
   mimetic hypothesis can be applied to the theories related to the
   struggle for recognition. Thus, it aims to contribute to the
   construction of the ethical foundations which are necessary for social
   reconciliation. Comprised in the field of philosophy of law, the paper
   follows the analytical and comparative method of the authors under
   study. Moreover, it seeks to develop a dialectical synthesis of the
   theories of recognition and mimesis, based on common theoretical
   foundations (Hegel and Freud).},

Abstract = {This research note examines the connection between portfolio and the
   individual popularity of ministers as measured in opinion polls. It is
   an ongoing challenge for political science to derive measures of
   portfolio salience. In this research note, portfolio popularity is
   measured in Denmark for the period 1978 to 2019 for 24 different
   portfolios. Though we know little about it, it is often stated that
   popularity is important for ministers. If this is the case, popularity
   is a relevant supplement to studies of portfolio salience. The results
   show that there are significant differences in how different portfolios
   have been assessed by voters, which is an important point in itself.
   This shows a clear hierarchy within cabinet. The results are discussed
   in relation to ministerial durability, portfolio salience and issue
   ownership. It is suggested that cross national studies of portfolio
   popularity should be carried out.},

Abstract = {This article explores the Cold War history of the Australia-U.S.
   alliance, and then uses this knowledge to contextualise more recent
   developments in the bilateral relationship. At several crucial moments
   in the first half of the Cold War, Australia disagreed with the U.S.
   about the wisdom of its policy toward China, and worked to moderate
   Washington's aggressive impulses. However, from the 1960s onwards,
   Australian leaders began to internalise a schema of alliance loyalty:
   they believed that only loyalty to the U.S. would ensure reciprocal
   loyalty from Washington. Although events have challenged the validity of
   this hypothesis, it became a powerful and pervasive influence which led,
   over time, to Canberra thinking less carefully about the costs and
   benefits of prospective alliance action. This intellectual lethargy
   explains why Canberra has found it difficult to adapt to a period of
   more intense strategic competition between China and the U.S today.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the global phenomenon of anti-Soros conspiracy
   theories, focusing on the Central European region between 2017 and 2019.
   It surveys how these theories have been employed by two populist
   leaders, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Robert Fico in Slovakia. It further
   discusses these leaders' motivations for developing conspiracy
   narratives and the channels through which they spread them. The author
   argues that the usage and effectiveness of anti-Soros conspiracy
   narratives in influencing political supporters and the general
   population has been determined by the type of crisis during which
   leaders have found themselves and the degree of concentration of power
   in their hands respectively. The article is distinguished from most of
   the academic literature on conspiracy theories by focusing on
   `mainstream' populist leaders, instead of extremist political parties or
   authoritarian regimes that often use conspiracy theories as well.},

Abstract = {Campaign finance contributions may influence policy by affecting
   elections or influencing the choices of politicians once in office. To
   study the trade-offs between these two paths to influence, we use a game
   in which contributions may affect electoral outcomes and signal
   policy-relevant information to politicians. In the model, a campaign
   donor and two politicians each possess private information correlated
   with a policy-relevant state of the world. The donor may allocate his or
   her budget to either an ally candidate who has relatively similar
   preferences or a moderate candidate whose preferences are relatively
   divergent from the donor's preferred policy. Contributions that increase
   the likelihood of the moderate being elected can signal good news about
   the donor's preferred policy and influence the moderate's policy choice.
   However, when the electoral effect of contributions is too small to
   demand sufficiently high costs to deter imitation by groups with
   negative information, this informational effect breaks down.},

Abstract = {Why do some fragile states collapse while others do not? This article
   presents results from a comparative analysis of the causes of state
   collapse. Using a dataset of 15 cases of state collapse between 1960 and
   2007, we conduct both synchronic and diachronic comparisons with two
   different control groups of fragile states using crisp-set QCA. The
   results support our hypothesis that state collapse has multiple causes.
   The militarization of political groups, when combined with other
   conditions, plays a major part in the process. Other causal factors are
   political transition, extreme poverty, declining government resources or
   external aid, factionalist politics, repression and pre-colonial
   polities. This challenges structuralist explanations focusing on regime
   types and the resource curse, among other things, and opens up avenues
   for further research.},

Abstract = {Demands for a second Scottish independence referendum have persisted
   since 2014. The Scottish government introduced the Referendums
   (Scotland) Bill at Holyrood in May 2019 to enable referendums within the
   competence of the Scottish parliament. The Scottish National Party (SNP)
   government presented this as a framework enabling a range of
   referendums. Opponents saw this as legislating for a second independence
   referendum. The act will form a large part of the legal framework and
   rules for any second independence referendum. Importantly, the
   legislation provides innovation in electoral law more generally. This
   article discusses the background to the bill, its initial contents, and
   debates around and amendments to the bill. It discusses its electoral
   law innovations, before considering its limitations and place as
   constitutional debates play out over a second independence referendum.},

Title = {Veto Threat Bargaining with a Bicameral Congress},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {628-644},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {According to the conventional view, presidents are largely bereft of
   influence with an opposition-controlled Congress. Congress sends them
   legislation with a ``take it or leave it{''} choice that maximizes the
   preferences of the opposition majority while minimizing presidents'
   preferences. To extricate themselves from this bind, presidents threaten
   vetoes. Past research suggests that their efforts largely fail, however,
   for two model-driven reasons: first, veto threats amount to minimally
   informative ``cheap talk,{''} and second, Congress is a unitary actor
   with firm control over its agenda. We relax both assumptions, bringing
   veto rhetoric into a setting more closely resembling real-world
   conditions. Presidents transmit credible veto threats to a
   heterogeneous, bicameral Congress where chamber rules enable the
   minority party to wield some influence over legislation. Examining the
   legislative histories of all veto-threatened bills passed between 1985
   and 2016, we confirm that veto threats ward off about half of
   veto-targeted legislative provisions-a far greater share than for
   comparable unthreatened provisions. The House of Representatives is more
   likely to introduce and pass legislation objectionable to presidents and
   the Senate is more likely to accommodate presidents, findings consistent
   with the textbook description of the modern bicameral Congress.},

Abstract = {While political accountability requires that voters can form an accurate
   picture of government performance, public evaluations of government
   performance in established democracies are often distorted by partisan
   considerations. We test whether the same factors bias evaluations of
   government performance in a new democracy where partisanship is less
   stable and defined. This analysis estimates individual-level models of
   retrospective national economic evaluations in South Korea's 2017
   presidential election. South Korea has unstable party politics, low
   levels of party institutionalization, and high levels of public distrust
   in political parties. Yet even in this context we find that voters'
   economic evaluations are significantly affected by political loyalties
   such as party identification. This endogeneity is sufficiently large
   that it results in aggregate consumer evaluations of the economy that
   systematically vary across regions depending upon the relationship of
   the president to that region. The findings confirm that party
   identification shapes citizen opinions even in a context where its
   effect would likely be weak.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of two different social housing systems
   on housing-market characteristics and affordability using a case study
   of Berlin and Vienna. Despite comparable framework conditions, both
   cities pursued very different social housing policies. While both cities
   are currently challenged by growing populations and rising house prices,
   we show that Vienna is more successful in providing affordable housing
   as it has created effective institutions to attract and retain private
   actors in this sector. In Berlin, in contrast, the current crisis
   reveals the lack of institutional capacity to actively pursue housing
   policy. We argue that different housing market outcomes can be
   attributed to fundamental differences in the organisation of social
   housing provision reflecting divergent state-market relations. While in
   Berlin social housing has been seen as a provisional measure to correct
   temporary market imbalances, Vienna's continuous state participation in
   the housing market has created a framework of balanced rights and
   responsibilities for social and private actors to achieve social policy
   goals. Differences in funding arrangements and institutional
   embeddedness influence not only housing outcomes but also feedback on
   the state's capacity to intervene successfully in housing markets.},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates how a hegemonic party learns from its early
   missteps to become an adept social media user, competing and expanding
   its digital influence. Singapore's long-standing People's Action Party
   (PAP) government has extended existing laws and co-opted social media as
   an information tool to shape public opinion and repress dissent. Its
   digital innovations include hiring social media consultants, ``Internet
   Brigade{''} and ``influencers{''} to soft-sell public policies and
   counter anti-establishment online comments. Based on a comparative
   analysis of four Facebook activities of four key political parties over
   the last decade, this study finds Facebook use to have raised electoral
   competitiveness, albeit temporarily. Singapore's evolving legal
   framework, coordinated media strategy and lack of transparency governing
   digital campaign tools enabled the PAP to overtake the opposition
   parties in expanding social network. Singapore demonstrates how digital
   authoritarianism can be advanced in subtle, covert ways.},

Abstract = {This critical commentary discusses Stephan Lessenich's recent work on
   democracy. It argues that-to understand the structural boundaries of
   welfare capitalist democracy-we must critically unearth the limits of
   liberal democracy. This article first maintains that the absence of an
   economic democratization dimension is an outcome of liberal democracy's
   shrinking of the meaning of the political. It next claims that defining
   democracy in terms of rights does not duly consider how these unfolded
   historically and recently, nor clarifies their relation with negative
   freedom. The article then contends that the environmentally destructive
   dialectic of democracy and the belittlement of reproductive work stem
   from the constitution of a narrowly defined economic sphere, from which
   ``reproductive activities{''} are excluded. Finally, the text reflects
   on what ``democratizing democracy{''} should entail.},

   Canada's plan to slow the spread of COVID-19. The success of these
   measures hinges on public support, which cannot be taken for granted as
   the orders induce considerable economic pain. As governments consider
   when to re-open the economy, one relevant variable is when the public
   expects the economy to re-open. At minimum, if public perceptions differ
   from government plans then additional government messaging is required
   to better align expectations.},

Abstract = {We expose the way the market evaluates internal political risk and
   instability in democratic polities by analysing the determinants of
   sovereign spreads of EU member states over the course of the past two
   decades. Our analysis builds on the ``democratic advantage{''} argument
   which suggests democracies enjoy preferential treatment on the
   international market of sovereign debt because of their better ability
   to make credible commitments. We suggest that, when it comes to the
   market's evaluation of internal political instability and risk in
   democratic polities, there actually exists a ``consolidated democracy
   advantage{''}. In times of political instability, older and more
   consolidated democracies pay less of a premium on their debt than their
   younger and less consolidated counterparts. In other words, the market
   indeed views the commitment of consolidated democracies with long track
   records of democratic competition and survival as something
   qualitatively different than the commitment of new democracies with
   short track records.},

Abstract = {In the face of the trend toward more participatory candidate nomination
   methods, studies increasingly focus on its consequences for the
   selection outcome. Yet, this string of literature has brought to light
   some inconsistent findings. They do not surprise given the complexity of
   selection decisions and the dependence of nomination results on the set
   of who is running for a candidacy. Drawing on representative survey data
   collected before the 2017 Bundestag election, the article looks at the
   potential implications of different procedures by examining how the
   selection criteria of membership and delegate conferences vary. It shows
   that both selectorate types differ as to process-related selection
   criteria but less regarding candidate-related features. More
   specifically, membership conferences can be associated with more open
   decisions as their participants attach less importance to coordination
   mechanisms like leadership proposals. At the same time, they less
   consider the external consequences of their choices since criteria that
   increase a candidate's chances to enter parliament play a smaller role
   than among delegates. The study points to implications of inclusive
   procedures which might not be desired by the party leadership and may
   not serve the party's electoral interests in the worst case.},

Abstract = {International courts, like domestic courts, protect liberal limits on
   majoritarianism. This sometimes puts these courts in a position to
   protect the property rights of the ``corrupt elites{''} that are
   targeted by populists or the civil liberties of those who are targeted
   in domestic populist identity politics. Moreover, populism offers an
   ideology to attack the authority of a court rather than just its
   individual rulings. An empirical examination illustrates the
   plausibility of this argument. A large number of backlashes against
   international courts arise from judgments that reinforce local populist
   mobilization narratives. Populist backlashes against international
   courts are not just about sovereignty but often follow efforts to curb
   domestic courts, usually for similar reasons. Yet populist backlashes do
   not always succeed, either because populist leaders do not follow up on
   their exit threats or because populism is too thin an ideology for
   creating successful multilateral reform coalitions.},

Abstract = {The recall referendum - a referendum triggered by citizens seeking to
   remove elected officials by means of a binding vote - used to be a rare
   institution, but since the 1990s has spread in different areas of the
   world. The frequency of its activation has been explained by three sets
   of sometimes interconnected variables: growing citizen dissatisfaction,
   institutional design (i.e. ease of activation), and the activity of
   political parties using the mechanism against their opponents, specially
   in contexts of low party-system institutionalization. This article
   proposes an additional variable: the role of electoral management bodies
   (EMBs) in allowing or preventing recall attempts. The empirical analysis
   focuses on the Ecuadorian experience, where legal provisions governing
   recall were introduced in 1998, modified in 2008, and amended in 2011,
   with a dramatic variation in the frequency of recall activations after
   each change.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {How strong are societal cues - understood as the linkage between
   heuristics present in society and the object of evaluation - compared to
   elite cues in influencing citizens' attitudes toward international
   politics? Our general argument is that societal cues have so far been
   underestimated in their effectiveness. More specifically, we argue that
   societal cues may have a direct effect or significantly diminish the
   effect of elite cues even in authoritarian contexts, when both cues are
   used at the same time. To test our hypotheses, we turn to cueing effects
   on citizens' UN attitudes in two Middle Eastern countries: Saudi Arabia
   and Jordan. First, we depict that anti-Americanism is a significant and
   substantial heuristic in shaping Arab attitudes toward the UN.
   Thereafter, the results of a self-administered survey experiment show
   that governmental cues significantly and substantially affect public UN
   favorability. While cueing citizens with a heuristic linking the US to
   the UN has no direct effect in itself, it substantially weakens the
   effect of the governmental cues when both are employed at the same time.
   We outline the important implications of these findings at the end of
   the article.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Despite abundant attention to the judicial selection of U.S. Supreme
   Court justices, most federal legal disputes are resolved in the lower
   federal courts. Who the judges are and how they make their decisions
   matters enormously in a democracy that values the fair and equitable
   treatment of its citizens under the rule of law. Our focus in this study
   is on the demographic diversity of President Obama's appointments to the
   lower federal bench. It is clear from the various methods of examining
   the numbers that Obama valued diversity - perhaps more so than any
   previous president. When we examine all lower courts in the aggregate,
   and then district and circuit courts separately, the total number of
   successful nominees, the replacement patterns for departing judges, and
   comparisons between active and senior status judges, we see a concerted
   and largely successful effort to increase symbolic representation on the
   federal judiciary. Under different political circumstances, the data
   would lead us to consider novel complexities in diversifying the federal
   bench in the next several years. But a Trump presidency and its expected
   focus on ideology over diversity is likely to lead the study of judicial
   selection in a different direction, at least for the time being.},

Abstract = {Studies have shown how women are underrepresented in senior executive
   positions in public and private organizations. Equal representation
   matters both for reasons of performance and legitimacy, and, to
   understand the mechanisms behind the glass ceiling, we explore if the
   women making it to the top of the Danish civil service differ from the
   men who do so. We want to understand if senior executive positions
   require something different of women than men. Using a dataset
   consisting of the entire career trajectory of all senior civil servants
   in Denmark, we find that, on numerous human capital dimensions, the
   women and men making it to the top are quite similar, for example, in
   terms of tenure and educational level. However, we find on the one hand
   that men are more often employed in the most prestigious departments
   and, at the same time, it seems that men with a profile deviating from
   the norm are more likely to make it to the top than women. This may
   indicate that the most prestigious positions - also in terms of
   early-career positions - are less accessible to women, and that women
   are less willing to apply for jobs outside their usual domain, or that
   those responsible for recruitment are less willing to take a chance on a
   woman with a slightly unorthodox profile. Hence, our study indicates
   that greater interest should be paid to the dynamics keeping women at
   lower levels of the hierarchy and possibly to encourage them to apply
   for top positions.},

Abstract = {Political realists reject the view that politics is applied morality.
   But they also usually claim that judgements about political legitimacy
   are normative. Where, then, does this normativity come from? So far,
   realists have given two answers: `concessive realism', which identifies
   legitimacy as a norm internal to political practice while delegating to
   morality the task of explaining why this practice is valuable; and
   `naturalist realism', which holds that alternatives to legitimate
   politics are not `real options' for anyone. I argue that concessive
   realism should be rejected because it neglects the importance of the
   realist critique of morality. I also argue that naturalist realism
   should be rejected because alternatives to legitimate politics remain
   `real options' for some people. I conclude with some thoughts on how a
   plausible account of the normative force of realist legitimacy should
   proceed.},

Abstract = {In `What's Wrong with Colonialism,' Lea Ypi argues that the wrong of
   colonialism can be expressed as procedural wrongs, not as wronging
   territorial rights. On her view, colonial practices went wrong in two
   ways: they forced residents into political associations, and the terms
   of the political association were not established through equal and
   reciprocal negotiations. I argue that because Ypi's account successfully
   side-lines all but essential claims to territory, her theory ends up
   being vulnerable to an objection it means to avoid. Historical residents
   may be subject to unequal treatment under newly formed political
   associations because their historical patterns of land use are not
   considered to have any independent moral weight. My analysis does not
   rely on any appeal to property or territorial rights. Instead, I appeal
   to pre-existing obligations holding between residents.},

Abstract = {Which firms oppose action to fight climate change? Networks of input
   sourcing and sales to downstream customers ought to propagate and
   reinforce opposition to decarbonization beyond direct emitters of CO2.
   To test this claim, we build the largest data set of public political
   activity for and against climate action in the United States, revealing
   that the majority of corporate opposition to climate action comes from
   outside the highest-emitting industries. We construct new measures of
   the carbon intensity of firms and show that policy exposure via
   carbon-intensive inputs and sales to downstream emitters explains this
   large volume of opposition from non-emitting industries. Sixty-six
   percent of U.S. lobbying on climate policy has been conducted by an
   extended coalition of firms, associations, and other groups that have
   publicly opposed reducing carbon emissions. Public opposition to climate
   action by carbon-connected industries is therefore broad-based, highly
   organized, and matched with extensive lobbying.},

Abstract = {Sustainability concerns have been placing public policy in the power
   sector under pressure to realize a radical change. However, energy
   policy is often subject to strong path dependency and inertia that make
   such change difficult. This study contributes to the theoretical
   understanding of the conditions under which radical policy changes
   happen in the power sector, based on the Multiple Streams Approach.
   Through a case study of the Feed-in Tariff program for increasing
   renewable energy deployment in Japan, it is elucidated that the
   elevation of the generous program, which is fundamentally incompatible
   to previous policy processes, was a result of the intersection of
   problem, policy, and politics streams. The findings provide strong
   evidence to support our claim that political parties embrace a policy
   proposal that is not necessarily ``softened{''} within the policy
   network when an existing policy community itself is perceived as a
   problem.},
