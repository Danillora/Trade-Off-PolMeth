Abstract = {This paper explores the history and ongoing transformation of the South
   Sudanese Sudd marshlands as a buffer zone in a variety of subsequent
   projects of domination and their subversion. Its argument will be that
   the contemporary geopolitics of the Sudd cannot be understood properly
   without unwinding the historical layers of contestation and conflict
   around these projects of control and their reversal, projects which have
   sought to shape and have been shaped crucially by the area's specific
   ecology. For more than a century, different external ventures -
   colonial, nationalist, secessionist - encountered in the southern
   Sudanese marshlands a formidable buffer to the realization of their
   various projects of control. Ambitions of making the Nile water flow,
   establishing effective state authority, or building lines of
   communication, get stuck in the Sudd's difficult terrain. Building on
   the political ecology and wider social theory on terrain, resistance and
   warfare, we conceptualize the Sudd as a lively political ecology - one
   characterized by constant struggles and accommodations between the
   centripetal logics of state-making and the centrifugal propensities of
   vernacular political culture.},

Abstract = {As a social institution, a border simultaneously divides and connects.
   When thinking about state borders, or borderlands, scholars tend to view
   them as either linear or zonal spaces, distinguishing as well as linking
   one state with another. My article argues for an alternative
   interpretation and explores the geopolitical and cultural meanings of a
   historical border region from both domestic and inter-state
   perspectives. The border of China and Korea along the Yalu and the Tumen
   Rivers, is arguably one of the oldest state boundaries that is still
   effective today. The history of the border river region as a ``buffer
   space{''} can be traced back to the seventeenth century when Qing China
   and Choson Korea established the border along their northern frontiers.
   However, the geopolitical function of this border went beyond
   considerations of defence or communications. From the mid-seventeenth
   century to the mid-nineteenth century, both the Manchu-Qing court and
   the Choson court implemented strict laws to control domestic population
   flows to their northeastern and northern frontiers. Such policies, I
   argue, must be understood in the context of domestic politics in the two
   courts. Internal anxiety over preserving Manchu and Korean identity,
   coupled with strategy to control the border against an external power,
   contributed to the making of this borderland. Hence, the Qing-Choson
   border region served as a ``dual buffer{''}. Employing historical
   records and local gazettes in the two countries, my article reveals a
   subtler layer of ``buffer{''} from a case study in early modern East
   Asia.},

Title = {Corruption and legislature size: Evidence from Brazil},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper studies whether and how legislatures affect political
   corruption. Using a regression discontinuity design in the context of
   Brazilian municipalities, we find a positive causal impact of council
   size on corruption levels, as detected by random federal audits. This
   indicates that an extra councilor represents an additional political
   actor potentially interested in diverting public resources, which we
   define as a rent extraction effect. However, we find further evidence
   that, in some contexts, larger councils enhance the representation of
   opposition parties and effectively increase monitoring over the
   executive, attenuating the rent extraction effect. Namely, in
   municipalities where opposition parties are typically underrepresented,
   the additional seat in the council is absorbed by the opposition and
   corruption outcomes do not worsen. In addition, only in such context,
   mayors are more commonly sentenced for misconduct in office by judicial
   authorities, whose investigations anecdotally often originates from
   councilors denouncing mayors to local courts. Overall, our findings show
   that legislature size is detrimental to corruption outcomes but less so
   where the representation of opposition parties improves with the
   enlargement of the legislature.},

Title = {Malta and the 2019 EP elections - maximising popular engagement with
   ``Europe{''}},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {305-322},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse why Malta continues to
   show the highest level of turnout for European Parliament (EP) elections
   in a country where voting is not obligatory. By analysing the Maltese EP
   elections from 2004 to 2019, the paper seeks to understand why the
   Maltese engage with a second order election to the degree that they do.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper is a combination of qualitative
   and quantitative methods, first assessing the context of the 2019
   elections, the historical trends and then the factors that help explain
   why the Maltese continue to engage with EP elections. Findings The paper
   finds that the Maltese political system, highly polarised and dominated
   by two parties, primarily galvanises people to engage with elections,
   that it is more about party leadership than actual engagement with
   Europe and that second order elections in Malta are often run as first
   order elections. Originality/value This paper is the only systematic
   evaluation of the 2019 EP elections in Malta, discusses categorically
   that EP elections are rarely about Europe while also showing clearly
   that political parties can make second-order elections appear as
   first-order elections should the stakes be high enough.},

Title = {Controlling the Schengen Information System (SIS II): The
   Infrastructural Politics of Fragility and Maintenance},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {160-184},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the Schengen Information System (SIS II) - the
   largest data infrastructure supporting police cooperation and border
   controls in the European Union. Through the SIS II, national authorities
   exchange information about individuals and objects, and this across
   national and institutional boundaries. Yet, the SIS II does not always
   perform as anticipated in its design scripts. Following common threads
   about infrastructural politics across Science and Technology Studies,
   political geography and critical security studies, we explore fragility
   and maintenance as being intrinsic to the functioning of data
   infrastructures and crucial sites of governance. We show how the SIS II
   is kept under continuous control to operate as a controlling data
   infrastructure. This article contributes to a critical inquiry into the
   datafication of border controls by interrogating how data acquire the
   status of allegedly credible and accurate information. Ultimately, this
   approach pinpoints the inherent fragility of seemingly mighty data
   infrastructures and casts a light on those actors and processes that
   sustain, through maintenance, contemporary digital borders.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a critical reading of the construction and
   circulation of the Hong Kong `model' as an archetype of free-market
   governance, calling attention to two sides of the attendant modelling
   process: first, folkloric tales of the acclaimed `architect' of the
   colony's laissez-faire policy, Sir John Cowperthwaite, Financial
   Secretary during the 1960s, who has risen to cult status in free-market
   circles; and second, the production and propagation of indices of
   `economic freedom', which institutionalized Hong Kong as the paragon of
   free-market governance and the benchmark against which the world's
   economies are annually rated. Together, these long-range projects have
   worked to sustain depoliticized images of an economically dynamic and
   institutionally stable Hong Kong, ostensibly `ground-truthed' to the
   city-state but at the same time abstracted, decontextualized and
   ideologically performative. They each mobilize variants of the tabula
   rasa myth, in this case a fusion of colonial and (neo)liberal narratives
   of Hong Kong as an economic miracle founded on a `barren rock'.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {83},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Using the concept of ``friends and neighbors{''}, we attempt to answer a
   main question: Do candidates in a primary election perform best in
   territories where they benefit from many supporters among local
   representatives and partisan networks? Therefore, we collected a unique
   data set during the French right and center primary election of November
   2016. For all candidates, in addition to their political career and the
   strength of their local anchorage, we considered the sponsorships they
   received from parliament members and local representatives. After
   fleshing out these data, we included it in a multivariate analysis of
   mobilization and votes in French departmental elections. Particularly,
   we distinguished local anchorage from the ability to mobilize partisan
   resources. Our results show that both phenomena have an important impact
   on primary outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article uses qualitative content analysis to investigate the role
   of the communicative tactics used by the UK campaign group, The People's
   Assembly Against Austerity, to reach voters in the 2015 and the 2017
   general elections. It focuses on the heuristic of trust and analyses the
   language of the tactics used by the group as they campaigned against the
   policies of the governments at the time. Analysis reveals that in both
   elections The People's Assembly employed existing electoral campaigning
   strategies, such as negative campaigning and political advertising,
   alongside novel tactics such as a protest song, that were all aimed at
   the voter and sought to shine a light on the pro-austerity policies of
   the incumbent Conservative government. This pattern shows that a group
   within the broader UK anti-austerity social movement was actively
   engaging in the parliamentary political process in an attempt to
   communicate with voters. What this insight does is emphasise the role of
   social movement communication in electoral campaigning and posits the
   dimension of `social movement-voter interaction', which largely remains
   absent in both the fields of social movement research and political
   communication.},

Abstract = {Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing
   populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic
   exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been
   acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the
   evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to
   migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and
   largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a
   representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of
   real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media
   exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the
   effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral
   behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our
   analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration -
   particularly on websites and on commercial television stations -
   increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure
   to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards
   immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources
   intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result
   challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could
   serve as an antidote to selective exposure and ``echo chambers{''},
   commonly linked with radicalization of political views.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the fiscal politics of oil revenue in Brazil and
   Canada, two oil-rich federal countries that have different
   constitutional arrangements for revenue allocation and where constituent
   unit governments have different powers in the energy sector. More
   specifically, it offers a comparative analysis of the intergovernmental
   relations around oil revenue distribution in both countries over the
   last 30 years. The argument is that constitutional provisions on natural
   resources in federations (federal ownership or constituent unit
   ownership) produce distinct federal dynamics as it pertains to
   intergovernmental relations. Federal government ownership of natural
   resources produces conflicts between constituent units as they vie for
   their share of the proceeds. In contrast, provincial ownership
   eliminates the direct competition between constituent units for natural
   resource revenues. Nevertheless, intergovernmental tensions over natural
   resources can still appear as constituent units pressure the federal
   government to adopt horizontal fiscal equalization formulas friendly to
   their oil-producing, or non-oil-producing economies.},

Abstract = {Civil-military relations in Ghana have a chequered history; since the
   first coup of 1966, there had been four military takeovers of political
   power, in 1969, 1972, 1979, and 1980. Relations are thawing, as
   evidenced by the fact that there has been no overt attempt at
   overthrowing a government since 1992. This article employs a qualitative
   approach to data collection and analysis to explain civil-military
   relations in Ghana's Fourth Republic (1992-2018). It argues that there
   is agreement among three societal partners-political elites, military,
   and the citizenry on four variables; social composition of the officer
   corps, political decision-making, and recruitment and military style.
   Yet focus of the civil-military discourse has been on political elites
   and military. These two are vital to the political decision process.
   Although the third partner, the citizenry has a meaningful voice,
   military-society relations fluctuates over time. There is mixed
   perceptions among Ghanaian about the armed forces.},

Abstract = {In the face of technology failures in preventing oil from reaching
   beaches and coasts after catastrophic oil spills in the 1960s and early
   1970s, the oil industry and governmental officials needed to quickly
   reconsider their idea of prevention. Initially, prevention meant
   stopping spilled oil from coating beaches and coasts. Exploring the
   presentations at three oil-spill conferences in 1969, 1971 and 1973,
   this idea of prevention changed as the technological optimism of finding
   effective methods met the realities of oil-spill cleanup. By 1973,
   prevention meant stopping oil spills before they happened. This rapid
   policy transformation came about because the oil industry could not hide
   the visual evidence of the source of their technology failures. In this
   century, as policymakers confront invisible pollutants such as
   pesticides and greenhouse gases, considering ways to visually show the
   source of the pollution along with the effects could quicken policy
   decisions.},

Abstract = {The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) first coined the united-front
   policy in 1921, representing a promising effort to bolster Communist
   influence in the workers' movement of that country. As the first part of
   the article shows, the kpd recruited large numbers of new members and
   significantly improved its electoral returns as a result. Despite this
   success, however, the party only pursued the united-front policy in two
   phases (1921-3 and 1926). As illustrated in the second part of the
   article, the KPD bid farewell to the united front as `Stalinisation'
   began to set in during the Weimar Republic's final years - with lethal
   consequences, as its abandonment decisively abetted the victory of
   German fascism.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the empirical research on corruption in three
   ways. From a methodological viewpoint, it applies partial least
   squares-structural equation modeling to estimate an index of perceived
   corruption around the world-hereinafter structural corruption perception
   index (S-CPI). This approach allows one to estimate corruption as a
   multidimensional latent variable by complex cause-effect relationships
   between observed and/or unobserved variables. From a positive viewpoint,
   it estimates comparable S-CPI scores in 165 countries from 1995 to 2016,
   using a model specification based on existing theory of and empirics on
   the causes and consequences of corruption. In terms of policy
   implications, helpful hints on which are the most effective channels for
   fighting corruption are provided.},

Abstract = {I find that self-selection into teacher training programs in Germany is
   co-determined with ideology. Incoming teacher-trainees are more
   left-wing in ideology and political preferences than the average
   incoming university student. I find also that teacher training programs
   exert a socialization effect: as compared to the average student,
   teacher trainees' views are reinforced and they become more left-wing as
   they progress in their studies. In a third step, I use the German
   SocioEconomic Panel to compare tenured teachers' political attitudes
   with other university graduates and other civil servants, and find that
   tenured teachers are more left-wing than the average in the respective
   reference groups. I consider possible explanations for the left-wing
   orientation of teachers in the German educational system and
   implications of indoctrination and imbalance of views.},

Abstract = {Military service is a highly social-and potentially
   socializing-experience. However, the long-term social effect of military
   service is a little-studied topic, and some have dismissed any direct
   impact of service on civic participation. Using data from a large,
   national survey, our estimates show, in contrast, that the likelihood
   and intensity of group participation is higher among veterans than other
   men and that combat veterans have the highest level of participation.
   Mettler argued that education funded through the GI Bill gave veterans
   both resources ({''}civic capacity{''}) and a desire to reciprocate to
   society ({''}civic predisposition{''}) for the generous benefits they
   received, but she did not allow for the possibility that
   serviceitselfcould also increase both civic capacity and predisposition.
   Furthermore, our estimates confirm that education is strongly associated
   with higher civic participation and that the association between
   military service and participation is largely independent of education.},

Abstract = {The military service readiness of reserve soldiers is an essential
   question for countries that rely mostly on reserve units for their
   defense or other operational needs. This study examines how forms of
   capital related to the military and civilian fields are associated with
   the military service readiness of reservists. Survey data were obtained
   from 396 Estonian reservists during the 2018 Hedgehog exercise.
   Reservists' military service readiness (RMSR) was studied first with
   respect to military field-related factors, and in the next phase
   civilian field linked factors are included. In a military field,
   cultural, social, and symbolic capital have a positive influence on
   RMSR. However, if civilian field-related social and economic capital is
   included, some military capitals would lose their effect. Study outcomes
   are discussed considering Pierre Bourdieu's theory of the forms of
   capital.},

Abstract = {This paper builds upon feminist approaches within political science,
   international relations and geography that study how bodies haunt global
   politics, by exploring how entitlement to power connects through the
   scale of the body to that of the state. In a context of rising populism
   and political bluster, as well as post-\#metoo discussions of personal
   entitlement displayed by well-known political figures, there is a need
   to take seriously how discourses of statehood within security crises are
   gendered in specific ways. This paper argues that the concept of
   entitlement offers potential for geographic enquiry by opening up new
   perspectives on masculinist framings of territory and state in critical
   geopolitics and in critical international relations. It considers
   specifically how diplomatic discourses ground and naturalize claims to
   territory by showing how states' entitlement to territory and
   masculinist forms of personal entitlement are connected. Drawing upon
   feminist approaches to language, discourse and power, this paper studies
   diplomatic interventions at the United Nations Security Council in New
   York in 2014-2017 on the crisis in Ukraine. Methodologically, it
   analyses diplomatic speeches through the concept of entitlement to show
   how territorial claims are naturalized through rhetorical devices
   grounded in hegemonic forms of masculinity. It argues that a clearer
   understanding of the connections between discourses of personal
   entitlement and state territorial sovereignty can further our
   understanding of territory.},

Abstract = {Objective This article investigates whether gains in ethnic identity
   reduce pan-ethnic identity among Asian American and Pacific Islanders
   (AAPI). Methods Ordered logit regression using data from the 2016
   National Asian American Survey (NAAS). Results Gains in ethnic identity
   do not reduce pan-ethnic identity among AAPI. As importance of ethnic
   identity moves from ``not at all{''} to ``extremely,{''} log odds of
   reporting higher levels of pan-Asian identity are about three to four
   times higher. Furthermore, AAPI who value both ethnic and pan-Asian
   identities show similar support for AAPI political candidates as those
   who identify in only ethnic or only pan-Asian terms. Conclusion Identity
   politics and disaggregated AAPI data are not inherently divisive.},

Abstract = {Objective Do premigratory experiences shape the perceived need for
   racial and/or ethnic political representation? Although there is much
   literature that has examined whether a ``pan-ethnic{''} Asian-American
   identity is emerging, we test the effects of premigration experiences
   with ethnic violence on the perceived need for descriptive
   representation among Asian Americans. Methods Using the 2016 National
   Asian American Pre-Election Survey, in combination with comparative
   cross-national data, we explore the relationship between premigration
   experiences and the perceived need for racial and ethnic representation.
   Results Using both multilevel logit and a Heckman selection analyses, we
   find that premigratory experiences with violence significantly reduce
   the assessment that racial and ethnic representation is important.
   Conclusion This suggests that premigratory experiences with ethnic
   violence reduce individual assessments that racial and ethnic
   representation is important. Individuals who emigrated from countries
   that experienced ethnic violence eschew descriptive representation in
   understanding politics in the United States.},

Abstract = {In recent years, historiography has addressed the building process of
   the Francoist regime through the analysis of the war experience of Rebel
   soldiers during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). This has produced two
   main interpretations: that coercion was the primary role played by the
   army, being the indoctrination significantly subordinated to it. And,
   consequently, that a relevant ideologisation experience among Rebel
   soldiers didn't take place. From this frame, the article aims to
   question these two ideas, arguing that there was indeed a process of
   ideologisation of Rebel soldiers in which, moreover, the army played a
   crucial role. Therefore, this allows to rethink the importance of the
   army's indoctrination policies. By analysing military sources concerning
   these policies at a general and divisional level, and incorporating
   soldiers' perspectives through their war diaries, I will delve into the
   forms and topics of this propaganda, arguing that the pragmatic
   approach, more than the ideological one, was ultimately what attracted
   combatants to the New State. Moreover, this interpretation would allow
   to understand how social support towards the dictatorship was built
   among war veterans, and more generally among the whole Spanish society.},

Abstract = {Objective Prior work on the effect of combat on veterans typically
   measures combat experience as a dichotomous event. I extend work in this
   area by theorizing and empirically accounting for the number of unique
   combat experiences a veteran endures and how that associates with the
   veteran's outlook on foreign policy. Methods I utilize an original
   survey that asks for multiple types of military combat experience, as
   well as foreign policy positions. Findings Consistent with previous
   research, I find that veterans tend to be more hawkish than civilians.
   When I account for veterans' number of unique combat experiences,
   however, I find that the more combat experiences that veterans endure,
   the less hawkish their foreign policy positions are. Moreover,
   consistent with literature from military psychology, this association
   only holds for veterans who express more regret about their time in the
   military. Conclusions The results should encourage public opinion
   scholars to consider the effects that the number of individual combat
   event experiences and regret have on veterans' issue positions more
   broadly.},

Abstract = {The rising voter support for populist parties in Western Democracies in
   recent years has incited academic interest in populist voters and
   attitudes connected to the voting propensity of populist actors. In line
   of this research, numerous scales to measure populist attitudes among
   voters have been proposed. In most cases, however, the measurement of
   populist attitudes was tailored to specific countries and its
   applicability to cross-national research on populism was not assessed.
   This article uses a cross-national survey to assess the measurement
   invariance, reliability, and validity of a deductively developed
   inventory for populist attitudes. The findings suggest that there is a
   common attitudinal base to left- and right-wing populism which may be
   measured reliably and invariantly across nations.},

Title = {Politicians' Self-depiction and Their News Portrayal: Evidence from 28

Abstract = {Visual content plays a crucial role in today's online political
   communication, especially during election campaigns. Prior research on
   candidate imagery has shown particular effects from non-verbal behavior
   (e.g., smiling), contextual features (e.g., the depiction of other
   people), and structural characteristics (e.g., camera angle and
   proximity). Importantly, this study argues to look at candidate imagery
   as institutionalized means of political communication online. In the
   realm of the European Parliamentary Election 2019, self-promoted
   candidate imagery on social networking sites (SNS) is expected to align
   cross-nationally along party-family structures vis-a-vis respective
   imagery in the news, which is anticipated to align along national
   borders. We analyze and describe respective candidate imagery in both
   news and SNS from 13,811 unique candidates across all 28 European member
   states by means of a computational content analysis of 79,500 images.
   After a manual two-step validation, which raises concerns about the
   validity of the computationally assigned camera angle, logistic
   regression models are used to estimate non-verbal behavior, contextual
   features, and structural characteristics. Findings show that while
   self-depiction on SNS includes more smiling, news imagery employs
   broader variation in camera angles and close-up photography. Differences
   are almost independent from structural influences with the exception of
   country alignment, which is a minor yet consistent predictor of all
   outcome variables. Visual computational content analysis has proven to
   be a useful and reliable utility for all but one variable - a call for
   its employment along strong validation also in future studies to allow
   visual content analyses also on a large and quantitative scale.},

Abstract = {We analyze the differences in the socioeconomic profiles between suicide
   terrorists and `regular' militants using a dataset of 1596 militants
   (including 209 suicide terrorists) from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
   Jihad (PIJ). We find that suicide terrorists are better educated,
   younger, less likely to be married or have children, and less likely to
   live in the Gaza strip than their non-suicide counterparts. Moreover,
   although the profiles of Hamas and PIJ militants are distinctively
   different, the suicide terrorists are very similar to one another.},

Abstract = {Marx is generally reckoned to have had too little to say about what has
   come to be defined as `social reproduction', largely as a consequence of
   too narrow a focus on industrial production, and a relative disregard
   for issues of gender. This paper argues in contrast that the approach he
   developed with Engels and in Capital, Volume 1, provides a powerful
   framework for its analysis. After an introductory discussion of recent
   literature on social reproduction the second section sets out Marx's
   approach to the `production of life, both of one's own in labour and of
   fresh life in procreation'. The third addresses his account of
   reproduction in Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 23. The fourth and fifth
   compare the relationship of the family to industry and exchange as
   depicted in Capital and in the present day respectively. The conclusion
   suggests some implications for theories of social reproduction.},

Abstract = {Although voluntary recruitment to the military is today the Western
   norm, we know little about citizens' beliefs regarding service members'
   reasons for joining. This article, reporting and analyzing the results
   of a nationally representative U.S. survey, rectifies this gap. We find
   that, despite the reality of market-based recruitment, many Americans
   continue to subscribe to an idealized image of service members as moved
   by self-sacrificing patriotism. This belief is most heavily concentrated
   among conservative Americans. Liberal Americans are more likely to
   believe that service members join primarily for economic reasons. Those
   furthest to the left are more inclined to aver that service members join
   chiefly to escape desperate circumstances. Perhaps most surprising, we
   discover a disconnect between respondents with military experience and
   their families: The former are more likely to acknowledge that pay and
   benefits are a primary motivation for service, whereas their families
   are more likely to embrace a patriotic service narrative.},

Title = {Is a pixel worth 1000 words? Critical remote sensing and China's Belt
   and Road Initiative},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As a novel means of researching China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
   this article advances a critical remote sensing agenda that connects the
   view from above provided by satellite imagery with the grounded,
   qualitative methodologies more typical of political geography such as
   ethnographic fieldwork. Satellite imagery is widely used to produce
   empirics relating to the BRI, and the Chinese state is showing
   increasing interest in applying Earth observation data to governance. A
   more critical approach attentive to the politics of remote sensing,
   especially in light of China's emergence as a space and satellite power
   and its embrace of big data, is needed to more precisely reveal what
   changing pixels represent on the ground and expose the potential issues
   with data captured from high above the planet. This paper offers three
   theoretical and methodological objectives for critical remote sensing.
   First, I reflect on the geopolitics involved in the production and
   analysis of satellite imagery. Second, through analysis of night light
   imagery, which captures illuminated anthropogenic activities, I
   interrogate metanarratives of development. Third, I engage with
   qualitative methods by ``ground-truthing{''} remote sensing with
   ethnographic observations along China's borders. I also seek to avoid
   the methodological nationalism often present in remote sensing research
   by situating these mixed-methods case studies at scales above and below
   the nation-state. As one of the largest development interventions in
   history materializes, pursuing critical remote sensing can create
   opportunities for social scientists to leverage quantitative and
   geospatial methods in support of more equitable and sustainable futures.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of voting rules on delay in a multilateral
   bargaining experiment with costly communication. Our design is based on
   a variant of the Baron-Ferejohn framework. Communication takes place
   after a proposer is selected and before a proposal is made. In contrast
   to prior experiments, communication is directly associated with costs in
   our setup. Specifically, every second of communication increases the
   probability that the game is terminated before a proposal can be made.
   In case of `breakdown', each player receives an exogenously fixed
   disagreement value. Those values sum up to less than the amount of the
   available surplus, implying that delay owing to communication is costly.
   We vary the decision rule (majority versus unanimity) as well as the
   distribution of disagreement values (symmetric or asymmetric). We find
   that unanimity rule leads to longer communication delays and more
   frequent breakdowns in asymmetric, but not in symmetric situations.},

Abstract = {The local arena provides an excellent framework for the study of
   practices linked to the reproduction of national identities. This
   article analyzes the different manners in which Spanish national
   identities were transmitted and assimilated at the local level during
   the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930). The paper takes a
   micro-historical approach and examines the process of mass
   nationalization in the town of Alagon, an industrial locality 15 miles
   north of Saragossa. It focuses on the different manners in which the
   local population `experienced' the nation in public, semi-public and
   private spheres of nationalization. The article shows the limits of
   government-controlled, top-down nationalizations and underlines the
   importance of material culture and daily consumption in the transmission
   and assimilation of national identity.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the role of the Spanish Constitutional Court in
   the state of autonomies between 1980 and 2014. It questions the
   evolution of the court in two fields. First, it demonstrates that the
   court profoundly shaped the contours of the devolution process through a
   dynamic of `judicialization'. Second, this research analyzes the
   politicization process of constitutional justice by territorial actors.
   This dynamic led to the quasiparalysis of the court from 2008 to 2012
   through the ruling of the reform of the Catalan statute. This paper
   concludes the court can be best interpreted as a `trustee' aspiring to
   remain an independent arbiter within a framework lacking alternative
   fora for regulating intergovernmental relations.},

Abstract = {This paper reconceptualizes and unbundles the relationship between
   public predation, state capacity and economic development. By reframing
   our understanding of state capacity theory from a constitutional
   perspective, we argue that to the extent that a causal relationship
   exists between state capacity and economic development, the relationship
   is proximate rather than fundamental. State capacity emerges from an
   institutional context in which the state is constrained from preying on
   its citizenry in violation of predefined rules limiting its discretion.
   When political constraints are not established to limit political
   discretion, then state capacity will degenerate from a means of
   delivering economic development to a means of predation. In addition, we
   investigate two case studies of economic and political transition: the
   privatization of Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union; and
   the political unification of Sicily with the Italian peninsula following
   the Napoleonic Wars. In each case, political and economic transition
   intended to secure well-defined and well-enforced property rights
   empowered the predatory capacity of the state. In each case, the attempt
   to redistribute property rights through political discretion only
   facilitated predation by the political elite.},

Abstract = {Is the Australian Labor Party (ALP) one party, or eight? Academic
   accounts of the ALP throughout its history have emphasised the
   importance of state-based policy-making and organisation as evidence
   that the ``life of the party{''} occurs within state and territory
   branches. However, over the last three decades, changes to the national
   conference and constitution, the increasing prominence of national
   leaders and the professionalisation of campaigning practices have
   arguably created the conditions for a far more centralised organisation,
   raising the question of whether, in 2019, there is anything distinctive
   about the ALP state and territory branches beyond the jurisdictions in
   which they operate. In this article, we investigate the distinctiveness
   of state Labor branches in terms of their formal organisational
   diversity and the characteristics and attitudes of their supporters.
   Using data from an original survey of Australian party supporters
   conducted in 2016, as well as undertaking an analysis of formal party
   rules, we show that the ALP exhibits a high degree of organisational
   uniformity across its branches, and supporters of the party in all
   states and territories very closely resemble each other. We conclude
   that even though the party maintains a federal structure it is possible
   to study its supportership and formal structure as a national
   organisation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the discursive aspect of the church-state
   relationship in Ukraine after the Euromaidan protests and the outburst
   of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis in February 2014. In particular, it
   analyzes the evolution of the core elements in the discourse on religion
   by President Petro Poroshenko in the period 2014-2018. It also traces
   the sources of his ideological representation of the church as a key
   attribute of Ukrainian political order and national identity, along with
   the army and the state language. This study demonstrates that, in
   addition to their intensive practical efforts intended to facilitate the
   emergence of a united autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian state
   authorities strove to establish and promote an ideological paradigm
   which features a close binding of religion and nationalism.},

Title = {Converging anticipatory geographies in Oceania: The Belt and Road
   Initiative and Look North in Fiji},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anticipatory geographies are state-driven initiatives promoting economic
   hope through the language of rejuvenation, prosperity and connectivity.
   As a discursive process, anticipatory geographies reconfigure spaces and
   identities. These narratives have proliferated in an age of intensified
   connectivity as states aim to imprint their political and economic
   visions. Oceania has become a site of multiple anticipatory geographies
   external and internal to the region with the presence of China as an
   enabling factor. In 2006, Fiji reintroduced a Look North policy to
   globalize economic connectivity placing Fijian agency at the centre, and
   in 2015, Beijing included Oceania into China's Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) framework. This work examines the processes when two anticipatory
   geographies meet. Adapting critical geopolitics, the research presents
   the findings of a critical discourse analysis of Chinese and Fijian
   texts referencing Look North and BRI. The work reveals the entanglement
   of anticipatory geographies in Fiji has generated a co-produced
   discourse of prosperity displaying continuity from Look North to the
   BRI. Although there is a shift toward defining the Sino-Fijian
   relationship through BRI, it does not signal an overwrite of an
   indigenous policy framework. I argue Look North has been `re-placed'
   into the BRI to co-produce a narrative that permits the ongoing
   articulation of Fijian interests. With the Belt and Road becoming the
   defining framework for China's relations with countries across Asia,
   Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas, this work suggests
   Fiji's handling of BRI's impact on its domestic spaces and policies is
   an indicator of how other states will reposition their promises of
   economic hope to civil society.},

Abstract = {Purpose In a dynamic environment, understanding the consumer's behavior
   in an online market is critical for the development of online retailers'
   strategies. In Egypt, although the number of internet users is growing
   rapidly, online shopping is at an early stage of development. In
   addition, there is a lack of knowledge about the behavior of Egyptians
   toward online shopping and the factors that influence their behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach To demonstrate the applicability of the
   technology acceptance model (TAM), this research applies an extended TAM
   to analyze the factors that impact the Egyptian consumers' online
   shopping behavior. Structural equation modeling is used for fitting the
   data and testing the hypothesis. Findings Findings revealed that
   perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, social norm and perceived
   risk have significant influences on the respondents to shop online;
   while the site language effect was insignificant. Research
   limitations/implications This study has mainly four limitations. The
   first concerning the sample, it should cover diversified areas other
   than Cairo and should include respondents from different education
   levels. Future studies may consider using a national sample of current
   and potential online shoppers to be able to generalize the results.
   Second, the questionnaire should include questions about the levels of
   education and the level of income to analyze if they influence actual
   online shopping. Third, although the benefits of using online surveys
   such as reducing the costs and time and collecting data more accurately
   compared to paper-pencil surveys, the low response rate may lead to
   non-response bias. Finally, constructs such as website content, design,
   and response could be added to the TAM to examine different aspects of
   website functionalities on the actual shopping. Originality/value
   Considering that online shopping is still at the early stage of
   development in Egypt, there is a need to examine the factors that
   influence the behavior of Egyptian consumers while adopting online
   shopping. To fill in this gap, this study is analyzing the factors
   impacting the consumers' decisions to shop online by examining a sample
   of students from the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Cairo
   University. This study will contribute to providing an empirical
   application of the TAM on the Egyptian consumers in addition to,
   enhancing the knowledge of electronic retailers about the factors that
   drive consumers toward shopping online.},

Abstract = {While previous research suggests that conspiratorial reasoning and
   populist ideology often walk hand-in-hand, this study explores their
   correlations by considering their internal heterogeneity in the
   sociopolitical context of China. Through an online survey (N = 807), the
   present investigation identifies two subtypes of populism (right- vs.
   responsibility-oriented), alongside two subtypes of conspiracy beliefs
   (pro-system vs. anti-system), and examines the associations between
   them. The results demonstrate that while China's right-oriented populism
   is positively correlated with anti-system conspiratorial beliefs, it has
   no significant correlations with pro-system conspiracy thinking.
   Responsibility-driven populism, however, is positively correlated with
   pro-system conspiratorial mindsets, and negatively correlated with
   anti-system conspiratorial beliefs. This study moves away from viewing
   populism and conspiracy belief as homogeneous concepts, providing an
   often-neglected Chinese context for these political-psychological
   ideations.},

Abstract = {This article explores how movements frame their claims and identities in
   response to opposing movements. We build on previous scholarship by
   tracing how movements instrumentally navigate such a response - aligning
   new frames with their old ones - as interactions between opposing
   movements persist. The case of Poland demonstrates how the lesbian and
   gay (LG) movement's frames developed from embracing universal and
   European themes to more rooted politics. We show how external discursive
   opportunities surrounding European Union accession shaped the frames of
   both the movement and its opposition around similar resonant themes,
   though with distinct interpretations. The countermovement converged
   around a frame of external forces imposing values on the nation -
   largely in a differentiated response to the international human rights
   frames touted by the LG movement initially. The LG movement responded
   strategically by emphasizing its Polishness in frames that signal a far
   more rooted politics of sexuality than before. These findings confirm
   much of what research has established concerning the relationship
   between opposing movements, but they also go beyond it, exploring how
   multi-level discursive opportunities can emerge simultaneously for both
   movements, leading to a contest of interpreting the politically potent
   symbols that come to the fore. Drawing on multiple years of fieldwork
   with Polish civil society actors, we use content analysis to trace the
   trajectory of the LG movement's frames, making the crucial point that
   they are shaped by ongoing movement/countermovement interactions, as
   well as the multi-level discursive context in which they operate.},

Abstract = {The independence of the central bank is routinely regarded as
   sacrosanct, at least for governments wishing to maintain credible
   monetary policy to meet inflation objectives. Yet empirical efforts to
   ascertain that routine economic policy advice are complicated by the
   endogeneity of inflation and independence. Using a large panel of up to
   147 economies between 1970 and 2012, we revisit the claim that central
   bank independence leads to superior inflation outcomes from the
   perspective of democratic governance. We deploy a measure of the degree
   of democratic representation as an instrument for the independence of
   the monetary authority and obtain estimates of the causal effect of
   central bank independence on inflation. Our baseline results overturn
   the standard negative inflation-independence relationship. Further
   inquiry into parameter heterogeneity indicates that the result is driven
   by developing economies and is attributable to political-economy
   factors: insufficient transparency enables the pursuit of
   non-price-stabilization objectives.},

Abstract = {The inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) is linked to several
   positive effects, which result in growing gross domestic product (GDP)
   and reduced unemployment rate in the host country. The level of GDP and
   the unemployment rate determine the FDI inflow, but contrariwise, FDI
   inflow has an impact on these variables. In the paper, we investigate
   which of these variables is the impulse and which is consequently
   determined by the impulse variable. The objective of the paper is to
   examine the length of the FDI effect in a host economy as well as the
   impact of FDI inflow on the unemployment rate using vector
   autoregression and impulse-reaction functions. Based on results of the
   Granger causality, we analyse linkages between FDI inflow, unemployment
   rate and GDP growth in the Slovak Republic in the period 1995-2018. The
   results show that the impulse comes from the unemployment rate, which
   consequently affects the FDI inflow. However, the length of this effect
   is very short.},

   THE RISE OF THE NATIONALIST RIGHT},

Abstract = {The growth of the nationalist right in Europe and the United States has
   set off a debate over whether ``economic anxiety{''} or ``racial
   resentment{''} is at the root of this phenomenon. Examining the case of
   the French National Front, I suggest that this is a poor way of posing
   the question of the significance of class in explaining the rise of the
   nationalist right. Recent advances by the National Front-particularly
   among working-class voters-have tended to be attributed to the party's
   strategic pivot toward a ``leftist{''} economic program and an embrace
   of the republican tradition. This in turn has been critically
   interpreted in two different ways. Some take the FN's strategic pivot at
   face value and see the party's success as the expression of a new
   political cleavage between cosmopolitanism and communitarianism. Others
   see the National Front's embrace of republicanism as a cynical ploy
   hiding its true face. Both interpretations, however, point to a strategy
   of ``republican defense{''} as a means to counteract the National Front.
   I argue that this strategy is likely to misfire and that class remains
   central to explaining-and countering-the rise of the National Front,
   albeit in a peculiar way. Working-class support for the National Front
   does indeed appear to be driven primarily by ethno-cultural, not class,
   interests, but this is itself predicated on a historical decline in the
   political salience of class due to the neoliberal depoliticization of
   the economy. I argue that it was this disarticulation of class identity
   that helped deliver the working-class vote to the National Front and
   that any strategy for combating the nationalist right must thus find new
   ways to articulate a class identity capable of neutralizing racist and
   chauvinist articulations.},

Abstract = {The article aims to analyse the effects of the start-up subsidy
   programme for unemployed in the Czech Republic, which is provided by the
   Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. We explored to what extent
   participants in the programme in 2014 returned to unemployment three
   years after the end of the programme, i.e., 2014-2017. Methodologically,
   we conducted counterfactual impact analysis, where we matched
   participants in the programme with those who were not supported by any
   measures of active labour market policy. The results show that
   participants in the programme return to unemployment to a lesser extent.
   In total, they spent fewer days in unemployment during the follow-up
   period, and they returned to unemployment fewer times when compared with
   non-participants. Overall, 91.3\% of participants never returned to
   unemployment during the analysed period. These results can be
   interpreted as a positive outcome of the programme. The article also
   offers implications for targeting the programme and for future research.},

Abstract = {The paper examines various English translations of the term Tutuong Ho
   Chi Minh. The author concludes that Ho Chi Minh Ideology is more
   accurate than the traditional version, Ho Chi Minh Thoughts. This
   ideology, which constitutes the Comintern techniques adapted to
   Vietnamese reality by Ho Chi Minh, underlies the state power in the
   Democratic Republic of Vietnam and in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,
   and is the national idea of contemporary Vietnam, a critical technology
   whose elaboration opened the way to national liberation. The ideology of
   Ho Chi Minh is also the ideological ground of successful economic reform
   effected in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Stemming from the
   conception of neurological levels, the author reveals the technique of
   changing the beliefs and actions of the Vietnamese public under the
   influence of the Ho Chi Minh ideology.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We examine the effect of population size on government size for a panel
   of 130 countries for the period between 1970 and 2014. We show that
   previous analyses of the nexus between population size and government
   size are incorrectly specified and fail to consider the influence of
   crosssectional dependence, non-stationarity and cointegration. Using a
   panel time-series approach that adequately accounts for these issues, we
   find that population size has a positive long-run effect on government
   size. This finding suggests that effects of population size that
   increase government size (primarily due to the costs of heterogeneity,
   congestion, crime and conflict) dominate effects that reduce government
   size (primarily due to scale economies).},

Abstract = {Geography has turned to towards the seas and oceans with much attention
   being paid to `water worlds' through socio-cultural, political and
   environmental lenses. Geo-economic analysis, in particular, has
   considered the role of containerisation, the port, and logistics global
   flows central to the contemporary shipping industry. However, where
   routeing enters discussion these debates remain `surficial' with a focus
   on the rationale of lines of connection which are mapped onto the sea
   (rather than into the sea, as a liquid, three-dimensional, motionful
   space). This paper challenges considerations of ship routeing that only
   skim the surface. This paper adds depth to the discussion. It is argued
   that ship routeing is not a purely surficial exercise of charting a
   voyage across seas and oceans. Routes have a geo-politics predicted at
   times on the water's depth, the topography of the ocean floor and seabed
   and marine resources. Drawing on a variety of examples, notably the
   traffic routeing scheme - or `maritime motorway' - governing the flows
   of shipping in the Dover Strait, UK, this paper brings a `wet ontology'
   and three-dimensional analysis to ship routeing. It is contended that
   such a recognition and discussion of deep routeing is necessary to shed
   light upon the often invisible processes sea that underscore the global
   logistics flows vital to society and the economy.},

Abstract = {This chapter proposes a sociological reconstruction of the emergence of
   citizenship as a source of legitimacy for political institutions, and it
   focuses on examining the historical processes that first gave rise to
   this concept. It explains how citizenship has its origins in the
   transformation of feudal law, a process that culminated in patterns of
   military organization that characterized the rise of the early modern
   state in Europe. On this basis, it describes how the growth of
   constitutional democracy was integrally marked by the militarization of
   society and explains that military pressures have remained palpable in
   constitutional constructions of citizenship. In particular, it argues
   that, through the early growth of democracy, national citizenship
   practices were closely linked to global conflicts, and they tended to
   replicate such conflicts in national contexts. It concludes by showing
   how more recent processes of constitutional norm formation, based
   largely in international human rights law, have acted to soften the
   military dimensions of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Cities have been recognized as important players in some of today's most
   visible global agendas, from the Paris Agreement on climate to the
   United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. This is a formalization
   of the global role of cities, on which we have little systematic
   evidence. The formal role of cities remains murky at best, when not
   unspecified or lumped into civil society. The review presented here, the
   first of its kind in both international and urban studies, explores the
   ways in which the United Nations has formally recognized cities in its
   key documentation, as represented by 32 key frameworks, treaties and
   statements underpinning the current Agenda 2030. It differentiates
   across three `functions' ascribed to cities: as issues, as places and as
   actors. The results of this study highlight the pervasiveness of cities
   being referred to as actors in official United Nations documentation,
   over and above other functions. Further unpacking the idea of city
   agency and implications for cities, we demonstrate that talk of the
   meteoric `rise' of cities might need to be undertaken more carefully
   with the better understanding of historical trends.},

Abstract = {One important domain of nonmarket-driven innovation is social
   innovation. Defined as ``new ideas that have the potential to improve
   either the quality or the quantity of life,{''} social innovation stands
   in stark contrast to business innovation that focuses on creativity with
   the intention of making a profit. Drawing on research on motivation,
   creativity, rentier mentality, and Islamic work ethics, this article
   takes a motivational approach to social innovation and advances a
   proposition that prosocial motivation is of particular importance in
   fostering social innovation in the context of the UAE. We argue that due
   to policies that grant nationals high financial stability and affluence,
   UAE locals are less likely to be driven by extrinsic motivation, but
   rather by intrinsic motivation. We propose that enhancing their
   prosocial motivation will have a synergetic effect with their intrinsic
   motivation and therefore lead to higher social innovation. This article
   extends the literature on prosocial motivation, social innovation, and
   social entrepreneurship by identifying a geographical/cultural region
   where the motivational basis for social innovation is amplified.
   Significantly, this article questions common assumptions about a rentier
   mentality and proposes a path to leverage social innovation.
   Implications for policymakers and practitioners are discussed.},

Abstract = {Guy Debord, founder of the Situationist International and filmmaker,
   kept a meticulous record of his correspondence between 1951 and 1994.
   Published by Fayard, the fifth volume of the correspondence includes
   several letters signed `Glaucos' (a character from the Iliad), which
   were sent to Afonso Monteiro, Gianfranco Sanguinetti, Eduardo Rothe, and
   Jaime Sempran. In those letters, Debord developed several analyses of
   the `Carnation Revolution, arguing that `the Portuguese proletariat' had
   gone `further than the May 1968 movement. Debord initially supported a
   local group called Conselho para o Desenvolvimento da Revolucao Social,
   but he would later criticise it for not taking sufficient action. He
   also encouraged Jaime Semprtin to write La Guerre Social au Portugal, a
   book published by Editions Champ Libre in May 1975. This article
   analyses Debord's correspondence in 1974 and 1975, offering a critical
   assessment of how he related to the revolutionary situation in Portugal.},

Title = {Mapping the subaquatic animals in the Aquatocene: Offshore wind power,
   the materialities of the sea and animal soundscapes},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {83},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines the controversy around marine animal management in
   Taiwan Strait, where the sea has been territorialized by offshore wind
   power developers. Concerns have been focused on the impacts of pile
   driving noise on the Taiwanese white dolphin which is on the IUCN list
   of extremely endangered species. To deal with the problem, both state
   and developers have been involved in volumetric practices which attempt
   to render the marine mammals knowable, and in turn, governable. While
   recent work on volumetric thinking has revealed that power is exercised
   through volume, we contend that insufficient attention has been given to
   those lively `non-human' subjects living in the volumetric spaces.
   Inspired by recent scholarship on animal atmospheres and the wet
   ontologies, we argue that marine animals are sentient beings that cannot
   be known, or mapped, by the state-corporate volumetric practices which
   are mainly based on scientific experiments, conducted in isolated social
   contexts. To illustrate this, we draw on assemblage thinking and develop
   the idea of marine animal soundscapes. We suggest that marine animal
   soundscapes exist only through the embodied experience of a sensory,
   marine animal body, which is able to affect, and learn to be affected
   by, others, through non-linguistic `signs', such as sound. We maintain
   that animal soundscapes are shaped by social, ecological and material
   circumstances, of which, the materialities of the sea, such as its
   liquidity, rapidity and fluidity, are of great importance. With an
   emphasis on the subaquatic animal soundscapes, our approach intends to
   extend social relationality to non-humans and calls for an ontology,
   distinct from the one with which existing volumetric analysts work.},

Abstract = {Passive online media use refers to the act of merely reading and
   observing political information on a users' feed. Alternatively, active
   use refers to the conscious decision to share information, comment,
   challenge, fact check, or engage in related activity. We argue that
   these types of social media use have fundamentally different
   relationships to offline political participation. We use original survey
   data from Malaysia and the Philippines to test two propositions: (1)
   active political use, such as online protest or resistance, substitutes
   for offline protest and (2) passive users who encounter critical
   information and do not engage in active use will participate in offline
   protest. Our results confirm these expectations.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at explaining the difference in e-participation (or
   online public participation) across countries using a conceptual model
   that is quantitatively analyzed using panel data. The model is based on
   the theories of policy feedback and socio-technical approach in the
   participation literature and explores the mediating and moderating role
   of technology on institutions. The technology variable is measured along
   four dimensions of information and communication technology (ICT),
   namely, infrastructure, affordability, skills, and usage. The
   institutions variable is measured along the two dimensions of political
   and regulatory environment and political rights and civil liberties. The
   study is significant as it quantitatively analyzes a complex
   longitudinal relationship between institutions, technology, and
   e-participation and finds support for institutions' role as antecedents
   to technology. Findings inform that ICT skills play a mediating role
   while ICT infrastructure and usage act as moderator for institutions'
   impact on e-participation.},

Title = {Toward a Transnational Information Ecology on the Right? Hyperlink
   Networking among Right-Wing Digital News Sites in Europe and the United

Abstract = {The recent rise of a more transnationally networked political right
   across Europe and the United States has been accompanied by an emerging
   alternative digital news infrastructure through which information
   circulates and shared epistemologies are established. This paper
   examines the extent to which digital news sites on the right are
   interconnected within and across countries. It further explores which
   additional sites serve as transnationally shared reference points of
   such news ecology on a transnational scale. To do so, we investigate
   hyperlink networks between alternative right-wing online news sites
   (RNS) in six western democracies (Austria, Germany, United States,
   United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden). Our analysis draws on hyperlink data
   harvested from 65 RNS for three months in 2018. The results show that
   RNS do establish interlinked alternative right-wing news ecologies, as
   they connect to likeminded RNS within and across borders. Furthermore,
   we see substantial variation across countries, where RNS from countries
   with less established alternative right-wing news infrastructure are
   more likely to link transnationally to RNS. The United States represents
   an outlier in that it features the largest and domestically most
   integrated network of RNS, while U.S. sites function as hubs for
   transnational connections from European RNS. Apart from connections
   between RNS, we find that legacy news media are crucial transnationally
   shared reference points. We conclude that rather than presenting an
   insulated, alternative sphere, the emerging digital news ecology on the
   right seeks to link up to the broader information environment across
   borders.},

Abstract = {This paper critically examines the implications of `self-sovereign
   identity' (SSI) for border politics and migration management. SSI refers
   to user-controlled, decentralised forms of digital identification.
   Closely linked with the distributed ledger technology blockchain, SSI is
   presented by advocates as a tool to empower marginalised groups,
   including refugees. Among other benefits, some claim that SSI removes
   the need for powerful, centralised institutional structures by giving
   individuals control and ownership of their identity information.
   However, through ethnographic research in an international aid
   organisation, I find that SSI is an embryonic technology with
   indeterminate properties and benefits. I identify a series of competing
   logics in the debates around SSI's emancipatory potential, which relate
   to four issues: (i) the neutrality of the technology, (ii) the
   capacities of refugees, (iii) global governance and the nation state,
   and (iv) new economic models for digital identity. SSI is simultaneously
   the potential enabler of new modes of empowerment, autonomy and data
   security for refugeesanda means of maintaining and extending
   bureaucratic and commercial power. I situate SSI in a genealogy of
   systems of identity control and argue that, in practice, it is likely to
   feed into the powers of corporations and states over refugee
   populations.},

   to Serve Prior to the July 2016 Coup Attempt?},

Abstract = {Motivation is a key factor for the military institution to accomplish
   its goals. Extant academic research, however, has generally focused on
   the combat motivation and the motivation to serve has been understudied.
   This study examines the motivation to serve and its predictors among
   Turkish military officers and NCOs. The aim of the current study is
   2-fold: (1) to test the effectiveness of measures proposed by previous
   studies in Turkish Armed Forces and (2) to build on the existing body of
   knowledge by showing the impacts of perceived fairness and satisfaction
   with social benefits. Survey data, which were conducted only 2 months
   before the coup attempt in Turkey on July 15, 2016, were used to assess
   the motivation. Findings revealed that institutional and moral
   commitments, organizational responsiveness, perceived fairness, and
   satisfaction with social benefits were positive significant determinants
   of motivation to serve, while occupational commitment had a negative
   relationship with it.},

Abstract = {In recent years, policy-makers and researchers have identified regional
   development agencies as the most suitable actors to carry out public
   tasks. One of these tasks has been the coordination of regional
   development processes. Both practitioners and researchers argue that
   legitimacy is a prerequisite for these regional actors to function
   properly. Although legitimacy is a key issue, little is known about the
   challenges that arise while producing it. Selecting six regional
   development agencies in Switzerland and applying an interview-based
   research method, this explorative study analyses how regional
   development agencies deal with legitimacy issues. The findings indicate
   that the main problem with which regional development agencies struggle
   is not procedural rightfulness but means-end coordination. By proposing
   a clear distinction between legitimacy and justification, we aim to
   stimulate the debate on how to operationalize legitimacy and further the
   discussion of the functioning of regional development agencies.
   Consequently, we introduce the concept of `asymmetric justification' to
   the debate on regional development processes in order to shed a light on
   the functioning of regional development agencies.},

Abstract = {People use social cues to decide whether they want to interact with
   others. As everyday life has become more politicized, we now attach
   political meaning to seemingly apolitical activities, from the food we
   eat, to the movies and TV shows we watch, to the car we drive. Do these
   stereotypes affect social behavior? Using two survey experiments,
   including one with a nationally representative sample, I show that
   people use apolitical cues to draw inferences about others' political
   leanings. More importantly, these inferences impact decisions about
   which individuals they want to interact with, which lead to reduced
   cross-party contact as well as cross-cutting political discussion. The
   findings have important implications for how partisan stereotypes of
   everyday attributes might indirectly exacerbate political polarization.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the latest wave of the higher education quality
   assurance (QA) reform, implemented by the Government of Georgia in
   response to its obligations envisaged by the EU-Georgia Association
   Agreement and its consequent Association Agenda 2017-2020. We argue that
   EU conditionality was a major driving factor for the modernization of
   Georgian QA system according to the European Standards and Guidelines
   for Quality Assurance (ESG 2015), and even though the reform was mostly
   implemented in the framework of the country's EU integration, an
   expected reward in the form of the membership of the European
   Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) granted to
   the National Center for Educational Quality Enhancement (NCEQE) of
   Georgia was the major driving force for implementing the reform
   successfully. While this reward-driven reform has resulted in the ENQA
   membership, it has not inevitably led to building a sustainable,
   independent and development-oriented external quality assurance system
   for the enhancement of Georgian higher education. Therefore, the entire
   QA reform was merely aimed at ``talking the EU talk{''} (Schimmelfennig
   \& Sedelmeier, 2005, p. 27) by the Georgian government instead of
   actually being focused on the development of internal ``quality
   culture{''} in Georgian higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {A cap on global warming implies a tighter carbon budget which can be
   enforced with a credible second-best renewable energy subsidy designed
   to lock up fossil fuel and curb cumulative emissions. Such a subsidy
   brings forward the end of the fossil fuel era but accelerates fossil
   fuel extraction and global warming in the short run. A weaker fossil
   fuel oligopoly implies that anticipation of a given global carbon budget
   induces fossil producers to deplete reserves more voraciously and
   accelerate global warming. This race to burn the last ton of carbon is
   more intensive for the feedback than open-loop Nash equilibrium, so that
   the Green Paradox effect of a renewable energy subsidy is stronger.
   There is an intermediate phase of limit pricing to keep renewable energy
   producers at bay, which becomes much more relevant when a cap on global
   warming is enforced. A stronger fossil fuel oligopoly lengthens the
   period of limit pricing and typically brings forward the carbon-free
   era. Finally, the mere risk of a cap on global warming being enforced at
   some unknown, future date makes fossil fuel extraction more voracious
   and accelerates global warming.},

Abstract = {The spatialities of feminist urban politics are investigated by
   combining the concept of multiple converging spatialities of contentious
   politics with the recent literature on policy mobilities and urban
   movements. The research begins with the hypothesis that networks are
   significant mediators of feminist urban politics, but their effects
   depend on other, converging spatialities as well. The presented case
   study of the Viennese Fair Shared City model illustrates the value of
   such analytical perspective. The results indicate that this model is
   deeply rooted in the Viennese environment, challenged by its recent
   transformation, unevenly circulating through various scientific and
   policy networks across the Central and Eastern Europe region.},

   Cross-classified multilevel models, using data from more than 20
   European countries, 80 surveys, and 100,000 respondents, over a decade.
   Results The longer the time that lower courts take, on average, to
   dispose of pending cases, the lower is the public's trust in their legal
   system. Conclusion Judicial performance, operationalized as the ability
   of courts to avoid delays in the delivery of justice, is a significant
   correlate of citizens' evaluations of their country's legal system.},

Abstract = {Objective In this article, we examine how religious accommodations for
   Muslim minorities impact subjective well-being (SWB) among Christian and
   nonattendee respondents in Western European countries. Methods We apply
   hierarchal linear modeling and fixed effects regressions on data drawn
   from the European Social Survey (2002-2008). Results We find that
   religious accommodations at the country level are negatively associated
   with lower SWB among both Christian and nonattendee respondents.
   However, the effect is substantially greater for nonattendees.
   Conclusion Although the threat and coalition theses are often argued as
   competing positions, we posit they may be complementary perspectives.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors present a critical analysis of some of the
   essential results of the Prevalence Survey of Sexual Violence against
   women in the context of the Colombian armed conflict for the period
   2010-2015. This survey presents, among other aspects, data regarding the
   magnitude of the different conducts linked to sexual violence, some
   socio-demographic characteristics of the victims, characteristics of the
   aggressors, and the spaces and the frequency of such forms of violence.
   While this article reports on the contributions of the survey to
   generate information on the subject, it also raises a debate about the
   limitations and challenges that the data have to estimate, among other
   aspects, the magnitude or prevalence of sexual violence against women in
   the context of the Colombian armed conflict. It also raises the need to
   explore the link between this type of violence against women and the
   context of social and institutional violence that the country has
   experienced in its recent history.},

   scenario in which it is possible to perform illicit economies, which are
   a financing source for armed groups. Bearing this in mind, this research
   analyzes the role of the state regarding illegal gold mining activities
   in the region and its link with crops for illicit use through the
   official database analysis, a review of the present academic production,
   semi-structured interviews with miners and coca growers, and fieldwork
   in San Jose del Fragua (Caqueta). This study shows that in the region,
   both illegal activities have a high impact on the deforestation of
   natural forests. Furthermore, these activities are common among the
   population due to the high income they generate. In the case study, the
   communities alternate the two activities (illegal mining and illicit
   crops).},

Abstract = {Regardless of who draws the redistricting plan in a state with numerous
   districts, there are always complaints about the outcome. We suggest
   that the inherent conflicts among the traditional redistricting criteria
   make any multi-district plan subject to criticism and vulnerable to
   litigation. In particular, the mandates to respect communities of
   interest while drawing competitive districts are frequently
   irreconcilable. This is because many communities of interest are
   themselves lopsidedly partisan, and including them whole or undiluted
   will impede the pathway to achieving an even partisan division in a
   district's electorate. Examples drawn from North Carolina and
   Pennsylvania serve to illustrate the constraints that map drafters face,
   regardless of for whom they are employed.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether politics causes regime shifts in deviations
   from the optimal monetary policy in the United Kingdom. After using a
   dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to construct the
   welfare-maximizing policy rule and deviations from the optimal Taylor
   rule, we show that politics does indeed play an important role in
   explaining these deviations. In addition to politics, unemployment rates
   account for regime shifts in the Taylor rule deviations.},

Abstract = {Each year thousands of people seeking better lives in Europe make the
   treacherous journey across the Mediterranean. Many of those struggling
   or stranded at sea are rescued by `boat people' comprising NGOs,
   humanitarian organizations, coast guards and merchant vessels. Under
   maritime law there is a duty of care towards anyone that experiences
   difficulty at sea. There is, too, a duty of care by States who under the
   same law are required to assist ships and allow the disembarkation of
   those in danger. Yet this practice has important legal, ethical and
   practical implications and has been challenged by right-leaning
   political regimes who, making good on election promises to ease
   immigration, have prohibited such vessels to dock at their ports. This
   paper, using a case study approach of the humanitarian vessel the
   Aquarius, considers the ways in which the geographies of care intersect
   and collide with the geopolitical framing of migrants and refugees. In
   doing so the paper makes two important contributions. First, it extends
   conceptualizations of care geographies which are more typically applied
   to the spatial outworking of health and wellbeing to European migration.
   It thinks about how care is administered, contested and politicized. The
   complex concept of care offers a rich lens through which to critique the
   framing of seaborne migrants and refugees in Europe. Through giving or
   circumventing legal responsibilities to provide care, seaborne migrants
   are either humanized or dehumanized. Second, through unpacking the
   legislative and ethical frameworks shaping search and rescue (SAR)
   activities in the Mediterranean, we can observe a distinct
   `geopoliticizing of care and responsibility' whereby these individuals
   become pawns in wider power dynamics within the European Union.},

Abstract = {Might additional opportunities to cast a ballot prior to Election Day
   increase the probability that an individual turns out to vote? More
   narrowly, does convenience voting have differential effects, altering
   the method of how some registrants cast their ballot? Scholars disagree
   as to whether convenience voting bolsters turnout, or even if it alters
   the method of voting. We argue that the targeted adoption of early
   in-person voting on the campuses of public colleges and universities
   lowers the barriers of casting a ballot, increasing the turnout of young
   registrants. Drawing on individual-level election administration data
   from Florida in the 2018 general election, we offer a series of models
   (differences-in-differences (DD),
   differences-in-differences-in-differences (DDD), and matching combined
   with differences-in-differences) to estimate the effect of the expansion
   of early in-person voting on eight public campuses. Although we find
   uneven effects of the policy reform on overall turnout, we find
   consistent evidence that the adoption of on-campus early voting not only
   made it more likely that young registrants exposed to the policy turned
   out to vote, but that it also shifted the timing of when these young
   voters cast a ballot.},

Abstract = {Objectives To examine the determinants of the duration time of drivers
   in the Formula One (F1) competition, which is an industry with high
   physical capital investment and requires labor with very high human
   capital. Methods Since estimates may be biased when the whole F1
   history, starting with the 1950 season, is considered, unlike prior
   studies in the literature, this article limits its data set to racing
   seasons from 1981 to 2017. In addition, since the failure times are
   correlated within the drivers with multiple spells, single-spell methods
   used in prior studies underestimate true standard errors and produce
   inflated test statistics. Hence, the most appropriate approach for the
   duration analysis of F1 drivers would be the survival analysis for
   recurrent events, which is employed in this study. Results Once a driver
   exits F1, he survives for a shorter period of time if he returns. In
   order to survive longer, a driver has to perform better than his
   teammate. Each year of age decreases the probability of exit while
   drivers can increase their duration time in F1 by switching teams.
   Completing a race does not make any difference to survival but finishing
   a race on the podium lowers the probability of exit. Conclusion Team
   owners and managers should be cautious when they consider hiring a
   driver who exited F1 before. A driver should be at least better than his
   teammate in order to survive in F1. Drivers can also increase their
   chances of survival substantially by changing teams.},

Abstract = {When former president Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal tried to bypass
   constitutional limitations on renewing his candidature, tens of
   thousands took to the streets. The success of this mobilisation has been
   largely attributed to the newly created youth movement, Y'en a marre.
   Burkina Faso witnessed similar events, when the country saw hundreds of
   thousands protest against the potential continuation of former president
   Blaise Compaore - the action being led by the social movement Balai
   Citoyen, whose public image also heavily featured music artists.
   Examining these large-scale mobilisations against term extensions by
   heads of state from a contentious politics perspective, however, reveals
   that a large number of actors from civil society and politics were
   involved in the protests. In both cases, we find cross-movement
   mobilisations, with none of them forming stable or enduring alliances. I
   will argue that the reasons for this go back to competitive relations
   among Senegalese actors, and ideological polarisation in the case of
   Burkina Faso. My concluding remarks outline the role and relative
   importance of these social movements within their broader societal
   contexts, and point at future pathways for research.},

Title = {The `Meta'-significance of Scalia's A Matter of Interpretation:
   Reflections on a Theory and Ethics of Judicial Legislative Power},
Journal = {TALTECH JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {173-194},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article focuses on a metatheory of legal interpretation as provided
   or implied in Antonin Scalia's famous essay A Matter of Interpretation.
   It is not so much textualism itself what is being analysed here as its
   theoretical and philosophical foundations. Following this route, the
   article reveals a complex ideological framework of intersections between
   domains of democracy, common law, stare decisis, jusnaturalism and
   juspositivism. By moving judicial legislative power to the forefront,
   the analysis opens up the existence of two rather different, if not
   opposite, legislative strategies in the contemporary government: a
   regular one, exercised by its political institutions (parliament being
   the main one), and a specific one, exercised by the judiciary. The
   article proceeds with a critical analysis of two justifications of the
   latter-one more formal and another more substantial. Finally, the
   article develops a basic practical hierarchical structure of principles
   or rules that should settle down legislative powers by neutralising the
   apparent fundamental contradiction in Scalia's essay (i.e., being
   pro-democrat and pro-liberal at the same time).},

Title = {Do national political parties matter? Evidence from Italian
   municipalities},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recently several countries have experienced a drop in popularity of
   national political parties, accompanied by the success of independent
   movements (e.g. ``Civic Lists{''} in Italy). I exploit the success of
   ``Civic Lists{''} in Italian municipalities and use them as a comparison
   group for party-affiliated politicians, to test whether national parties
   affect fiscal discipline. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD),
   I show that party-affiliated mayors are more fiscally responsible: they
   run lower deficits, accumulate less debt and reduce expenditures. The
   effect is significant only for municipalities not constrained by fiscal
   rules. This suggests that national parties act as a substitute for
   fiscal rules in constraining politicians. Besides, I provide evidence
   that the discipline of party-affiliated politicians is linked to better
   career prospects: party-affiliated mayors have a higher probability of
   being re-elected and better chances of being promoted to higher levels
   of government. Alternative stories find less support in the data.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We conduct across-outlet and within-outlet (and within-topic) analyses
   of ``congenially{''} slanted news. We study ``horse race{''} news (news
   on candidates' chances in an upcoming election) from six major online
   outlets for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential campaigns. We find robust
   evidence that horse race headlines were slanted congenially with respect
   to the preferences of the outlets' typical readers. However, evidence of
   congenial slant in the timing and frequency of horse race stories is
   weaker. We also find limited evidence of greater within-outlet demand
   for headlines most congenial to outlets' typical readers, and somewhat
   stronger evidence of greater demand for relatively uncongenial
   headlines. We discuss how various aspects of our results are consistent
   with each of the major mechanisms driving slant studied in the
   theoretical literature, and may help explain when each mechanism is more
   likely to come into play. In particular, readers may be more likely to
   click on uncongenial headlines due to inferring that these stories are
   particularly informative when they stand in contrast to an outlet's
   typically congenial slant.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We experimentally test Hume's hypothesis that people underappreciate the
   value of cooperation-enforcing institutions in impersonal interactions
   by relying on personal trust. Subjects played a game in groups of two or
   six. Each subject could defect at any time, leaving the others with zero
   payoff by unilaterally appropriating an amount of money that grew over a
   period of 5 minutes. All players received the maximum payoff only if
   nobody defected. Before the game, subjects could purchase a
   cooperation-enforcing institution. Their willingness to pay for this
   institution fell short of the loss caused by failed cooperation under
   institution-free play. This was even true for the best-off subject in an
   institution-free society. In the absence of learning, people indeed fell
   prey to the atavistic fallacy of trusting in people instead of
   institutions. Understanding this bias might help people in complex
   societies to acknowledge the value of institutions intellectually.},

Abstract = {The effects of religiosity on moral attitudes have been described in
   numerous studies (see for an overview: Hood, Hill, \& Spilka 2009, pp.
   381-411). There is also a long research tradition on how economic
   development promotes tolerance (Inglehart \& Welzel, 2005). Much less is
   known about how religiosity and development interact in their effect on
   moral attitudes. In a pioneering study, Gaskins, Golder, and Siegel
   (2013) analyzed this interaction for several moral attitudes which are
   part of the World Values Survey (WVS), namely, attitudes toward
   abortion, divorce, euthanasia, homosexuality, and suicide. Thus, in
   terms of moral attitudes, they-roughly speaking-cover attitudes toward
   sexuality/ partnership and attitudes toward the termination of life.
   Gaskins et al. (2013) not only confirm the generally assumed idea that
   the more religious a respondent is, the higher their level of social
   conservatism tends to be, but find that this effect of religiosity is
   stronger in more developed countries: 1 As development progresses, both
   groups (secular and religious) become less socially conservative and
   thus more tolerant, but secular people do so at a considerably faster
   rate, widening the gap between the two groups even further. This
   polarization fuels the culture war raging in many developed democracies
   over issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion law (Smith \&
   Tatalovich, 2003).},

Title = {The value of political connections in the post-transition period:
   evidence from Czechia},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {188},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {121-154},

Abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between political connections and
   reported profits using a newly compiled dataset on all corporate
   donations to political parties in Czechia during its post-transition
   period (between 1995 and 2014). I develop a dynamic matching approach to
   identify non-connected firms that are similar to their connected peers
   on a range of observable characteristics, including profitability prior
   to becoming connected. I find that being politically connected is
   associated with superior reported profits: I estimate conservatively
   that the connected firms outperform their non-connected but otherwise
   similar competitors by 8-12\% following the establishment of the
   connection, which is a larger effect than found previously for more
   developed economies. What is more important, however, I find that the
   effect virtually vanishes for non-connected firms aligned closely with
   the public sector. That evidence suggests that other forms of
   connections, such as personal ties and those established at subnational
   levels of government, such as regional and municipal governance tiers,
   are likely to have played a significant role in Czechia during its
   post-transition period.},

Abstract = {Political mobilizations for and against legal abortions are cyclical
   entities. Studies on people who joined pro-life movements in the peak of
   abortion protests (1980s) are relatively common but recent critical
   studies of right-to-life activists are almost non-existent. To address
   this lack of recent research, this work combines ``political
   resource{''} theories and feminist scholarship to explain why certain
   people are involved in anti-abortion social movements. After analyzing
   data from the 2010-12 version of the American National Election Surveys
   (n = 3,860), this study concludes that pro-life activism was primarily
   driven by absolutist stances on abortion, the minimization of perceived
   sexism in society, being exposed to religious conversations about
   politics, and membership in explicitly political groups. The study also
   found that people's gender, social class, and educational levels failed
   to predict their pro-life political behaviors.},

Abstract = {This paper tests the existence of political credit cycles, the positive
   comovement between credit and elections. While several single-country
   studies point to the existence of this relationship, the link between
   electoral cycles and credit expansion has seen little exploration at the
   multicountry level. Using a comprehensive dataset covering bank and
   non-bank credit in 165 countries from 1960 to 2013, we show that both
   government and private credit significantly increase in election years.
   This finding suggests the possibility that politicians use not only
   fiscal and monetary policy to court voters, but also implement credit
   policies such as interest rate subsidies and tax breaks for debt to
   enhance credit growth. We also find that a higher degree of financial
   openness weakens the frequency and magnitude of political credit cycles;
   yet, the conditional effect of financial openness is stronger for
   developing countries than developed economies.},

Abstract = {To understand the political geography of Kenya's 2007-08 post-election
   violence (PEV), locational (territorial) and relational (ethnic
   community) theories of how context affects politics are combined. This
   hybrid conceptualization provides a nuanced illustration of how
   subnational violence patterns are shaped by Kenyans' ethnic
   community-level experiences and by regional demography. Communities
   whose leaders have held presidential office in the past
   (prior-incumbents) have skill using government institutions to
   distribute material benefits to supporters, which increases their
   motivations for political activity, including violence. Where the size
   of the two prior-incumbent communities - Kikuyu and Kalenjin - are
   large, the severity of PEV is elevated. The presence of a community
   without these experiences controlling the presidency acts as a buffer,
   reducing the severity of conflict. Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzioa counties
   are used as illustrative cases highlighting the relationship between
   locational-relational contexts and PEV. While both counties endured
   substantial electoral conflict, Trans Nzoia's comparatively diverse
   ethnic geography diluted the incentives for deadly PEV. Understanding
   these multidimensional contextual influences for violence improves the
   understanding of conflict geography.},

   Services International},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper sets out the need to conceptualise labour internationalism in
   the public sector, given its distinct political character and
   orientation. Our analysis adds to a literature on labour
   internationalism that hitherto has mainly depicted strategies of unions
   in private sector industries. To better understand the reasons for
   upscaling trade union efforts in a sector where the main employer
   remains the institutional apparatus of the nation-state, we have
   interviewed office bearers in the most important global union federation
   organising across different public services - Public Services
   International (PSI) - asking them to explain their political and
   strategic considerations. We find that the distinct role of the nation
   state as an employer, the public character of work and specific
   relations between public sector workers and the users of services, are
   all determinants in shaping labour transnationalism in the public
   sector. This in turn leads to a greater emphasis on alliances with
   social movements and oppositional campaigns, representing a radical
   global political unionism. Neoliberal austerity and privatisation
   measures have reinforced the importance of such political relationships
   and power, but also challenged their organisational foundations.
   However, alliance-building is not PSI's sole strategy. We find that
   office bearers at the transnational level combines three strategic
   rationales through orientations that we have labelled the
   political-institutional, the movement-popular and the
   industrial-corporate. We also suggest that employing these sensitising
   concepts can bolster the scholarly treatment of understanding labour
   internationalism and its strategy repertoires more generally.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the pornographic genre of `border sex', set on the
   US-Mexico border and produced in the US, which depicts uneven power
   relations taking shape at and through the border. I posit an
   interpretation of these representations that focuses on the use of
   institutionalised violence as a means of exerting control over female
   migrants' bodies, reasserting a gendered territorial authority. This
   interpretation also highlights the intersectional aspects of
   inequalities and I propose an understanding of the embodiment of control
   and the US-Mexico border that shows the importance and potential of the
   theoretical and analytical tools of feminist geography to contribute to
   the critical border studies literature. Moreover, the article places
   itself in the tradition of popular geopolitics and plugs a gap in this
   stream of research and literature regarding online pornography and its
   importance in shaping imaginaries, not only with regard to sexual
   relations. This work draws on various theoretical traditions and
   analytical approaches to cover issues related to borders and border
   crossing from a feminist geopolitical standpoint, with a particular
   interest in the increasing embodiment of migration control in
   pornographic popular representations and in the intersection of various
   forms of inequality at the border. The representation of border patrols
   on the US-Mexico border in pornography is an interesting research field
   for a reflection on ethnosexual borderscapes and the border as a
   technology for reproducing inequalities and reaffirm power relations.},

Title = {More Than Just Gender: Exploring Contextual Influences on Media Bias of
   Political Candidates},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Gender bias in the media coverage of political elections has long been
   theorized as a major obstacle to women's success in elections and their
   institutional representation. However, this view of persistent media
   bias against women politicians is increasingly subject to pressure by
   inconsistent evidence of size and patterns of gender bias. This paper
   argues that some of these inconsistencies derive from a lack of
   attention to contextual influences of electoral coverage. This study
   analyzes gender bias in the amount and content of media coverage in the
   run-up to Swiss federal elections in 2015 by means of a quantitative
   content analysis. Drawing on an extensive sample of print, online and
   audiovisual election coverage from the most important tabloid and
   broadsheet media of three different language regions, the results reveal
   mixed evidence of gender bias: On the one hand, women candidates remain
   underrepresented in Swiss media. On the other hand, however, once they
   are covered by the media, candidates are overwhelmingly presented in a
   gender-neutral way. Several differences emerge between language regions
   and media type. Extending the traditional gender bias hypothesis to
   account for contextual influences, the study illustrates that the
   geo-cultural and media-specific contextual influences of election
   coverage impinge on the gendered mediation of candidates together with
   known drivers of political communication, such as incumbency, the
   electoral system, and party ideology.},

Abstract = {Low-cost forms of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) such
   as phone calls, e-mail, faxes, online town halls, constituent databases,
   and social media are thought to improve Congress' ability to capture and
   be responsive to constituent views. However, scholarly work finds
   evidence that congressional offices don't use ICTs to effectively listen
   to constituent concerns. Rather, Members of Congress use such
   technologies primarily for one-way communication and self-promotion,
   indicating a clear disconnect between the expectations and realities of
   Congress adopting these technologies for responsive engagement. Using
   staff survey and interview data collected during ethnographic fieldwork,
   we find that this disconnect can be partially explained by institutional
   pressures and interpretations of responsive citizen engagement. Congress
   adopts ICTs as symbols of responsiveness by efficiently responding to
   constituents via form letters. The language of responsiveness touted by
   congressional offices allows staff to bridge public narrative and
   institutional practice by using the same word to promote different
   values in constituent engagement. This disconnect leads to a mismatch
   between the public's expectations of how ICTs might influence
   communicative practices by elected officials and how such tools are used
   in practice.},

Title = {Between capture and addition: The ontogenesis of cartographic
   calculation},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper argues that cartographic calculation can be considered as a
   form of `capture'. It suggests that surveillance narratives, typically
   used to illustrate sovereign forms of power, can be augmented by other
   socio-technical approaches. Accordingly, the paper develops the idea of
   capture from media studies to reframe cartographic calculation in
   computational terms. In doing so, it engages with work in political and
   digital geography, arguing that the rise of digital devices, apps,
   platforms and services have led to the generation of huge volumes of
   event-based knowledges; with significant implications for the study of
   the calculation. It subsequently argues that cartographic calculation is
   not, however, solely composed of calculative practices that simply
   capture cartographic data, but also necessarily composed of calculative
   practices that add knowledge into, and proliferate renders of, the
   world. Two dynamics of this oscillating process - anticipation and
   correspondence - expose the ontogenetic tendencies of cartographic
   calculation. The paper draws on the use of a digital protest mapping app
   to exemplify these forces.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to analyze the impact of Arab Revolution on the
   Arabian Gulf security by applying on Yemeni Revolution. This can be
   achieved by analyzing the threat of Arab Spring Revolutions to the
   national security of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries after
   the breakout of demonstrations and protests in some of the member
   states. In addition to its analysis of threat of the Regional Security
   of the Gulf as a result of Yemeni Revolution and Civil War and Iranian
   intervention to support Houthis within light of regional anarchy and
   security competition according to the Neorealism and how the GCC
   Countries face such threats. Design/methodology/approach The study
   depended on the historical methodology to track the developments of some
   events related to the Gulf Security and crisis in Yemen. Moreover, it
   used the analytical approach to analyze the impact of Arab Revolutions
   and Yemeni Civil War on the Arab Gulf Security. In addition, it depended
   on the realistic approach to explain the security state at the national
   and regional level of the Arab Gulf countries within light of regional
   anarchy, security competition and Iranian support to Houthis ``Non-State
   Actors{''} (Kenneth Waltz), as well as the offensive realism (John
   Mearsheimer). Findings The Arab Revolutions had an effect on the
   national security of GCC countries according to the Neorealism due to
   the breakout of demonstrations and protests in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
   Sultanate of Oman which reached to the degree of threatening the
   existence of the state as in Bahrain. The Gulf Regional Security is
   influenced by Revolution and Civil War in Yemen as a result of that
   Iranian support to Houthis within light of security competition between
   Iran and Saudi Arabia, leading to the threat of the Arabian Gulf
   Security as Yemen is the southern gate to the GCC Countries and having
   joint borders with Saudi Arabia and Sultanate of Oman. Moreover, the GCC
   countries dealt with that threat individually, such as, performing
   internal reforms, or collectively through using military force, such as
   Bahrain and Yemen (Offensive Realism). Originality/value This study is
   an introduction to explain the Arab Spring Revolutions, conflict in
   Yemen and its threat to the Arab Gulf Security according to the
   Neorealism based on that the GCC countries sought to keep its existence
   and sovereignty in confrontation to the demonstrations and internal
   protests and to keep the regional security in confrontation to the
   threats of neighboring countries such as the Civil War in Yemen and the
   Iranian Support to Houthis in light of the regional anarchy.},

Abstract = {Using archival material from the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Study
   of Political Economy and first-person recollections from relevant
   figures, we reconstruct James M. Buchanan's mission (in partnership with
   G. Warren Nutter) to ``save the books{''} in the related but distinct
   disciplines of economics and political economy. From his graduate days
   at the University of Chicago in the late 1940s, Buchanan was worried
   about dominant trends in mainstream economics which would carry the
   field away from its core. In particular, Buchanan was worried that
   political economy was becoming unmoored from the types of philosophic
   and institutional analysis which were previously central to the field.
   In its flight from reality, Buchanan feared economics was in danger of
   abandoning social-philosophic issues for exclusively technical
   questions. More than this, Buchanan feared that economists were
   asserting their authority as benevolent social planners. In response to
   these fears, Buchanan sought to (re)create an economics which would
   balance the science of economics and the art of political economy-an
   economics which began with an explicit commitment to democracy and would
   integrate philosophy, institutional thinking, and technical,
   price-theoretic economics, into a coherent working paradigm for research
   and graduate education.},

Abstract = {During the last decades the map of Europe has changed considerably. New
   claims for independent statehood were brought forward and demanded for
   recognition. These claims had to be answered by the European Union and
   its member states. This article evolves around the idea that state
   recognition is as much a matter of politics as it is of law. It starts
   from the assumption that `who we are defines what we see', claiming,
   that EUropean identity, the images the EU and the member states hold
   about themselves, shape the mental maps they hold of territories and
   space. Building on this identity a geopolitical imaginary is formed,
   which can be defined as ideas, allowing actors to ascribe meaning to
   territories, establish order in a seemingly chaotic world by means of
   classification and categorisation and allow to develop strategies for
   action. The geopolitical imaginary of EUrope contains the vision, that
   if all states were more like EUrope itself, the world would be a better
   place: a world determined not by power and coercion, but by rules, norms
   and values; with conflict mechanisms, not based on the rule of the
   strongest, but the rule of law; stability, created through common rules,
   negotiation and economic prosperity; and a determination not to let
   `blunt power-politics' prevail. This imaginary shapes the way in which
   Europe makes meaning of claims for statehood and decides which claims to
   recognise as legitimate. The different elements of the imaginary
   sometimes contradict each other: law may have to take the back seat in
   the quest for stability or justice. Law is open to creative
   interpretations to allow the `right' claims for recognition to prevail
   and the `wrong' ones to be rejected The tool of recognition is caught
   between legal arguments and political considerations, between normative
   visions and pragmatic possibilities.},

Title = {Economic downturns, inequality, and democratic improvements},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper explores the extent to which discrete improvements in the
   democratic quality of political institutions can be explained by income
   inequality. Empirical tests of this relationship have generally yielded
   null results, though typically test an unconditional relationship.
   Guided by a theoretical nuance of the ``new economic view{''} of
   democratization and using an instrumental variable strategy, we
   re-examine the relationship conditional on the state of the
   macroeconomy. We demonstrate that the more unequal are societies, the
   higher the probability of experiencing democratic improvements following
   economic downturns. Following growth periods, higher income inequality
   has a slight negative or null effect on the likelihood of democratic
   improvement. The conditional result provides a simple explanation for
   why previous literature has found largely null results concerning
   inequality and democratization and offers additional evidence in support
   of the new economic view.},

Title = {A Contingent Perspective on Pluralistic Ignorance: When the Attitudinal

Abstract = {Although past research has suggested that pluralistic ignorance-a
   mismatch between perceptions of others' opinions and actual personal
   opinions-does not occur in every circumstance, no studies have directly
   investigated variations among different attitude objects. Drawing upon
   theoretical and analytical approaches based on social representations,
   this study examines differences between personal opinions and perceived
   opinions of different groups toward same-sex female parenting (a newly
   debated attitude object) and working mothers (an older debated attitude
   object). Using data from a study (N = 743) conducted in Switzerland, the
   findings indicate that pluralistic ignorance occurs in opinions toward
   same-sex female parenting. Furthermore, the findings show that
   pluralistic ignorance arises from false consensus among conservatives
   and from false uniqueness among liberals.},

Title = {Intergovernmental transfers and political competition measured by
   pivotal probability - Evidence from Hungary},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {I estimate the effects of political competition on the allocation of
   intergovernmental transfers to Hungarian municipalities between 1998 and
   2006. The intergovernmental transfers were intended to finance
   schooling, elder care, and administrative needs in municipalities.
   Rather than use closeness of the dominant blocks' vote share, which is
   the standard measure of political competition, I instead employ
   (Myerson, 2000)'s pivotal probabilities, calculated at the municipality
   level. As a result, the number of voters, in addition to the vote
   difference, is taken into account when describing political competition
   at the municipal level. I argue that under mixed-member proportional
   systems, as well as under proportional systems in general, pivotal
   probability reflects the political reality better than closeness can. I
   find evidence that swing municipalities in villages are targeted and,
   ceteris paribus, that poorer regions receive larger transfer amounts
   than other areas.},

Title = {Global flows and everyday violence in urban space: The port-city of
   Buenaventura, Colombia},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Buenaventura, Colombia's rapidly expanding Pacific port, is
   simultaneously a city of violence. Focusing the linkages between local
   violence and the port economy, this contribution explores the role the
   port's global interconnections play for Buenaventura as a site of
   violence. In which ways does everyday violence shape urban spatial
   practices, particularly movement? How do every day coping strategies,
   reacting to a violent context, produce urban space? I suggest an
   analysis that links the production of urban space through everyday
   practices to the notion of violence as inherent to urban power relations
   on the one, and to the role of global flows of goods in urban space on
   the other hand. The main argument is that, global interconnections
   through the port are not decoupled from, but rather constitute a
   condition for violence in Buenaventura, particularly in neighbourhoods
   next to port terminals. This urban space is constituted both by daily
   violence and by stretching along global supply chains. Both violence and
   the secured, off-access port spaces shape, transform and limit
   inhabitants' mobility, while they enable global flows. I identify coping
   strategies such as mapping safe spaces, accompaniment, adaptation of
   movement to zig-zag patterns, and organised spatial strategies. The
   article contributes to recent debates on violence and the everyday, and
   urban space shaped by violent global-local encounters.},

Title = {Functions of sovereign violence: Contesting and establishing order in
   Darjeeling, India},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between de facto sovereign violence
   and order in spaces of contested authority. Here, so-called ``informal
   sovereigns{''} imbued with the power to kill and punish with impunity
   can act either as rebels against, or as chosen mediators for, a weak
   government. This paper takes this ambivalent relationship between
   informal sovereigns and the state as a starting point to explore the
   different functions of sovereign violence drawing on a case study from
   Darjeeling, India. Here, informal sovereigns appear in the form of
   regional leaders of an autonomy movement that has, at times, violently
   challenged the government's authority over the region. Drawing on Walter
   Benjamin's distinction between law-making and law-preserving violence,
   the paper argues that sovereign violence performed by such informal
   sovereigns has different functions. It can either stabilize or challenge
   existing power relations and legal orders. To differentiate these
   functions and to account for the ambivalent relations between informal
   sovereigns and the state, the category of informal sovereigns needs to
   be disentangled. To do so, this paper establishes a distinction between
   `petty sovereigns', whose sovereignty is outsourced from the state, and
   `autonomous sovereigns', whose authority is mainly grounded in actors'
   capacity to perform excessive violent acts. While petty sovereigns'
   violence is law-preserving and strengthens existing power relations,
   autonomous sovereigns engage in law-making activities and aspire to
   affect changed orders and to benefit from that change. The case study
   concludes that a sovereign's efficacy in effecting order is not only
   grounded in violence. Rather, its authority emerges from the grey zone
   of the negotiated boundaries between itself and the state, and its
   recognition by its respective constituents.},

Title = {Detecting Florida's Gerrymander: A Lesson in Putting First Things First},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {37-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective We show that Florida's post-2010 congressional districts were
   an ex ante knowable gerrymander, which, if diagnosed as a factual matter
   before enactment, would have avoided both the 2012 and 2014 harm and the
   state's unnecessarily burdensome reliance on a showing of intent. Method
   We recount the legal focus on intent, apply the McDonald-Best equal vote
   weight effects test standard to the Florida facts, and use more than
   25,000 simulated districting plans to check on whether there was a
   gerrymander effect. Results We find a pro-Republican gerrymander effect
   could have been detected in advance of enacting Florida's redistricting
   plan. Conclusion In specific reference to Florida, we conclude the
   enacted districts could have been identified as a gerrymander
   beforehand, allowing court proceedings to move expeditiously and with a
   clear focus. As a general matter, we conclude a comprehensive approach
   to gerrymandering is best served by following a two-part prescription:
   (1) set an effect standard for identifying a gerrymander and (2) know
   the intent by checking the facts against the standard.},

Abstract = {We present the basic framework of psychological game theory (PGT) and
   linkages to the public choice literature. The distinction between PGT
   and other game-theoretic frameworks rests on the inclusion of beliefs
   about strategies directly within the players' objective functions. Thus,
   a natural extension of PGT includes the consideration of non-monetary
   drivers of behavior. We provide examples of applications in public
   choice.},

Abstract = {Objective This article evaluates Evenwel v. Abbott to determine how and
   why the U.S. Supreme Court reached the decision it did in determining
   whether the appropriate database for a state to utilize in redistricting
   is the total population count or the American Community Survey's
   five-year estimates. At the core of the decision was whether
   apportionment was based on participation or representation, voters or
   total population. Method A qualitative analysis of plaintiff and
   defendant arguments and the district court's and U.S. Supreme Court's
   decisions. Additionally, a discussion of the accuracy of the American
   Community Survey's five-year estimate is presented. Conclusion The final
   decision was a decisive unanimous decision where the Court concluded,
   citing historical, constitutional precedence and traditional
   redistricting practices, that total population generated by the U.S.
   Census Bureau every decade was to be used as the base data for
   redistricting. The Supreme Court definitively stated that apportionment
   and redistricting were designed as representational mechanisms for all
   persons counted by the Bureau of the Census and not simply voters.},

Abstract = {Although two-round voting procedures are common, the theoretical voting
   literature rarely discusses any such rules beyond the traditional
   plurality runoff rule. Therefore, using four criteria in conjunction
   with two data-generating processes, we define and evaluate nine ``runoff
   pair selection rules{''} that comprise two rounds of voting, two
   candidates in the second round, and a single final winner. The four
   criteria are: social utility from the expected runoff winner (UEW),
   social utility from the expected runoff loser (UEL), representativeness
   of the runoff pair (Rep), and resistance to strategy (RS). We examine
   three rules from each of three categories: plurality rules, utilitarian
   rules and Condorcet rules. We find that the utilitarian rules provide
   relatively high UEW and UEL, but low Rep and RS. Conversely, the
   plurality rules provide high Rep and RS, but low UEW and UEL. Finally,
   the Condorcet rules provide high UEW, high RS, and a combination of UEL
   and Rep that depends which Condorcet rule is used.},

Abstract = {Studies on Albanian historiography during communism have so far focused
   primarily on its main narratives. This paper shifts the research focus
   towards the actual conditions under which historiography was produced,
   paying particular attention to historians' relationship with political
   power. It shows that Albanian historiography went through five stages,
   each of which substantially shaped historians' positions, and that the
   relationship between the Party and historians was complex and
   bi-directional. The regime intimidated historians and strictly
   controlled their work, but also bestowed on them immense resources and
   high cultural authority. Historians, for their part, were interconnected
   with the regime in many ways and loyal to it, while simultaneously
   determined to make use of the conditions they found themselves in to
   advance their own interests. On the whole, historians' relationship with
   political power was multifaceted and predominantly shifted between
   subordination and symbiosis.},

Abstract = {The 2019 European Parliament (EP) election in Lithuania was a
   second-order event significantly affected by domestic political
   developments and agendas. As with all previous EP elections, it
   attracted a minimal level of public attention in Lithuania, creating
   challenges and opportunities for Lithuanian political groups to
   effectively reach their electorates. This article focuses on the
   emotional display patterns of the campaign messages of political parties
   during the 2019 European Parliamentary campaign in Lithuania. To this
   end, it applies Lasswell's model of communication to assess printed
   media- and social-network-based campaign materials. Findings confirm
   that emotional messages dominated the communication of the political
   groups to their voters, and show the extremely broad spectrum of
   political messages that were used to arouse emotions. The study
   indicates that the concept of Europe remains distant and abstract to
   voters in Lithuania. Politicians' messages to voters overwhelmingly
   appealed to the European context when addressing domestic agendas,
   thereby exploiting the emotional aspects of domestic political
   discourses in Lithuania and the perception of the EU in the country.
   Finally, the study demonstrates that the personification of political
   strategies involving politicians' charisma, public image, and
   expressivity were key elements in terms of the election outcome.},

Abstract = {In Vietnam, the awareness of the rule of law is a process of acquiring
   and applying Western legal theory to specific conditions of the country.
   This is reflected first in Ho Chi Minh's views on the state and the law.
   In spite of not using the term ``rule of law{''}, from a very early
   stage, on the basis of acquiring Marxism-Leninism and the progressive
   ideas of humankind, Ho Chi Minh advocated building a new democratic
   state. In that state, people act as the sole and supreme subjects of
   state power; the constitution and laws have an important role in
   society; democracy becomes a decisive factor in a law-governed society,
   etc. These ideas contributed to the theoretical improvement of the rule
   of law, being inherited and creatively applied by the Party and State of
   Vietnam in the process of building the socialist rule of law today.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the origins of physician-patient privilege in the
   United States. It concentrates an 1828 New York law that protected
   medical confidentiality in the courtroom-the first statutory guarantee
   of physician-patient privilege-as well as the rapid spread of privilege
   statutes throughout the nineteenth century. Using the published notes of
   the authors of New York's influential statute alongside other primary
   sources, I argue that these early statutes are best explained as the
   result of nineteenth-century efforts to codify American law. The medical
   profession took little note of physician-patient privilege until much
   later, indicating that privilege emerged not as a protection of doctors'
   professional status, nor as a means of protecting patients in the
   courtroom, but rather as an inadvertent offshoot of attempts to
   streamline and simply judicial proceedings. It is perhaps because of
   these unsystematic origins that physician-patient privilege still
   remains such an unevenly applied rule in American courtrooms.},

Abstract = {Objective I theorize that as nationalization increases, state
   legislatures will take less legislative actions related to local topics
   and take more legislative actions on divisive, national issues.
   Method To measure nationalization I use election data as well as data on
   mass partisanship in a state. To measure a state's legislative agenda, I
   use data on legislative actions collected from LexisNexis. For my
   statistical analysis, I use two-way linear fixed effects regression.
   Results I find that as nationalization increases, legislatures take less
   legislative actions pertaining to education, transportation, and
   localities. I also find that as nationalization increases,
   Republican-controlled states increase the number of legislative actions
   related to abortion.
   Conclusion Taken together, the article provides evidence that
   nationalization delocalizes the agenda and places on the agenda issues
   associated with the national partisan conflict.},

Abstract = {We analyze in how far market perceptions of actual financial integration
   affect EU integration support at the country level. As indicators of
   realized states of integration in financial markets we rely upon yield
   differentials of long-term government debt. To identify particular
   situations that could undermine the integration process, we suggest a
   new measure of EU integration risks that fulfills a number of properties
   which are desirable to ensure its informational value. Our results
   indicate that tensions to finance public debt in integrated financial
   markets are the main contributor to weakened support for EU integration.
   Particularly, large yield spreads increase the polarization on this
   issue at the country level. Moreover, as a confirmation of a-priori
   expectations, we find that the national support for EU integration sees
   a fostering in times of economic upswing and under beneficial structural
   EU funding. These results indicate that it becomes crucial to monitor
   increasing international yield differences as they could prepare the
   ground for claims for EU disintegration policies, thereby, threatening
   future advances of the EU integration project.},

Title = {Motivations for Social Interaction: The Case of Pokemon Go After the Fad

Abstract = {Objective We survey Pokemon Go players regarding motivations/patterns of
   gameplay and sociability over time to understand human interaction in
   augmented game settings. We disentangle effects of solo versus social
   and past versus current gameplay through replication of the Pokemon Go
   Motive Scale.
   Methods We use OLS regression to determine how motivation affects hours
   of gameplay, to measure changes in hours spent playing Pokemon Go, and
   to capture perceptions of engagement with the game over time.
   Results We find seven motivations: exercise, fun, escapism, nostalgia,
   friendship maintenance, relationship initiation, and achievement.
   Initiating new relationships leads to increased social playing time and
   increased perceptions of Pokemon Go as both interesting and challenging.
   Conclusion Intrinsic rewards hold the most staying power as a distinct
   motivation for gameplay. Implications go beyond Pokemon Go gaming to
   shed light on the differential impact of human motivation for social
   interaction in games that utilize augmented reality.},

Title = {Cooperation with Police in China: Surveillance Cameras, Neighborhood
   Efficacy and Policing},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {1},
Pages = {433-453},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective Given the paucity of research on Chinese cooperation with the
   police and the underdevelopment of knowledge on the influence of
   surveillance videos on such cooperation, this study investigates the
   interplay of surveillance cameras and neighborhood collective efficacy,
   police fairness, and police effectiveness in shaping public willingness
   to cooperate with the police.
   Methods Relying on face-to-face survey interview data collected from 751
   residents in a southern city in China, this study used Ordinary Least
   Squares (OLS) regression analysis to examine the key correlates of
   Chinese willingness to cooperate with the police.
   Results The results reveal positive influences of video surveillance,
   collective efficacy, police fairness, and police effectiveness on
   cooperative desires. Notably, the cooperation-promoting effect of
   surveillance cameras is most profound among people who live in
   neighborhoods with high levels of collective efficacy and people who
   perceive low levels of police fairness.
   Conclusion These findings affirm that formal and informal social control
   interlock in determining the public's cooperative willingness, and
   reiterate the need for testing theoretical interactions. They also help
   us understand the underlying reasons that may explain the public's
   reliance on video surveillance to make their decisions about helping the
   police in the context of China.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to the book symposium on Julian
   Culp's Democratic Education in a Globalized World. In this paper we
   introduce the themes and core claims of Culp's book, sketch the
   contributions made by authors of this symposium, and highlight the
   plausibility of the book's significance for debates in political
   philosophy, philosophy of education, educational public policy, as well
   as for the practice of political education. The issue includes three
   critical essays by Michael Festl, Martin Beckstein, and Michael Geiss as

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},

Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {6-15},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Galeotti argues that we can gain a better understanding of political
   decision making by drawing upon the notion of self-deception and offers
   a rich articulation of what self-deception is, and how and why it exerts
   influence upon political decision making, especially in high-stakes
   contexts where the decision seems to be counter to rationality. But such
   contexts are also explicable from a different perspective, with
   different theoretical resources. In recent years the field of `virtue
   epistemology' has discussed a wide range of epistemic vices - traits of
   character, and cognitive strategies, that stand in the way of gaining
   knowledge. This raises questions about how an explanation of political
   decision making in terms of self-deception relates to an explanation in
   terms of epistemic vice. Because the notion of epistemic vice applies to
   self-deception and to other cognitive deficiencies, it is argued that
   the broader notion of epistemic vice might be explanatorily richer, and
   more useful.},

   Socio-economic Perspective and Policies},

Abstract = {How can we explain the neoliberal orientation of Islamist movements in
   the Middle East? This paper attempts to answer this question by
   exploring the case of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. It analyzes in
   depth the Brotherhood's socio-economic vision and policies when it was
   in power between 2012 and 2013. It argues that the Brotherhood adopted a
   market-oriented vision, which encouraged the private sector, liberalized
   the economy, and appealed to foreign investments. As a socio-political
   movement, the Brotherhood attempted to strike a balance between its
   constituency, which is rooted in the lower, middle, and upper-middle
   classes, and its commitment to neoliberal policies. However, this
   paradoxical balance burdened the movement and affected its popularity.
   The article also contends that the Brotherhood's neoliberal leanings can
   be explained by three key factors: the movement's pragmatism, its
   ``devout{''} bourgeoisie, and the appeal for international acceptance
   and recognition.},

Abstract = {Why do some authoritarian states adopt shoot-to-kill policies at their
   borders, while others do not when they are equally interested in
   reinforcing their borders? This study makes a novel contribution to the
   literature of state-sanctioned border violence by laying out a causal
   linkage between the extent of domestic repression and the authoritarian
   states' willingness to implement shoot-to-kill policies at their
   borders. Drawing upon a constructivist framework, we argue that in
   states where violence is routinely applied in addressing domestic
   political conflicts, this violent norm has implications for
   authoritarian states' and their border practices. We find a positive
   relationship between violent repression and shoot-to-kill policies, and
   do so by analysing 58 authoritarian states' border-reinforcement
   strategies between 1990 and 2017.},

Abstract = {Strikes, just as other types of conflict, used to be difficult to
   explain from an economic perspective. Initially, it was thought that
   they were a result of mistakes or irrationality. Then, during the 1980s
   an explosion of research brought asymmetric information to prominence as
   a significant cause of strikes. After reviewing such long-standing
   potential explanations, we go over some more recent ones. When a strike
   changes the future strategic positions of unions relative to firms
   compared to a bargain, then a strike can ensue; significantly, the more
   important the future is considered to be (i.e., the higher is the
   discount factor), the more likely a strike is. In a new model we show
   how solidarity based on identification with the union can lead to
   strikes. Additionally, power asymmetries, reputation-building, and
   internal union politics can account for strikes within a
   rational-choice, economic perspective.},

Abstract = {Many European countries are changing political boundaries at the local
   government level. Reforms consolidating local jurisdictions have
   recently been implemented in a number of countries, and more
   mergers/amalgamations are ongoing. We examine whether citizens'
   attachment to their local political unit is affected when municipal maps
   are redrawn. Our study is based on a dataset from Danish local
   governments with survey data from before and after a major reform of
   municipal mergers, and the traditional endogeneity problems are thereby
   circumvented. Drawing on Scannell and Gifford's tripartite model of
   person, place and process, we find that person characteristics affect
   local territorial attachment as well as the intersection between places
   of residence and the processes leading to the new jurisdiction. It is
   not an increase in the absolute size of the municipality (i.e., place)
   or the amalgamation as such (i.e., process) that affects the level of
   attachment, but rather the relative size of the former municipality
   compared to the new municipality and thereby the specifics of the
   redrawing of boundaries. When smaller municipalities are amalgamated
   with larger municipalities, the local territorial attachment decreases
   among citizens living in the smaller municipalities but not among
   citizens living in the larger municipalities.},

Title = {`Frack off': Towards an anarchist political ecology critique of
   corporate and state responses to anti-fracking resistance in the UK},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper puts forward an anarchist political ecology critique of
   extreme energy extractivism by examining corporate and state responses
   (or `political reactions from above') to anti-fracking resistance in the
   UK. The planned drilling for unconventional gas and oil through
   hydraulic fracturing has triggered unprecedented opposition, with
   protest camps, direct actions, and legal challenges disrupting
   operations and slowing down planning and exploration development.
   Drawing on green anarchist thought, critiques of extractivism, statism,
   and industrialism, and a (corporate) counterinsurgency framework, I
   examine the strategies adopted by drilling companies and state actors to
   manage resistance and win the `hearts and minds' of the population,
   deploying tactics from greenwashing in local schools to harsh policing
   of dissent. The latter has included the criminalisation and
   stigmatisation of land defenders, targeting campaigners as `domestic
   extremists', physical abuse, targeting protesters with disabilities, and
   entering public-private security partnerships with local police forces
   which involve the `outsourcing' of police communication to drilling
   companies. Such actions are complimented by the contracting of PR firms,
   lobbying, sponsorships of sports clubs and school competitions,
   `astroturfing', and influencing local so-called democratic procedures.
   This has gone hand in hand with political efforts to classify operation
   sites as `Nationally Significant Infrastructure projects' to facilitate
   the suppression of protest. These strategies are embedded in a recently
   well-documented history of police infiltration and corporate spying,
   laying bare an unapologetic commitment to sacrifice human and nonhuman
   wellbeing for industrial growth, commitment to extractivist ideology and
   centralisation of power at the cost of further eroding local autonomy
   and control.},

Abstract = {This paper combines the `local turn' in the study of migration policy
   with the `practice turn' in EU studies by analysing the humanitarian
   practices applied in the Sicilian city of Siracusa in the years
   2013-2018. The primary interest of this research is to explore the
   practices by which the local community responded to the migration crisis
   in the Mediterranean and the contribution provided to migration
   governance by border cities such as Siracusa. It seeks to test the
   hypothesis that local communities are better apt to react to the
   emergency. While scholarly attention has focused extensively on the
   explanation of the multiple causes of migration as a global phenomenon,
   the practices adopted to manage migration still deserve investigation.
   Migration governance relies upon practices, i.e. competent performances,
   existing or emerging `on the ground', to effectively address the
   phenomenon. By deconstructing the dynamics involving the European Union,
   decentring the study of migration governance in the Mediterranean allows
   us to go beyond the lack of EU policy-response to explore the local
   levels where politics takes place. Drawing on interviews with local
   actors, or international and national ones acting locally, the article
   explores the interaction among stakeholders in a practical context where
   actors, as members of a `community of practice', are involved in a
   process of `learning by doing'. Empirical research demonstrates that the
   actors' role in addressing the crisis, their ideas and know-how, have
   shaped migration governance and developed community practices in a
   process of `learning by doing'. It suggests further empirical research
   to test whether an emergency operational model - consisting of competent
   performances, routine practices and procedures to be adopted in other
   areas and cases, has emerged in this Sicilian border city.},

Abstract = {Although images have always been part of politics, research on the
   visual aspects of political communication recently gained momentum,
   especially with the spread of social media-based political
   communication. However, there are still several significant research
   gaps in this field. The aim of this article is to identify and compare
   the patterns and effects of Hungarian politicians' (n= 51) image-based
   communication on Facebook (n= 2,992) and Instagram (n= 868) during the
   Hungarian parliamentary election campaign in 2018. By doing so, we shed
   light on two important dimensions of personalization: individualization
   and privatization. This work is designed to fill three gaps in the
   literature. We argue that existing research of visual political
   communication (1) treats images predominantly as illustrations, (2) is
   limited to single-platform studies, and (3) does not investigate the
   engagement effects of images. To move beyond these limitations, this
   study investigates images as objects of interest on their own; it adopts
   a cross-platform comparative approach and examines the engagement
   effects of visual cues by applying a combination of inductive and
   deductive qualitative content analysis. Our results show that images are
   often used to personalize communication. While on Facebook the
   individualization dimension of personalization is more common and
   popular, on Instagram its privatization dimension prevails. Furthermore,
   on Facebook, users like more politics-related candidate-centered images,
   but on Instagram we could not find similar effects for more informal
   visuals.},

Title = {Voting by Mail and Ballot Rejection: Lessons from Florida for Elections

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and its concomitant need for social distancing
   have increased the attractiveness of voting by mail. This form of voting
   is nonetheless not a panacea for election administration in the time of
   a public health crisis, as a widespread move to ballots cast by voting
   by mail risks exacerbating existing inequities in mail-in ballot
   rejection rates across voters and jurisdictions. This motivates our
   examination of the roughly 9.6 million and 8.2 million ballots cast in
   the 2016 and 2018 general elections in Florida, respectively, including
   over 2.6 million vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots cast in each. Using a
   selection model that analyzes all ballots cast and those VBM ballots not
   counted in Florida in these two elections, we find that younger voters,
   voters not registered with a major political party, and voters in need
   of assistance when voting are disproportionately likely to have their
   VBM ballots not count. We also find disproportionately high rejection
   rates of mail ballots cast by Hispanic voters, out-of-state voters, and
   military dependents in the 2018 general election. Lastly, we find
   significant variation in the rejection rates of VBM ballots cast across
   Florida's 67 counties in the 2018 election, suggesting a non-uniformity
   in the way local election officials verify these ballots. As interest in
   expanding mail voting swells as a consequence of the novel coronavirus,
   protecting the rights of all voters to participate in electoral politics
   requires a characterization of the correlates of VBM ballot rejection
   with an eye toward considering how disparities in ballot rejection rates
   might be rectified.},

Abstract = {In the United States, religious elites routinely use prayer to set and
   communicate political agendas, shape the opinions of Christian publics,
   and mobilize political activism. Among political prayers distributed to
   believers, imprecation is rare. In this paper, I examine a set of cases
   of imprecatory political prayers publicized since the turn of millennium
   that have undeniable U.S. political subtexts and objects. Using the work
   of James Scott and Jan-Werner Muller, I argue that most political
   prayers of imprecation can fruitfully be read as manifestations of
   right-wing populism. These prayers reveal a hidden transcript of rage
   aimed not only at mainstream political arrangements and political elites
   but also at the comparatively polite discourse characteristic of
   mainstream U.S. Christian traditions, including much Christian
   conservatism.},

Abstract = {This article uses the Palazzo della Civilta Italiana (PdCI) in the Rome
   suburb of EUR as a case study to explore how Italians have negotiated
   the ``difficult heritage{''} of Fascism since 1945. Following Sharon
   Macdonald, the paper understands the term difficult heritage to refer to
   a historically significant past that remains materially visible through
   sites, buildings, artworks, monuments and other artefacts, but which is
   difficult to reconcile with ``a positive, self-affirming contemporary
   identity{''}. The paper employs a biographical approach to reveal and
   analyse the post-Fascist ``lives{''} of the PdCI, one of the most
   recognisable - and, in recent decades, most admired - examples of
   Fascist monumental architecture in Italy. With reference also to other
   examples of difficult Fascist heritage in Italy, and to sites associated
   with the difficult heritage of Nazism in Germany, the paper offers new
   insights into how Italy has confronted its Fascist past and places the
   Italian experience of difficult heritage within the broader
   international context.},

Abstract = {This article examines how user comments influence assessment of public
   opinion climate and perceived support for one's opinion. The effects of
   user-comment sentiment (positive vs. negative) and of user-comment
   content (with or without personal exemplification) were tested with an
   online experiment (n = 1,510). Results show that user-comment effects on
   estimates of public opinion depend mainly on the sentiment of the
   comments and not on their framing as opinions with or without personal
   exemplification. Negative comments significantly reduce readers'
   estimation of public opinion support of the issue dealt with by the
   article and affect the perceived support of one's opinion. Study results
   refer to the possible dangers in user comments deliberate manipulation
   in democratic public discussion.},

Abstract = {Janos Kornai chose to become an economist after reading Karl Marx'sDas
   Kapital. Kornai's relation with Marx is not merely political, but also
   professional. Kornai ``broke with Marxism{''} in 1956, but his
   relationship with Marx's thoughts were not severed then. Kornai's
   post-1956 works can be examined in the light of Marx's ideas, dealing
   particularly with equity, freedom and the relation between theory and
   practice. Some of Marx's own theses can be enriched interestingly by
   taking note of Kornai's later writings.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {867-886},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {The paper examines the recent security interventions at the northern
   Finnish-Swedish border crossing point in the town of Tornio, the
   particular focus being on the 2015 migration influx in which Finland
   received a tenfold increase in asylum applications compared with the
   previous years (\~{}3000 -> 32 476 asylum applicants). The resultant
   securitization of the Finnish-Swedish border and the organization of
   asylum reception practices, in which nongovernmental organizations
   played an important role, created tension between the Finnish and
   Swedish authorities, borderlanders, and within wider Finnish society. An
   empirical study of various materials (documents, interviews, social
   media debates and media reports) is used to examine the coexistence and
   intertwining of different border securitization practices and
   discourses. The analysis is structured around three story lines that
   disclose border securitization as multiple and aims to problematize the
   assumption that states, as entities holding sovereign authority, fully
   determine matters of border securitization. Firstly, the state
   intervention examined here occurred through and fully depended on
   collaboration with local authorities and nongovernmental actors.
   Secondly, nationalistic groups mobilized demonstrations against
   immigration and started independent street patrols in the name of
   security, throwing into question the effectiveness and authority of the
   state government in matters of border securitization. Thirdly, the
   discourses of the securitized Finnish-Swedish border reflect the wider
   solidarity crisis between EU countries with respect to shared
   sovereignty. The study complicates the understanding of border
   securitization as a straight forward state effort and provides a picture
   of a hybrid border securitization environment.},

Title = {What Makes News Newsworthy: An Experimental Test of Where a News Story

Abstract = {Previous research has attributed media convergence to, among other
   things, where the news was originally published. That research, however,
   has struggled to identify causal relationships between a news item's
   publication in a particular outlet and journalists' perceptions of a
   story's newsworthiness. This relationship is difficult to identify
   because of the correlation between publication in a particular outlet
   and many other factors that also impact newsworthiness. This paper uses
   an experiment embedded within a survey of over 1,500 U.S. political
   journalists to test the impact of a news story's previous publication
   history on journalists' views of the newsworthiness of that news item.
   Compared with previously unpublished stories, the publication of a news
   story in a national paper has no significant positive effect on the
   perceived newsworthiness of a story. The origin of a story in a local
   outlet, however, causes journalists to perceive that story to be less
   newsworthy.},

Abstract = {Radical right populist parties claim to act on behalf of people who need
   to be protected from a series of risks initiated by `others'. Border
   control is a key topic in the narratives developed by these movements in
   Europe. However, populist parties located in different states can shape
   a cohesive discourse across state borders with regard to the protection
   of the people. They consequently forge a discursive `chain of
   equivalence' (Laclau \& Mouffe, 1985, p. 144) implying the reduction of
   state-bounded differences while preserving some territorial
   singularities. This process, which can be termed `meta-populism' (de
   Cleen, 2017, p. 356) supposes a series of interactions, which are not
   often analysed in Europe's borderlands. Based on a Critical Discourse
   analysis, we investigate the building-up of transregional meta-populism
   powered by two regionalist parties positioned in different states, but
   located in a single European area: the Regio Insubrica in-between Italy
   and Switzerland.},

Abstract = {Objective In this study, we explore how daily Internet and social media
   use are related to feeling addicted to technological devices and
   describe the sociodemographic indicators of device addiction for U.S.
   adults. Methods Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults,
   we estimate a series of logistic regression analyses predicting device
   addiction. Results We find that social media use, rather than Internet
   use alone, is a stronger indicator of device addiction. Women report
   more addiction than men, and employment and education are both
   associated with increased addiction. Results describe device addiction
   as a felt reality for U.S. adults of all ages, while also noting
   particular social and demographic class characteristics for which these
   dilemmas may be more acute. Conclusion ``iAddiction{''} appears to be
   endemic to general conditions of postscarcity and concentrated in those
   with particularly high situations of ontological security. Directions
   for constructive theory building in the sociology of technology are
   elaborated.},

Abstract = {We examine the role that emotion plays in understanding people's
   reactions to the presidential candidates during two of the three general
   election debates between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary
   Clinton. To measure the impact of emotions on people's attitudes toward
   the candidates, we run studies at two large public universities. We are
   able to measure changes in attitudes and responses to the candidates
   after exposure to each debate. In addition, we explore real-time
   reaction to the candidates by employing facial expression software to
   assess people's emotional responses during the debate. We show that
   people who watched the first and third presidential debate are much more
   likely to change their evaluations of the presidential rivals, compared
   to people who did not view these debates. We also show that people's
   displays of emotion are related to their willingness to change their
   views of the candidates. For example, when people are displaying anger
   and joy, they are less likely to change their evaluations of the
   presidential candidates during the course of the debate. Furthermore, we
   find that when people show fear and sadness, their views of the
   candidates become less polarized over the length of the debates. These
   results show how different emotions influence the candidate evaluation
   process.},

Abstract = {This article challenges two orthodox views of Political Scientists
   concerning the roots of Euroscepticism. First, it contests that
   Euroscepticism originated in the UK in 1980s and was primarily advocated
   by British political parties and the Thatcher government. If defined as
   an opposition to the federalist European idea, Euroscepticism can indeed
   be traced back to the very beginning of the European integration process
   after the Second World War and can then be continuously followed up
   until today. Second, it questions the so-called end of the permissive
   consensus in the 1990s and argues that, if public opposition against the
   EU has indeed amplified since then, this is primarily due to the
   frequent organization of referenda. Third, whereas Eurosceptic political
   parties have gained increasing support in the European elections since
   the 2000s, the possibility of the European people to express their
   anti-European feelings has already existed since the introduction of
   European direct elections in 1979. Finally, the article identifies a
   rather paradoxical link between European elections and Euroscepticism,
   especially when considering the high degree of abstentions.},

Abstract = {After decades of scholarship, there is still little agreement about the
   usefulness of territorial self-governance in managing territory-centred
   conflicts. We argue that the effectiveness of territorial
   self-governance as a tool of territory-centred conflict management
   increases when combined with a proportional representation (PR)
   electoral system for the national legislature in basically open
   political regimes, but not when combined with a parliamentary form of
   government at the centre. We propose that the combination of territorial
   self-governance and PR in at least minimally democratic regimes has most
   conflict-reducing potential, as both institutions follow a logic of
   widening the input side of representative politics. We find empirical
   support for this proposition using binary time-series cross-section
   analysis is found. Our findings highlight the need to consider not just
   the number but, more importantly, the type of power-sharing institutions
   that are combined with each other when looking for ways to reduce the
   risk of territory-centred intrastate violence.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a systemic conception of freedom as
   non-domination. It does so by engaging with the debate on the so-called
   coalition problem. The coalition problem arises because non-domination
   holds that groups can be agents of (dominating) power, while also
   insisting that freedom be robust. Consequently, it seems to entail that
   everyone is in a constant state of domination at the hands of potential
   groups. However, the problem can be dissolved by rejecting a `strict
   possibility' standard for interpreting non-domination's robustness
   requirement. Frank Lovett and Philip Pettit propose to restrict the
   relevant domain of possible worlds by reference to two epistemic
   conditions pertaining to potential group members. I argue that this
   strategy unduly limits non-domination's critical potential. I then argue
   that a suitably systemic conception of domination avoids this problem.
   By placing explanatory emphasis on social institutions, and how these
   bear on the feasibility of individual and collective action, a systemic
   conception of non-domination avoids the coalition problem in a way that
   retains its critical potential. The article clarifies the relationship
   between the rule of law and the social norms and objects to the claim
   that non-domination is bound to deem the latter irrelevant from the
   point of view of freedom.},

Title = {Disastrous hydropower, uneven regional development, and decolonization
   in India's Eastern Himalayan borderlands},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sikkim, a small Eastern Himalayan state in India has twenty-seven
   hydropower projects proposed under the Indian Power Ministry's
   hydropower initiative that envisions the Himalayan region as the
   country's ``future powerhouse{''} (Dharamadhikary 2008; Kohli, 2011). In
   2011, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake rocked Sikkim, the epicenter of which
   was located eerily close to two under construction dams and the Dzongu
   reserve, revered as sacred by Sikkim's Indigenous minority Lepchas.
   Drawing on interviews with Lepcha residents of Dzongu, and state
   geologists and disaster management officials, I center my analysis on
   their encounters with disasters and hydropower infrastructure. Building
   on decolonial theorizations and scholarship on Himalayan borderlands, I
   argue that disastrous hydropower forms on historical terrains shaped not
   only by geophysical conditions but also generations of uneven regional
   development, and the racialized colonial and postcolonial governance of
   the Eastern Himalayan frontier. In placing `disastrous' as a prefix to
   hydropower, I follow my interlocutors who implicate state and private
   developers in producing disaster conditions in Sikkim even as they evade
   culpability by discursively shifting blame onto the region's
   ``inhospitable terrain{''} (GoI 2008: 27). I demonstrate that despite
   key differences in their relation to state power both Dzongu Lepchas and
   Sikkimese technocrats, forward a materialist, place-based understanding
   of precarity, differential vulnerability, and uneven regional
   development. Centering Indigenous and regionalist critiques, I argue
   that the recent entry of hydropower development in the Eastern
   Himalayas, conceptualized by colonial authorities as India's ``Mongolian
   Fringe{''} (Baruah, 2013), requires a closer attention to the
   entanglements of frontier-making and racialization in India. More
   broadly, I demonstrate how disastrous hydropower development in a
   racialized frontier region offers a productive entry into decolonial
   theorizing in the Indian context.},

Title = {The role of ex-paramilitaries and former prisoners in political tourism},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Northern Ireland has a turbulent history, enduring 30 years of violence
   known as `The Troubles'. Streets in Belfast that were once `no-go' areas
   are now popular tourist attractions. They are the sites of
   assassinations, attempted murders and memorials to the dead - both those
   killed and those who killed. This article reports back on interviews and
   focus groups with ex-prisoners and ethnographic walks, participating in
   guided tours of streets, memorial sites and cemeteries, led by former
   paramilitaries turned tour guides. These local, sometimes controversial,
   figures play a key role in Belfast's tourist industry, letting those at
   the very centre of the conflict present and represent the city's dark
   and contentious history. In this article, we argue that `Troubles
   tourism' is not about glorifying or commodifying violence, as its
   critics have suggested (Northern Ireland Assembly, 2008; O'Doherty,
   2016; Tinney, 2017), but rather, it enables the contested nature of the
   conflict to be understood by allowing competing discourses to co-exist
   and divergent positions to be tolerated, which is politically important
   for peace. As such, post-conflict tourism requires a different
   analytical approach than that currently offered in the `dark tourism'
   literature, which often focuses on visitors' motivations and
   expectations, and the commodification of history. Instead, we suggest
   that increased attention be dedicated to the voices of those with
   previous experience of violence, and the potential of this to understand
   current ongoing struggle, as well as consider how tourism might
   contribute to community transition in a post-conflict context.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {After a long debate on wine import tariffs, the Italian Parliament
   rejected the Spanish-Italian trade agreement on 17 December 1905. This
   decision left Spain and Italy without a bilateral trade treaty for an
   entire decade. In the literature, broader political issues and local
   interests are alternatively indicated as the main drivers of the
   rejection. Based on a new database which collects economic and political
   variables (including MPs personal features) and using a probit model,
   this paper provides a quantitative analysis of the vote. Results show
   that constituency interests had a role in determining the result of the
   vote on the trade treaty. Moreover, constituency interests were also
   important for the ``vote switchers{''}, i.e. those MPs that supported
   the overall government policy stance in the first round, but opposed the
   Spanish-Italian trade agreement in the second.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do protests occur in civil wars? Evidence from
   case studies suggests that protests can indeed play an important role in
   contexts of civil wars, with civilians using respective tactics both
   against the state and rebels. We argue that localities experiencing
   armed clashes are likely to see protest events in the same month.
   Civilians conduct protests due to battle-related changes in the local
   opportunity structures and grievances related to losses experienced
   through collateral damage. Using spatially disaggregated data on protest
   and battle events in African civil wars, we find support for our
   hypothesis that battles trigger civilian protests. This effect is robust
   to the inclusion of a comprehensive list of confounding variables and
   alternative model specifications, including the use of different
   temporal and spatial units. Our findings highlight the role of the
   civilian population and the spatial relationship between war events and
   protests in civil wars.},

   Nigeria, this paper seeks to re-embed the concept of informality within
   institutional structures of political confinement, as well as in the
   situations in which exit is negotiated from the waste infrastructure. It
   examines how waste congestion in the West African metropolis has
   translated into a higher degree of political confinement and the
   occlusion of exit strategies in the waste sector. Through an empirical
   study of the city's state-recognized and alternative waste channels, it
   looks at the new political instruments deployed in order to secure
   impermeable waste channels managed by state-recognized actors. Such
   instruments have had a stark impact on the control of the waste sector
   as well as on that of monetary flows extracted from the management and
   situational mobilization of solid waste. The intrusion of institutional
   boundaries in the waste sector has pushed workers to renegotiate their
   positions amid new constraints, mobilizing new discourses to negotiate
   the tolerance of their activities. While leaks in the waste
   infrastructure are negotiated on an ad hoc basis, the limitations
   imposed by the Lagos state on exit strategies have triggered political
   instability and demand the development of new forms of political
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {Media attention is a scarce, yet attractive, resource for interest
   groups. Existing studies show that media attention is concentrated on a
   relatively small number of well-resourced groups, often representing
   economic interests. However, the literature still struggles to
   disentangle the reasons behind this bias in media attention. Is it
   explained by media selection practices or uneven interest group
   activity? We cannot separate these two possible mechanisms by simply
   studying aggregate levels of media attention. In this study, we
   therefore compare the set of groups that lobby in specific policy areas
   with the groups that appear in the news on issues related to those same
   policy areas. The investigation is based on data from Denmark and the
   United Kingdom. First, we use survey data to identify the policy areas
   in which groups actively lobby. Second, we identify groups' media
   appearances in news stories related to those same policy areas. Third,
   we compare diversity among the groups actively lobbying with the groups
   actually appearing in the news and investigate possible biases. We find
   that even when the analysis of media appearances is narrowed down to
   only those groups active in a policy area, the news media allow more
   access to well-resourced groups. However, in contrast to previous
   findings, differences in media appearances across interest group types
   are not reproduced. These results imply that media selection biases are
   mainly produced by varying lobbying resources rather than discrimination
   based on the type of interests that groups represent.},

Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, several theorists have defended a form of neutrality
   that seeks to equalise the benefits that state policies bestow upon
   citizens' conceptions of the good life. For example, when state policies
   confer special benefits upon a conception that revolves around a
   particular culture, religion or type of sports, other cultures,
   religions or types of sports might be due compensation. This article
   argues that this kind of neutrality - which I refer to as `hands-on
   neutrality' - cannot be vindicated, whether it takes a resourcist form
   or welfarist form. After explaining why states cannot simply avoid
   bestowing unequal advantages upon citizens' conceptions of the good
   life, I identify several versions of hands-on neutrality and show that
   all of them fail to respect the moral equality of citizens. (In so
   doing, however, I do find that a different form of neutrality is
   appropriately applied under a more limited set of conditions, which is
   lottery-based.) I conclude by showing that in cases where theories of
   hands-on neutrality have intuitive force, more plausible rival
   principles can account for our intuitions.},

   how it is perceived and experienced, lends insights into how nationalism
   and exclusion play out in everyday life. Contextualizing and nuancing
   broader issues of ``othering{''} and discrimination through sound
   demonstrates that exclusion is not always visual or overt. Based on
   three years of fieldwork and interviews with Indian Tamils living in the
   United States, this research examines the banality of nationalism in
   aural encounters. First, it highlights subtle othering and
   micmaggressions as well as their physical, emotional, and psychological
   effects. Second, it demonstrates how language and accent can be used to
   ``flag{''} otherness in ordinary daily interactions and spaces. Third,
   it shows how attention to aural `flagging' reveals nuance of complex
   identities often binarized during climates of heightened nationalism.
   Ultimately, this article demonstrates that the impacts of nationalism
   are embedded in people's daily lives and identities through subtle
   discriminatory aural encounters.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a unique approach to framing the political obligation
   social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have in a democratic
   society by casting the public sphere as a common-pool resource. Over the
   last decade or so much of our civic discourse has moved to social media
   platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. This paper argues that just as
   citizens have an obligation to one another, social media companies have
   an obligation to promote agonistic forms of civic, political discourse
   through their algorithms. This algorithmic obligation that social media
   companies have must be reconciled with social media companies'
   formulation of their fiduciary shareholder obligations. We posit that a
   commons based view of social media discourse allows these companies to
   make both a democratic health and fiduciary interest argument.},

Abstract = {In 1981, around fifty conservative southern Democrats in the House of
   Representatives, the so-called Boll Weevils, played a crucial role in
   the enactment of President Ronald Reagan's economic agenda. The
   significance of this episode has thus far been underappreciated. This
   article illustrates the importance of the Boll Weevils' support to the
   early success of Reagan's presidency, as well its implications for both
   the South's political landscape and for the national Republican Party.
   Though short-lived, this coalition would prove to be a significant
   rupture in the Democratic Party's superiority in the South at the
   congressional level and highlighted the partisan fragmentation the
   region was undergoing. As this article will demonstrate, the events of
   1981 returned southern conservatism to the center of power in Washington
   for the first time in over a decade and acted as a catalyst for a number
   of southern Democratic congressmen to move toward the GOP.},

Title = {``Like the father's home:{''} perceived state of the Turkish-Sunni
   community in Germany},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Focusing on a mosque organization, the Turkish-Islamic Union for
   Religious Affairs (DITIB), this paper engages with the Turkish-Sunni
   diaspora's complex perception of the `state' in Germany. DITIB is a
   Sunni-Islam based mosque organization that oversees over 900 mosques
   across Germany. However, the Turkish-Sunni diaspora does not consider
   DITIB mosques as simply religious or cultural spaces but instead
   attributes a highly complex quasi-stateness to it. My field research
   between 2016 and 2018 reveals that for this community, DITIB reflects an
   intimate familial version of the Turkish state in Germany. While DITIB
   has significant connections to the state in Turkey, based on my findings
   I argue that these connections alone do not explain why the diaspora
   perceive DITIB like a state. Rather, DITIB's perceived stateness has
   been constructed through a historical process that brings to the fore
   diasporic experiences, feelings, and memories centered at the
   ethnoreligious spaces of mosques. Thus, this research produces new
   questions for, and theoretical approaches to geographies of states,
   extending this literature's emphasis on everyday and intimate
   perspectives. I build on feminist geopolitics and diaspora studies to
   contribute to this scholarship by analyzing the role of feelings and
   memories in forming perceptions of the state. I explain how spaces of
   perceived states become fluid, cross the borders of officially defined
   national territories, and exceed the classical spaces and embodiment of
   states. Instead, spaces like mosques come to be perceived like a state
   through their association with care, unity, and a home. This analysis
   points to the emotional and memory-based production of what is perceived
   as a state and how those perceptions are formed.},

Abstract = {Do sovereign bond markets react systematically to microeconomic policy
   reforms? Some observers suggest that investors are very attentive to
   supply-side policies such as those related to labor markets, corporate
   taxation, and product standards. They argue that, along with
   macroeconomic outcomes and broad financial market conditions, such
   reforms affect sovereign bond premiums, for developed as well as
   emerging economies. In contrast, we predict few systematic effects of
   supply-side policy reforms on sovereign bond market outcomes. Our theory
   draws on a standard three-equation model of the economy, widely accepted
   among economic and finance professionals. That model makes few clear
   predictions regarding the anticipated effects of microeconomic policy
   changes; as a result, we expect that such reforms will not generate
   systematic market reactions. Our analyses, based on daily data from 37
   countries from 2004 to 2012, indeed reveal little evidence of a
   systematic bond market reaction to the 47 most significant reforms to
   corporate taxation and labor market regulation. These results call into
   question the notion that ``bond market vigilantes{''} play a central
   role in compelling governments to enact specific microeconomic policy
   changes.},

Abstract = {This article provides a poststructuralist analysis of the interplay
   among the EU's three temporal selves, elucidating how the ideal
   representations of the EU's past and future selves legitimize its
   statebuilding activities, particularly in cases of contested statehood
   in its neighbourhood, and reproduce the ideal European self today. The
   major argument of the article is that the discourse of ``successful
   peaceful European integration{''} (employed to construct the EU's past
   self) and the discourse on ``the EU's normative aspirations about
   state-/peace building{''} (employed to construct its future self) help
   constitute its present identity ``as representing peace{''} - and, thus,
   as ideal - and legitimize its statebuilding practices. The article takes
   the ideal constructions of the EU's past, present and future selves as
   spatio-temporal practices because they serve the continuous production
   and reproduction of the boundaries between a peaceful Europe and its
   conflictual others, which primarily refers to a
   geographical/geopolitical othering exercise.},

Abstract = {What accounts for the variation in EU actorness in cases of contested
   statehood in the European Neighbourhood? A comparative analysis of the
   EU's policies vis-a-vis three territorial conflicts - Kosovo, Abkhazia
   and Western Sahara - demonstrates the intricate relationship between
   external conditions and internal EU capability leading to substantial
   involvement, partial involvement or non-involvement in conflict
   management. Using insights from the EU actorness debate and the
   literatures on contested statehood and EU external governance, the paper
   offers a conceptualisation of the EU's conflict management role and a
   contingent explanation of the EU's varying commitment to managing
   conflicts in three cases of contested statehood. The paper finds that
   external determinants have a considerable weight in EU's policies which
   existing research tends to overlook owing to its predominant focus on
   EU's internal institutional procedures and instruments. It teases out
   the external action-enabling and action-hindering factors, in particular
   the external structural constraints arising from the nature of statehood
   contestation and the agency of other international and local players in
   the three conflicts in the European Neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {The contentiousness of markets has recently been assessed by the social
   movements literature. Activists can use a broad range of tactics to
   compel corporations to change their practices. This paper examines the
   outcomes of this contentiousness. It draws on an empirical study of a
   disruptive tactic used by anti-corporate activists: the shame-on-you
   prize. I propose to adopt an economic sociological perspective to
   understand the mechanisms by which social movement organizations seek to
   undermine the values that underpin the economic order. Activists provide
   new categories for valuating economic activities that challenge the
   existing ones. Social movement organizations legitimate these valuations
   as coming from civil society and reflecting public expectations about
   what should count in valuations of economic activities. As such, they
   may encourage public decision-makers to undertake regulatory action.},

Abstract = {Jews and Jewish institutions have suffered the majority of reported
   religion-motivated hate crimes in the United States for nearly two
   decades. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in 2014
   the 609 reported anti-Semitic incidents made up 59\% of all religious
   bias hate crimes alone. Rates of reported anti-Semitic hate crimes vary
   considerably over the course of a year. Yet, little scholarly attention
   has been given to what factors cause reported anti-Semitic hate crimes
   to fluctuate so substantially in the United States. This paper
   hypothesizes that violent Israeli military engagements are critical in
   explaining weekly surges of reported anti-Semitic hate crimes. Utilizing
   FBI hate crime data from 2001 to 2014 and fixed effects negative
   binomial regression models, consistent findings underscore that violent
   Israeli military engagements significantly increase the likelihood of a
   state reporting anti-Semitic hate crime. Most dramatically, their
   occurrence increases the likelihood of reported hate crime intimidating
   individuals or characterized as violent by nearly 35\%. This paper
   underscores that homeland perpetrated violence can directly impact the
   security of diaspora communities.},

Abstract = {Throughout the euro area crisis, the ECB broadened the scope of its
   instruments and enacted a series of non-standard measures to address
   financial fragmentation across jurisdictions and restore an appropriate
   degree of policy accommodation. The transmission of these measures
   through the currency union depends on the financial structure prevailing
   in various regions. This paper explores the country-specific
   macroeconomic transmission of selected non-standard measures from the
   ECB using a global DSGE model with a rich financial sector: we use the
   six-region multi-country model of Darracq Paries and Papadopoulou
   {[}2019] to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of asset purchase
   programmes as well as credit easing measures taken by the ECB since
   2014. The model accounts for credit and exchange rate channels of
   non-standard monetary policy measures. We show that the domestic
   transmission of the APP through the credit intermediation chain is
   significant and quite heterogenous across the largest euro area
   countries. The introduction of global portfolio frictions on euro area
   government bond holdings by international investors opens up for a
   larger depreciation of the euro which turns out to reinforce the
   macroeconomic propagation and narrow down the cross-country
   heterogeneity of the impacts.},

Abstract = {The question of identity narrative is at the core of the interaction
   between social movements and temporalities. In this paper, we draw on
   long-term qualitative research amongst activists engaged in Italian
   social movements and argue that identity narratives are often the result
   of a complex mnemonic, contradictory and open-ended process that spans
   through a life-time of engagement with multiple collectives. We then
   question whether the use of social media reshape these dynamics. The
   analysis shows that the construction of identity narratives on social
   media tends to take place with knowledge of the complexity and overlaps
   that characterise these processes online. Nevertheless, the temporality
   of social media, based on immediacy, archival and predictive time,
   challenges the unpredictable, contradictory, and open-ended nature of
   political identity construction offline. The need to escape the
   hegemonic temporalities of social media poses new challenges to
   activists in their creative agency.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the attractiveness of contemporary China's
   state-directed economic system beyond China's borders. It considers the
   political and economic affinities between China and Latin America and
   the Caribbean (LAC) in order to understand the allure of Chinese state
   capitalism in the region. Employing six broad governance variables, this
   project develops an empirically grounded tool - the Neoliberal-Dirigiste
   Continuum - to estimate the allure of Chinese state capitalism in 25
   countries within the region. Drawing on data from the Varieties of
   Democracy database, the Database of Political Institutions, the United
   Nations Comtrade database, the Academic Network of Latin America and the
   Caribbean on China Monitor (RED ALC-China), and the Inter-American
   Dialogue's China-Latin America Finance Database, this paper examines the
   relationship between LAC countries' political and economic organization
   and trade, Chinese outbound foreign direct investment, and the issuance
   of Chinese policy bank loans to LAC countries from 2005 to 2017. While
   the allure of Chinese state capitalism and its spread across the Global
   South over the last three decades is not specific to any one world
   region, examining the China-LAC political economic relationship in this
   context is useful because it represents a blending of the global and the
   contextual.},

Abstract = {Objective In this article, we analyze whether firms with market
   power-measured by their market share-fill top management positions
   differently than firms with no market power. Market power gives firms
   the opportunity to share rents with their employees. If these firms or
   their owners also have a taste for discrimination, they may share their
   rents in a discriminatory way. Using data from top-level collegiate
   athletics, we assess the effect of market power-measured by market
   share-on the relative employment and wages of female coaches. Methods To
   account for the potential endogeneity of market power and unobserved
   productivity of female coaches, we exploit the effect of an
   institutionalized cartel, that is, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS),
   on a college's athletic department market share. By exploiting
   particular organizational characteristics of the BCS as an exogenous
   shock, we establish a causal link between market power and female
   employment. Results Our results show that an increase in the market
   share has a negative effect on females relative to males among coaches.
   Conclusion We interpret this as evidence for Becker's (1957) theory on
   employer discrimination.},

Abstract = {This article uses the censuses of 1842 of Canada East (modern-day
   Quebec) and Canada West (modern-day Ontario) to help explain the
   historical differences in living standards between Canada and the United
   States. The wage and price data contained in the censuses suggest a gap
   of 42 percent between Canada East and Canada West. We argue that Canada
   East was substantially poorer than the rest of Canada and, as it
   represented such a large proportion of the total population of the
   initial four Canadian provinces (over 35 percent), that relative poverty
   weighed heavily in determining the extent of differences in living
   standards between Canada and the United States. These findings change
   the perspective on the roots of the differences between the two
   countries. We propose that any research agenda trying to explain those
   differences should focus heavily on Quebec.},

Title = {Early retirement incentive programs as a human resources restructuring

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the conceptual framework
   about human resources downsizing and restructuring and how organizations
   of the public sector can do that effectively and efficiently. These
   facts drive to the conclusion that the implementation of early
   retirement incentives requires the most elaborate planning and execution
   to be effective, predictable and safe in the long term.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts an analytical, descriptive
   methodology approach to describe the basic features of the data by using
   the descriptive research design. Data have been collected through
   different sources, which include secondary data, to introduce the
   theoretical literature of the subject as books, journals, articles,
   published working papers and referred previous studies related to the
   same subject. Findings Downsizing process is a deliberate administrative
   process that includes, but is not limited to, workforce reduction and is
   primarily aimed at achieving efficiency in public organizations. The
   definition of workforce downsizing may be narrowed to reducing the
   number of workers, or more likely to refer to general efforts to
   restructuring human resources in public organizations, Early Retirement
   Incentive Programs (ERIP) represents a viable alternative for
   organizations seeking to reduce staff. For the ERIP to be successful,
   the program coordinator must understand the business objectives and
   goals that the organization is trying to obtain. Originality/value Human
   resources strategies concerning downsizing public administration
   workforce should be more appropriate to those who leave the organization
   and those who stay at work, reducing the negative psychological,
   administrative and economical effects. This could be achieved through a
   strategy called early retirement incentive programs.},

Abstract = {The everyday practice of food sovereignty varies across place, and
   efforts to democratize food systems and create more holistic and
   equitable forms of food production and access are highly politicized.
   Considering the ``geo{''} of these practices assists with understanding
   how perceptions of place shape imaginaries about food sovereignty in
   place. Using the example of education-based food sovereignty tourism in
   Cuba I examine, in this paper, how outsiders from the US map
   geopolitical imaginaries onto Cuba in their efforts to see the ``real
   Cuba{''} and authentic food sovereignty practices. I argue that the
   myopic character of food sovereignty tours creates a re-writing of space
   based on participants' hopes and fears regarding agricultural production
   and consumption. Drawing on a feminist geopolitical framing, I use
   recent theorizations that consider geopolitical encounters via tourism
   to elucidate what I observed, which trended towards paternalistic
   geopolitical imaginaries of Cuba.},

Abstract = {We study how individual political preferences changed in response to the
   influx of over 3.5 million Syrian refugees to Turkey during 2012-2016.
   Using a difference-in-differences research design, we compare the
   political outcomes in geographic areas with high versus low intensities
   of refugee presence before and after the beginning of the Syrian Civil
   War. To address the endogeneity of refugees' location choices, we adopt
   an instrumental variables approach that relies on (1) historical
   dispersion of Arabic speakers in Turkish provinces and (2) driving
   distances between Turkish and Syrian residential areas to predict the
   flows of refugees across Turkish provinces during the study period. We
   find strong polarization in attitudes towards refugees between the
   supporters and opponents of the ruling Justice and Development Party
   (AKP). However, regression analyses of monthly survey data suggest that
   the massive inflow of refugees induced only a modest net drop in support
   for the AKP. Refugee inflows did not have a significant impact on
   election outcomes during the study period.},

Abstract = {Rent-seeking behavior can thrive in democratic and other forms of
   government where the government is able to hand out exclusive privileges
   or positions. One of the most famous examples is the venal aristocratic
   Ancien Regime of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France. This paper
   presents the Revolution as guided by private interests rather than as an
   uprising powered by aspirations of peasants for the provision of public
   goods. While taxation, income distribution, and multiple other causal
   factors played a role, opposition to rent seeking, from merchants,
   tradespeople, upper-income members of the Third Estate, and others
   negatively affected by French policies, was the tipping point leading to
   the Revolution in 1789. In constructing a public choice-based theory to
   make this argument, we bifurcate the mercantilism that characterized the
   French economy into seventeenth- and eighteenth-century types.},

Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Army recruiting, initial entry training, and retention enterprises
   consume tremendous manpower resources and become disproportionately more
   expensive and challenging as the size of the Army increases.
   Fortunately, empirical evidence suggests that the Army could readily
   improve enlisted continuation rates by changing enlistment contracts
   from its present form, requiring soldiers to reenlist or opt-in to
   continue service, to open-ended enlistment contracts that require
   soldiers to opt-out of service upon fulfilling their service
   obligations. Changing enlistment contracts to an opt-out
   paradigm-similar to how officer populations are currently managed-could
   greatly increase the number of soldiers who continue service past their
   initial enlistment obligation. Improved continuation rates could save
   the Army hundreds of millions in recruiting and reenlistment incentives,
   as well as freeing thousands of Non-Commissioned Officers serving as
   recruiters, drill sergeants, and retention specialist to support other
   operational requirements.},

Title = {Left justified: The early campaign for an international law response to
   Khmer Rouge crimes},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In April 1979, a mission of the International Association of Democratic
   Lawyers made a solidarity visit to Cambodia in the immediate aftermath
   of Khmer Rouge rule of the country. One of the mission members, John H.
   E. Fried, a former advisor to the United States' military trials at
   Nuremberg, was moved to subsequently advocate for United Nations
   recognition of the then ostracised Cambodian state. The crisis of
   post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia, and the political justifications made by
   early visitors there, illuminate late Cold War cultures of progressive
   international law scholarship and activism through their constitutive
   affects and material practices. While legal investigation of Khmer Rouge
   crimes is now largely understood through the frame of `transitional
   justice', this paper rejects such a framing. It argues instead for
   attention to Cambodia's early experiences, in which left legal activism
   - calling for Nuremberg's lessons to be applied to the violence
   perpetrated in Vietnam and Cambodia - played an important role. For
   scholars interested in post-1979 Cambodia, the Tuol Sleng Genocide
   Museum historical visitor books, recently digitised, promise insight
   into the multiple actors, motivations and understandings of
   international `early responders' to evidence of Khmer Rouge crimes.},

Abstract = {In this paper I defend the view that the democratic legitimacy of
   refugee admission policies requires the democratic inclusion of asylum
   seekers. I argue that this includes not only granting them formal
   participation rights, but also ensuring that they have a sufficient
   level of participatory capabilities to exercise these rights. This leads
   to the specific problem of asylum seekers with vulnerable minority
   backgrounds. Their participatory capabilities may be hindered by social
   injustice stemming from their state of origin which the receiving state,
   one might argue, has no duty to redress. Redressing inequalities that
   stem from social injustice in other states may be thought of as being
   beyond the limits of refuge, and therefore unreasonable to demand from
   receiving states. I propose a defence of what I call the Inclusion
   Thesis against this objection based on the idea that the democratic
   inclusion of asylum seekers is necessary for making sure that they can
   enjoy their basic right to have a say. Receiving states do not generally
   have a duty to rectify unjust inequalities among asylum seekers that
   stem from their states of origin. However, when this is necessary for
   making sure that they can enjoy their basic rights, they may be required
   to do so. Therefore, since receiving states have a duty to ensure that
   asylum seekers with vulnerable minority backgrounds can enjoy their
   basic right to have a say, they also have a duty to make sure that their
   participatory capabilities are equalized.},

Year = {2020},
Pages = {35-50},
Abstract = {During the course of revolutionary activities, the issue of liberating
   people and bringing happiness to people is the highest purpose of
   President Ho Chi Minh that he generalized into a humanistic philosophy.
   After all, the essence of it is problems of life and human being. In
   life and to be human, we need to love our country, our people, the
   suffering and oppressed humanity. Ho Chi Minh's thought about man and
   the liberation of man is the inheritance and development of traditional
   values of the nation and the quintessence of human cultural ideology,
   and at the same time acquires Marxist-Leninist doctrine about human
   being to be suitable with modern Vietnam historical and social
   conditions. Ho Chi Minh's thought on people and human liberation
   contents main ideas of Ho Chi Minh's conception on people (that is both
   a goal and a driver of revolution) and liberation of people ( for
   building new socialist people). The greatest and most sustainable value
   of Ho Chi Minh's thought about people and human liberation is the issue
   of promoting people's activeness, initiative, self-awareness and
   creativity in the revolutionary cause in Vietnam. Today that thought
   still holds its value, with great scientific and revolutionary
   significance in the cause of comprehensive national rennovation.},

Abstract = {In the current era of intensified immigration enforcement and heightened
   risks of deportation even for long-term lawful permanent residents,
   citizenship has taken on a new meaning and greater importance. There is
   also growing evidence that citizenship denials in their various forms
   have become inextricably linked to immigration enforcement. Who is
   denied citizenship, why, and under what circumstances? This chapter
   begins to address these questions by developing a typology of
   citizenship denials and providing an empirical overview of each type of
   citizenship denial. Taken together, the typology of citizenship denials
   and the accompanying empirical overview illustrate the close connection
   between immigration enforcement and citizenship rights in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {Established in 1944, the North Queensland Local Government Association
   made an impact on post-war reconstruction and northern development in
   Australia. The association modernised infrastructure and improved social
   conditions in Queensland's north, as well as launching an influential
   publicity campaign to promote a massive northern development scheme. In
   an era when federal proposals for developing Australia's northern
   regions often struggled to make a convincing case for Commonwealth
   investment, these were significant contributions to nation-building.
   Putting substance before parochialism, the association fostered
   cooperation among municipal authorities and patiently lobbied the
   Queensland government. But some members complained that their region was
   part of a ``neglected north{''} and called for a more assertive
   campaign. By the late 1950s, having developed regional infrastructure,
   grown in confidence, and looking for new challenges, the association
   shifted its lobbying to target the Commonwealth government. The change
   led to the `` People the North{''} publicity campaign, which influenced
   federal northern development policy. This article analyses the campaigns
   led by the North Queensland Local Government Association in the twenty
   years after 1944. It illuminates a neglected part of Australia's
   political history: the contribution of regional political voices from
   Australia's north to nation-building projects such as post-war
   reconstruction and northern development.},

Abstract = {In the following I would like to expose Julian Culp's normative
   argumentation to some empirical considerations. My commentary focuses on
   one of the central premises of the book: Culp assumes that education can
   make a decisive contribution to solving the current challenges in plural
   and globalized societies. He states that recent political philosophy has
   unacceptably neglected the issue of education. But the book's aim is not
   the theoretical determination of education itself. Rather, Culp is
   concerned with the question of giving education the right normative
   foundation to solve the social, ecological and democratic challenges the
   globalized world is currently facing. I don't think that one can or
   should discuss and analyse education without normative considerations.
   Educational thinking cannot do without a normative foundation and it is
   helpful and necessary to reflect upon them philosophically. This is the
   central concern of the book, and there is nothing to be added to it by
   historians or educational researchers. But a purely normative approach
   runs the risk of repeating many of the problems inherent in educational
   thinking. I think that even a normative approach would gain a lot from
   taking the empirical and historical boundaries of its subject more
   seriously than Culp does. Therefore, most of my remarks are about the
   relationship between normative theory and historical realities.},

Abstract = {The article examines the economic vision of the Tunisian Islamist party
   Ennahda focusing on its supposed transformation from a party with
   socialist rhetoric to one embracing fully the tenets of neo-liberalism.
   The article argues that such a transformation has been quite easy to
   achieve because the party and its leaders were always more pragmatic
   than ideological when it comes to economic policy-making. In fact, the
   party is more at ease with neo-liberal economics because of the
   electoral constituency it serves and because of its internal structure
   and ways of operating, which reward those members who display the
   virtues that the neo-liberal economy also values.},

Abstract = {The following is a critical reconstruction of the collaboration between
   Bauer and Marx between 1839 and 1842. The turbulences in the period in
   question reveal themselves in Marx's thought as well as in his
   relationship with Bruno Bauer. Correspondingly, Marx's detours, false
   paths, dead ends and abandoned work are therefore made the focus of this
   study. The ambivalent initial relations between the two of them, which
   both made their collaboration possible and hindered it, clearly go back
   further than 1841, when Bauer was not yet an atheist and was still a
   proponent of church doctrine. This was the Bruno Bauer that Marx had
   come to know in the Doctor's Club. We then meet Bauer the atheist at the
   end of 1839 or perhaps the beginning of 1840, as he was planning a
   comprehensive attack on orthodox theology and wanted Marx to fight on
   his side. This attack continued in Bauer's Trumpet and in lieges
   Doctrine.},

Abstract = {Existing research shows that ideological orientations are stable after
   young adulthood. Extending research on the sources of ideological
   stability, we examine social and economic ideology over a 3- to 4-year
   period in two twin panels (one Danish and one American). We find
   evidence for the importance of genetic influences and individual life
   experiences on the stability of social ideology in both contexts; shared
   environmental factors play an important role in the younger, Danish
   sample only. For economic ideology, genetic factors contribute to
   stability in the American sample only. Our findings show that the role
   of genetic and environmental factors in the stability of ideological
   orientations varies by type of ideology, national context, and,
   possibly, age cohort.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the visual self-representation of current Brazilian
   President Jair Bolsonaro, who is considered to be one of the exponents
   of the recent rise of rightwing neopopulism. Despite the growing body of
   literature analyzing contemporary populism, little has been said about
   the deployment of images in the construction of public meanings relevant
   to popular understandings of populist leaders. This research draws from
   the social media analysis of Casullo to investigate how the images
   posted on Bolsonaro's Instagram account show him (1) as a mirror of the
   people, (2) someone extraordinary, and (3) quick to appropriate symbols
   of power. Referencing the work of Butler, we document how the visual
   self-representation of Bolsonaro is marked by eccentricity and
   unsophistication, which makes his demeanor, body, and appropriation of
   institutional power function as a series of parodies. His performance
   hyperbolizes the transgressive aspect of populism, producing a
   vertiginous and pleasurable ambiguity toward the figure of the leader.
   In emptying the presidency from its extraordinary dimension, the parody
   paradoxically does something extraordinary by reestablishing the
   distance that it seeks to eliminate. His eccentric rejection of basic
   social standards, over-the-top masculinity, and impromptu use of
   everyday objects as props work to construct an image that he is just an
   ordinary man, extraordinarily occupying the presidency.},

Abstract = {Focusing on commercial office real estate as both a manifestation of and
   a conduit of cross-border capital flows, this paper refers to the
   concepts of topology and topography in a theoretical and empirical
   exploration of contemporary `network economy' spatial implications for
   the `polycentric urban region' (PUR). A body of research has cast doubt
   on the normative European representation of the multi-centre PUR as a
   balanced, sustainable spatial development model. Yet, the model has
   continued to be propagated in European territorial strategy and has been
   influential internationally. Academic perspectives and qualitative
   evidence reviewed in the paper shed a light on mutual dependencies and
   recursive relations between network economy global structural processes,
   international office real estate investment practices mediated by city
   governments, and the spatial configuration of density. Commercial
   investment and city planning actor practices chime with urban
   agglomeration, spatial concentration and density. Quantitative evidence
   of associations between urban density and office real estate investment
   returns and capital flows is found. It is concluded that network economy
   topology, politics and the city are in a dialectical relationship with
   the PUR territorial governance agenda for spatially balanced regional
   development.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we question a very deep-rooted bias in the economic
   literature with regard to conflict and revolution. Conflict in general
   and revolution in particular are not necessarily ``dark side of
   self-interest{''} or bad things. They may be sources of political and
   economic efficiency depending on their incidence on institutional
   change. Revolution escapes from Hirschman's dichotomous corrective
   mechanisms of ``voice{''} versus ``exit{''}. We consider revolution as
   scream exiting from existing rules and voicing new rules. Our
   theoretical framework suggests that revolutions are a source of
   institutional innovation characterized by a process of
   de-institutionalization and re-institutionalization. The Veblenian
   ``selective adaptation{''} on the basis of differentiation, inheritance
   and selection through a survival struggle provides an endogenous
   explanation of its different stages. We explore the impact of
   revolutions on institutional change by focusing on two major types of
   revolutions, namely the elite revolution and the mass revolution. The
   former is led by a fraction of the old elite group, while the latter is
   driven by social groups and classes that were previously non-dominant.
   The 1688 British Glorious Revolution and the 1789 French Revolution are
   emblematic figures of these two types of revolutions. The great
   demarcation between property and sovereignty was accomplished by both
   revolutions traversing through different patterns of institutional
   innovation. Our references to the British revolution are exclusively
   limited to old and new institutionalist authors to show the consistency
   between their theoretical framework and conflict as a means of
   bargaining. By contrast, our analysis of French revolution tries to test
   the consistency of our theoretical framework in light of empirical
   evidence.},

Abstract = {The flows of traded goods across countries are known to follow a gravity
   pattern: Their volumes are greater between countries that are larger in
   size and closer to each other. We find a similar pattern in the flows of
   territories across countries between 1870 and 2008. During this period,
   countries experienced inflows and outflows of territories, mirroring the
   international flows of goods. We find three other pieces of critical
   evidence supporting that the two flows interact through similar economic
   motives. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of international trade
   models for understanding international politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores `community gyms' as prefigurative counter spaces
   where sport is experienced as a political practice. Emerging in the
   framework of political squats in Italy and beyond, community gyms
   constitute an integral part of today's right to the city mobilization,
   with two unique contributions. Firstly, they reclaim the right to
   leisure space as a fundamental component of the struggle against
   gentrification. Secondly, they introduce to a critical approach to urban
   development also individuals who would otherwise not embrace
   anti-systemic politics. Specifically, the article analyses the spatial
   dimension of community gyms. It exposes how they constitute a bulwark
   against the commodification and gentrification of the urban habitat,
   recovering vacant or abandoned buildings to return them to the locals
   and embodying an alternative model of urban development centered on
   people rather than profit. The article also explores the gyms'
   relational dimension, showing how community gyms nurture novel
   relationships of care, in three ways: they include and give agency to
   marginalized subjects, they forge militants through sport practice, and
   seek to mitigate the socio-economic needs of their social surroundings.
   In so doing, the article shows that leisure, too, can create moments of
   disruption able to generate change, and that sport, when understood as a
   political act, can unsettle the capitalist logic of commodification of
   leisure. Inspired by a carnal sociology approach to social research,
   this article is based on original data gathered by means of in-depth
   interviewing, ethnographic observation and document analysis.},

Abstract = {Objective This article asks: Does experience with education undermine
   confidence in the institution? If so, has this changed over time?
   Method This study uses mixed effects binary logistic regression on the
   General Social Survey (1973-2018).
   Results Confidence in the institution of education has declined over
   time. Those with a college degree are less confident in education and
   their confidence is diminishing over time. By 2018, those with a college
   degree indicated the lowest levels of confidence in education since
   1973. These changes are distinct from general trends in institutional
   confidence. In fact, higher education is typically associated with more
   confidence in social institutions.
   Conclusion These trends likely reflect the shifting rhetoric around the
   purpose and function of college education as well as the changing
   economic landscape of higher education. By focusing on long-term changes
   to a key symbolic impact of higher education (i.e., public confidence in
   education), findings add to the existing literature on the material
   benefits and consequences of attaining a college degree.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on recent work on ``third spaces{''} to analyze
   political talk in comments on news about nonpublic affairs. It draws on
   content and discourse analyses of comments on news published by a
   leading Costa Rican media organization on Facebook. The article develops
   five categories of issues that triggered political talk
   (institutionality, identity, political inclinations, factual aspects,
   and criticism of the media) and examines the discursive strategies
   through which these comments became political. This allowed to broaden
   understanding of the political relevance of discussions about nonpublic
   affairs on social media.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between central planning, pervasive shortages,
   and soft budget constraints under socialism? In this paper, we address
   this question by exploring the evolution of Janos Kornai's work on the
   operation of real-world socialism. In doing so, our goal is to reframe
   Kornai's contributions to the political economy of socialism by focusing
   on the epistemic conditions under non-market decision making. From this
   perspective, we argue that the dysfunction facing socialist economies is
   not one based fundamentally on a misalignment of incentives in enforcing
   hard budget constraints and eliminating shortages. Rather, soft budget
   constraints are aconsequenceof competition between firms in a non-profit
   setting, utilized as a means to monetize the control over state-owned
   resources through the creation of pervasive shortages.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with data extraction and data circulation that are at
   stake in refugee governmentality with a focus on the Cash Assistance
   Programme in Greece. It focuses on the data extraction activities which
   are part of the cash Assistance Programme and on the ways in which data
   is shared and not shared among the actors involved. It starts by
   critically engaging with debates on techno-humanitarianism in refugee
   governmentality, and it moves on by drawing attention to the
   constitutive dynamics between data abundance and data disregard. Then,
   it analyses the extent to which different actors can access and act upon
   the data. The second part of the article centres on the peculiar modes
   of subjectivation that asylum seekers are shaped by, as cards
   beneficiaries and techno-users. It shows that asylum seekers are both
   passive surfaces of data extraction and, at the same time, are object of
   a request to speak and to produce data and feedback about their use of
   the card. The paper concludes with a section about the injunction
   imposed on asylum seekers to act as autonomous and responsible
   techno-users and, at the same time, to comply with multiple spatial
   restrictions.},

Title = {The strange geographies of the `new' state capitalism},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The recent polymorphism of state intervention and attendant political
   geographies have been interpreted as a return of state capitalism. While
   commentators across the social sciences have offered competing
   characterizations of the new state capitalism, little attention has been
   dedicated to how narratives and geographical imaginal-Ms of the new
   state capitalism operate as a form of geopolitical knowledge and
   practice. Drawing upon critical geopolitics, we make three main
   arguments. First, we examine the context of wider geopolitical and
   geoeconomic shifts in which the social construction of the geo-category
   has happened. We contend that the emerging new spatiality of the global
   economy has prompted the need for new discursive frames and geopolitical
   lines of reasoning. Second, we argue that this need is fulfilled by the
   geo-category state capitalism, which acts as a powerful tool in
   categorizing and hierarchizing the spaces of world politics. It does so
   by reinstituting a simple narrative of competition between two easily
   identifiable protagonists - (Western) democratic free-market capitalism
   and its deviant `other', (Eastern) authoritarian state capitalism - and
   by reactivating older geopolitical grand narratives. Third, the
   geo-category state capitalism discursively enables Western business and
   state actors to justify tougher policy stances in three areas: foreign
   policy; trade, technology, and investment regulation; and international
   development.},

Abstract = {Objective We compare and contrast methods for measuring malapportionment
   from different disciplines: law, political science, and economics.
   Methods With data from the U.S. House, Senate, and Electoral College
   (EC) over the period 1790-2010, we compare disproportionality measures
   and compare both across time and between institutions.
   Results We demonstrate that which approach to measurement we take can
   dramatically affect some of the conclusions we reach. However, we also
   demonstrate that the House and the EC are hardly malapportioned,
   regardless of which measure we use, while the level of malapportionment
   we observe in the Senate can depend on which measure we use.
   Conclusion Since there are many axiomatic properties we might wish to
   satisfy, no one measure is uniformly best with respect to all feasible
   desiderata. However, one measure, the minimum population needed to win a
   majority, offers a readily comparable measure across legislatures and
   jurisdictions, and is easy for nonspecialists to understand.},

Title = {Money talks: Decentralized personalism and the sources of campaign
   funding},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many scholars suggest that candidates are increasingly personalizing
   their campaign efforts, local organizations, and even their messaging. A
   variety of temporal factors have been identified as fueling this
   personalization of politics, including the decline of partisanship,
   evolving media norms, and changes in party organization such as the
   adoption of primaries. The personalization of politics is linked to
   spatial, or geographic, factors, as well. Research suggests that in
   geographically defined electoral systems, personalized campaigning most
   often involves a focus on district-level issues and that this translates
   into parliamentarians prioritizing local interests in the legislature.
   One potentially important factor that has been relatively understudied
   in explaining personalization is money, especially its geographic
   source. Using an innovative dataset that pairs candidate survey
   responses with administrative financial data, we test whether candidates
   are less likely to run personalized campaigns when their local party
   organization receives a higher proportion of its total income from the
   party at the centre. Our findings suggest that the degree to which
   campaign funds are raised locally or transferred from the central party
   office helps shape the message that local candidates convey to voters,
   although not how they get their message out.},

Title = {(Re)constructing borders through the governance of tourism and trade in
   Ladakh, India},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper analyses how everyday life, the state and nationhood are
   regulated and organised in a conflict-affected borderland space through
   economic activities. It focuses on two elements that are often
   overlooked when scholars discuss spatial governmentality: tourism and
   trade. Both are commonly declared to be elements of peace, peacebuilding
   and cosmopolitism. However, the spatial governance of tourism and trade
   can also profoundly shape how national belonging and the limits of
   territory are perceived and experienced by borderland populations and
   visitors. These dynamics can be acute in conflict-affected border zones,
   where state sovereignty may be under existential or territorial threat.
   This paper exposes such dynamics in the Indian conflict borderland area
   of Ladakh, a part of Jammu and Kashmir State until October 2019.
   Building on scholarship that has analysed cultural and social dynamics
   of ``bordering{''} in the region, this paper argues that it is possible
   to read (socio-) economic boundary-making in Ladakh through the state's
   influence in the organisation and experience of trade and tourism for
   Ladakhis and visitors. The paper highlights how their spatial
   organisation, in part, underwrites difference and separation, and aids
   in framing the contested territory as `Indian'.},

Title = {Federal Election Commission Divided: Measuring Conflict in Commission
   Votes Since 1990},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {224-241},

Abstract = {This article investigates conflict on the Federal Election Commission
   (FEC). A long literature has documented the polarization of elites in
   Congress, in state legislators, and among justices on the Supreme Court.
   Many assume also that polarization is present at FEC, the regulatory
   agency tasked with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance
   laws. The Commission has been characterized as toothless and
   ineffectual, but in recent years these charges have been coupled with
   claims that Republican commissioners have done more to sabotage
   enforcement than Democratic commissioners. This article advances these
   questions by using over 5,000 Commission votes to estimate ideal points
   for all commissioners since 1990. The evidence supports the claim that
   partisan conflict has come to characterize Commission voting patterns,
   with deadlocks on Commission actions skyrocketing in recent years.
   Attributing this entirely to ideology may not be warranted, but the
   evidence of a partisan divide at the Commission poses real problems for
   the agency in meeting its mandate to enforce the law and offer
   regulatory guidance.},

Abstract = {Morally convicted attitudes-attitudes grounded in core beliefs about
   fundamental right and wrong-play an important role in political
   psychology, public opinion, and political behavior. Extant research
   suggests that these attitudes are intensely held, likely to evoke strong
   emotional responses, more stable and less amenable to compromise, and
   perceived to be universally true. Despite a large body of research on
   how morally convicted attitudes affect behavior and choice, several open
   questions remain about their antecedents. There are two questions
   central to this article: First, can the news media effectively
   communicate a sense of moral conviction to the mass public? Second, if
   so, what are the factors that cause these attitudes to become morally
   convicted? Drawing on framing theory, appraisal theory, and research in
   political communication, we hypothesize that moral conviction can be
   effectively communicated using episodic (as opposed to thematic) frames,
   and also, that emotional reactions to such frames contribute to the
   development of moral conviction. Using four survey experiments and two
   replications, we find some support for our hypotheses, but we also find
   that treatment effects are likely context dependent. We close with a
   discussion about avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Selective exposure to likeminded political viewpoints on algorithmic
   social media platforms is considered a potential source of polarization
   of public opinion. We still know little about the proposed mechanism or
   how potential reinforcement of specific attitudes affects citizens'
   political behavior, especially in a nonelectoral context. Focusing on
   the issue of immigration during the refugee influx to Europe in autumn
   2015, this study investigates the effects of social media usage on
   attitude reinforcement, connecting it to political participation in
   refugee-related activities. A panel study conducted among Danish
   citizens (n= 847) reveals that frequent social media usage reinforces
   existing attitudes and mobilizes political participation. However,
   citizens who become more extreme in their attitude toward immigration
   over time are found to be less likely to become politically active
   regarding this specific issue.},

Abstract = {On 26 August 1975 the colonial administration in Portuguese Timor
   abruptly removed itself from Dili to the island of Atauru, amidst
   escalating armed conflict among Timorese political parties. A puzzle
   that has remained is why did the Portuguese administration leave so
   precipitately, and why did it not return a few days later when the
   conflict was over? We have been left with the impression that Portugal
   simply deserted its responsibilities, abandoning the territory to
   Indonesian annexation. This paper pieces together a rivetting but
   little-known story, from contemporary Portuguese, Indonesian, US,
   Australian, Timorese and eyewitness accounts, about the humiliating
   capture and detention by Timorese and Indonesians of Portuguese military
   as prisoners of war, which helps to explain a previously unrecognized
   constraint on Portuguese policy in East Timor in 1975-1976. This paper
   also shows that Indonesia had taken some important lessons from history
   on how to manage Portugal, from India's annexation of Portuguese Goa in
   1961.},

Abstract = {All of the major religious confessions existing today have outlasted
   every single secular ruling regime known in human history. That
   observation poses an interesting puzzle for social scientists interested
   in institutional durability. If religions can be seen as governance
   institutions that organize and coordinate people's lives, why have they
   outlasted secular states? Despite claims regarding the inevitability of
   secularization, religious institutions refuse to fade from the social
   landscape and in many places are thriving and expanding. I argue that
   the durability of religious institutions relative to secular governing
   regimes is related to the unique ability of religions to avoid the
   public choice ``paradox of government{''} as laid out by James Buchanan.
   More precisely, religious institutions are more resilient because they
   effectively provide vital public goods, involve ``citizens{''} in the
   process of governance at the local level, and provide a credible neutral
   arbitrator for violations of the governing covenant. A further argument
   is made for the efficiency of religious institutions relative to states
   based on the smaller deadweight losses associated with participatory
   governance. Finally, state-sponsored confessions expose themselves to
   the paradox of government and become less effective in pursuing their
   missions.},

Title = {When Is It Democratic to Postpone an Election? Elections During Natural
   Disasters, Covid-19, and Emergency Situations},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Holding regular elections is an essential feature of democratic
   practices. The case for postponing elections is often made during
   emergency situations, however. Despite the critical nature of the issue
   for democracy, peace, and security, there has been sparse academic
   literature on election postponement. This article provides a new
   typology of reasons why elections might be delayed to disentangle the
   causal factors and normative rationale. It distinguishes the
   humanitarian case for temporary postponements during natural disasters.
   It then argues that substantive concepts of democracy and electoral
   integrity, rather than existing international/national laws and
   standards, should be used to inform decisions about postponement by
   relevant stakeholders, be it an electoral management body (EMB),
   government, parliament, or the judiciary. The possible effects of
   natural disasters on electoral integrity are traced through a
   comparative analysis of past cases. The article holds that variations in
   context and the ability of actors to strategically adapt to situations
   will make the effects contingent. Nonetheless, holding elections during
   natural disasters will often lead to severely compromised opportunities
   for deliberation, contestation, participation, and election management
   quality. There is therefore a strong, democratic case for time-limited
   postponement. However, the postponement will break institutional
   certainty, which could pose threats of democratic breakdown-especially
   in presidential systems. The best available safeguards for electoral
   integrity during natural disasters include the introduction or expansion
   of low-tech solutions such as early voting, strengthened risk
   management, but also transparency and inclusivity in decision making.
   Overall, there are important lessons for the broader scholarship and
   practice of democracy during emergency situations.},

Abstract = {Wonder Woman (2017) has been one of the most lucrative entries in the
   recent superhero film canon. With a female lead and director, it has
   also proven a rich text for feminist analysis. Here, the film's
   engagement with questions of gender, aesthetic judgment and disability
   is explored through the lens of feminist geopolitics, and connected to
   the alignment between immorality and disfigurement in Hollywood more
   broadly. It is suggested that aesthetic value is used in the film as a
   key organizing principle for spatial and geopolitical claims. Through
   this analysis, the paper suggests the potential for further studies of
   disability, including disfigurement, in popular geopolitics.},

Abstract = {This paper is based on former Zimbabwean President Robert Gabriel
   Mugabe's ninety-third birthday celebrations. It uses and goes beyond the
   said ceremony to interrogate the politics of commemorative toponyms in
   post-independence Zimbabwe. The event took place on 25 February 2017 at
   a school whose nameRhodes Estate Preparatory School(REPS) was changed
   toMatopos Junior Schoolprior to the celebrations. The methodological
   framing of this discussion consists of a critical reading of the media's
   representation of the name change and the debates that followed.
   Reference is specifically made to two Zimbabwean newspapers,The Patriot,
   which featured the story on 2 March 2017 under the heading ``Rhodes
   `legacy' finally put to rest{''} and theZimEye's story of 26 February
   2017 headlined ``Mugabe removes Rhodes.{''} Theoretically, the paper is
   framed within the critical approach to toponymy that interprets
   commemorative place-nomenclature as political arenas which could be used
   to think through issues of history and memory. In particular, it is
   argued in this paper that in post-independence Zimbabwe, place names,
   especially commemorative toponyms, are political spaces par excellence
   which we can use to study not only the country's colonial history but
   also its postcolonial realities.},

Abstract = {The development of radio as a communication and broadcasting technology
   has been vital to popular, formal and practical geopolitics. This paper
   contributes to the nascent literature on assemblage thought in
   geopolitics by considering radio as a historical iteration of ``the
   media{''}. Through this dialogue, it is suggested that British
   Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio is both a material and discursive
   assemblage, operating at multiple scales, sites and intensities of
   governance. The paper argues that radio cannot be seen simply as a
   vehicle for producing popular geopolitical imaginaries, nor as a neutral
   military or cultural diplomatic tool. Contributing to the use of
   assemblage and actor-network thought in historical-popular geopolitics,
   the paper begins by articulating the benefits of certain elements of
   these theoretical registers to the sub-field in general, before moving
   onto a series of empirical fragments from the archive to illustrate
   these abstractions in a more concrete manner. First, it does so by
   considering the early governance and regulation of radio in the 1920s,
   then the forces producing the BBC's Middle Eastern Relay network during
   the late 1960s. The paper concludes with a further call to take
   materiality seriously, particularly in future popular geopolitical
   research dealing with media networks.},

Abstract = {Since independence on October 1, 1960, Nigeria has been a victim, at one
   time or the other, of intra-ethnic, inter-ethnic, religious, and
   communal conflicts which have undermined the human security of her
   citizens. Nigeria's corporate existence had also been threatened by 3
   years (1967-1970) civil war which impacted negatively on the well-being
   of its people. In addition, the inability of the Nigerian Police to cope
   with the magnitude of the surge of violence in recent years has brought
   about the idea of involving the military, a core component of
   traditional security apparatus to deal with internal insecurity. This
   article is anchored on human security paradigm with reliance on
   secondary data to analyze the operations of the Nigerian Military in
   counterviolence campaigns between 1999 and 2017. This article points out
   that the involvement of the military in internal security has worsened
   the problem of insecurity due to the military's unprofessional approach
   and, at times, deliberate targeting the civilian populace which it is
   supposed to protect. It, therefore, recommends among others, the need
   for the Federal Government of Nigeria to urgently review the role of the
   armed forces in addressing internal security situations in a way that
   will bring about respect for the rule of engagement in internal security
   operations and adherence to global best practices.},

Abstract = {Objective Do voters hold accurate perceptions about economic conditions
   and what factors drive those perceptions? Some work suggests that voters
   are too hopelessly biased by partisanship or other commitments to be
   able to develop accurate perceptions of the economy upon which to base
   judgments of incumbent performance (Evans and Andersen, 2006). By
   contrast, other work shows that voters do a good job of developing
   accurate perceptions about economic conditions in which partisan bias is
   a minor influence (Lewis-Beck et al., 2013). Methods The research note
   draws on a pooled data set of Canadian Election Studies from nine
   national elections for the period 1988-2015 to explore the relative
   influence of both approaches using multilevel modeling. Results Findings
   indicate evidence for both camps: partisan bias does exert some
   independent influence on shaping national economic evaluations and
   national economic evaluations reflect actual real-world economic
   conditions. Conclusions Implications of these results suggest that
   economic perceptions have mixed origins that lend some, not
   insignificant, support to the claim that economic voting remains a
   viable scholarly enterprise.},

Abstract = {Europeanism or Europeanisms is not a false dilemma. The traditional
   narrative of a process of European integration designed by Monnet and
   developed by the Communities is definitely questioned. There are and
   were other alternatives which may not be labeled as Euroscepticism. The
   intergovernmental cooperation defended by Great Britain had and has more
   way to go than the one that has been wanted to recognize but it failed
   to lead the integration process for several reasons, in which, by the
   way, it never believed. The Occidental Union, sponsored by the Labour,
   and the Council of Europe, inspired by Churchill, both deserve a
   historical review which this work modestly wants to contribute to.},

Abstract = {In this article, we have studied the extent and especially the causes of
   discrimination against male candidates during the first stage of the
   rental process (i.e. when individuals ask to visit the apartment)
   through a meta-analysis of 23 correspondence tests conducted in 15 OECD
   countries, representing a total of 110,000 emails sent to owners or real
   estate agents. Female names are 13 \% more likely to receive a positive
   response from agents than male names and this result is invariably
   present in OECD countries. Female candidates, however, appear to face
   first order statistical discrimination regarding their financial
   stability, but this negative effect is more than offset by statistical
   discrimination suffered by male applicants because of their supposed
   higher-risk behavior. Finally, it seems that differential treatment
   between men and women is not significantly higher for individuals with a
   foreign-sounding name than for individuals with a typical name of the
   country tested.},

Abstract = {In this article I highlight the political work of Nicaraguan migrants
   living in the informal settlement of La Carpio in San Jose, Costa Rica,
   as they negotiate rights in the form of urban services. Nicaraguans in
   La Carpio have organized politically since 1993 to self-instal, demand,
   and negotiate services such as potable water and electricity. In the
   process, they successfully compel local authorities to allocate these
   services and grant them an implicit recognition of their right to remain
   and live a decent life, regardless of their status. These migrant
   struggles to improve urban life, the political subjectification they
   engender, and the mechanisms for rights-claiming that they open, show a
   different articulation of citizenship and political agency largely
   absent in the literature on migrants, refugees, and noncitizens, shaped
   in global North contexts: the predominance of urban informality as a
   means for migrants to negotiate with institutions of power the
   allocation of substantive rights. Moreover, in the absence of direct
   engagement with and challenge to the national migration regime,
   Nicaraguan migrants are able to weave the fabric upon which their own
   continuous practice of citizenship rests through their quotidian,
   informal interactions with state servicing authorities in La Carpio.},

Title = {Do Gender Cues from Images Supersede Partisan Cues Conveyed via Text?
   Eye Movements Reveal Political Stereotyping in Multimodal Information
   Environments},

Abstract = {An important feature of the information environment is its multimodal
   nature. In politics, people encounter representations of political
   candidates that combine images and text. Among the most prominent pieces
   of information people encounter are a candidate's gender, obtained from
   images of the candidate's face, and the candidate's partisan
   identification, often represented as text. This feature of the
   environment is important given previous work showing that individuals
   infer gender categories from faces rapidly and effortlessly. In this
   study (N = 113), we use eye movements to determine how individuals
   assign stereotypical policy positions to candidates in an environment in
   which photos of candidates' faces are paired with labels of their
   partisan IDs. We find that politically-knowledgeable individuals are
   more likely to use partisan- than gender-based stereotypes. In contrast,
   political novices did not prioritize one type of stereotype over the
   other. Our findings have implications for understanding how individuals
   make political evaluations in multimodal settings and show the
   advantages of measuring eye movements when studying stereotyping in
   multimodal environments.},

Abstract = {In this paper I discuss the interdisciplinarity of computational
   communication science. I draw on my own experiences leading a
   multi-disciplinary lab that broadly studies multimodal communication.
   Scholars are increasingly using text-as-data methods for social science
   inquiry, driving a need for more training and professionalization of
   computational political communication as a sub-field. Text-as-data
   methods are largely borrowed from other disciplines such as linguistics
   and computer science, but sustained, institutionalized collaboration
   between scholars in different departments is still somewhat rare. Using
   the concept of cohesion as an example, I describe how multiple
   disciplines interpret and operationalize the same term in different
   ways. Finally, I provide a list of challenges and lessons learned,
   including the logistics of running a lab, communicating and publishing
   across disciplines, implications of authorship sequence, and maintaining
   your own research profile while collaborating. I conclude by discussing
   the role of meaningful mentorship and future directions for
   interdisciplinary text analysis research.},

Abstract = {A substantial amount of James Buchanan's academic work was devoted to
   his constitutional project: the development of procedures for designing
   constitutional rules that would create a government sufficient to
   protect people's rights but that would constrain government from
   violating people's rights. Buchanan divides government functions into a
   protective state that preserves people's rights and a productive state
   that produces collective goods that individuals could not produce on
   their own or through market mechanisms. Buchanan uses the benchmark of
   hypothetical agreement with the constitutional rules to evaluate whether
   they further the interests of those who are subject to them. This paper
   presents Buchanan's constitutional project as a framework for analyzing
   constitutional rules and suggests how Buchanan's framework can extend
   his constitutional project.},

   Messages Affects Young Muslims' Support for Collective Action: A
   Longitudinal Experiment},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},

Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Drawing from the Social Identity Model of Collective Action, this study
   investigates whether Islamophobic political agitation increases
   perceived discrimination and support for collective action among young
   Muslims. Using a longitudinal experimental design, we exposed young
   Muslims aged 18 to 37 years (n = 143) to a variety of anti-Islamic
   right-wing populist social media messages either once (i.e., single
   exposure) or at several different time points (i.e., repeated exposure).
   Our findings show, for the first time, that anti-Islamic political
   messages not only increased perceived discrimination immediately after
   exposure, but that this effect was still detectable 2 and 3 weeks after
   initial exposure. Repeated exposure did not lead to an incremental
   effect beyond that of one-time exposure. Our findings also showed that
   perceived discrimination predicted support for nonviolent collective
   action, but not for violent collective action to improve young Muslims'
   social status both after single and repeated exposure. From a democratic
   perspective, these findings are encouraging and have important
   theoretical and methodological implications.},

Abstract = {Objective Presidents routinely employ public statements to inform
   Congress about their position on pending legislation. Position-taking is
   strategic, with presidents choosing whether, how, how often, and when to
   intervene. We move beyond the traditional dichotomies of issuance and
   position to explore the timing and frequency of presidential
   position-taking during the lawmaking process.
   Method We use Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs)-bill-specific
   messages addressed to Congress-to analyze presidential communications.
   Our regression analyses examine both the frequency of SAPs usage on
   bills and when in the process presidents communicate their position.
   Results We find that presidents take positions sparingly and most often
   at the early stages of the lawmaking process.
   Conclusion Presidential communications during the lawmaking process are
   more about winnowing options and bargaining over bill text than
   influencing pivotal votes.},

Abstract = {Rather than accept the mainstream view that the state needs need to be
   brought back in to regional thinking, the paper argues that the state -
   and the analysis of it - is restricting understandings of urban and
   regional change and leading to a state-territorial trap. Analysing over
   40 years of literature on growth-oriented regionalism, the paper reveals
   important blind spots in the approaches to researching regions (and
   other forms of place-making) and the role of business in regional
   development, planning and governance. Presenting a comparison of two
   spatial governance projects in the UK - The Peel Group's Atlantic
   Gateway Strategy and UK government's Local Enterprise Partnerships - it
   is revealed how business-orchestrated regionalism is a new empirical
   reality, but one we are ill-equipped to understand. It argues that we
   need to move beyond the conceptual and methodological lock-in of
   business-as-usual approaches to start `seeing like a business' and
   revealing the practical politics and pragmatism by which actors - both
   state and business - are engaging to effect regional change and shape
   regional futures.},

Abstract = {In this paper I argue that we should not frame the debate over whether
   or not we have duties to help refugees in terms of duties of rescue.
   This way of framing the issue, where Western states are depicted as
   rescuing refugees from harms unconnected to them, does not adequately
   represent the reality experienced by refugees in the 21 st century. I
   suggest that we need a framework that includes the secondary harms
   experienced by refugees as they try to seek refuge in camps, urban
   spaces and via asylum. These secondary harms constitute serious
   violations of human rights and prevent refugees from accessing the
   minimum conditions of human dignity. As a result, the rescue metaphor is
   inappropriate and, perhaps more importantly, prevents us from having a
   proper debate about the obligations of states in general, and Western
   states in particular, to refugees.},

Title = {Disinformation by Design: The Use of Evidence Collages and Platform
   Filtering in a Media Manipulation Campaign},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {194-214},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Disinformation campaigns such as those perpetrated by far-right groups
   in the United States seek to erode democratic social institutions.
   Looking to understand these phenomena, previous models of disinformation
   have emphasized identity-confirmation and misleading presentation of
   facts to explain why such disinformation is shared. A risk of these
   accounts, which conjure images of echo chambers and filter bubbles, is
   portraying people who accept disinformation as relatively passive
   recipients or conduits. Here we conduct a case study of tactics of
   disinformation to show how platform design and decentralized
   communication contribute to advancing the spread of disinformation even
   when that disinformation is continuously and actively challenged where
   it appears. Contrary to a view of disinformation flowing within
   homogeneous echo chambers, in our case study we observe substantial
   skepticism against disinformation narratives as they form. To examine
   how disinformation spreads amidst skepticism in this case, we employ a
   document-driven multi-site trace ethnography to analyze a contested
   rumor that crossed anonymous message boards, the conservative media
   ecosystem, and other platforms. We identify two important factors that
   filtered out skepticism and contested explanations, which facilitated
   the transformation of this rumor into a disinformation campaign: (1) the
   aggregation of information into evidence collages-image files that
   aggregate positive evidence-and (2) platform filtering-the
   decontextualization of information as these claims crossed platforms.
   Our findings provide an elucidation of ``trading up the chain{''}
   dynamics explored by previous researchers and a counterpoint to the
   relatively mechanistic accounts of passive disinformation propagation
   that dominate the quantitative literature. We conclude with a discussion
   of how these factors relate to the communication power available to
   disparate groups at different times, as well as practical implications
   for inferring intent from social media traces and practical implications
   for the design of social media platforms.},

Abstract = {In Australia, two-and-a-half party systems are common with the Liberal
   and National parties, usually needing to collaborate to form
   governments. In Queensland, the 2008 merger of two of these state
   parties to create the Liberal National Party (LNP) created instead a
   two-party system. This review examines the forces for the merger and
   prospects for the continuation of the LNP, the likelihood of change as a
   result of the Queensland merger in the remaining two-and-a-half party
   systems, and how the drivers of this merger compare with those observed
   in studies of other non-Australian party and electoral systems.
   Pressures and conditions for a merger similar to those in other, mostly
   European systems, were evident in the case of the LNP. The particular
   structure of the pre-merger party competition and relationships was,
   however, a likely factor in the merger in that two collaborating parties
   could avoid a contested switch in party seniority. This aspect, unlikely
   to occur in other Australian party systems, combined with the very
   limited success of the LNP in gaining and holding government since the
   merger, does not suggest an imperative for further mergers in other
   Australian systems.},

   contribute to, four distinct, yet related streams of research: critical
   geopolitics, critical terrorism studies, geographies of education, and
   young people's geographies. Simultaneously, while most work on the topic
   focuses on individual cases (typically of Western countries), I conduct
   the first comparative analysis of twelve countries from different world
   regions: China, Egypt, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
   Philippines, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Contrary to recent
   claims, considerable heterogeneity persists regarding geopolitical
   imaginations of terrorism, while US-coined discourses are only
   infrequently adapted. However, there is still recognisable functionalist
   convergence as the states under analysis utilise their control of the
   education system in their internal struggles, mainly by portraying their
   opponents as evil, by ascribing a positive identity to themselves, and
   by calling for support by their citizens (including restrictions of
   human rights and democracy).},

Title = {Immigrants' Support for Welfare Spending and the Role of Perceived and
   Preferred Group's Access to Welfare: A Comparative Study Among 10
   Immigrant Groups in the Netherlands},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {1-24},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Immigrants' opinions on welfare spending are often ignored, but an
   examination of these perspectives provides further insights into the
   formation of welfare attitudes. We developed a framework proposing that
   support for welfare spending is not only driven by self-interest and
   group-interest, but also by the preferences and perceptions of
   immigrants regarding their group's access to welfare. We discuss how
   these two aspects affect immigrants' support for spending on
   unemployment benefits and social assistance in the Netherlands.
   Immigrants were found to be more supportive of spending on welfare to
   which they perceived they had greater access, particularly when they
   preferred a more generous access for their group. Their support for
   welfare spending was weaker if they preferred less generous access.},

Abstract = {Janos Kornai developed soft budget constraint logic to explain the
   socialist world's dysfunctional economies. We extend his logic to
   explain dysfunctional land reform in the developing world. International
   development organizations such as the World Bank provide support for
   land privatization to developing-country governments, softening their
   budget constraints. Softer budget constraints encourage
   developing-country governments to pursue land privatization even when
   its social value is negative. Kenya's land reform program illustrates
   the soft budget constraint syndrome.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effect of having a reelected politician on
   policy outcomes in the absence of term limits. Using a regression
   discontinuity design and data from Peruvian municipalities, we find that
   having a reelected mayor does not have sizable effects on policy
   outcomes. That result seems to be driven by rapid learning-by-doing by
   new politicians. Differences in performance and policy outcomes are
   observed only early in the electoral cycle. Our findings weaken
   arguments against term limits based on loss of institutional or human
   capital and support existing interpretations of term limit effects as
   driven mostly by electoral incentives.},

Abstract = {As the environment has moved centre stage, there has been an upsurge in
   the study of sustainability and the relationship between humans and the
   natural environment. Indeed, because of its focus on systems and human
   behaviour, sustainability is evolving into a pivotal position in the new
   trinity of governance that we argue for in this book. As with the other
   concepts, we note a more human-centred approach developing, particularly
   with the Sustainable Development Goals. As with the other parts of the
   trinity, we note that this is overly focused on the individual and
   generally favours adaptation and amelioration over more structural or
   systemic change. With such deep changes taken for granted as part of the
   anthropocene, the focus on lifestyles, life choices, awareness,
   reflection and responsible individual behaviour tends to duck the big
   economic and political system questions. In its current formulation, the
   notion of `the anthropocene' is particularly culpable in this in that it
   fails to address what is driving the ongoing environmental crisis.},

Abstract = {In many contexts, states have a duty to take special measures to protect
   minorities. Does this duty include prioritizing minority over majority
   refugees? To answer this question, we first show that a
   vulnerability-focused notion of `minorities' is preferable to a
   numerical one. Given the vulnerability-focused notion, there is a
   presumption in favour of prioritizing minority over majority refugees.
   However, this presumption is sometimes defeated. We identify five
   conditions under which this is the case. In fact, surprisingly, under
   special circumstances, states should prioritize certain majority over
   certain minority refugees.},

Abstract = {Laws geared toward regulating the employment relationship cling to
   traditional definitions of workplaces, neglecting the domain of the home
   and those who work there. Domestic workers, a population of largely
   immigrant women of color, have performed labor inside of New York City's
   homes for centuries and yet have consistently been denied coverage under
   labor law protections at both the state and federal level. This article
   traces out the exclusions of domestic workers historically and then turn
   to a particular piece of legislation - the 2010 New York Domestic Worker
   Bill of Rights which was the first law of its kind to regulate the
   household as a site of labor, therefore disrupting that long-standing
   pattern. However, the law falls short in granting basic worker
   protections to this particular group. Drawing from 52 in- depth
   interviews and analysis of legislative documents, The author argues that
   the problematics of the law can be understood by recognizing its
   embeddedness, or rather the broader political, legal, historical, and
   social ecology within which the law is embedded, which inhibited in a
   number of important ways the law's ability to work. This article shows
   how this plays out through the law obscuring the specificity of where
   this labor is performed - the home - as well as the demographic makeup
   of the immigrant women of color - the whom - performing it. Using the
   case study of domestic workers' recent inclusion into labor law
   coverage, this article urges a closer scrutiny of and attention to the
   changing nature of inequality, race, and gender present in employment
   relationships within the private household as well as found more
   generally throughout the low- wage sector.},

Abstract = {Objective The objective of the article is to address the following
   fundamental questions: First, to what extent can Bronze Age maritime
   technology in Mesopotamia and the Gulf be considered an example of
   historical innovation, given the limited set of evidence? Second, what
   are the challenges of effectively measuring and analyzing maritime
   technological ``innovation{''} in this period? Third, what methodologies
   have been recently developed to help us better understand these
   innovations?
   Methods The method relies on historical-archaeological analysis of the
   evidence as well as experimental archaeological reconstruction.
   Results The study suggest that while the archaeological and textual
   evidence clearly shows that innovations took place, the paucity of that
   evidence limits any detailed analysis of innovation.
   Conclusion Due to the limited data currently available to us, maritime
   experimental archaeology provides the best methodology for potentially
   understanding these innovations until further archaeological discoveries
   are made related to the subject.},

Abstract = {Brexit has opened doors for renewed attention to contested, multi-scalar
   geopolitical forces grounded in everyday life in borderlands. In this
   paper, we aim to unravel `everyday Brexits' in the Gibraltar-La Linea
   (Spain) borderlands. By studying the 2019 commemoration of the historic
   1969 border closure, we concentrate on how local borderwork by residents
   is mobilised for bottom-up geopolitics in the context of Brexit
   negotiations. We use a conceptual approach that focuses on multiple
   layerings of the border and the selectivity of stakeholders to select
   among these layers to pursue their interests. Based on on-site
   observations, in-depth interviews, and informal conversations with
   residents and key actors of La Linea and Gibraltar, we argue that Brexit
   has increased the tension of already loaded core-periphery relations in
   Spain. Brexit does not represent a sudden disruption. Rather, we show
   how Brexit allowed the bottom-up geopolitical mobilisation of latent,
   strongly historically embedded and continuous cross-borders sentiments
   of residents. This mobilisation could potentially challenge local
   cross-border power relations. In the final analysis, we conclude that
   the bottom-up geopolitics of `ordinary' residents through everyday
   bordering processes is central to geopolitics research, including with
   regard to Brexit and in particular for non-British geographies affected
   by Brexit.},

Abstract = {This study uses computational methods to investigate public incivility
   in Facebook comments to campaign messages during the primaries of the
   2016 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on candidates' posts about
   immigration. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between
   campaign messaging strategies, such as advocacy and attacks, and the
   presence of incivility in public comments. We find that Trump dominated
   both in terms of number of posts and of public conversation and was the
   least likely to receive uncivil comments. Attack messages by the
   candidates were more likely to receive uncivil comments, suggesting that
   campaign negativity may indeed affect how the public engages with
   candidates online. These findings are important because uncivil
   discourse may contribute to further polarize the public around the
   issues, which may in turn lead to more extreme views.},

Abstract = {Causal inference and American political development (APD) are widely
   separated and (to some) fundamentally incompatible tendencies within
   political science. In this paper, we explore points of connection
   between those two perspectives, while also highlighting differences that
   are not so easily bridged. We stress that both causal inference and APD
   are centrally interested in questions of causation, but they approach
   causation with very different ontological and epistemological
   commitments. We emphasize how the sort of detailed, contextualized, and
   often qualitative knowledge privileged by APD can promote credible
   causal (and descriptive) inferences, but also that scholars of causal
   inference can benefit from alternate conceptions of causality embraced
   by APD work. We illustrate with two empirical examples from our own
   research: devising weights for quota-sampled opinion polls and
   estimating the political effects of the Tennessee Valley Authority. We
   conclude that bringing APD and causal inference together on more equal
   terms may require a broader perspective on causation than is typical of
   scholarship in the causal-inference tradition.},

Abstract = {Breaking with a long tradition of political quietism, many Salafis in
   Tunisia and Egypt decided to found political parties and participate in
   competitive elections after the collapse of the regime. In doing so,
   they had to present a political program to voters, including policy
   proposals on economic issues. The article examines how Salafi parties
   dealt with economic policy-making and finds that they reluctantly
   engaged with it, offering contradictory and naive policies meant to
   pander to the electorate. Policy-making preferences and positions on
   economic issues are employed to look at the degree of party
   institutionalization Salafi parties have.},

Title = {Mediating anti-political peace in Abidjan: Radio, place and power},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {83},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {After a decade of conflict (1999-2011), peace-building in Abidjan, Cote
   d'Ivoire, focused on the local as a primary site of reconciliation. In
   addition to being local, peace was anti-political, seeking to separate
   place from politics as autonomous realms of public life. Through the
   example of local radio peace programmes, this article offers a critical,
   ethnographic account of anti-political peace as a spatial process. It
   links local peace and its justifications to the operations of
   governmental power, emphasising continuities of anti-political mediation
   and political domination. Such a historicised perspective challenges the
   framing of anti-political peace as the opposite of politics-as-conflict:
   they have long been two sides of the same coin in Abidjan and, as a
   binary ``choice,{''} prevent the search for more democratic
   alternatives. Simultaneously, I argue that anti-political peace it is
   best approached as a field of contest. An ethnographic approach
   acknowledges the widespread rejection of politics in the Ivoirian
   metropolis, while resisting the collapse of institutional and everyday
   perspectives into a self reinforcing consensus. I show that radio
   producers and Abidjanais residents could not quite pin down the meaning
   of politics, as that which ought to be shunned. Rather than bypass these
   hesitations through normative or ontological reasoning, I suggest
   (following others) that we might treat politics' irreducible polysemy as
   a source of continued struggle.},

Abstract = {In this article we propose a theoretical model to better comprehend the
   effect of gun laws on violent property crime. We assume that a violent
   encounter between a criminal and a victim is costly to both, and we
   uncover two types of equilibria: a pure strategy violent equilibrium and
   a mixed strategy equilibrium where the criminal is deterred with
   strictly positive probability. The effect of a relaxation of gun laws is
   shown to be conditional on both initial gun laws and on the relative
   improvement of the victims' defense capacity relative to the criminals'
   offense capacity. We uncover a potentially inverted U-shaped
   relationship between gun laws leniency and investments in violent
   activities which helps reconciling seemingly contradictory empirical
   findings.},

Title = {Social movements as schooling for careers: career consequences of the

Abstract = {Scholarship on social movement schools shows that movements often
   facilitate the schooling of their participants, while scholarship on the
   biographical consequences of social movements demonstrates that
   movements influence their participants' subsequent careers. To date,
   however, few studies consider whether and how the schooling functions of
   social movements shape participants' later careers. In this article,
   through a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of the careers of 23
   student participants in the Nashville civil rights movement of
   1958-1961, we show that participants who enrolled in James Lawson's
   workshops in nonviolence and who served in the core cadre of the
   movement's Student Central Committee - two important forms of social
   movement schooling - pursued careers in organizing and electoral
   politics. In contrast, participants who did not enroll in Lawson's
   workshops and who were not part of the core cadre of the Student Central
   Committee tended to pursue careers as social service workers or
   businesspeople. The article extends our knowledge of the impacts of
   social movement schools and suggests directions for future research on
   the biographical consequences of social movements.},

Abstract = {How do people address information deficiency caused by rigid control of
   information in authoritarian regimes? We argue that there exists an
   internally oriented information compensation approach through which
   people can glean extra information from official messages domestically.
   This approach does not violate state regulations directly and allows
   people to retrieve information not explicitly publicized by the
   government. We delineate the circumstances of internally oriented
   information compensation using the case of China. We conduct trend and
   text analysis on the data of millions of individual-level actions of
   Chinese Internet search engines and social media users during a large
   anticorruption campaign that conspicuously claimed to crack down on
   influential corrupt leaders without naming who exactly. We show that
   some Chinese netizens were able to identify the unnamed high-ranking
   officials targeted by the campaign based on negative official reports
   about their family members. Some of the netizens even correctly
   predicted the downfall of the officials months before the government's
   announcements. As the existing literature is increasingly concerned
   about the threat of digital authoritarianism on throttling the free flow
   of information, our findings indicate that some authoritarian citizens,
   instead of passively accepting the government's information control,
   acquired their own arts of information self-salvation. This, though not
   directly challenging the government, constitutes an everyday politics
   under digital authoritarianism.},

   possibly lethal blows and economic setbacks through four stages: (I) an
   account of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War and the surprising outcome that
   left Iran undefeated, (II) a review of several theories that can aid us
   to analyze Iran's national resilience ability, (III) an analysis of
   Iran's wartime survival using the abovementioned theoretical
   infrastructure, (IV) a concise review of current issues in Iranian
   society which concludes with an evaluation of the state of Iran's
   resilience regarding attacks on their nuclear program and its
   ramifications.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the reasons for the adoption and rejection of
   liquor dispensaries in the years prior to the adoption of national
   prohibition in the United States. Southern municipalities were the
   primary dispensary locations, largely due to the permissiveness of local
   option laws in the South. Municipalities with dispensaries were often
   retreating from prohibition and dispensary supporters argued that
   publically run liquor stores were the next best thing. Beyond the South,
   states that explored dispensary adoption also were those repealing
   prohibition laws, suggesting a larger pattern whereby prohibition
   preceded dispensaries rather than following them.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the US fiscal condition has been characterised by
   high and rising debt. On a fiscal commons in which citizen-voters
   attempt, through their congressional representatives, to minimise tax
   payments, this is the expected outcome. In this article, we examine the
   effects of a tax policy that has concentrated tax liability on the upper
   end of the income distribution in light of another important trend:
   rapid growth in the higher-income segment of the income distribution. We
   find that growth in the higher-income segment of the income distribution
   - more people paying higher taxes - has made the tragedy of the fiscal
   commons less severe and slowed the pace to a possible ultimate default.},

   emergency response (CMER) more data-driven and centralized through
   shared data infrastructures and control centres. While there are a few
   well-known case examples of data-driven CMER, in general it has been
   partially implemented. In this paper, we highlight the importance of
   historical institutional and spatial context and path dependencies in
   shaping the development of CMERs within and across jurisdictions. We
   examine the progress and prospects of data-driven CMER in Ireland, with
   respect to the general landscape of inter-agency cooperation and with
   reference to a single key agency: An Garda Siochana (AGS), the Irish
   police force. To do so, we draw on 36 in-depth interviews with key
   stakeholders and a critical discourse analysis of 15 key
   policy/guideline documents. Our analysis reveals the ways in which
   embedded institutional cultures, structures and working practices, which
   are relatively resistant to change, have thwarted data-sharing and
   data-driven analysis and decision-making. These factors act as barriers
   to the adoption of smart-city approaches more generally, not just in
   Ireland but globally.},

Abstract = {We use the 2003 and 2013 waves of the International Survey Program
   (ISSP) in order to explore the change in people's attitudes that may be
   behind the recent backlash against globalization. We show that the
   average support for international trade has decreased in many - albeit
   not all - countries, and we demonstrate that these changes are related
   to the depth and length of the global financial crisis of 2008/09 as
   well as the evolution of income inequality. Moreover, our results
   document a declining support of those individuals who are likely to
   benefit from international trade: the young, high-skilled and well-off.
   We show that this ``eroding enthusiasm of the elites{''} is empirically
   relevant even if we control for individuals' increasing exposure to
   international labor-market competition.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We examine the effects of Mafia infiltration on public procurement
   performance, based on a sample of 68,063 public work contracts (PWC)
   awarded by Italian municipalities over the period 2012-2017, of which
   687 are identified as Mafia-infiltrated, either because of being awarded
   by municipal councils subsequently dissolved due to Mafia infiltration,
   or because of being won by Mafia-owned firms.
   Our results reveal that Mafia infiltration is positively associated with
   number of submitted bids, awarding rebates and execution cost overruns,
   whereas it is negatively associated with delivery delays for PWC. The
   effect of Mafia infiltration on execution cost overruns and the
   probability of their occurrence is weaker for larger PWC, and the
   elections of the new municipal councils, after the dissolution of the
   previous ones, do not significantly influence the performance of PWC.
   Our findings suggest the presence of collusive schemes among bidding
   firms within the Mafia network and provide new insights for the
   implementation of more sound policies to tackle practices associated
   with Mafia infiltration in public procurement.},

Abstract = {Objective This article examines whether female managers and female
   owners of firms are better empowered in presidential or parliamentary
   democracies. Parliamentary democracies might be more responsive to the
   demands of special interest groups, while government decision making
   might be more streamlined in presidential democracies. Methods We use
   firm-level data from the World Bank for more than 100 emerging and
   developing nations and employ the logistic estimation procedure. Results
   Results show that female owners of firms thrive in presidential
   democracies, but the effects on female managers were largely
   statistically insignificant. Other interesting findings include both
   female managers and female owners facing special challenges in nations
   with greater gender inequality, with female owners benefiting in nations
   with a larger informal sector. Conclusions Our results show that the
   type of democracy is relevant in female entrepreneurship, with female
   owners of firms thriving in presidential democracies, but not
   necessarily female managers.},

Abstract = {We provide the first parcel-level, time-series empirical analysis of
   municipal annexation behavior. We also exploit a unique natural
   experiment created by the incorporation and exogenous (court-mandated)
   dissolution of a new neighboring municipality to examine the
   public-choice motivations behind annexation. Our results indicate that
   an existing city's annexation behavior differed significantly in the
   areas threatened with the formation of a competing jurisdiction,
   yielding the most compelling evidence yet that political motivations
   play a major role in the annexation behavior of cities. We also are the
   first to construct and include measures reflecting the strategic
   stepwise dependence between parcels in the annexation process-in terms
   of what other parcels subsequently can be annexed. We find that the
   characteristics of a parcel itself in many cases are of only secondary
   importance relative to considerations regarding the other parcels to
   which it gives access for future annexation. Such a spatially dependent
   stepwise factor has been overlooked entirely in prior literature
   assuming that parcel annexation decisions are independent of one
   another.},

Abstract = {Objective. This research analyzes the impact of political trust on
   Native American electoral participation, using survey responses from
   roughly 1,500 Native Americans living in South Dakota and Nevada.Method.
   The in-person survey taking was conducted at locations in Native
   communities and with the support of tribal leaders, allowing us to
   overcome many of the methodological issues that have hampered previous
   studies.Results. We found much higher levels of electoral participation
   in tribal elections than in non-tribal elections. Respondents expressed
   high levels of distrust in nontribal government and voting methods, and
   this distrust has a surprisingly powerful impact on the decision to
   participate in nontribal elections.Conclusion. We suggest that
   historical trauma and ongoing discrimination are the primary causes of
   distrust among Native Americans and find support for this in the
   observed differences in levels of trust between South Dakota and Nevada.},

   Populist-Right Parties in Industrial Democracies},

Abstract = {Objectives The objective of this article is to examine whether refugee
   flows are associated with an increase in electoral support for
   populist-right parties. The empirical evidence on this so far remains
   mixed. This article argues that refugee inflows alone are an inaccurate
   predictor of the success of populist-right parties. Rather, refugee
   inflows can lead to a rise in electoral support for populist-right
   parties where traditional welfare states are expansive-the so-called
   welfare chauvinism argument, wherein natives already dependent on high
   levels of social welfare are likely to see refugees as interlopers who
   free-ride on welfare and thereby threaten the welfare of locals. Methods
   This article deploys Tobit and OLS fixed effect estimators in panel data
   covering 27 OECD countries during the period 1990-2014 (25 years).
   Results There is no evidence to suggest that refugee inflows per se
   increase electoral support for populist-right parties. However, a
   positive effect of refugee inflows on electoral support for
   populist-right parties is conditional upon a higher degree of social
   welfare spending, which supports the propositions of ``welfare
   chauvinism.{''} Moreover, support for populist-right parties increases
   when the degree of labor market regulation and welfare spending is high.
   These results are robust to alternative data, sample, and estimation
   techniques. Conclusion The results suggest that societies with higher
   levels of social protection through high taxes might fuel ``welfare
   chauvinism,{''} in which the segments of native population fear
   significant welfare losses from inflow of refugees.},

Abstract = {Using regression methods and propensity score matching applied to two
   different retrospective samples, this study finds evidence of a positive
   ``property confiscation{''} effect on educational attainment. We use a
   1993 survey of adults (aged 20-69) in the post-transition Eastern
   European countries of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
   Slovakia. In countries experiencing the most private property losses,
   regression results indicate that years of schooling increase by about
   0.19 for each member of an affected extended family (parents, maternal
   grandfathers, or paternal grandfathers). When all three sets of family
   members lost property, we find an increase in years of educational
   attainment of about 0.6. We also find an increase in the probability of
   post-high school education of about 0.02 for each extended family member
   whose property was confiscated. Those findings are confirmed using
   propensity score matching, which provides a larger and more pervasive
   positive confiscation effect. We also test our hypothesis using current
   and retrospective microeconomic panel data from Europe's Survey of
   Health, Aging and Retirement (SHARE), a dataset that covers countries in
   Eastern and Western Europe. We again find that property confiscation
   leads to greater educational attainment in the children of the affected
   households. We apply propensity score matching to the data and find,
   again, positive and statistically significant evidence of a confiscation
   effect on years of educational attainment. Auxiliary work indicates a
   separate channel for property confiscation's effects. Our explanation
   for the empirical results reported herein can be found in families'
   ability to pay bribes to advance their children's education.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1970s, Congress and the judiciary moved to regulate the
   National Security Agency (NSA) at a moment when such regulation might
   have restricted the growth of electronic surveillance. The Ford
   administration played a crucial role in preventing that from happening.
   It did so by controlling the flow of intelligence information to
   Congress and by establishing a flexible new legal framework for
   intelligence based on broad executive orders, narrow legislation, and
   legal opinions written by executive branch lawyers. This framework
   fostered a perception of legality that headed off calls for
   comprehensive legislation governing intelligence. The Ford
   administration's actions protected NSA from meaningful regulation,
   preserved the growth of electronic surveillance, and sustained executive
   branch preeminence in national security affairs. The episode proved
   formative for the Ford administration officials involved-including Dick
   Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Antonin Scalia-and solidified the central
   role of executive branch lawyers in national security policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article examines the challenges undocumented youths face when
   joining and leading social movement coalitions. It relies on a case
   study of New York and New Jersey to bridge the gap between the
   literatures on social movement coalitions and undocumented migration. I
   argue that the success of undocumented youths within a coalition depends
   on establishing and maintaining leadership over the movement. I show
   that leadership has implications on youths' ability to manage movement
   structure and the diversity of goals across partner organizations. Not
   without difficulties, the New Jersey coalition assembled behind a single
   `face' of the movement, streamlined its decision-making process and all
   members agreed to keep undocumented youths as the leaders of the
   movement. On the other hand, undocumented youths in New York joined a
   pre-existing coalition made up of `heavy weights' with vast resources.
   They struggled to establish clear leadership over a vast coalition of
   groups with diverse objectives, not all of whom agreed to sacrifice some
   of their goals for the sake of undocumented youths. Ultimately, the
   diversity of goals within the New York coalition proved to be too great
   of an obstacle for the movement to be successful. The article is based
   on 72 interviews conducted in 2015 with young immigrant activists
   (documented and undocumented), community organizers, union members and
   elected officials involved in the campaigns for in-state tuition and
   state financial aid in New York and New Jersey.},

Title = {Simple Markovian equilibria in dynamic spatial legislative bargaining},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper proves, by construction, the existence of Markovian equilibria
   in a dynamic spatial legislative bargaining model. Players bargain over
   policies in an infinite horizon. In each period, a sequential protocol
   of proposal-making and voting, with random proposer recognitions and a
   simple majority, produces a policy that becomes the next period's
   status-quo; the status-quo is endogenous. The construction relies on
   simple strategies determined by strategic bliss points computed by the
   algorithm we provide. A strategic bliss point, the dynamic utility
   ideal, is a moderate policy relative to a bliss point, the static
   utility ideal. Moderation is strategic and germane to the dynamic
   environment; players moderate in order to constrain the future proposals
   of opponents. Moderation is a strategic substitute; when a player's
   opponents do moderate, she does not, and when they do not moderate, she
   does. We provide conditions under which the simple strategies induced by
   the strategic bliss points computed by the algorithm deliver a
   Stationary Markov Perfect equilibrium, and we prove its existence in
   generic games with impatient players and in symmetric games. Because the
   algorithm constructs all equilibria in simple strategies, we provide
   their general characterization, and we show their generic uniqueness.},

Abstract = {Focusing on ordinary people's political talk the paper contributes to
   the study of deliberative democracy from a systemic perspective. By
   examining citizens' everyday communication, it focuses on an object that
   is rarely studied from a deliberative perspective, but crucial for the
   deliberative system's democratic character. By investigating the
   couplings between different arenas of political talk between citizens,
   ranging from informal private, semi-public and public conversations to
   formalized discussions at public events, it provides evidence on the
   appropriateness of the systemic conception of deliberative democracy.
   Analyzing data from two high-quality face-to-face surveys by means of
   structural equation modeling the paper demonstrates how these venues are
   connected to one another. The linkages between these discursive spheres
   create opportunities for bottom-up information flows from informal
   everyday conversations into formalized public discussions. To some
   extent, informal conversations also empower citizens for participation
   in these more demanding organized discussion events. Informal political
   conversations between strangers, a type of political talk largely
   neglected by extant research, emerge as a crucial nexus that funnels the
   motivational and capacity-building influence of everyday political talk
   within people's social networks into active participation in formalized
   public discussions.},

Abstract = {While Buchanan is best known for the economics of politics and
   constitutions, his seminal contributions to this field are but one
   branch of his more underlying methodology and approach to doing social
   science. Buchanan's fundamental project was to re-orient economics and
   social science toward an analysis of symbiotic exchange (catallactics)
   rather than of antiseptic allocation (optimization). The most definite
   statement of this contribution lies in Buchanan's 1963 presidential
   address to the Southern Economic Association, ``What should economists
   do?{''} which was later expanded into a book of the same title. This
   paper seeks to draw attention to several of Buchanan's more recent but
   lesser known articles where he fully develops this theme. He calls on
   economists to rediscover Adam Smith's ``elementary notion{''} about the
   division of labor and the extent of the market, and he professes the
   notion of ``generalized increasing returns{''} as a mechanism for
   economists to rediscover their Scottish Enlightenment roots within the
   neoclassical framework. In this same vein, we also discuss how
   Buchanan's rediscovery might apply to two prominent and ongoing
   twenty-first century issues, trade restrictions and populism.},

Abstract = {Among twentieth century inheritors of the classical liberal mantle, the
   notion that democracy could be understood as ``government by
   discussion{''} is found most prominently in the work of Frank H. Knight
   and James M. Buchanan. The purpose of the present paper is to compare
   Knight and Buchanan's use of the expression ``democracy is government by
   discussion{''}. Knight adopted the expression in reference to the means
   by which (a) individuals coordinate decisions and actions to facilitate
   constitutional decisions about social action and (b) we coordinate
   society's norms and values. For Buchanan, democracy as discussion occurs
   only at the level of constitutional decisions. Thus, while their use of
   the expression unites them, it also provides a way of examining the
   divide between them.},

Abstract = {In 1968, Aline Cesaire travelled to Cuba to participate in the Havana
   Cultural Congress, a mass international meeting where delegates
   discussed the place of culture in the struggle against imperialism,
   neo-colonialism, and underdevelopment. Among the likes of C.L.R. James,
   Nicolas Guillen, Rene: Depestre, Michel Leiris, and Daniel Guerin, it
   was in Havana that the Martinican politician produced the until-now
   untranslated interview with Sonia Aratan for the Casa de las Americas
   revue and his Cultural Congress conference paper - believed by Cesaire
   scholars to be lost. Both texts shed light on Cesaire's little-known
   views on Fidel Castro, the Cuban Revolution and Marxism in the context
   of late-1960s tricontinentalism. Ainie Cesaire's Cuban Documents,
   located in archives in France and Cuba, offer Spanish-to-English
   translations of a virtually unknown interview and a lost speech, which
   contribute to a re-evaluation of the Martinican's political and poetic
   projects of the late 1960s and early 1970s.},

Abstract = {This article examines how multilateral trade liberalization (not
   domestic trade policy liberalization as widely investigated in the
   relevant literature) influences the extent of tax revenue
   diversification. The latter is proxied by the ratio of trade tax revenue
   to non-trade tax revenue. The analysis primarily uses the fixed effects
   estimator and covers an unbalanced panel comprising 145 countries, over
   the period 1995-2015. Results show that multilateral trade
   liberalization increases the extent of tax revenue diversification,
   i.e., it reduces the ratio of trade tax revenue to non-trade tax
   revenue. Furthermore, less advanced economies benefit more than
   relatively advanced countries of the tax revenue diversification impact
   of multilateral trade liberalization. Additionally, countries that are
   highly dependent on the agricultural sector (for example, poor countries
   or low-income countries) experience a higher positive effect of
   multilateral trade liberalization on tax revenue diversification than
   countries with a higher share of value added in the non-agriculture
   sector in total output. These results, therefore, call for further
   reduction of world trade barriers, in particular through greater
   cooperation among Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
   promote multilateral trade liberalization.},

Abstract = {This essay uses the case of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to discuss
   ``the coloniality of disaster{''}: how catastrophic events like
   hurricanes, earthquakes, but also other forms political and economic
   crisis deepen the fault lines of long-existing racial and colonial
   histories. It argues that disaster capitalism needs to be understood as
   a form of ratio-colonial capitalism and that this in turn requires us to
   question our understandings of both ``resilience{''} and ``recovery.{''}
   The article focuses on the ``wait of disaster{''} as a temporal logic of
   state subjugation and on how Puerto Ricans responded to state
   abandonment through modes of autogesaon, or autonomous organizing. It
   concludes that while resiliency can be coopted in service of a
   neoliberal recovery, it can also be the site for gestating new forms of
   sovereignty and new visions of postcolonial recovery.},

Abstract = {Militia groups have only recently started to attract scholarly attention
   in the literature on internal conflicts. This attention is mostly
   focused on either the causes of their emergence or their functions and
   performance during the conflict. The role of militia groups in
   post-conflict processes, however, has not been adequately addressed.
   This article intends to fill this gap by analyzing the case of village
   guards, a type of pro-government militia system in Turkey, based on
   qualitative evidence from field research. While the dominant narrative
   in the literature identifies militia groups as spoilers in peace
   processes, the article shows that militias do not act as spoilers under
   certain conditions. In the case of the village guard system in Turkey,
   the permanent integration of militias into the state's regular military
   apparatus prevented militia groups from acting as spoilers. It then
   argues that the permanent integration of wartime militia systems is a
   consequence of two factors: militia networking and a lack of
   comprehensive peace-building structures.},

Abstract = {While military and civilian dictators tend to rule through fear,
   absolute monarchies do not depend exclusively on it and can also derive
   legitimacy from the historical, cultural and religious roles they play.
   That opportunity provides absolute monarchs with an option
   (constitutional monarchy) that is unavailable to other types of
   dictators. On the one hand, the institutional flexibility of that option
   might facilitate negotiations between an absolute monarch and the
   regime's elites. On the other hand, it might complicate power-sharing,
   as the monarch may fail to commit to the principle of non-interference,
   while the regime's elites may attempt to disempower the monarch. By
   formalizing a power-sharing game between a monarch and the regime's
   elites, this paper argues that the threat of civil disobedience
   contributes to the resolution of commitment problems and also explains
   the reasons some constitutional monarchs hold and on occasion exercise
   substantive political powers despite the fact that their ability to
   survive presumably depends on their commitment to non-interference.},

Abstract = {This article investigates gender gaps in political knowledge by
   exploiting a pooled dataset containing the four modules of the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, thereby allowing the comparison
   of seven different measurements of political knowledge, the most
   comprehensive comparison to date. The paper's findings are threefold.
   First, the two conventional types of political knowledge-factual or
   placement knowledge-belong to different latent constructs and are not
   interchangeable. Second, most factual knowledge scales produce important
   variations in the size of gender gaps across and within countries over
   time. Third, ``don't know'' as an incorrect response generally leads to
   broader gender gaps, given men's higher propensity to guess.},

Title = {Countering Violent Extremism Online: The Experiences of Informal Counter
   Messaging Actors},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-87},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The online space is a haven for extremists of all kinds. Although
   efforts to remove violent and extremist content are increasing, there is
   a widely accepted need to also contest extremist messages with counter
   messages designed to undermine and disrupt extremist narratives. While
   the majority of academic focus has been on large and well-funded efforts
   linked to governments, this article considers the experiences of
   informal actors who are active in contesting extremist messaging but who
   lack the support of large institutions. Informal actors come without
   some of the baggage that accompanies formal counter message campaigns,
   which have been attacked as lacking in credibility and constituting
   ``just more government propaganda.{''} This has been noted by some of
   the wider countering violent extremism industry and the appetite for
   incorporating ``real-world{''} content in their campaigns seems to be
   rising. This article fills a gap in our knowledge of the experiences of
   informal counter messaging actors. Through a series of in-depth
   qualitative interviews it demonstrates that, despite the potentially
   serious risks of incorporating greater levels of informal content, there
   is an appetite among informal actors to engage with formal campaigns
   where they can be selective over who they work with and maintain a
   degree of control.},

Title = {Trade and the predatory state: Ricardian exchange with armed competition
   for resources-a diagrammatic exposition},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {182},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {459-494},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Armed conflicts-especially wars-between/among nation-states, considered
   as monolithic wholes, surely reduce the mutual benefit they enjoy from
   trade. That common sense is virtually self-evident. Wars destroy trust
   that is essential to trade, wars and preparations for war absorb
   resources otherwise available for productive investment and exchange.
   Wars destroy people, their capital, and land. Anticipation or fear of
   war distorts free exchange, causing nations to protect domestic
   production. Accordingly, I was surprised and puzzled, when attending a
   seminar by Professors Garfinkel and Syropoulos (Trading with the enemy,
   Memo of March 1, 2017, Department of Economics, University of
   California-Irvine, Irvine, CA) to learn of a rigorous mathematical model
   that entailed mixed motives in international systems that might lead at
   once to armed conflict among states which nevertheless simultaneously
   benefit from mutual trade. So here I develop a primitive Ricardian model
   to explore how incentives to trade interact with those of predation. Its
   primary purpose is heuristic: to assemble the components of Ricardo,
   present them in a manner that specifically incorporates opportunities
   for appropriation through armed conflict, and shows how the component
   working parts fit together. Importantly, the paper builds the simplest
   possible model for the case at hand. Methodologically, the steps are
   geometric/diagrammatic with only ancillary attention to mathematics. The
   aim is to construct and explore the simplest possible classical,
   old-fashioned model that could permit analysis of those trade-predation
   linkages that seem to permit so unexpected a conclusion.},

Abstract = {Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and
   political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine
   the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking
   Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish,
   respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language
   media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and
   Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging
   in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that
   seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option
   next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward
   Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a
   political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion
   and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like
   immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime
   identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking
   Latino voters.},

Abstract = {This special issue addresses the urgent need for reflexive introspection
   about conducting research in violent contexts. To do so, it explores two
   interrelated dimensions of the places where researchers conduct
   fieldwork: 1) temporality; and 2) power. In the current political
   moment, fully engaging with these dimensions of field sites has become
   an ethical and security imperative, as well as a methodological
   imperative. Once we put these two dimensions at the centre of analysis,
   the need to re-conceptualize fieldwork beyond the binaries of here/there
   and insider/outsider also becomes apparent. Thus, this special issue
   approaches fieldwork, not only as a means to a research end, but
   instead, as an opportunity for social action in itself. From a variety
   of methodological and epistemological positions, the contributors to
   this issue build on recent feminist work that explores fieldwork's
   geopolitical dimensions. Collectively, these interdisciplinary essays
   argue in favour of reimagining fieldwork as an imaginative and
   transformative act.},

Abstract = {Recent empirical observations indicate that firm size responds to
   cyclical fluctuations in economic activities. By analyzing the effects
   of endogenous overhead costs in the economy, this paper finds that in
   response to a fiscal expansion, firm size will increase if the
   relationship between overhead costs and the number of firms is positive,
   while firm size will decrease if the relationship is negative.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the proliferation of the Chicago metropolitan
   region's post-recession regional economic development initiatives, and a
   consequent shift towards manufacturing-centric development programmes
   among regional planning bodies and public-private institutions. This
   phenomenon provides important insights about the post-recession economic
   development policy terrain in mature city-regions and the politics of
   economic development imaginaries. While there has been justified
   celebration of a new creativity in urban and regional economic
   development and industrial policy in the geographical literature, the
   Chicagoland case indicates that defensive actions, meant to recode
   older, disciplinary attitudes towards the region's labour pools and
   lobbying from region's industrial capitals, are an important element of
   the region's post-recession policy coordination. What is dubbed herein
   as `manufacturing discourse' in Chicagoland originates in institutions
   endogenous to the region's industrial capitals and represents a longer
   term project of maintaining a specific type of socio-spatial fix as the
   predominant mode of crisis response among the region's governance
   bodies, civil society and fractions of capital. In turn, it is argued
   that geographers and urban scholars need to theorize properly about the
   link between `soft' economic imaginaries and the protection of power
   centres within city-regions, particularly amid state rationality crises
   and bursts of policy experimentation.},
