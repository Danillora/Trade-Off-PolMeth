   CENTURY},
Booktitle = {HO CHI MINH'S HERITAGE IN VIETNAM AND ABROAD},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {251-262},
Abstract = {Since the early 20th century in Vietnamese society there began to form
   the perception of women, different from the classical Confucian model,
   having contributed to the widespread emergence of the problem of gender
   inequality and the formation of the concept of ``women's rights{''}. The
   women's issue was one of the central elements of Vietnamese social
   thought in the first half of the 20th century.
   The article is devoted to identifying the place of the women's issue in
   the work of the founder of the modern Vietnamese state, as well as
   demonstrating the real changes in the situation of women in Vietnam due
   to Ho Chi Minh's activities. The changes in the status of women at the
   legislative level are shown by using the Constitution, the Family Law
   and various regulatory acts. Also, the question is touched concerning a
   new model of perception of women's activities, which has developed due
   to the revolutionary situation in the country.
   The sources involved are the Complete Works of Ho Chi Minh, as well as
   the DRV legal framework. Also, the author has used some researchworks of
   Vietnamese scholars published in the Internet and materials of the
   Women's Union of Vietnam.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Pages = {630-649},
Abstract = {This paper tests the usability of the Taylor rule under the conditions
   of the Czech economy using a single-equation error correction model in
   the period from 2000 to the second quarter of 2019 and finds key
   variables for the CNB's monetary policy setting. Other important
   monetary policy rules and their effect on the optimal monetary policy
   setting are also discussed. The starting point of the empirical part is
   a summary of the current monetary policy of the CNB and an analysis of
   its decision model. Since 2008, the new DSGE model g3 replaced the
   previous QPM model. At the end of the theoretical part, foreign
   experience and various approaches to the estimation of the Taylor rule
   are summarized. The CNB's two-week repo rate is best described by the
   size of the output gap in the domestic economy, the ECB's base
   refinancing rate, the change in the price level measured by the consumer
   price index and the previous value of the repo rate. The paper also
   analyses the relationship between the repo rate and the ECB's basic
   refinancing rates, confirming the historically high dependence of
   domestic monetary policy on the ECB's actions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the different approaches given to the
   concept of social reintegration as well as to its applications in
   teenagers. With different perspectives, Mexico is beginning to look at
   youngsters as an essential group. In fact, it has recognized that public
   policies should be involved when targeting this group. However,
   government programs rarely consider those in conflict with the law. From
   the psycho-juridical view, the phenomenon could be studied from the
   social learning theory and social labeling. The method used was a
   systematic review of the social reintegration concept within scientific
   literature in the period from January 2017 to June 2017 using Google
   Scholar. Out of 93 articles obtained, 18 met the criteria and were used
   in the study. Results suggest that social reintegration in teenagers
   does not differ from the concept used when applied in adults.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an ever-evolving corpus of scholarly, political, and public
   texts, this article reflects on the temporalisation and
   territorialisation of Africa in response to Europe's `migration crisis.'
   Re-awakened fears of the African other and its own divisive internal
   politics have presented Europe's leaders with a dilemma: how to contain
   African ambitions to move while remaining true to their self-professed
   commitment to individual freedom, universal rights, and global progress.
   To solve it, Europe has updated longstanding colonial narratives and
   identities by constructing a timespace trap. This trap justifies
   exclusion as readying Africa for an elusive global future. Employing
   temporal forms of socio-spatial governance, the Europeans dangle a
   global and mobile future to Africans willing to mould themselves into
   externally defined parameters of moral respectability. Adherence to
   immigration regulations authored and often imposed by Europe, together
   with a demonstrated commitment to family, community, and country mark
   one's suitability to enter a global future. But meeting these legal and
   moral standards effectively means building a sedentary life dedicated to
   `development at home'. Together with allies across sectors and
   continents, they are realising their ambitions through frameworks that
   morally justify intercepting and pre-empting movement as means of
   empowering and perfecting Africans. Doing so effectively excludes
   Africans from a shared, global humanity while discursively shielding
   Europe's liberal commitments.},

Abstract = {Objective I contend that City Plaza, a refugee-run hotel in Athens,
   Greece has actually used socialist and anarchist political theories in
   an innovative way for our current global system by subverting the norms
   of the nation-state with regard to refugee care. I am framing this
   argument by considering Derrida's discussion of unconditional and
   conditional hospitality.
   Methods The article is based on ethnographic research carried out in
   Athens during the summers from 2016-2019.
   Results I suggest that in its innovative methods of providing refugee
   care, City Plaza is highly successful.
   Conclusion While Derrida contends that unconditional hospitality, the
   acceptance and embracing of the stranger without condition or question,
   is a moral imperative, realistically this is not possible in our current
   global system. I argue that at City Plaza, the improbable was achieved
   as a group of activists subverted the dominant system and yielded better
   results than state governments and international organizations with much
   greater resources.},

Abstract = {Objective This article considers the raison d'etre of international
   institutions in the occupied Palestinian territories during the Oslo
   period (1993-2000) and discusses how these institutions have shaped the
   notion of a future Palestinian state through their policy
   recommendations and development projects.
   Methods Drawing on neo-Gramscian concepts of hegemony and
   internationalization of the state this project analyzes the Oslo peace
   process through primary source data and information in the Oslo Accords
   as well as the official reports and publications of the major
   international development and financial organizations involved in the
   Palestinian territories.
   Results Through policy recommendations, development projects, and donor
   funding and aid coordination, international institutions set in motion
   the neoliberal conceptualization and configuration of Palestine during
   the Oslo process.
   Conclusion I conclude with a review of the findings, as illustrated
   throughout the article, and emphasize that Palestine's conceptualization
   will continue to be rooted in the development of the neoliberal
   condition as long as a political process that would lead to Palestinian
   self-determination and an end the conflict is not pursued.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to help explain the history of the public
   spending-to-GDP ratio in France by examining the production of laws and
   regulations. It empirically finds a positive and significant
   relationship between the number of pages in the Official Gazette of the
   French Republic and the development of the public expenditure-to-GDP
   ratio. We rely on the number of pages in the Official Gazette as a proxy
   for the cost of implementing laws and regulations. If unchecked, a
   proliferation of laws and regulations expands public spending. Over the
   period 1905-2015, a 10\% increase in pages caused a 1.14\% increase in
   the public expenditure-to-GDP ratio.},

Abstract = {Applying an array of quasi-experimental designs, proponents of causal
   inference approaches to studying American politics are setting their
   sights on the study of Congress. In many ways, that focus makes sense:
   improved research design allows us to draw stronger analytical
   inferences from observational data, bolstering our understanding of
   legislative politics. But are the pursuit and methods of causal
   inference equally well suited to the study of Congress and history? In
   this article, I consider the application of causal inference methods in
   historically oriented studies of Congress. Drawing from my coauthored
   work on the interdependence of Congress and the Federal Reserve over the
   Fed's first century and earlier work on the institutional evolution of
   Congress, I point to the tradeoffs between knowledge and certainty that
   are endemic in causal inference approaches-and arguably especially so in
   the study of Congress and history.},

Title = {How do the factors determining terrorist groups' longevity differ from
   those affecting their success?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper distinguishes a terrorist group's survivability from its
   success. Terrorist groups succeed if they join the political process or
   achieve some of their goals. Based on a sample of 470 terrorist groups,
   we first estimate the determinants of groups' ending and, conditional on
   their demise, we identify factors conducive to their success. We find
   that religious fundamentalist terrorist groups survive longer than
   left-wing, nationalist/separatist, or right-wing groups; but religious
   groups are less apt than other ideologies to attain their objectives or
   to join the political process. Larger groups survive longer and possess
   a better success prognosis. Within-country group competition is
   conducive to survival, but harmful to success. Controls include groups'
   goals, groups' strategic choices, and home country's characteristics.
   Robustness tests disaggregate our success measure, provide panel
   estimates, and incorporate other controls.},

Abstract = {Game theoretic analyses of American institutions and American political
   development largely are disconnected enterprises, yet they share many
   points of contact and thus opportunities for fruitful exchange. In this
   essay I discuss the value and limits of formalization for the enterprise
   of institutional analysis that those fields have in common. I
   conceptualize two broad approaches that formal modelers have taken to
   study institutions-institutions as game forms, and institutions as
   equilibria-that have been relatively successful for understanding
   institutionalchoiceandstability. At the same time, formal modelers have
   been less successful in addressing institutionalchangeanddevelopment,
   topics about which APD has much to offer. Overall, I contend that
   crosstalk between the two fields can benefit them both.},

   elections},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper, I estimate the causal effect of public funding of
   elections on candidates' reemergence and success using a regression
   discontinuity design in the context of South Korean municipal
   legislative elections. I find that public financing has no overall
   effect on candidate reemergence and success in a subsequent election. I
   do find, however, that campaign expense reimbursement has a positive
   effect on those who are formerly underrepresented in politics,
   especially women, in whose case it increases the probability of running
   again by 24.6 percentage points and that of winning the next election by
   10.1 percentage points. I also find some suggestive evidence that
   campaign expense reimbursement can help female candidates become career
   politicians.},

Abstract = {Members of the subfield of American Political Development (APD), like
   other political scientists, are confronting the identification
   revolution in the social sciences. They are exploring whether and how
   evolving standards of causal inference can shape the research the
   subfield performs. Almost by definition, APD research involves analyzing
   observational data, where variation in the data is provided by `nature',
   and thus faces the formidable challenges that follow from the inability
   of the researcher to manipulate the assignment of units of interest to
   treatment and control conditions. Fortunately, the very scope of
   historical analysis can create opportunities to take advantage of
   natural experiments and exogenous inputs that alter the course of events
   to produce more convincing causal analyses. Yet, historical
   investigation presents unique challenges to standard methodological
   approaches, certainly no less the case when causal identification is
   prioritized. Understanding and confronting these challenges is essential
   to taking advantage of inferential opportunities presented by historical
   data, as our consideration of scholarship on economic development
   demonstrates.},

Abstract = {Recent micro-level studies have suggested that globalization-in
   particular, economic globalization and trade with China-breeds political
   polarization and populism. This study examines whether or not those
   results generalize by examining the country-level association between
   vote shares for European populist parties and economic globalization.
   Using data on vote shares for 267 right-wing and left-wing populist
   parties in 33 European countries during 1980-2017, and globalization
   data from the KOF institute, we find no evidence of a positive
   association between (economic or other types of) globalization and
   populism. EU membership is associated with a 4-6-percentage-point larger
   vote share for right-wing populist parties.},

Abstract = {Objective To examine whether the consumption of Spanish-language news
   influences perceptions of issue salience among Latinos, the largest
   ethnoracial group in the United States.
   Methods This mixed-methods analysis incorporates conceptual content
   analyses of English and Spanish-language online newspapers from major
   Latino metropolitan areas, logistic regressions, and robustness checks
   to predict the salience of Latino issues.
   Results Spanish-language news media covers immigration to a much greater
   extent than mainstream media, even within the same geographical
   locations; as a result, Latinos who consume Spanish-language news are
   more likely to report immigration as a salient issue, even after
   accounting for important predispositions such as nativity and in-group
   linked fate.
   Conclusion This study highlights the importance of Spanish-language and
   ethnic media in a growingly diverse country, where ethnoracial groups
   will soon make up the majority of the country.},

Title = {Rethinking urban adaptation as a scalar geopolitics of climate
   governance: climate policy in the devolved territories of the UK},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This paper exposes missing interconnections between the urban, national
   and international scales in the analysis of climate adaptation policy
   and territorial governance in the UK. Drawing upon the results of
   interviews with adaptation stakeholders in seven UK city-regions, it
   examines: (1) the increasing discursive alignment of the `urban' and the
   `national' in international climate adaptation policy and
   decision-making processes; and (2) the contradictions between urban and
   national climate policy discourses across the UK devolved territories.
   The paper identifies and accounts for an emergent scalar geopolitics of
   climate adaptation governance as urban climate actions and knowledges
   are enrolled in the UK state's efforts to respond to broader
   international climate governance and policy imperatives. We call for
   further research on how adaptation knowledge is geopolitically mobilized
   at different scales of climate governance.},

Title = {`But we are the most backward': Hierarchical categorization of modernity
   in contemporary Chinese national identity},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article examines how the classification of specific territories in
   China as backward constructs contemporary Chinese national identity.
   Recent scholarship has examined the role that regions within nations
   play as repositories of undesirable traits of national identity. This
   article examines how spaces at scales other than the region within a
   national territory are classified on a continuum of backwardness and
   modernity through an examination of four forms of classification of
   political spaces within China: minzu (ethnicity), westness, poverty,
   rural/urban. Drawing on ethnographic field work in Western China,
   alongside the writings of noted anthropologist Fei Xiaotong and others
   Chinese intellectuals, this article shows that spaces were discursively
   categorized as backward. This classification of backwardness is not a
   case of binary othering, but rather exists as a graduated teleological
   hierarchy in which all spaces classified as backward have the
   theoretical ability to move out of their backwardness through state-led
   development. With the goal of helping backward spaces advance towards
   modernity, the state has enacted de jure forms of territorial
   classification target specific spaces for development and modernization.},

Abstract = {Simon Dalby has most fervently argued to reframe various current
   security challenges as `anthropogenic geopolitics'. This paper takes up
   Dalby's call discussing theoretically classical as well as critical
   readings of geopolitics arguing that both are helpful analytical lenses
   that do, however, focus on very different aspects. Empirically, these
   two geopolitical frames are used for an analysis of the current boom of
   renewable energies. The paper thus first analyses geographic and
   territorial determinants of the new energy revolution showing the
   relevant, but overall more benign conflict potential RE might entail and
   does so regarding material input, RE installations, storage and the grid
   system. In a second step, the spatial politics of RE are debated with a
   focus on the German energy transition arguing that a new regional
   geopolitical discourse has emerged after the Ukraine crisis. The paper
   is a critical - although normatively favourable - reading of the promise
   of Prometheus and the potential unintended consequences that are in
   store in Pandora's box claiming that in the end the fulfilment of RE's
   potential depends on politics.},

Abstract = {From the strategic point of view, not all foreign direct investments
   (FDI) are always positively benefiting the host economy, i.e. not all
   multinational enterprises (MNEs) are promoting local host economies.
   Even more, not all FDIs are equally beneficial to different sectors
   within the same economy. The fact is that FDI can impact different
   sectors in various ways, and the impact is not only based on the amount
   of FDI itself but on MNEs' motivations and the peculiarities of the host
   economy, which can differ from country to county. In other words, only
   FDI numbers aggregated per year are not really giving a comprehensive
   picture of the situation and in many cases lead to incorrect strategic
   decisions, as it has happened in many countries, including Georgia.},

Journal = {REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE},

Abstract = {During the first round of the presidential election on April 22, 2017,
   voters from three polling stations in the municipality of Fort-de-France
   (Martinique) were asked to test two voting methods: the Alternative Vote
   and the Borda rule at 4. The purpose of this paper is to report the
   results of this experiment which is the first of its kind in the
   overseas territories. The results obtained show discrepancies with
   official results at both local and national levels. On the basis of the
   gross results, in addition to being the winner under each of the rules
   tested, J.-L. Melenchon is also the Condorcet winner while J. Cheminade
   is the Condorcet loser under the alternative vote and M. Le Pen is the
   Condorcet loser under the rule of Borda at 4. After correcting the bias
   of representativeness and participation, E. Macron becomes the winner
   for each of the rule tested.},

Title = {Fiscal rules and budget forecast errors of Italian municipalities},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study the impact of the domestic stability pact on the accuracy of
   budget forecasts of Italian municipalities. Identification of the causal
   effect exploits a quasi-natural experiment generated by the removal in
   2001 of the fiscal restraints on budget decisions for municipalities
   with fewer than 5000 inhabitants and by stricter budgetary restrictions
   and severe penalties for noncompliers in 2002. We find that relaxing
   fiscal rules had a sizeable impact on budget forecast errors, especially
   in 2002. In fact, revenue (expenditure) forecast errors for
   municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants became 26\% (22\%)
   larger than in the past.},

Abstract = {This research note describes an exploratory study that examined what
   makes two types of campaigns go viral online. Using research in
   communication, persuasion, and emotional valence, we conducted a survey
   experiment that exposed viewers to persuasive videos and asked about
   sharing behaviors. Results demonstrated that personal relevance and
   cognitive elaboration on content are key predictors of viral sharing
   behaviors. In addition, both positive and negative emotions play a role,
   but in different circumstances. Overall, this study provides a framework
   for future scholars to examine the phenomenon of ``virality.{''}},

Abstract = {What explains the differences in the Sino-Russian oil and gas
   cooperation? Overall, I suggest, the several trajectories are explained
   by the dissimilarities of oil and gas as commodities and potential
   foreign policy tools. These differences, along withother factors, such
   as corporate culture and individual personalities, shed light on the
   strategies of Russia's gas conglomerates, Gazprom and Rosneft. Yet, if a
   more nuanced understanding of variation within these energy markets
   illuminates the reasons behind the sequencing of oil and gas
   cross-border pipeline projects, what explains the particular timing of
   the landmark 2014 gas deal? Why after 15 years of stalemate in the
   Sino-Russian gas cooperation did breakthroughs occur in 2014? And what
   explains the modesty of the record in gas cooperation to date? Many
   factors are undoubtedly involved, both economic and political; however,
   I contend that the conclusive factor can be found in underlying domestic
   politics. The article outlines the role of national narratives in
   driving both Russia and China's energy foreign policy and goes on to
   argue that the Sino-Russian gas breakthrough in 2014 was due to the
   peculiar way in which domestic factors paired with international
   circumstances to produce the outcomeat that particular moment.},

Abstract = {The Estonian Citizens' Assembly (ECA) was initiated in late 2012 as a
   direct consequence of a legitimacy crisis of Estonian political parties
   and representative institutions. The spark igniting this crisis was the
   unraveling of a scheme of illegal party financing. The response from
   governmental institutions took the form of a democratic innovation
   involving public crowd-sourcing and deliberative mini-publics. This
   study reports on a survey among the participants in the online
   crowd-sourcing process of the ECA (n = 847). The study examines how this
   democratic innovation influenced participants' social and political
   trust as well as the impact of participants' predispositions and level
   of satisfaction with the ECA on changes in trust. We find that
   participants that had positive predispositions and who were satisfied
   with the ECA were more likely to gain trust. Furthermore, we also find
   that the participants, in general, became more distrustful of political
   institutions, while their participation fostered increased social trust.
   This outcome differs from the intentions of the Estonian institutions
   which organized the ECA and sheds new light on the role of democratic
   innovations in the context of legitimacy crises. This is an important
   step forward in the scholarly understanding of the relationship between
   democratic innovation and trust.},

Abstract = {Disasters create spaces for the political to unfold. This paper
   contributes to the recurring debates on space and the political in
   geography by providing a novel empirical focus: following a fire in
   Leerdal, Norway in 2014, contesting discourses on how emergency services
   should be spatially organized revealed themselves. A scalar discourse of
   the local, situated in discourses on periphery and rurality in Norway,
   emerged to contest a neoliberal discourse promoted by the government. I
   illustrate the scalar discourse of the local through four identified
   narratives in Norwegian newspapers that emphasize different aspects of
   the local. This demonstrates how scalar categories are meshed with
   everyday vocabulary, and hence are important to study. Although a space
   of the political was realized following the fire, in the last part of
   the paper I reflect on why the scalar discourse of the local has not
   gained recognition as legitimate contestation, as reforms aiming to
   centralize and/or merge continue to be rolled out in Norway.},

Abstract = {Objective In this COVID-19 pandemic, there are not many sound studies
   focusing on the extensive socioeconomic impact ushered in with this
   disaster. This work aims to understand the thought of the youth, their
   opinions and understanding of various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methodology Using a combined qualitative-quantitative approach,
   Q-method, we tried to assess people's discernment from different
   perspectives. This was done through a questionnaire survey method during
   the national-level lockdown 1.0 in India. Results We have differentiated
   the perceptions of youth respondents into seven factors, including six
   subdimensions, on COVID-19 pandemic (viz., science, society,
   environment, economy, politics, and religion). The choices and opinions
   have been segregated into two major groups: quantitative and
   qualitative. Conclusion This work yielded a firsthand ground-level
   insight into the comprehensive yet diverse responses from youths
   regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in India. There are various topics that
   arise from this study, for example, misinformation, misinterpretation of
   science, dubious nature of faith in governance and policy, turbid
   understanding of strategy, polarization of opinion, and so forth.
   Following this work of identification, the next steps would be to
   understand how to mitigate the problems toward betterment in the
   COVID-19 pandemic situation or similar widespread crisis events in the
   foreseeable future.},

Title = {How Outside Money Makes Governing More Difficult},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {486-502},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Little empirical attention has been paid to the possible relationship
   between the sources of money in campaigns and whether political parties
   within the legislature are more unified or fragmented. Using recent data
   along with original interviews of leading party figures and former
   members of Congress, this article assesses how the rise of contributions
   from organizations outside the political parties affects the unity or
   disunity of the party caucus in the legislature. With highly polarized
   political parties, party fragmentation makes all the more difficult the
   building of effective governing coalitions. Exploiting state variation
   in political action committee (PAC) contribution limits on party voting
   heterogeneity-the extent to which the caucus votes together-we find that
   higher levels of permitted PAC contributions decrease the unity of
   parties in the legislature. The results hold for both the majority and
   the minority party; for state legislatures that are both professional
   and part-time; and for whether the majority leader fully controls the
   legislative agenda or does not do so. Through interviews with former
   party leaders, campaign committee and congressional staff, and rank and
   file members, we link this effect to federal reforms that have weakened
   the parties relative to outside interest groups and thus limited the
   leverage party leaders have to forge more unified party caucuses. As the
   debate over partisanship and government dysfunction in U.S. politics
   continues, this article adds an important component to understanding how
   changes in campaign finance laws have contributed to fragmenting the
   political parties, and hence, to making effective governing coalitions
   more difficult to forge.},

Abstract = {Partisan identities do not only shape people's political attitudes, but
   also their perceptions of real-world developments. This is evident from
   the partisan economic perception gap: Government supporters have more
   positive economic perceptions than opposition supporters, especially
   when the economic situation is ambiguous. Recent research has shown that
   the size of this partisan gap varies across different contexts and that
   the state of the economy and working of political institutions are
   important moderators. Still, little is known about the influence of
   another important contextual variable: the degree of partisanship in the
   media system. Based on a theoretical discussion of partisan-motivated
   rationalization and the information environment, the paper tests the
   hypothesis that, due to selective exposure and exposure to more partisan
   content, people in partisan media systems have more polarized economic
   perceptions. A multilevel analysis of representative surveys in
   twenty-six European countries in 2014 shows that the partisan perception
   gap is, indeed, larger in countries with more polarized media systems,
   after controlling for other relevant country characteristics. People
   with the highest level of media consumption are most affected by
   media-party parallelism. The findings are relevant for worldwide
   discussions about posttruth politics, as they show that the media
   environment influences gaps in people's perceptions of real-world
   developments.},

Abstract = {The work of southern sociologist Thomas Jackson Woofter Jr. (1893-1972)
   is frequently cited by American historians, but his contribution to
   government policy on agriculture in the New Deal, Social Security in the
   1940s, and demography in the Cold War remains underappreciated. He left
   the University of North Carolina to direct government research on rural
   relief in the 1930s, Social Security enhancement during and after World
   War II, and foreign population and manpower projections during the Cold
   War. Contributing to the delivery of essential programs in key agencies,
   he participated in internal and external debates over policy and social
   attitudes between 1930 and 1960. Woofter worked for the Federal
   Emergency Relief Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the
   Farm Security Agency, the Federal Security Agency, and the Central
   Intelligence Agency, improving data-gathering and assisting transitions
   in federal policymaking. This article assesses his role in those
   agencies, using official records, other primary materials, and secondary
   sources.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain how the Colombian state addresses coca
   demands and mobilizations: negotiating and then defaulting --the
   noncompliance cycle. Despite how apparently counterproductive it is, the
   cycle is persistent and, perhaps the main form of the state's response
   to those mobilizations. I argue that part of the noncompliance cycle is
   due to the nature of the coalitions that support the drug war in
   Colombia. Furthermore, these coalitions, typically long, range from
   global to purely local, so they can charge peasants with prohibitive
   costs without being affected by the new policies. In addition, these
   have not always been smoothly articulated to the country's greater waged
   global war, the war against subversion. Both circumstances generate
   permanent blockages, instabilities, and problems of collective action.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we contribute to the debate regarding the relationship
   between lobbying and environmental regulation by explicitly taking into
   account the role of market competition. We analyse how the number of
   firms affects both the effectiveness of lobbying in fighting
   environmental regulation and the individual incentive for firms to
   switch to green technology. To explore this issue, we present a Cournot
   oligopoly where firms can choose between abating the environmental
   externality or lobbying the government to hold a loose regulation. We
   investigate two alternative government's political objectives. In the
   first, government aims to only minimise the externality, while in the
   second, it also cares about the consumers surplus. We find that, in both
   cases, the higher the number of firms, the higher the incentive to
   abate. However, while in the first case, either both types of firms
   coexist or all firms switch to be green, in the other case, there exists
   a minimum the number of firms below which all firms remain polluting.},

Title = {The arc of autonomy in Georgia's Ajara},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Drawing on the case study of Georgia's Ajara region, this paper makes
   the argument for foregrounding autonomy as a strategy used by states for
   managing diverse territories. Particularly salient to the concept of
   autonomy is its flexibility as a spatial fix, one which can be variously
   deployed depending on the form of political relations between center and
   periphery. Empirically, we draw from a set of 22 interviews conducted in
   Tbilisi and Ajara's capital of Batumi to trace the arc of autonomy in
   the republic through its Soviet and post-Soviet history. Established on
   cultural grounds, the form of Ajara's autonomy has subsequently been
   institutional, instrumental, and nominal. The republic today maintains
   its autonomous status, though its competences are delimited from
   Tbilisi; rather, this status serves as a model for the future-albeit
   unlikely-reincorporation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the Georgian
   state. In conclusion, the paper endorses greater engagement with
   autonomies that fall short of conflict and separatism but nonetheless
   provide valuable insights into the suite of strategies that states
   employ in the management of territory. Autonomies are possibly entering
   a new, more unstable period of centralizing pressures that will
   challenge their original purpose and perhaps also regional peace and
   stability.},

Abstract = {The article uses the struggle for an autonomous social centre in Prague
   to examine the concept of post-politicization in the post-socialist
   city. Using the case of the squatted social centre Klinika, it discusses
   different kinds of prefiguration and argues that the struggle for this
   space has the ability to re-politicize the post-political city. The case
   of Klinika demonstrates that post-politics is not a one-way process -
   but re-politicization is not either. These processes may therefore be
   understood as something akin to a ping-pong interaction between the
   post-political forces of order and the re-politicizing action of radical
   opponents of the status quo.},

Abstract = {Geopolitical shifts and the changing significance of borders in the EU's
   neighbourhood are usually understood as a matter of international power
   politics. Factors that accompany geopolitical impact on borders, such as
   media coverage of geopolitical change, often appear as secondary or
   irrelevant. However the recent Ukraine conflict revealed the contrary as
   pro-EU attitudes were strongly supported by `western' media. Therefore
   this paper seeks to clarify the role of news media in creating
   perspectives and attitudes on geopolitical shifts and the significance
   of European borders. Empirical evidence on the coverage of the evolving
   Ukraine crisis by German news sources portrays the media as promoters of
   biased framings and imaginaries which suggest that the EU be a potential
   conflict party in the newly evolving geostrategic confrontation in its
   eastern neighbourhood. The findings indicate that during critical
   periods of the Ukraine crisis media reports combined rising euphoria
   about Europe and `the West', as defenders of the `good cause', with
   excessive moral polarising and the discursive normalisation of a
   rhetoric of escalation. Imaginaries of a bipolar world (The West against
   Russia) and a new Cold War prepared the ground for a new understanding
   of European borders and neighbourhood relations as being manipulable at
   will.},

Abstract = {The policy of the European Union, which promotes a vision of Europe
   without borders and has fostered the development of cooperation across
   borders over 25 years, has led, in some parts of Europe, to the
   emergence of so-called integrated cross-border regions. Thus far, the
   increase of cross-border flows and interactions has always been a
   normative and almost unquestioned policy paradigm. However, tendencies
   of re-bordering and signs of growing Euroscepticism can also be observed
   nowadays in these border regions, which show the importance of
   investigating the negative externalities that can be generated by
   cross-border integration. This article attempts to do this by focusing
   on three case studies usually considered as among the most integrated
   ones in Europe because of cross-border flows related to work: the
   cross-border metropolitan regions of Basel, Geneva and Luxembourg. Our
   findings show that if several decades of cross-border integration have
   led to the reinforcement of the functional linkages between the border
   regions, some effects of the cross-border integration process have also
   created a functional specialisation of space that relies on social and
   economic inequalities. Such a situation contradicts the ideal of
   cross-border territorial cohesion and helps to better understand the
   rise of Euroscepticism in some of the border areas.},

Abstract = {Common-pool resources (CPR) are frequently used as risk-management tools
   against risk on private activities. The impact of this safety-net use of
   CPR on the individual investment into and extraction from the commons is
   analyzed in this paper. Agents of the community first choose to invest
   in their private project and in the CPR; second, they choose how much to
   extract from their private project and the commons. The model compares
   two types of risk-management tool: CPR as (ex post) risk-coping and (ex
   ante) risk-diversification mechanisms. It also compares two situations
   regarding risk: risk on a private project and uncertainty on CPR
   investment by other community members. The theoretical predictions are
   empirically tested with experimental economics. To this end, we propose
   an original CPR game composed of an investment period and an extraction
   period. Our result clearly shows that risk reduction in the private
   project unambiguously decreases investment in the CPR, while it does not
   impact CPR extraction. We also show that a risk-coping strategy is well
   understood as more flexible and influenced by the outcome in terms of
   private project yield.},

Abstract = {Monitoring networks are playing an important role in acquiring
   information to guide policies to improve surface water quality. This has
   led us to reflections regarding the economic value of this information
   using the Bayesian method. In this study, we seek to determine the
   optimal location of stations in a monitoring network, along a river,
   where the objective is to detect potential accidental pollution.
   With a theoretical model and a numerical simulation, we compare the
   economic value of information from two different networks: a
   ``physically{''} optimized network where the location of stations
   minimizes the time required to detect accidental pollution, taking into
   account only hydrological considerations, and an ``economically{''}
   optimized network where the location of stations allows the value of
   information to be maximized. This comparison is made for three
   vulnerability scenarios, namely environmental damage, generated by
   pollution: constant, decreasing or increasing along the river.
   Our results show that the benefit of optimizing the network economically
   rather than physically depends on the context, namely the number of
   stations and the vulnerability scenario. Thus, depending on the
   additional cost of economic optimization, physical optimization could be
   recommended.},

Title = {Do the Affluent Override Average Americans? Measuring Policy
   Disagreement and Unequal Influence},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1018-1037},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective In this article, I seek to adjudicate between contradictory
   findings in studies of unequal responsiveness that focus on policy
   issues over which affluent and average Americans disagree.
   Methods I assess the impact of 22 definitions of policy disagreement and
   two methods of measuring policy influence-based on win rates and policy
   change rates-on analyses of unequal responsiveness.
   Results Win rates are an unreliable measure of influence and comparing
   policy change rates across cases of agreement and disagreement minimizes
   bias and allows for a more direct measure of relative independent policy
   influence. When income groups disagree over proposed policy changes, the
   preferences of the affluent-but not those of the middle-significantly
   impact the likelihood that the policies are implemented.
   Conclusion My results support previous findings that the affluent have
   substantial influence over policy making while average Americans have
   little to no influence.},

Abstract = {Exploiting a unique panel of student respondents surveyed both shortly
   before and after the March 2016 bombings in Brussels, this paper
   analyzes the effects of terrorism on social identities and preferences
   over security policy. Social identification-including individuals'
   feelings of connection to social groups such as countries or regions-is
   often considered a possible determinant of political and economic
   preferences. In turn, it is widely supposed that social identities may
   be subject to influence by acts of terror; indeed, our respondents
   report stronger connections to Belgium after the attacks than before.
   Problems with endogeneity and causality can confound analyses of those
   relations. Our novel pre- and post-attack responses help disentangle
   causality between terror and country connection: respondents feeling
   affected severely by the attacks show stronger connections ex-post at
   the country level, but close ex-ante connections do not predict stronger
   feelings of affectedness. Feelings of terrorism's influences also
   correlate significantly with preferences over security policy and police
   resourcing, unmediated by jurisdictional connections.},

Title = {Transnational turnout. Determinants of emigrant voting in home country
   elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A wide majority of countries acknowledge non-resident citizens' right to
   vote in elections in their country of origin. However, classical turnout
   theories do not take into account how electoral mobilisation has
   expanded into a transnational political field that reaches beyond
   national state borders. This paper analyses the determinants of emigrant
   turnout based on an original dataset of 25 countries of origin and each
   of the counties of residence where these voters reside. We find that
   emigrant communities from developing democracies experience a steep
   political learning curve that prompts their participation in home
   country politics, especially if they reside in countries with solid
   democratic institutions and linkages with their host societies. Our
   research also shows that remittances not only indicate commitment to
   family members' welfare in home countries, but positively influence
   participation in home country politics.},

Abstract = {The advent of the Internet inadvertently augmented the functioning and
   success of violent extremist organizations. Terrorist organizations like
   the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) use the Internet to project
   their message to a global audience. The majority of research and
   practice on web-based terrorist propaganda uses human coders to classify
   content, raising serious concerns such as burnout, mental stress, and
   reliability of the coded data. More recently, technology platforms and
   researchers have started to examine the online content using automated
   classification procedures. However, there are questions about the
   robustness of automated procedures, given insufficient research
   comparing and contextualizing the difference between human and machine
   coding. This article compares output of three text analytics packages
   with that of human coders on a sample of one hundred nonindexed web
   pages associated with ISIS. We find that prevalent topics (e.g., holy
   war) are accurately detected by the three packages whereas nuanced
   concepts (Lone Wolf attacks) are generally missed. Our findings suggest
   that naive approaches of standard applications do not approximate human
   understanding, and therefore consumption, of radicalizing content.
   Before radicalizing content can be automatically detected, we need a
   closer approximation to human understanding.},

Abstract = {Recent studies indicate that the ideological stances of government
   parties no are longer associated with differences in total government
   spending. At the same time, we observe that political polarization over
   spending policies has deepened. This paper addresses that puzzle by
   analyzing government spending behavior for ten expenditure categories
   during both `normal' times and periods of fiscal consolidation between
   1995 and 2015 for 16 OECD countries. Our results indicate that partisan
   motives prevail in `normal' times: right-wing cabinets spend more on
   defense and less on education and environmental protection than
   left-wing governments. On the other hand, in periods of fiscal
   adjustment, differences between left- and right-wing government
   expenditures can be observed mostly in different budget categories. For
   instance, during fiscal consolidations, right-wing governments reduce
   spending more than their left-wing counterparts on those categories
   featuring large shares of public employee compensation (i.e., public
   consumption spending) and small capital-expenditure shares. Hence, a
   central message of this paper helping to resolve the aforementioned
   puzzle is that ideological differences remain important after taking a
   comprehensive look at individual spending categories and distinguishing
   between periods with and without adjustments.},

Abstract = {The growing availability of abortion pills has transformed the safety
   and accessibility of abortion worldwide, especially in countries with
   very restrictive abortion laws. The public health implications of this
   abortion technology have been widely recognized, but its political and
   geographical impacts require closer attention. This paper examines the
   geography of illegal abortion pills in the Republic of Ireland, where
   abortion pills became widely accessible through transnational activist
   networks, despite a constitutional abortion ban. It contributes to
   political geography and international relations conversations about
   materiality and sovereignty by mapping the flows of abortion pills into
   Ireland and discussing the varied ways that the institutions of the
   state conceptualized and responded to these flows. It argues that the
   state's response to the influx of illegal abortion pills was
   predominantly shaped by its understanding of their territorial
   significance: the state sought to intercept pills at the border and
   discourage their use at home while advocating abortion travel abroad,
   eventually legislating for abortion reform that would offer tightly
   controlled access authorized by doctors. The paper advances the research
   agendas in reproductive and abortion geographies by bringing them into
   conversation with broader debates on territory and politics.},

Abstract = {The policy area of housing is associated with a set of contradictory
   claims over its subject and scope. This includes tension between a
   market-based understanding of housing, a social-rights-based approach,
   and a traditionalist approach (as patrimony). Debates about housing
   intensified after the financial crisis of 2008, especially on Europe's
   periphery. The present research focuses on Hungary and Spain, two
   countries with diverging housing paths after the crisis, in which crisis
   management and housing debates resulted in a number of housing policy
   changes. The paper is based on a critical frame analysis of interview
   data and policy documents about these two sets of policies. It combines
   Karl Polanyi's double movement theory with Nancy Fraser's perspectival
   dualism to trace recognition and redistribution frames in housing policy
   discourses in an investigation of the dynamics that led to policy
   changes. It argues that market expansion and social protection, the two
   movements in Polanyi's theory, should not be understood as forces that
   always clash with each other, but as a set of recognition and
   redistribution claims that mutually enable or limit each other as they
   are mediated through policy-making.},

Title = {HO CHI MINH'S IDEAS AS THE PATTERN OF REVOLUTIONARY INTERNATIONALISM},
Booktitle = {HO CHI MINH'S HERITAGE IN VIETNAM AND ABROAD},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {298-310},
Abstract = {The article analyzes 30 years of the life and work of Ho Chi Minh
   abroad, primarily in the Soviet Union (1923-1924 and 1934-38) and in
   China (1924-1927 and 1938-1940), partly in exile. Ho Chi Minh evaluated
   these years like this: in the USSR he studied the experience of party
   building, and in China the experience of the struggle against
   colonialists and feudal lords.
   Ho Chi Minh is one of those revolutionary leaders, whose name was known
   to millions of people during his lifetime and who has become truly
   legendary. Over the long years of his life in exile, Ho Chi Minh became
   a true internationalist, but in the first place he always had feelings
   of patriotism, the fate of his native country, enslaved by the
   colonialists. He has become a genuine symbol of national solidarity for
   the Vietnamese.
   The article discovers the genius of Ho Chi Minh in his creative choice
   of the path of the Vietnamese revolution, in particular: the strategy of
   a single broad national front at each particular stage of the re
   volution; a consistent course towards the implementation of the
   principle of freedom of religion of all participants in the front; a
   humane attitude towards the abdicated monarch and his family.
   The article confirms that Ho Chi Minh was a great friend of our people,
   he was unanimously called both in Vietnam and in the Soviet Union a man
   who laid the foundation of ``fraternal friendship{''} between the
   peoples of two countries and contributed in every way to its development
   and consolidation.},

Abstract = {We set up a two-party electoral competition model in a two-dimensional
   policy space with campaign contributions by an interest group that wants
   to promote a certain agenda. Assuming that voters are influenced by
   campaign spending for/against candidates, we analyze
   incentive-compatible contracts between the interest group and the
   candidates on agenda policy positions and campaign contributions. The
   interest group asks the candidates to commit to a level of agenda
   promotion in exchange for campaign contributions, letting them compete
   over the other (ideological) dimension only. It is shown that as the
   agenda is pushed further by the interest group, ideological policy
   polarization and campaign contributions surge.},

Abstract = {Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo has been the last of the engineers who became
   president of the Spanish Government. He is, to a great extent, an
   example of the persons who played an important role in the period of
   transition to democracy. A civil engineer, a prestigious professional,
   an entrepreneur, who held important posts in the private sector and who
   played a key role in the social and political life of the country. His
   singular trajectory exemplifies a new aspect of the social role of
   engineers, which has been studied for other countries and that may also
   be identified in Spain: engineers who do not make a career in
   engineering, but in management positions in private companies that
   demand them for the social prestige granted by engineering education.
   Thus, we analyse the trajectory of a civil engineer who developed all
   his professional career in the private sector-in companies linked to the
   Urquijo Bank- and who entered public life in moments of uncertainty in
   Spanish politics. The study of his political career focuses on a key
   moment: his role as the first Spanish negotiator for accession to the
   EEC. In this role, he could show some of his knowledge and engineering
   know-how and since this position he would become, shortly thereafter,
   the president of the Government.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present an analysis of the status and
   career choices of Hungarian, Slovak, and Romanian ethnic minority high
   school graduates in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, the northern
   province of Serbia. We implemented a purpose-built,
   paper-based-questionnaire process of data collection that involved 2,192
   ethnic minority high school students who were finishing high school in
   their mother tongues in 16 municipalities in Vojvodina. The results of
   the analysis showed that almost 40 per cent of the sample of ethnic
   minority high school graduates planned to leave Serbia to study in their
   mother tongues in nearby European Union (EU) countries. While this brain
   drain is not a new trend, our research shows that there are new and
   different reasons for it and it was caused by the insufficiency of
   Serbian language skills of the ethnic minority studnets. The results of
   the research show that the main reason for this educational migration is
   thus the aspiration to obtain a diploma from an EU-based institution,
   which (1) grants immediate access to the EU's integrated labor market,
   and (2) is perceived to improve social status compared to that of
   remaining in Serbia after graduating. Despite this new motive for
   educational migration, language barriers are still relevant determinants
   of the latter. A gender-sensitive analysis of the responses was
   undertaken that showed that there are gender-based differences in terms
   of which students continue their studies after high school, and in the
   reasons for staying in Serbia.},

Abstract = {This paper builds a simple framework for analysing over- or undersaving
   of economies in the context of external economic imbalances.
   Macroeconomic determinants of optimal household and corporate saving,
   based on microeconomic theory, are used as explanatory variables in a
   benchmark panel regression model. Among other things, the model shows
   chronic oversaving of China and other Asian economies (Korea, Japan),
   and undersaving of the USA and the United Kingdom. Czechia and the other
   V4 countries showed no significant deviation from the model, nor did
   Germany or France.},

Title = {Modelling the mediating effect of multiple emotions in a cycle of
   territorial protests},

Abstract = {Nowadays it is customary to incorporate emotions as explanatory
   variables of protest participation, since numerous studies have provided
   evidence for their relevance. However, the incorporation of emotions in
   quantitative research continues to emphasise the effect of a limited set
   of emotions (normally one or two with negative valence, such as anger or
   contempt) that are modelled as mediators between non-emotional motives
   and participation. This makes it difficult to test the joint effect that
   multiple emotions appear to have, as has been reported in qualitative
   research. The present research aims to address these gaps in the
   quantitative literature by applying structural equation modelling to a
   survey administered to a random sample of 500 inhabitants of a region of
   Chile in which a long cycle of territorial protests occurred. Our
   results confirm some hypotheses derived from qualitative research by
   showing that emotions are in fact experienced in arrays, that emotions
   with positive valence play a relevant role in explaining participation,
   and that several emotions mediate the effect of non-emotional motives
   and participation. It is also clear that emotions experienced by the
   population are significantly interrelated, thus a study of the direct or
   mediating effects of any given emotion must also address other emotions
   experienced intensely by subjects. This evidence could help to modify
   and improve the way in which emotions are integrated into formal
   quantitative models of protest participation.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for the utility of remote warfare as a means of
   analysing the geopolitics of American primacy. Through the use of new
   technologies and surrogate forces to address security challenges with a
   minimal military footprint, remote warfare (re)imposes political
   distance between the United States and the sites of its military
   interventions. Its constitutive modalities of intervention range from
   drones and Special Operations Forces to Private Military Security
   Companies, security cooperation programmes and emerging technologies
   associated with Artificial Intelligence. As public support for
   large-scale overseas interventions has dwindled and strategic
   competition with China has intensified, remote warfare represents a
   means of `retooling' US primacy, which is both a structural condition
   and a strategic orientation. As a strategic approach to the use of
   force, remote warfare enables the American state to project military
   power in a more flexible and sustainable manner. This has supported the
   maintenance of US primacy as Washington's strategic focus has shifted
   from counterterrorism towards a renewed emphasis on great power
   competition.},

Abstract = {Regime changes and power transfers usually engender an extensive
   reordering of the cultural geography. Incoming political regimes usually
   reconfigure commemorative landscapes to symbolically dismantle icons and
   landmarks of the previous political regimes and herald their arrival on
   the political scene. The new regime in Zimbabwe that assumes power in
   November 2017 reconstituted the commemorative space according to its
   sociopolitical logics, commemorative priorities, and assumptions of
   power. This article uses the textual approach to the politics of place
   naming to interrogate the varied ways the Mnangagwa regime used to
   reinscribe the cultural landscape producing a new memorial landscape in
   the aftermath of the upstaging of Robert Mugabe in November 2017. The
   new regime symbolically constructed the imaginative national geography
   in a relational manner that differed from the one instituted by the
   Mugabe regime. The main observation in this article is that place
   renaming is not merely as a reflection of, but also integral to, the
   politics of `transformation' in post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. The new place
   names are saturated with messages that indicate official versions that
   prescribe new rules on the reading of the past. The new toponymic order
   symbolically replaced the Mugabe political hegemony with the Mnangagwa
   one, increased the visibility of women, commemorated a new set of
   heroes, including those that had suffered systematic exclusion in
   nationalist discourses, and renamed `unusual' places that the previous
   regime never considered in the process of recasting the cultural
   geography. The memorial project involved a highly politicised nomination
   process that served the interests of the ruling political elites. It is,
   therefore, problematic that most critical enquiries into this phase in
   the Zimbabwean political landscape have not focussed on these cultural
   transformations.},

Abstract = {In Democratic Education in a Globalized World (Routledge, 2019) I defend
   a discourse theory of global justice as the appropriate normative1
   ground for conceiving educational justice and citizenship education
   under conditions of economic and political globalization. In addition, I
   articulate democratic conceptions of global educational justice and
   citizenship education that recognize a moral-political right to
   democratically adequate education and call for the creation of
   transnational democratic consciousness. Based on these conceptions I
   spell out school practices such as historically informed, cross-cultural
   learning within socially diverse settings that would contribute to
   realizing these conceptions. In this article I reply to liberal
   perfectionist, communitarian-conservative and empiricist-historical
   critiques of Democratic Education in a Globalized World from Michael
   Festl, Martin Beckstein and Michael Geiss, respectively. I emphasize the
   feasibility of injusticereducing educational practices, I explain how a
   discourse theory of justice accommodates considerations of both the good
   and the right, and I justify why the grim record of past educational
   experience does not render pointless the pursuit of progressive aims
   through education.},

Abstract = {It has long been speculated that banning parties from participation in
   elections may be counterproductive because it might provoke societal
   resistance. Using the European Social Survey (2002-2010; N = 195,405),
   our study suggests otherwise. We demonstrate that party bans enjoy the
   legitimacy of majority support. This holds true irrespective of
   countries' resilience to extremist influences (or lack thereof)
   resulting from ``institutional intolerance,{''} electoral entry barriers
   and authoritarian legacies. Individual orientations toward the
   democratic establishment do matter to a small extent: citizens with
   authoritarian tendencies and low system support are less supportive,
   while this is less so for citizens with extremist ideological
   orientations. Even though party bans entail significant democratic
   dilemmas, this study reveals societal resources supportive of repressive
   responses to extremist parties.},

Abstract = {There is a paradox: why are there so many political and economic Islamic
   actors in the Middle East but not a large willingness on their part to
   adopt and promote Islamic banking and finance methodologies? This paper
   argues that the more vague and ambivalent these actors are on economic
   policy, the wider their appeal; and, by extension, the more compatible
   Islamic ideas and ideologies are with neoliberalism. The case of the
   Islamic Action Front (IAF) in Jordan is given as it has adopted an
   emphasis on Islamic middle-class values and ethical concerns of
   neoliberalism in order to gain political support. The case of the IAF
   demonstrates that there are points of compatibility between the
   neoliberal economy and Islamist politics. In the calibrations of the
   relationship between the state and Islamist party politics in line with
   Islamic neoliberal tenets, this approach ensures enhanced appeal for
   neoliberal Islamism into the future.},

Abstract = {The psychological bases of the selection and attitudinal response to
   news media have received ample attention in political communication
   research. However, the interplay between three crucial factors in
   today's online, high-choice news media settings remains understudied:
   (1) textual versus multimodal (text-plus-visual) communication; (2)
   attitude congruent versus attitude incongruent versus balanced content;
   and (3) political versus nonpolitical genres. Relying on an experimental
   study of refugee and gun control news in the United States (N = 1,159),
   this paper investigates how people select and avoid, and also the extent
   to which they agree with, congenial, uncongenial, and balanced political
   news in a realistic multimodal selective-exposure setting in which
   political news is presented alongside sports and entertainment news.
   Although the findings partially depend on the issue, we find that the
   presence of multimodal (compared to textual) entertainment and sport
   items can increase avoidance of political news. Multimodal (compared to
   textual) political news augments attitude congruent selective exposure
   instead of encouraging cross-cutting selective exposure. Once selected,
   multimodal political news articles evoke stronger emotions and lead to
   higher issue agreement than textual news, regardless of an article's
   attitude congruence. By linking research on text-alone to multimodal
   selective exposure, this study shows that visuals in high-choice media
   environments can contribute to the selective avoidance of political news
   generally and cross-cutting political news more specifically.},

Abstract = {What is the value of using referendums as part of independence
   movements? By considering recent prominent secession movements, this
   article theorizes that referendums provide several strategic advantages
   to distinct communities seeking territorial independence. First, the
   referendum is a key event that transfers power away from political
   elites and towards citizens, who are given responsibility for deciding
   independence. Second, the referendum forces the central government to
   act by creating a date when independence will be decided (a self-created
   window of opportunity). Third, the referendum frames independence in
   terms of democracy and the right to self-determination, making it
   difficult for the central government to challenge. Fourth, referendum
   campaigns can help solidify the identity of a distinct community (or
   `resurrect' it), thus increasing the number of citizens concerned with
   secession. While not always successful, secession referendums provide
   advantages to those groups that control their deployment.},

Abstract = {Whereas social movement-media relations were, in the era of mass media,
   a dialogic relationship of mutual, albeit asymmetric, dependency between
   news makers and social movement organizations, the hybridization of the
   media system has complicated matters considerably. The dialogic tensions
   that drove organizations' access to the political information
   environment have been supplanted by new tensions-tensions that have
   transformed organizations' media work routines. Organizations must now
   manage tensions over the temporality of issue emergence, tensions
   between identity and policy knowledge as sources of expertise, tensions
   between emotional charge and informational novelty as criteria of
   newsworthiness for journalists, and tensions between policy demands and
   media demands in the formation of communications strategy. And these new
   tensions demand new work practices oriented toward addressing multiple
   audiences concurrently and via multiple media streams. Because the
   discourses of social media influence the press to such an extent, the
   successful management of press discourse requires both direct influence
   via routine media work targeting journalists and indirect influence via
   steering digital media discourse-the combination of which presents
   significant resource costs to movement organizations. This article draws
   on an ethnographic case study of media work in the U.S. transgender
   rights movement to extend theorizations of movement-media relations to
   account for the structuring influence of the hybrid media system,
   illustrating these news tensions in the context of the panic over
   transgender passport policy that erupted in the summer of 2018.},

Abstract = {Italy's regional inequalities are more substantial and persistent than
   any other European country. They pertain to fundamental economic
   indicators (income, productivity, employment) and to many relevant
   features of the socio-institutional environment (the quality of
   institutions, education attainments, government and bureaucratic
   efficiency, etc.). The 2008-13 crisis further exacerbated divergences,
   with a collapse of capital accumulation and unwelcome demographic shocks
   (brain drains, migrations, etc.). This paper contributes to this rich
   literature with a specific focus on the increase of `within-south
   inequalities' and investigates some socioeconomic determinants and
   processes that can explain them. Through several original surveys and
   case studies, emphasis falls on the importance of human capital and
   cooperative networks that support firms in their capacity to exploit
   comparative advantages and opportunities for local development.},

   states, from 1996 to 2016. The 2020 iteration takes into account the
   recent adoption of automatic voter registration processes, expansion of
   early voting, new absentee voting laws, and the elimination of polling
   stations in some states. We learn that Oregon, which has one of the most
   progressive automatic voter registration processes and mail-in voting,
   maintains the first position as the easiest state in which to vote.
   Texas falls to 50th, in part because it does not keep pace with reforms
   like online voter registration and no excuse absentee voting, which have
   taken place in most other states. Voters in both Michigan and Virginia
   will find voting more hassle free in 2020 because of changes to both
   voter registration and balloting processes that have occurred since
   2016.},

Abstract = {Portugal was a pioneer in state-led cooperative development. In 1867,
   the parliament passed legislation encouraging workers to organize their
   own collective businesses. In the view of the ruling elite, this would
   prevent the emergence of a class cleavage between labor and capital,
   contributing to the stability of the liberal economic and political
   order. Combining the historical method with John Kingdon's
   multiple-streams approach to policy formulation, this article examines
   the complex array of domestic and external factors that shaped this
   policy intervention. Additionally, the study explores the impact of the
   policy on the involved stakeholders. Far from fulfilling the
   expectations of its promoters, the law on cooperatives seems to have
   only marginally stimulated the growth of the sector. Moreover, the
   government's support to cooperatives seems to have undermined the
   legitimacy of the model in the eyes of a labor movement that was
   starting to see its interests as opposed to those of the ruling class.},

Abstract = {Through a comparative historical analysis of two sites on Myanmar's
   borders with China and Thailand, this article explores how natural
   resources affected border-making in Zomia. Firstly, the article argues
   that demand for natural resources drove lowland states'
   territorialisation of the highlands in the late nineteenth century,
   including their desire to demarcate borders. Secondly, local actors
   chose different political strategies in response to lowland state
   penetration. Some chose to attempt to repel lowland states, others to
   avoid them. The type of natural resources available ('lootable' versus
   `unlootable' resources) enhanced or diminished the effectiveness of the
   political tactics chosen by local actors. Thirdly, the article explores
   whether local politics or the `knowability' of natural resources
   determined the differential success of border-making in the region. This
   attention to natural resources can deepen histories of `state-escaping'
   highland peoples. This also has implications for the question of human
   agency and environmental determinism in Zomia, a question which is often
   implicit but unaddressed when scholars use the concept of the `friction
   of terrain'. In the context of accelerating climate change and the
   global spread of pathogens, understanding the potential for agency of
   non-human objects is more important than ever. Drawing on archival
   materials from the Myanmar National Archives, India Office Records, and
   the British Library, this study gives insights into both the politics of
   this region today, and how natural resources affected border-making at
   the margins of states.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the evolvement of the `movement of the squares'
   following the end of the more visible cycles of mobilization of the
   squares ` occupations. We argue that a crucial aspect of this evolution
   lies in the creation of a social infrastructure of alternative
   (re)productive projects in the form of commons. We call this type of
   outcomes `social' in order to distinguish them from the cultural,
   political and biographical outcomes underlined in typologies on the
   consequences of social movements. Bridging social movement studies with
   the literature on the commons, we build a conceptual framework of their
   relationship. Through a comparative analysis of the movements in Athens
   and Barcelona, we show how the commoning practices of the square
   encampments gave rise to more endurable commons disseminated across
   cities ` social fabrics. We identify both direct and indirect mechanisms
   of movements ` transmutation into commons, and distinguish the former
   into transplantation, ideation, and breeding processes. Our second aim
   is to scrutinize the political dimension of these commons in relation to
   what has been framed as the `post-political condition'. We maintain that
   the post-square commons constitute political and politicizing actions
   for activists and users for their effects on everyday life, for their
   capacity to link their practices with broader, structural dynamics of
   injustice, inequality and exclusion, and for their selective engagement
   with counter-austerity politics.},

Abstract = {Explanations for the third-person phenomenon generally hinge on either
   self-favoring biases or cognitive mechanisms. While controlling for
   common perceptual factors, we demonstrate an additional cognitive
   component: exemplar availability, using a 2-study design. The first
   considers the third-person perception in the context of media-generated
   stereotypes. The second considers 3 distinct types of advertisements
   meant to evoke varied third- and first-person perceptions. Results of
   both studies showed that the ability to think of examples serves as the
   most consistent predictor, even after accounting for the influence of
   perceived exposure and similarity.},

Abstract = {Objective Social mobility plays an important role in stabilizing the
   political order. This article leverages China's hukou (household
   registration) reforms to examine the effects of state-engineered social
   mobility on individuals' trust in the government. Methods Using China
   General Social Survey data for 2010 and entropy balancing for causal
   effects, this article provides empirical evidence for the attitudinal
   effects of social mobility at the individual level. Results It finds
   that, first, individuals with the rural-to-urban hukou change are more
   likely to experience upward mobility, while individuals with the
   nonlocal-to-local hukou change are more pessimistic about their
   prospects of upward mobility; second, the rural-to-urban hukou change
   increases beneficiaries' trust in the central government, while the
   nonlocal-to-local hukou change increases beneficiaries' trust in the
   local government. Conclusion The Chinese authoritarian regime's
   co-optation tactic of engineering upward social mobility via the hukou
   reforms contributes to its performance-based political legitimacy as it
   effectively bolsters individuals' trust in government.},

Abstract = {Individuals and families are being displaced from the Northern Triangle
   of Central America by structural and physical violence. Clandestine
   migration increases the invisibility of forced migrants and makes them
   difficult to access for researchers. Gatekeepers perceive or depict
   forced migrants as vulnerable populations and often deny investigators
   access to them, arguing that traumatised people should not be asked to
   retell their stories and be revictimised. The growing literature on
   research participation suggests that individuals categorised as
   vulnerable often decide to collaborate in studies, because they welcome
   the opportunity to talk about their experience to an empathetic listener
   and to help improve policies and services. Immediate distress produced
   by revisiting painful moments in life often dissipates quickly and is
   outweighed by the benefits of research participation, such as feelings
   of catharsis and a sense of acknowledgement and purpose. When
   gatekeepers deny investigators access to vulnerable population groups,
   they preclude them from autonomously deciding whether to grant or
   withhold informed consent and from exercising their right to participate
   in research. Their invisibilities and silences render migrants more
   susceptible to human rights violations. Taking protection seriously
   means widening the research participation of vulnerable individuals.},

Abstract = {Although measuring the ideal points of news media is essential for
   testing political communication theories based on spatial theory, prior
   methods of estimating ideal points of media outlets have various
   shortcomings, including high cost in terms of time and human resources
   and low applicability to different countries. We propose that
   unsupervised machine learning techniques for text data, specifically the
   combination of a text scaling method and latent topic modeling, can be
   applied to estimate ideal points of media outlets. We applied our
   proposed methods to editorial texts of ten national and regional
   newspapers in Japan, where prior approaches are not applicable because
   newspapers have never officially endorsed particular parties or
   candidates, and because high-quality training data for supervised
   learning are not available. Our two studies, one of which analyzed
   editorials on a single typically ideological topic while the other
   investigated all editorials published by the target papers in one year,
   confirmed the popular view of Japanese newspapers' ideological slant,
   which validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also
   illustrate that our methods allow scholars to investigate which issues
   are closely related to the respective ideological positions of media
   outlets. Furthermore, we use the estimated ideal points of newspapers to
   show that Japanese people partially tend to read ideologically
   like-minded newspapers and follow such newspapers' Twitter accounts even
   though their slant is not explicit.},

Abstract = {Does exposure to news affect what people know about politics? This old
   question attracted new scholarly interest as the political information
   environment is changing rapidly. In particular, since citizens have new
   channels at their disposal, such as Twitter and Facebook, which
   increasingly complement or even replace traditional channels of
   information. This study investigates to what extent citizens have
   knowledge about daily politics and to what extent news on social media
   can provide this knowledge. It does so by means of a large online survey
   in Belgium (Flanders), in which we measured what people know about
   current political events, their so-called general surveillance
   knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that unlike following news via
   traditional media channels, citizens do not gain more political
   knowledge from following news on social media. We even find a negative
   association between following the news on Facebook and political
   knowledge. We further investigate why this is the case. Our data
   demonstrate that this lack of learning on social media is not due to a
   narrow, personalized news diet, as is often suggested. Rather, we find
   evidence that following news via social media increases a feeling of
   information overload, which decreases what people actually learn,
   especially for citizens who combine news via social media with other
   news sources.},

Abstract = {We model a simplified electric market with producers using either
   conventional or intermittent electric generators and consumers equipped
   with either smart meter with real-time pricing or traditional meters
   with a flat tariff. We calculate the investment in intermittent
   technologies and smart meters in a social optimum. We find that the
   optimal penetration of smart meters is increasing in the volatility of
   the electric spot price. As a consequence, intermittent capacities and
   smart-meters are complement, only if the correlation existing between
   intermittent energy and demand is negative or if the capacity of
   intermittent generators is large enough. Otherwise, larger intermittent
   capacities actually help to decrease the volatility of the electric spot
   price, making smart-meters less useful. We also give a numeral
   application, calibrated to represent the French electric market in 2018
   and policy objective for 2030.},

Abstract = {In recent years, data have become part and parcel of contemporary
   capitalism. This has created tensions between the growing demand for
   personal data and the fundamental right to data protection. Against this
   background, the EU's adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) in 2016 is puzzling. Why did the EU adopt a regulation that
   strengthens data protection despite intensive lobbying by powerful
   business groups and the EU's supposed neoliberal bias? We make two
   arguments to explain this outcome. First, we use process tracing to show
   how issue-specific institutions played a crucial role during the
   agenda-setting stage (1990s-2009) and policy formulation stage
   (2009-2012). They triggered and structured the drafting process by
   strengthening the position of data protection advocates within the
   European Commission. Second, we use discourse network analysis to show
   that the Snowden revelations of 2013 fundamentally changed the
   discursive and coalitional dynamics during the decision-making stage
   (2012-2016). The salience shock it produced ``saved{''} the GDPR from
   being watered down, by incentivizing policymakers to distance themselves
   from business interests and by exposing the geo-economic dimension of
   data protection. This article thus offers a comprehensive explanation of
   the GDPR, while contributing to the literature on the political economy
   of data protection.},

Abstract = {Objective Donald Trump's sustained emphasis on the negative impact of
   immigration policies for personal economic conditions necessitates
   reevaluating the influence of the latter on the former. We assess the
   interaction between income and individual economic anxiety on
   immigration attitudes. Methods Multivariate analysis of the 2012 and
   2016 American National Election Study survey data. Results After
   controlling for conventional explanations and standard political
   covariates, those who share an income bracket with foreign-born workers
   and also expressed individual economic anxiety were significantly more
   likely to express negative attitudes toward immigrants in 2016, but not
   in 2012. Conclusion The discrepancy between the results in 2016 and 2012
   is partially attributed to the different rhetorical approaches toward
   immigration policy adopted by Donald Trump and Mitt Romney. Whether the
   2016 results represent an isolated anomaly or emerging trend may depend
   on the rhetorical choices of future presidential candidates.},

Title = {Political Agenda Setting in the Hybrid Media System: Why Legacy Media
   Still Matter a Great Deal},

Abstract = {This article examines the roles of the media in the process of political
   agenda setting. There is a long tradition of studies on this topic, but
   they have mostly focused on legacy news media, thus overlooking the role
   of other actors and the complex hybrid dynamics that characterize
   contemporary political communication. In contrast, through an in-depth
   case study using mixed-methods and multiplatform data, this article
   provides a detailed analysis of the roles and interactions between
   different types of media and how they were used by political and
   advocacy elites. It explores what happened in the different parts of the
   system, and thus the paths to attention that led to setting this issue
   in the political and media agendas. The analysis of the case, a partial
   policy reversal in the United Kingdom provoked by an immigration scandal
   known as the ``Windrush scandal{''} reveals that the issue was pushed
   into the agenda by a campaign assemblage of investigative journalism,
   political and advocacy elites, and digitally enabled leaders. The legacy
   news media came late but were crucial. They greatlyamplifiedthe salience
   of the issue and, once in ``storm mode,{''} they were key
   forsustainingattention and pressure, eventually compelling the
   government to respond. It shows that they often remain at the core of
   the ``national conversation{''} and certainly in the eye of a media
   storm. In the contemporary context, characterized by fierce battles for
   attention, shortening attention spans and fractured audiences, this is
   key and has important implications for agenda setting and beyond.},

Abstract = {Objectives Preelectoral party coalitions are common in multiparty
   systems. We examine the proposition that individuals who choose between
   parties from competing coalitions think and behave differently compared
   to those who only consider voting for parties of the same coalition.
   Part of the reason, we suggest, is that coalition-straddling voters play
   a key role in deciding who forms government. Methods We rely on data
   from a multiwave panel with thousands of participants collected during
   two election campaigns in Sweden. Statistical regression techniques are
   used to analyze the data. Results We find that citizens who straddle
   opposing coalitions think that the vote decision is harder and rely more
   on voting advice applications. Moreover, the evidence suggests that
   their ultimate vote choice is more consequential in how they view
   parties. Conclusion Coalition-straddling influences political behavior.
   The evidence is largely in line with the notion that
   coalition-straddling individuals are aware of their importance.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the destruction and commodification of nature during
   the development of the mega-port of Granadilla on the island of Tenerife
   (Canary Islands, Spain), and the social movements that arose in response
   to these actions. It draws on participant observations within protest
   movements, participation in collective action and meetings in the 2000s,
   relevant documents, and seven interviews with former presidents of the
   port authority, the ex-mayor of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and
   environmental activists. By focusing on the interplay of the crisis,
   urbanization, nature, conservation and the uprisings, the study expands
   the literature on the neoliberalization of nature. It is found that the
   neoliberalization of nature began to intensify after the financial crash
   in 2008, the completion of the port played a significant role, and
   biodiversity offsetting emerged against this background. Further,
   rollbacks in conservation regulations fostered urbanization in the
   future. The study also focuses on social contestation by highlighting
   its political emancipatory potential. The emergence of a political
   red-green alliance that combined the vindication of social rights with
   the defence of nature and the demand for a different social and
   territorial island model highlights the `right to nature' as a central
   element in the fight for the `right to the island'.},

Title = {Reactive, cost-beneficial or undermining legitimacy: how disempowered
   protestors explain their part in violent clashes with the state},

Abstract = {Among cases of violent clashes between states and citizens, that of
   disempowered minorities is particularly paradoxical. The use of violence
   can negatively undermine the protest's public legitimacy, and violence
   is likely also to extract a personal price from those using it,
   especially from disempowered protestors. Yet, violent clashes occur.
   This article, based on sixty in-depth, semi-structured interviews with
   protest activists, twenty of them Israelis of Ethiopian descent, focuses
   on ex-post explanations of disempowered protestors for their part in
   violent clashes with the state. Three non-mutually exclusive
   explanations can be offered: First, violence may be described as
   reactive, take place in clashes with the police during demonstrations,
   and therefore not a matter of strategy. Second, violent clashes can be
   perceived retrospectively as cost-beneficial, even if they were not a
   planned strategy. The potential benefit of raising problems to social
   discourse, despite the high cost of violence, can explain that. Finally,
   violent clashes can indicate undermining distinct components of state
   legitimacy. A combined analysis of the current case study, and of
   findings from other struggle arenas worldwide, provides a broad picture
   that could be generalized: while disempowered protestors tend to
   undermine state legitimacy based on the components trust, procedural
   justice, distributive justice, and effectiveness, they usually would not
   tend to undermine legitimacy based on the components identification and
   legality. The case of the Israelis of Ethiopian descent may be the
   exception that proves the rule, regarding trust and ex-post explanations
   for violent clashes.},

Title = {A political economy perspective on horizontal FDI in a dynamic
   Cournot-oligopoly with endogenous entry},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Entry in a homogeneous Cournot-oligopoly is excessive if and only if
   there is business-stealing (Amir et al., 2014). The excessive entry
   prediction has been derived primarily for closed economies and using a
   welfarist benchmark. We extend this framework and allow for (1)
   horizontal FDI in a multi-period setting and (2) interest group-based
   government behaviour. Opening the market to greenfield investments from
   abroad tends to aggravate the entry distortion. Moreover, market opening
   may reduce welfare if a more pronounced entry distortion dominates the

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss what is at stake in appropriating the thought
   of reactionary figures, such as Heidegger and Schmitt, for critical
   geography. We will argue that Heidegger and Schmitt were beholden to an
   arcane geopolitics shaped by supposed gnostic insights into the deeper
   currents of world history. This (geo-) political theology of Heidegger
   and Schmitt has not yet been given sufficient attention by geographers
   engaging their work. However, it is only in approaching their work in a
   theological key that the gnostic political theology that undergirds
   their arcane geopolitics can be fully understood. At the core of this
   arcane geopolitics is the conviction that modernity and all those
   identified as its agents is a force for ill, setting the world towards
   catastrophe. In this paper, we excavate this gnostic disposition in the
   thought of Heidegger and Schmitt in order to raise questions about how
   their work ought to be mobilized in and for critical, emancipatory,
   progressive thought so that this appropriation does not bring unwanted
   residues along with it.},

Abstract = {The issue of global economic inequality has inspired researchers to
   explore the potential connection between income inequalities and foreign
   direct investment (FDI), as it is one of the driving forces of
   globalization. Although there is a large body of theoretical as well as
   empirical studies linking these variables, the empirical literature on
   the relationship between FDI, production factors productivity and income
   inequalities is not conclusive because most scientists treat FDI as
   uniform. Therefore there is a lack of reliable empirical evidence on the
   distributional effects of FDI, especially in emerging countries, such as
   in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The research presented in the
   article fills this gap.
   The aim of the study is to analyze the impact of the inflow of foreign
   direct investment on the productivity of production factors (labor,
   capital and total factor productivity) and income inequality of
   households in four Central and Eastern European countries (poland, the
   Czech republic, Slovakia and Hungary) in the period 1990-2016. The four
   countries were selected for analysis as a classic example of European
   countries transforming their economic structures and similar in terms of
   the level of economic development. in turn, the choice of the analysis
   period was related to the availability of necessary statistical data.
   According to the theory of economics, the inflow of foreign direct
   investment should have a positive impact on production factors
   productivity as well as on income inequalities of households in
   investment receiving countries. In the study, a research method based on
   the study of economic literature in macroeconomics and international
   finance and econometric methods (vector autoregression models-VAR) was
   used. Results of the research suggest a significant and positive impact
   of greenfield investment inflow on labor productivity and total factor
   productivity, as well as a positive impact of brownfield investment
   inflow (mergers and acquisitions) on capital productivity in countries
   receiving investments. Moreover, the results also revealed the lack of a
   statistically significant impact of greenfield and brownfield investment
   on income inequalities in all of the examined countries. The statistical
   data used in the study came from the statistical databases of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World
   Bank (World Development Indicators), World Income Inequality Database
   (United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics
   Research) and Total Economy Database (The Conference Board of Canada).},

Abstract = {National and cross-national studies demonstrate that the probability of
   women candidates' emergence and success is lower in more religious
   areas. One recent study of the U.S. House of Representatives even
   suggests that the effect of religiosity may be so powerful as to render
   insignificant other contextual factors, including a district's baseline
   women-friendliness. We argue that this finding is an institutional
   artifact; in less competitive contests with more internally similar
   constituencies, both religion and other contextual factors should affect
   women candidates' emergence and victory. We test this proposition using
   state legislative data and find that while women are less likely to run
   and win in more religious areas, district women-friendliness has an
   independent, positive effect on women's candidacies. These effects are
   particularly noteworthy in districts with large evangelical Protestant
   populations and affect Republican and Democratic women similarly.},

Abstract = {Objectives This article examines the role of white racial identity or
   white racial group consciousness in the vote choice of whites for the
   U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.
   Methods Data from the 2018 American National Election Study (ANES) Pilot
   Study are analyzed using a logistic regression model.
   Results White racial consciousness was a significant predictor of U.S.
   House vote choice in 2018, even after controlling for other relevant
   explanatory variables such as racial resentment, party identification,
   and ideology. The effects were especially evident for two quintessential
   swing groups: independents and moderates.
   Conclusion In the first national election of the Trump era, white racial
   group consciousness became a relevant electoral cleavage and determinant
   of white vote choice at the subpresidential level. Given the rhetoric
   and action of Trump as president, the Republican Party has morphed into
   a white identity political party, not dissimilar to populist right-wing
   parties in Europe. While this might reap electoral benefits for the
   Republican Party in jurisdictions with smaller minority populations, it
   is likely to cost the party support where there is greater racial
   diversity. In the long term, the politics of white identity is likely to
   be an impediment to the Republican Party's ability to expand its
   electoral base.},

Abstract = {In 2011, one of the most important social movements since the end of the
   dictatorship proposed a change in higher education in Chile. More than
   two hundred thousand people participated in public demonstrations.
   Facing the failure of the negotiations with the government, the student
   movement focused on proposing changes to the 2012 Budget Law. What
   coalitions did the leaders of this student movement form to influence
   the Budget Law? The aim of this paper was to analyse the factors that
   explain coalition formation to impact the 2012 Budget Law. In doing so,
   an analysis has been carried out, focusing on the leaders of the student
   movement (CONFECH). This paper emphasizes their coalition with the
   rectors of public universities and their relationship with other
   educational actors and the opposition parties. The analysis includes the
   review of documents and national newspapers and interviews with the
   leaders of the CONFECH. The results of the analysis show that the
   traditional factors explaining coalition formation are useful but not
   sufficient to explain the student movement alliances. This paper argues
   that the factor that explains the student movement coalitions is the
   `strategic sense' that the movement is focused on an outcome-based
   strategy. The leaders consider a coalition with the rectors of public
   universities as outcome-tactics. However, the relationship with
   opposition parties was much more difficult because of their distrust
   resulting from what happened in 2006. This study thus has significant
   implications for the coalition formation theories and its relationship
   with social movements' impact.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of Euroscepticism on regional cross-border
   cooperation between Germany and Denmark. It demonstrates that
   Euroscepticism, while absent from local mainstream politicians, had
   already caused civic unrest in the 1997 attempts to construct areturn to
   historyEuro-region Schleswig. It resulted in a re-scaling of the
   Euro-Region to Region and Schleswig to ``Sonderjylland/Schleswig{''},
   omitting any reference to Europe, European identity or a commitment to a
   closer European union in the relevant agreements. Border controls, on
   the agenda in 2011 and again since 2015, have demonstrated the
   institutional weakness of cross-border politics when faced with
   determined initiatives from the national center. Furthermore, the
   Eurosceptic Danish People's Party had its best results in the border
   precincts both at the latest European and Danish national elections.
   Euroscepticism, even though difficult to measure on a regional level,
   seems to have been an ever present underneath current despite a
   political rhetoric of successful cooperation and cross-border
   reconciliation. The Danish-German case's development might be more
   distinct, but nonetheless representative for European border (and
   cross-border) regions. While European metropolises develop into thriving
   cosmopolitan post-nation state societies, this is not necessary the case
   at Europe's borders, where categorization and bordering remain common
   social practices by the large majority of national borderlanders with
   only a small portion of transnational borderlanders or `regionauts'
   getting involved in border crossing social practices on a larger scale.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of several trade policy instruments on
   product Research and Development (R\&D) investment in a North-South
   duopoly where a Northern firm competes in prices with a Southern firm on
   both markets. The Northern firm invests in product R\&D owing to a
   competitive disadvantage compared to its Southern counterpart which
   benefits from a lower labor cost. The outcome of the R\&D activity is
   uncertain. If successful, vertical differentiation occurs in both
   markets. The Northern country's government is the only one to be policy
   active and may implement the following policy instruments: an import
   tariff, an import quota or a quality standard. The results show that the
   Northern firm's R\&D expenditures increase with each policy instrument
   except for the import quota. The paper also dresses a comparative review
   of the effects of these measures based on a detailed welfare analysis.
   Numerical simulations suggest that in most cases, the Northern country's
   government would favor the implementation of an import tariff, except
   for when the consumer preference for product quality is high. In that
   case, the favorite instrument would be the quality standard.},

Abstract = {We construct a model of revolution and transition to democracy under
   individualistic and collectivist cultures. The main result is that,
   despite facing potentially more challenging collective action problems,
   countries with individualistic cultures are more likely to end up
   adopting democracy earlier than countries with collectivist cultures.
   Our empirical analysis suggests a strong and robust association between
   individualistic cultures and average polity scores and durations of
   democracy, even after controlling for other determinants of democracy
   emphasized in the literature. We provide evidence that countries with
   collectivist cultures also are more likely to experience autocratic
   breakdowns and transitions from autocracy to autocracy.},

Abstract = {The very first Article of the 1931 Spanish constitution declared `Spain
   is a democratic republic of workers of all classes' and that `The powers
   of all its organs derive from the People'. But who were those workers,
   those People? This populist nationalism was key in legitimizing the
   Second Spanish Republic and in many of its political and cultural
   projects, but the state did not develop a clear image of the people.
   This should come as no surprise, since the `People' was a contested
   concept in the 1930s, appropriated by different political parties and
   groups. How were Spaniards supposed to visualize themselves then? Who
   embodied the Spanish nation in the 1930s, and how was it represented? In
   this article, I show how different social actors - the state,
   photographers, the illustrated press - developed varying images of the
   `People', focused either on the rural population or urban dwellers, who
   were supposed to play an important role in defining the new Republican
   nation. These photographic representations offer a window on to the
   complexities of the intersection between nationalism, populism, and
   social and political conflict in 1930s Spain, and how the nation was
   built through printed culture.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between taxation and firm
   performance in developing countries. Combining firm-level data from the
   World Bank Enterprise Surveys and tax data from the Government Revenue
   Dataset, our results suggest that taxation benefits firm growth in
   developing countries, especially in lower-income countries. This
   positive contribution of domestic revenue to firm performance seems to
   channel through the financing of the public infrastructure vital to
   firms operating in these countries. We also provide evidence that this
   positive effect disappears when corruption is too pervasive, and when
   the source of tax revenue reduces government accountability.},

Abstract = {Political communication has become one of the central arenas of
   innovation in the application of automated analysis approaches to
   ever-growing quantities of digitized texts. However, although
   researchers routinely and conveniently resort to certain forms of human
   coding to validate the results derived from automated procedures, in
   practice the actual ``quality assurance{''} of such a ``gold
   standard{''} often goes unchecked. Contemporary practices of validation
   via manual annotations are far from being acknowledged as best practices
   in the literature, and the reporting and interpretation of validation
   procedures differ greatly. We systematically assess the connection
   between the quality of human judgment in manual annotations and the
   relative performance evaluations of automated procedures against true
   standards by relying on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The results
   from the simulations con?rm that there is a substantially greater risk
   of a researcher reaching an incorrect conclusion regarding the
   performance of automated procedures when the quality of manual
   annotations used for validation is not properly ensured. Our
   contribution should therefore be regarded as a call for the systematic
   application of high-quality manual validation materials in any political
   communication study, drawing on automated text analysis procedures.},

Title = {Sedimentary logics and the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper adopts a geosocial approach to sociopolitical research by
   thinking with sediment as a forceful mode of terraqueous mobility driven
   by interactions between dynamic earth systems inflected by social
   processes. It demonstrates that sediment is an active and vital state of
   matter, with the potential to erupt into and disrupt human politics.
   Unpacking sediment as a form of movement challenges assumptions of the
   earth as a stable platform on which socio-political processes play out.
   The paper develops its argument through analyses of the Rohingya refugee
   camps in southeast Bangladesh and a char (sediment) island in the Meghna
   Estuary to which Bangladesh proposes to relocate the refugees. In the
   first situation, the sedimentary logics of anticline geology,
   deforestation and monsoon rains push back against political agendas
   directed towards constraining refugee movement. In the second, fluvial
   and oceanic sedimentary dynamics and the post-Holocene volatility of the
   monsoon throw into doubt the engineering solution proposed by Bangladesh
   to the political problems the refugee presence poses. Through these
   examples, the paper adds to literature on how states of matter inflect,
   exceed, undercut or in other ways interfere with matters of state
   through their unique, dynamic environmental properties.},

Abstract = {We analyze the art market in Paris between the government-controlled
   Salon and the post-1880 system, when the Republican government
   liberalized art exhibitions. The jury of the old Salon decided on
   submissions with a bias in favor of conservative art of the academic
   insiders, erecting entry barriers against outsiders as the
   Impressionists. With a difference-in difference estimation, we provide
   evidence that the end of the government-controlled Salon contributed to
   start the price increase of the Impressionists relative to the insiders.},

Abstract = {Objective What can machine learning tell us about who voted in 2016?
   There are numerous competing voter turnout theories, and a large number
   of covariates are required to assess which theory best explains turnout.
   This article is a proof of concept that machine learning can help
   overcome this curse of dimensionality and reveal important insights in
   studies of political phenomena.
   Methods We use fuzzy forests, an extension of random forests, to screen
   variables for a parsimonious but accurate prediction. Fuzzy forests
   achieve accurate variable importance measures in the face of
   high-dimensional and highly correlated data. The data that we use are
   from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study.
   Results Fuzzy forests chose only a small number of covariates as major
   correlates of 2016 turnout and still boasted high predictive
   performance.
   Conclusion Our analysis provides three important conclusions about
   turnout in 2016: registration and voting procedures were important,
   political issues were important (especially Obamacare, climate change,
   and fiscal policy), but few demographic variables other than age were
   strongly associated with turnout. We conclude that fuzzy forests is an
   important methodology for studying overdetermined questions in social
   sciences.},

Title = {Money versus Value? Reconsidering the `Monetary Approach'

Abstract = {Even after the demise of the influential Uno School in the 1980s,
   Japanese economists have been continuously engaged in the categorial
   reconstruction of Marx's Critique of Political Economy, especially the
   theory of value and money. Writing in the 1980s-2000s, authors of the
   `post-Uno School', such as Ebitsuka Akira, Mukai Kimitoshi, Kataoka Koji
   etc., broadened the value-theoretical views of Uno School orthodoxy to
   include, among others, the Neue Marx-Lekture (predominantly H.-G.
   Backhaus and M. Heinrich) and the French economists C. Benetti and J.
   Cartelier.
   This paper will confront the `post-Uno School's' reading of Marx's
   theory of value, which poses the theories of value and money as
   unreconcilable, leading them to discard the theory of value in favour of
   a `monetary approach'. We show that the dismissal of value theory leads
   to an introduction of Baileyan and neo-classical elements into Marx's
   theory, which we believe to be both theoretically and practically
   precarious.},

Title = {Trans-Himalayan power corridors: Infrastructural politics and China's
   Belt and Road Initiative in Nepal},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article examines the shifting dimensions of Chinese infrastructural
   aid in Nepal, focusing on the politics of anticipation and enunciation
   that shape Nepali perceptions of Chinese-facilitated development and
   negotiations concerning Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
   Drawing from ethnographic research focused on sites of ongoing and
   planned infrastructure development in Nepal's two northern districts of
   Rasuwa and Gorkha, we analyze the uncertain remaking of these areas into
   trans-Himalayan power corridors. Our examination reveals the gamut of
   transitions, opportunities, reorientations, and expectations that the
   BRI and other forms of Chinese investment evoke in Nepal, showing how
   politics articulate infrastructures, and vice versa. After reviewing the
   historical context of Nepal-China relations, our empirical analysis
   begins in late 2014 when China became the single largest source of
   foreign direct investment in Nepal, continues through several rounds of
   negotiations about the BRI and other forms of Chinese infrastructural
   investment and aid, and concludes with a review of significant
   Nepal-China agreements at the Second Belt and Road Forum, held in
   Beijing in April 2019. Tacking between remote construction sites, scenes
   of diplomatic debate, borderland villages, investment summits, and
   speculative media coverage, we demonstrate how the Belt and Road
   Initiative is differently enacted and co-constructed by a variety of
   Nepali and Chinese actors who interpret, reimagine, and rhetorically
   appropriate the BRI within their own narrations of future possibility.},

   Does the level of corruption matter?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We examine the effects of province-level financial development and
   corruption on the performance of Vietnamese firms in terms of the growth
   rates of sales, investment and sales per worker. Employing a large
   firm-level dataset of more than 40,000 firms for the period 2009-2013
   and applying a heteroskedasticity-based identification strategy, we find
   that province-level financial development promotes firm growth, while
   corruption hinders it. Most importantly, the marginal effect of
   financial development on firm growth depends negatively on the level of
   corruption. Moreover, financial development exacerbates the
   growth-retarding effect of corruption.},

Abstract = {This article modifies the framework for the analysis of civil-military
   ``gaps{''} proposed in Armed Forces \& Society (Vol. 38, 2012) by
   Rahbek-Clemmensen, Archer, Barr, Belkin, Guerro, Hall, and Swain, who
   depicted a continuum of four binary fissures ({''}gap dimensions{''})
   dividing two hypothetically homogeneous communities: civilians versus
   military personnel. Extrapolating from Israel's experience, this article
   instead visualizes a more dynamic and fissured landscape, inhabited by
   several heterogeneous clusters of population groups, each comprising
   impromptu coalitions drawn from both the armed forces and civilian
   society. That environment, we argue, although certainly influenced by
   the traditional penetrability of Israel's civil-military boundaries,
   more directly reflects current technological and cultural processes,
   which are transforming encounters between civilians and military
   personnel in other countries too. We therefore suggest replacing the
   predominantly dichotomous taxonomies that generally characterize studies
   of civil-military relations in contemporary democratic societies with
   the fractured format observed in the Israeli case.},

Abstract = {It has long been noted that electing members of the U.S. House of
   Representatives in single-member, mutually exclusive districts often
   leads to discrepancies between the partisanship of the electorate and
   the party distribution in the House. There has been a spirited debate in
   the literature about the extent to which this is due to demographic
   clustering or intentional gerrymandering. This study presents direct
   tests of both of these potential causes using a simulation-based
   approach that improves upon similar studies in the past. We find that
   while there is a significant amount of demographic clustering,
   redistricting procedures account for a much greater portion of the
   partisan bias in the House. Furthermore, our results indicate that, in
   the 113th Congress (2013-15), Republicans were overrepresented in the
   House by about 15 seats, of which only a few can be attributed to
   demographic clustering.},

Abstract = {Today's fragmented and digital media environment may create a fertile
   breeding ground for the uncontrolled spread of disinformation. Although
   previous research has investigated the effects of misinformation and
   corrective efforts, we know too little about the role of visuals in
   disinformation and fact checking. Against this backdrop, we conducted an
   online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to
   investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal
   (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and
   multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings
   and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source,
   multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than
   textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential
   harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers
   can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the
   relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.},

Abstract = {Online disinformation is considered a major challenge for modern
   democracies. It is widely understood as misleading content produced to
   generate profits, pursue political goals, or maliciously deceive. Our
   starting point is the assumption that some countries are more resilient
   to online disinformation than others. To understand what conditions
   influence this resilience, we choose a comparative cross-national
   approach. In the first step, we develop a theoretical framework that
   presents these country conditions as theoretical dimensions. In the
   second step, we translate the dimensions into quantifiable indicators
   that allow us to measure their significance on a comparative
   cross-country basis. In the third part of the study, we empirically
   examine eighteen Western democracies. A cluster analysis yields three
   country groups: one group with high resilience to online disinformation
   (including the Northern European systems, for instance) and two country
   groups with low resilience (including the polarized Southern European
   countries and the United States). In the final part, we discuss the
   heuristic value of the framework for comparative political communication
   research in the age of information pollution.},

Abstract = {Objectives Previous research asserts that women are less prone to
   corruption than men. It is not without contestation, leading to a
   complex corpus with mixed findings suggesting that perceptions might be
   context-specific. This study investigates whether, how, and under or
   through what conditions gender impacts individual perceptions of
   corruption in South Korea, a case exemplifying ``Asian
   exceptionalism.{''} Methods Employing the World Values Survey and
   statistical regression techniques, we leverage a quasi-experiment
   analyzing individual attitudes across all regime types in South Korea's
   recent history. Results Examining three types of corruption-state
   benefit fraud, tax evasion, and bribe-taking-we find no significant
   differences until Korea democratizes, when we observe a surprising
   increase in the gap between perspectives. Conclusions Women's
   differential tolerance is mixed across types of corruption, implying
   that corruption is not a homogenous concept and that perceptions are
   conditioned by individual opportunities and constraints.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom's imminent departure from the European Union provides
   the opportunity for a more selective industrial strategy. This paper
   therefore analyses the effect of product subsidies on productivity in
   British manufacturing plants between 1997 and 2014 in order to provide
   evidence on the desirability of extending their use. The results suggest
   that low rates of subsidization had either a positive or no effect but
   higher rates had a negative effect on total factor productivity in some
   sectors. This implies that increasing the generosity of subsidies does
   not offer a means of improving the UK's productivity performance.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of sentiment and issue salience on
   emotionally labeled responses to posts from political actors on Facebook
   (i.e., Reactions). We use an automated content analysis of Facebook
   posts and voter survey data in a multilevel negative binomial regression
   approach. Findings show that the sentiment of a post relates to the
   number of ``Love{''} and ``Angry{''} Reactions. Furthermore, if a post
   addresses an issue that constituents perceive as salient, this
   positively influences the number of ``Angry{''} Reactions only. We also
   find that the effect of sentiment on ``Angry{''} Reactions is highest
   when issue salience is low.},

Abstract = {We exploit a unique panel dataset merging data on individual
   socio-economic characteristics and individual turnout in an Italian
   municipality to investigate the relationship between ethnic diversity in
   residential neighborhoods and propensity to vote. Using these data, we
   document for the first time a differential effect of diversity on
   electoral turnout depending on household equivalent income.
   Specifically, we show that ethnic diversity in the neighborhood reduces
   the political participation of the poor, while it fosters that of the
   more affluent. These results highlight a potential democratic deficit
   stemming from reduced and unequal electoral turnout in increasingly
   heterogeneous neighborhoods.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Objective To introduce a novel way to make partisan gerrymandering fair.
   Methods In the context of two parties, divide a state into two
   geographical areas, each of which contain a number of districts that are
   roughly proportional to the share of the statewide vote received by each
   party in the last congressional elections. Allow each party to
   unilaterally design the districts in a designated area of the state,
   restricted only by traditional districting principles. Adaptations may
   be made to account for more than two parties. Results Each party
   gerrymanders but is limited to doing so in its designated area of the
   state, with results that are roughly proportional to the statewide vote.
   Conclusion ``Fair gerrymandering{''} is a way to counter unfair partisan
   gerrymandering and it is likely to reduce the number of uncontested
   elections and increase voter turnout.},

Abstract = {In this paper, estimates of tax losses as a result of aggressive tax
   planning are presented using two different methodological approaches.
   While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) methodology addresses profit
   shifting and corresponding tax losses across the European Union, the
   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) methodology
   uses FDI data and a list of so-called offshore financial centres.
   According to the IMF methodology, the annual tax losses are about EUR
   69-105 billion for the EU-28. According to our calculations, the Czech
   Republic achieves negative losses (tax revenues) of CZK 15 billion per
   year, probably due to the low effective tax rate (16.4\%) and investment
   incentives. On the other hand, the UNCTAD methodology implies annual tax
   losses for a given EU member state of about EUR 18 billion. Because of
   limited data availability, we estimated the regression model for only 22
   EU member states for the period 2013-2016.},

Abstract = {Objective This study examined whether community attachment leads to
   population changes through in- and out-migration (such as migration
   rates), based on the concepts posited by the social capital,
   linear-development, and systemic approaches. Methods Using the data of
   the 2014 Iowa Small Towns Project combined with information from the
   2016 American Community Survey, we conducted structural equation
   modeling to examine the associations between community attachment with
   respect to its predictors (e.g., population size, median age, length of
   residence, and social capital) and migration. Results The results showed
   that the model effectively explained community attachment, and in
   particular, longer length of residence and higher social capital
   increased the level of community attachment. However, community
   attachment did not predict migration rates. Conclusion While previous
   studies found that community attachment is a determinant factor of
   migration intention, and essentially identical to actual migration, the
   findings implied that using migration intention or actual migration
   might yield conflicting results and thus yield different conclusions.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the extent and reasons for restatements of
   financial statements by Czech firms. In 2013, Czech accounting
   regulation was amended to remove inappropriate accounting treatment for
   prior period errors and changes in accounting policies. A sample of
   3,407 financial statements for the period 2013-2017 also includes a
   significant amendment to accounting standards in 2016. The combination
   of both amendments creates a quasi-natural experiment enabling
   investigation into firms' response to regulatory changes. Empirical
   analysis shows that restatements occurred in 7.4\% of the cases. Using
   non-parametric tests, we found that restatements are more frequent in
   joint-stock companies and that corrections of prior period errors
   dominate over changes in accounting policies. An expected one-time
   increase in restatements in 2016 is confirmed; however, the hypothesis
   that increased restatements are driven by changes in accounting policies
   required by new GAAP can be neither confirmed nor refuted. The main
   cause is that over 50\% of the entities did not disclose their reason
   for restatement, despite the fact that disclosure is mandated by
   accounting standards and all financial statements are audited.},

   Hungarian Students},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {63+},
Abstract = {There is abundant literature on individual-level characteristics that
   encourage citizens to participate in political demonstrations. However,
   empirical studies on demobilization and factors that prevent people from
   joining protests remain scarce. In this paper, I zero in on the
   perceived risks of political participation. Two questions are examined:
   first, how protest willingness is shaped by perceived risks, and second,
   what political and socio-economic factors explain risk perception. I
   answer these questions using the representative sample of 800 Hungarian
   university students from the Active Youth Survey (2019). Hungary has a
   special position in Europe because it is defined neither as a liberal
   democracy nor as sheer autocracy, but an `illiberal regime'. In
   non-democratic illiberal societies the state does not apply overt
   repressive techniques against dissident groups, although protest
   participation is still not a riskless form of political action, as
   regarded in developed democracies.
   I apply logistic regression models to predict both protest willingness
   and perceived risks of protest. Results confirm the importance of risks
   in extra-parliamentary protest politics, since almost half of the
   university students see their participation in demonstrations as
   somewhat risky. Regression models show that perceived risks are to some
   extent politicized, but risks have their own significant role in
   explaining protest (un)willingness.},

Abstract = {This research explores the political advertising campaign of Niyazi
   Kizilyurek, who was a candidate for the 2019 European Parliament
   election with the left-wing Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL)
   in Cyprus. It aims to uncover the content of political ads by focusing
   on the emotive character of the campaign language. Adopting a
   multi-method approach involving visual and qualitative content analysis
   of fifty-five ads, I examined the characteristics of communication
   materials distributed prior to the election. I looked at the type of
   tone, theme, language, music, visuals, and emotions these ads displayed.
   The main findings of the study are the following: (1) Kizilylirek's
   political stance, which favors a solution to the problem of Cyprus based
   on creating a federation with Greek Cypriots, is literally reflected in
   each ad; (2) issue-based ads that underline political issues in the
   country were preferred to image-based ads that highlighted the personal
   qualities of the candidate; (3) both emotional appeals (associated with
   feelings such as hope and enthusiasm) and logical appeals (which tended
   to promote rational information processed by the conscious mind) were
   employed in the ads; and, (4) the overall tone of the ads was positive
   in nature, while negative emotions were completely avoided in this
   campaign.},

Abstract = {The historical treatment and the current management given to the right
   to territory in the head of the ethnic groups of the country have led to
   the struggle of their rights transcending legal-institutional areas,
   which generates new spaces of conflict and resistance from where the
   legal, illegal, and alegal aspects will be approached. In this context,
   the Nasa people of the North of Cauca resist the dispossession and the
   displacement to which they have been subjected through the liberation of
   mother earth, a political and ecological process of taking land by
   advocating for the defense of the territory in the face of abuses of
   chemicals and monocultures. From the accompaniment to the communities of
   northern Cauca, the tension between legitimacy and social uses of
   illegality in the processes of defense and struggle for the territory is
   problematized.},

Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced
   by ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some
   controversy. Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard et al. 2020) suggest the
   verification rate is low. It is unclear if this is because voters cannot
   do this accurately or whether it is because voters simply choose not to
   attempt verification in the first place. In order to answer this
   question, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
   participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
   choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed
   ballot. The design of the printed ballot, its length, the number and
   location of changes that were made to the ballot, and the instructions
   provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
   Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed
   ballot, 76\% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably
   detect errors on their ballot if they simply review it. This suggests
   that administrative remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental
   human perceptual capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to
   check their ballots, which could prove as an effective countermeasure.},

Abstract = {I propose a theoretical model where trust towards strangers is a channel
   through which institutions determine economic outcomes, in particular,
   entrepreneurship and corruption. More importantly, I show that the role
   of trust has been overlooked since high levels of trust do not always
   enhance desirable economic outcomes. Trust helps individuals to
   participate in economic exchanges aligned with social welfare, but it
   also facilitates individuals to cooperate for the achievement of corrupt
   deals. Under this more general view of trust, the model generates a
   non-trivial new prediction at the individual level. Specifically, the
   individual-level relationship between honesty and trust changes
   depending on the institutional quality of a country. Dishonest
   individuals are the more trusting individuals in countries with poor
   institutions, and the less trusting in countries with good institutions.
   Using individual-level data of 80 countries from the World Value Survey
   and the European Values Study, I present empirical evidence in support
   of this prediction.},

Title = {Perceptions of inequality},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Individual perceptions of (income or wealth) inequality have strong
   effects on their decisions as economic agents or voters. It is therefore
   important to know more about the relation between perceived and measured
   inequality. We present a novel formal framework that is based on the
   assumption that people typically do not observe the entire income
   (wealth) distribution and that their guesses about the extent of
   inequality are based on ``self-centered{''} reference groups. This
   framework predicts that perceptions of inequality will change along
   positions in the income distribution and that for a specific position
   various dimensions of inequality perception are related to each other.
   First, low (high) income individuals overestimate (underestimate) their
   own position. Second, subjective estimates of average earnings increase
   with the own income position. Third, high or low income people have
   different perceptions about the skewness and the ``shape{''} of the
   income distribution (e.g. pyramid or diamond). Fourth, the subjective
   perception of inequality is lower for high-income individuals. Survey
   data from 40 countries provide strong support for the framework.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Do people ``vote with their feet{''} in response to a lack of political
   competition? Since political competition is associated with higher
   growth and welfare, with the free movement of labour, we argue that it
   should also encourage inward migration. We test this hypothesis by using
   data from the US and find a strong positive relation between political
   competition and net migration. This result is robust to alternative
   specifications, alternative samples and addressing endogeneity using the
   Voting Rights Act to instrument for political competition. The effect is
   economically large, specifically, we find that an increase in political
   competition in the order of magnitude observed in US Southern states
   during the post-war period leads to an increase in net migration by
   between 27 and 44 individuals per 1000 population.},

Title = {Covering \#MeToo across the News Spectrum: Political Accusation and
   Public Events as Drivers of Press Attention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},

Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Garnering coverage across the political spectrum is a major challenge
   for burgeoning social movements. The \#MeToo movement stands out due to
   the volume of attention it generated. Yet, it is unclear how news media
   across the partisan spectrum covered the movement using different sexual
   violence language markers, latent topic, and word choices and which
   accusations and events drove media attention. To examine this, we used
   Media Cloud to extract 17,877 news articles from nine media outlets
   across the political spectrum, containing specific n-grams or
   co-occurrences of (1) ``metoo,{''} (2) ``sexual misconduct,{''} (3)
   ``sexual harassment,{''} and (4) ``sexual assault{''} from October 2017
   through February 2018. The analyses first examined whether language and
   attention differed across the ideological news ecology and then turned
   to time-series modeling of these discourses to examine what drove press
   coverage and structural topic modeling (STM) and term frequency-inverse
   document frequency (TF-IDF) analysis to understand latent topics and
   language usage. Findings reveal that (1) left-leaning media dedicated
   more relative attention across all topics-\#MeToo, sexual misconduct,
   sexual harassment, and sexual assault-relative to centrist and
   right-leaning media. Moreover, across the right, left, and centrist
   media, the language markers ``misconduct,{''} ``harassment,{''} and
   ``assault{''} decreased over the study period, while the mentions of
   \#MeToo movement increased during the same period; (2) stories relating
   to entertainment and those accusing politicians, especially those
   belonging to the party in power at the Federal level, seemed to be by
   far the strongest driver of news media attention; and (3) we further
   observed partisan differences in topics of news coverage and language
   usage.},

Abstract = {Building on Scott's notion of identity as a key concept in early modern
   statehood, this paper historically contextualises and analyses the
   current political re-problematisation of identity in the EU. Engaging
   the recently adopted interoperability initiative that is set to
   biometrically verify and cross-validate identity records between all
   European border management, migration, and security databases, it argues
   that interoperability presents a shift from traditional modes of
   identity production at the border towards a digital space of identity
   management. Such identity management is predicated on the establishment
   of a biometric super-layer structure that cuts across databases without
   dissolving their legal foundations and introduces a new mode of `truth'
   production in the form of a dedicated `identity confirmation file' that
   is supposed to re-introduce a reliable baseline for the government of
   the Schengen area.},

Abstract = {This paper explores contemporary cultures of British military
   recruitment and considers the domestication of geopolitics as matters of
   the ephemeral (fleeting, sensory encounters), and of ephemera (everyday
   objects). It employs an auto/ethnographic approach toward spaces
   critical to recruitment - the airshow, the home and the body. Three
   central contributions are developed: first, building on a recent turn to
   the material in political geography, the paper argues that taking
   seriously materiality, objects, and `stuff' enhances our understanding
   of the connections between geopolitical, militarised and everyday;
   second, deploying a notion of the geopolitical social, it explores the
   geopolitical as it is situated in everyday lives and spaces; third, it
   investigates the tendency for militarised objects to find their way onto
   and around bodies and into domestic spaces. Set at the interface of
   literatures in critical geopolitics and critical military studies, the
   paper concludes that material encounters and everyday objects are
   matters central to the business of geopolitics and militarism.},

Abstract = {This article offers a new explanation for why brutalization occurred in
   only some parts of Europe in the first half of the twentieth century.
   The presence of veterans hardened by war was not enough for a broader
   brutalization of society to take place; the presence of pre-existing
   institutions with experience repressing civilian populations was also
   necessary so that their methods could then be applied more broadly by
   those in favour of employing brutality in political contestation and
   warfare. This article examines the repression of the rebellion of
   October 1934 in the Asturias region and the beginning of the Spanish
   Civil War as examples of this chain of events. Spain's militarized
   police force, the Civil Guard, had a long history of dealing harshly
   with those who challenged the liberal regimes of the nineteenth and
   early twentieth centuries. In the suppression of the Asturias revolt,
   colonial officers were able to apply the Civil Guard's pre-existing
   methods on a wider scale in their effort to cleanse Spanish society of
   radical elements. In the Civil War, they extended a similar pattern of
   repression across the entire country.},

Title = {Consociationalism and the politics of the census in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina and Northern Ireland},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Population censuses have symbolic and instrumental importance for
   ethnic, national, linguistic or religious groups and their political
   representatives. This is particularly apparent in deeply divided
   societies, where political institutions are designed to accommodate
   groups through forms of power sharing. Existing literature posits that
   consociational power-sharing institutions, which are commonly employed
   to manage inter-group conflict, are likely to incentivise contestation
   and mobilisation in relation to the census, but this claim has not been
   tested empirically. Employing the case studies of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   and Northern Ireland, this article tests a proposition about the
   relationship between consociationalism and the politics of the census:
   that it is corporate consociational designs that are likely to result in
   contestation of the census and mobilisation of groups during
   enumeration, whereas liberal consociational designs will not. The
   analysis offers support for this proposition, but also suggests that
   other features of power-sharing settlements, such as the federal nature
   of the Bosnian state and the majoritarian provision for a `border poll'
   in the Northern Irish settlement, also play an important role in shaping
   census politics. These insights contribute to political geographic
   debates about the census by highlighting the influence of institutional
   design on struggles over how and where populations get counted, which
   are applicable beyond the immediate context of deeply divided societies.},

Abstract = {The limited influence of corrective messages is one of the most striking
   observations in the misperceptions literature. We elaborate on this
   well-known outcome, showing that correction effectiveness varies
   according to recipients' judgment strategy. Using data from two online
   experiments, we demonstrate that individuals' responses to corrective
   messages are less biased by prior attitudes when they engage in on-line
   rather than memory-based processing. We also show that individuals are
   more responsive to one-sided messages under conditions of on-line rather
   than memory-based processing. Unexpectedly, two-sided messages, which
   repeat the inaccuracy before correcting it, performed better than
   one-sided messages among individuals using memory-based processes. These
   findings contribute to our understanding of fact-checking, and suggest
   strategies that could help promote greater responsiveness to corrective
   messages.},

Abstract = {Social movements provide participants a chance to establish
   collaborative foundations and develop enduring friendships from which
   subsequent movements can arise. This happens as they find different ways
   to capitalize on a particular movement's momentum. However there can
   also be friction within the same movement. Unreconciled friction can
   lead to withdrawal and avoidance of working together. Movements may
   consequently disband and fail to achieve their immediate goals. This
   study investigates the sources of friction within one such movement.
   Based on interviews with 54 Kopi Badati movement participants in Ambon,
   Indonesia, we found that friction emerging from dissent on strategies,
   incompatible views, and feeling unacknowledged led to the disbandment of
   the Badati movement. When participants' relationships with others
   deteriorate, it becomes difficult for them to identify themselves with
   the movement. Conversely, participants' ability to reconcile internal
   friction may be one factor for the movement's success.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Bringing political ecology's concern with the critical politics of
   nature and resource violence into dialogue with key debates in political
   geography, critical security studies and research on the geographies and
   phenomenology of violence and warfare, this paper explores strategies
   `from above' in relation to the establishment and operation of the Rio
   Tinto QIT-Madagascar Minerals (QMM) ilmenite mine in southeast
   Madagascar. While QMM claims to be a responsible `green' self-regulator
   and sustainable development actor, it has triggered serious social,
   environmental and legal conflicts since its inception, including
   allegations of a `double land grab' to accommodate mining activities and
   compensatory biodiversity offsetting. We argue that `pacification',
   theorised as a productive form of violence that works through the
   re-ordering of socio-nature, underwrites the forms of `security',
   `stability' and even `sustainability' that facilitate multiple and
   overlapping strategies of value extraction in the territorial and
   extra-territorial spaces occupied by the QMM mine partnership. By
   situating these dynamics historically, we identify ways in which
   pacification draws upon sedimented and evolving logics of racialised
   violence to facilitate operations and silence opposition.},

Abstract = {Based on a sample of 16 Western OECD countries we show that although
   veto players with heterogeneous political preferences reduce the
   probability of a structural fiscal consolidation, the effect of veto
   players declines with greater financial market pressure, which we
   measure as the spread between the long-term government bond yield and
   the corresponding yield in a base country (either the United States or
   Germany). We proxy veto players with heterogeneous political preferences
   primarily by the political constraints index of Henisz (Econ Polit
   12(1):1-31, 2000). Our findings support the view that, as long as
   government bond yield spreads are sufficiently narrow, financial market
   pressure exerts a disciplining effect on fiscal policy by counteracting
   the political deadlock resulting from veto players who obstruct
   structural fiscal consolidations. The mirror image of our finding is
   that financial market pressure exerts a more positive impact on the
   likelihood of a structural fiscal consolidation in political
   environments characterized by many heterogeneous veto players.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the cooperation logics within European and North
   American cross-border metropolitan regions to explain how institutional
   actors respond to the challenges of globalization. The focus is on
   analysing the relationship between concepts of space and planning to
   provide insights into the way cross-border metropolitan regions are
   produced, and on how the border is conceived. The hypothesis is that
   mobility galvanizes stakeholders on both sides of the border in order to
   undertake collective actions to overcome obstacles posed by an
   international border, even in situations where the border is conceived
   as a hard barrier. The study employs a comparative approach of two
   cross-border regions: Basel (Switzerland/France/Germany) and San
   Diego-Tijuana (United States/Mexico), according to three dimensions of
   mobility (airport and pedestrian infrastructures, and daily mobility
   management). The main conclusion is that although these two border
   contexts are completely different, similarities exist regarding the
   planning of mobility, and the space conception. States are willing to
   relinquish sovereignty allowing a foreign government, cross-border
   structure or a private company to perform planning operations that
   normally belong to the nation-states. Furthermore, local authorities do
   whatever is needed to facilitate the flow of workers and people across
   borders when economic costs due to border barriers are too high.},

Abstract = {Objectives To assess the extent to which crime, Hispanic-to-white
   population changes, black-to-white population changes, and conservative
   political appeals affect gun permit application rates across Texas
   counties. Methods This article uses spatial lag regression and robust
   regression with county-level data to assess structural sources of
   variation in handgun permitting across Texas counties in 2016.
   Conclusions Spatial and robust regression model results confirm that
   median incomes, Republican votes, and rising rates of Hispanic-to-white
   populations are significant predictors of handgun permit application
   rates. The results call attention to the centrality of Hispanic threat
   and the prevalence of partisan politics in aggregate permit-seeking
   processes.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the policing measures of the Habsburg Empire
   against the exiled defeated revolutionaries in the Mediterranean after
   the 1848-1849 revolutions. The examination of this counter-revolutionary
   policy reveals the pioneering role Austria played in international
   policing. It shows, in particular, that Vienna invested more heavily in
   policing in the Mediterranean after 1848 than it did in other regions,
   such as Western Europe, due to the multitude of `Forty-Eighters' settled
   there and the alleged inadequacy of the local polities (e.g., the
   Ottoman Empire, Greece) to satisfactorily deal with the refugee question
   themselves. The article explains that Austria made use of a wide array
   of both official and unofficial techniques to contain these allegedly
   dangerous political dissidents. These methods ranged from official
   police collaboration with Greece and the Ottoman Empire to more subtle
   regional information exchanges with Naples and Russia. However, they
   also included purely unilateral methods exercised by the Austrian
   consuls, Austrian Lloyd sailors and ship captains, and ad hoc recruited
   secret agents to monitor the emigres at large. Overall, the article
   argues that Austrian policymakers in the aftermath of 1848 invented new
   policing formulas and reshaped different pre-existing institutions
   (e.g., consuls, Austrian Lloyd), channelling them against their
   opponents in exile. Therefore, apart from surveying early modes of
   international policing, this study also adds to the discussion about
   Austrian (and European) state-building and, furthermore, to the more
   specific discussion of how European states dealt with political
   dissidents abroad in the nineteenth century.},

Title = {Reconfiguring Desecuritization: Contesting Expert Knowledge in the
   Securitization of Migration},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1042-1068},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {This article introduces desecuritization as the missing supplement of
   the conception of securitization as a dispersed social process. It calls
   for the creative development of approaches that destabilise the
   credibility of security professionals' claimed expert knowledge. To
   illustrate the potential of this approach, the article combines insights
   from the sociology of ignorance (agnotology) and the autonomy of
   migration literature to deconstruct the framing of migrants as cunning
   tricksters, a narrative that features prominently in processes of
   securitization. Within the Schengen visa regime discussed in this
   article, the trickster narrative emerges in the portrayal of visa
   applicants as deploying various modes of deception like `document fraud'
   or `visa shopping'. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at consulates in
   North Africa, this article demonstrates, in contrast, that practices
   like applying at a consulate known for a more liberal decision-making
   practice constitute coping strategies by which migrants try to mitigate
   the uncertainty that a culture of suspicion, the discretionary power of
   consular staff and the heterogeneity of opaque decision-making criteria
   create for them. Ultimately, the analysis shows that security practices
   produce not only knowledge, but also various forms of nonknowledge which
   provoke the instances of `trickery' that ever more pervasive security
   practices are supposed to forestall.},

Abstract = {Flash mobs are commonly portrayed in the media as light-hearted events
   intended to surprise bystanders. Meanwhile, academic literature features
   a number of explicitly political interpretations of flash mobs. However,
   to date, no empirical study has addressed why individuals organize and
   take part in the internationally spread mass events organized by the
   most popular contemporary flash mob incarnation, the Urban Playground
   Movement (UPM). In this paper, we place Budapest's UPM on an
   entertainment practice versus social movement mobilization spectrum. Our
   interviews with the leaders of the largest Hungarian UPM organization
   show that the functioning of the UPM in Budapest heavily relies on
   social movement continuity, where organizers see their events as ways to
   reclaim public spaces and to prefigure more social cities. However,
   among participants surveyed at the most notable yearly UPM event, the
   International Pillow Fight Day, we found fun as the primary motivation
   for participation, thus showing movement discontinuity. We conclude that
   the UPM in Budapest is a collective action, but not a social movement.
   Secondly, we find that the UPM exhibits `thin' diffusion both in its
   reliance on individual activists over coalitions and in its usage of
   commercial social media as its diffusion infrastructure. Lastly, our
   results show that UPM collectives can act as `containers' of social
   movement frames, implying that these playful groups could function as
   vehicles in the spread of protest in movement milieus. Our key finding
   that UPM is not a social movement contradicts the numerous academic
   interpretations of flash mobs as outright political events.},

Abstract = {Research on the responsiveness of policy to public opinion has
   infrequently confronted the possibility that re-election seeking
   politicians' policy choices may reflect their expectations about future
   public opinion. This article reports observational and experimental
   findings from a survey of senior Canadian policy-makers. Results from
   vignette-based experiments that manipulate the characteristics of
   current and estimates of future opinion show that policy-makers are
   responsive to the estimated direction of future opinion, but this
   relationship is conditional on high estimated future salience. Survey
   results shed additional light on the role that estimates of future
   opinion play in policy-making. Combined, these experimental and
   observational results suggest existing empirical work on policy
   responsiveness is incomplete.},

   performance},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A substantial literature has studied how increased diversity in terms of
   gender, age, education, and race amongst members of firms' boards
   affects decisions and performance. This paper studies whether
   ideological diversity in the boardroom affects firm performance. We find
   that whilst a board with a broader range of political opinions and
   beliefs is correlated with better performance ceteris paribus, that the
   causal impact of such an increase in diversity is negative and
   substantial. This negative effect is still present when diversity is
   measured excluding top management, and when diversity is defined in
   terms of the difference between firms' management and non-executive
   directors. In conclusion we consider the implication of these findings
   given the recent growth in both political polarization and ideological
   segregation.},

Abstract = {The years 1975 and 1977 witnessed a wave of de facto military regimes in
   Bangladesh and Pakistan, respectively. In Pakistan, General Muhammad
   Zia-ul-Haq operationalized the country's preexisting Islamic identity
   from emblematic to substantive at both domestic and international
   levels. General Ziaur Rahman and General Ershad of Bangladesh revived
   the country's Islamic identity at the domestic and international levels
   and reopened the space for religious fractions that were banned from
   politics constitutionally in the previous regime. Focusing on military
   regimes in Bangladesh and Pakistan between 1975 and 1990, this paper
   aims to bridge that gap by specifically examining the use of Islam. This
   study argues that dictators in both countries used Islam to support
   their survival strategies of legitimacy, repression, and social control.
   Authoritarian rulers did not have to use Islam to maintain military
   coherence, because of the military's culture of subordination to
   superiors.},

Abstract = {After the ``Troubles{''} broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969, the
   Australian government became increasingly concerned that these
   international tensions would manifest themselves within the Irish
   diaspora. Sympathy for Irish Republicanism was identified in a number of
   nationalist and socialist groups in Australia which were monitored by
   the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Although
   chiefly focused on the Communist Party of Australia, ASIO monitored
   Irish Republicans alongside other left-wing groups and social movements.
   Based on recently released ASIO files, this article explores the extent
   to which they were surveilled. The article argues that the monitoring of
   the Irish Republicans can fit into two periods. The first period, from
   the outbreak of the ``Troubles{''} in 1969 to 1972, was when Irish
   Republicanism was seen as an extension of the Communist and Trotskyist
   groups in Australia. The second period, from 1972 through to the late
   1970s, saw security services much more concerned about Irish
   Republicanism as terrorism, as international terrorism and the expansion
   of the IRA's bombing campaigns outside of Northern Ireland became an
   increasing concern. This shift in perceptions of Irish Republicanism
   demonstrates a wider shift in focus for ASIO and the Australian
   authorities from Cold War counter-subversion to counter-terrorism.},

   is Buchanan's uncompromising commitment to a methodological and a
   normative individualism to which his lifework owes its coherence and
   internal consistency. Secondly, that a principal motivating force behind
   his life-long research efforts has been the aim of inquiring into how
   the citizen-members of a democratic polity may govern themselves in
   mutually beneficial ways. And, thirdly, that his contractarian
   constitutionalism provides a paradigmatic alternative to received
   outlooks of liberalism, welfare economics, and democratic theory.},

Abstract = {Despite the EU accession of the Republic of Cyprus in 2004, the ``Green
   Line{''} dividing Cyprus that was added as a border in 1974 remains an
   external EU-border between the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) and the Turkish
   Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a self-proclaimed state
   internationally recognized exclusively by Turkey. Pro- and con European
   attitudes on Cyprus are therefore not recent phenomena, but date back to
   the start of EU accession negotiations in 1998 and the Annan-Plan for
   reunification in 2004. These aspects, however, refer to the
   Turkish-Greek antagonism on the island and the ongoing national tensions
   that have resulted in violent conflicts since independence in 1960, the
   establishment of a demilitarized UN Buffer Zone in 1964 and the division
   of the island in 1974, also cutting through the island's capital
   Nikosia/Lefkosa. Drawing on fieldwork from 2004/2005 and 2014/2015
   regarding the border's shifting meanings and pointing to the border as a
   place where pro- and con-EU-articulations converge, emphasis is placed
   on the borderscape in Nikosia/Lefkosa that impedes and increases the
   movement of people and goods. After all, the border is a dividing line
   that both shapes and exhibits identities. Moreover, it serves as an
   individual economic resource whilst border-crossings likewise offer
   benefits. Nevertheless, the border also stands as painful emotional
   remembrances for people on both sides. The pro- and con-EU attitudes
   that were dominant when the RoC joined the EU in 2004 have thus been
   blurred on both sides of the Green Line. The empirical research for this
   paper has been framed by the question of how this blurring is
   intertwined with the division of Cyprus and how people are affected by
   the Green Line as a socio-material and symbolic artefact on the
   micro-scale of personal feelings, identities and practices.},

Abstract = {The advent of online platforms has been considered to be one of the most
   significant economic changes of the last decade, with their emergence
   reflecting a longer trend of increasing contingent work, labor market
   flexibility, and outsourcing work to independent contractors. In this
   article, we conceptualize the so-called gig economy along four
   dimensions, namely, online intermediation, independent contractors, paid
   tasks, and personal services. Using this framework, it is possible to
   derive both a narrow definition of the gig economy, as ex ante
   specified, paid tasks carried out by independent contractors mediated by
   online platforms, and broader definitions that include offline alongside
   online intermediation, employees alongside independent contractors,
   unpaid tasks alongside paid tasks, and asset sharing alongside
   performing gigs. The four dimensions also span four key regulatory
   questions: How should online platforms be classified and regulated; how
   should gig workers be classified and regulated; what should count as
   paid and unpaid work; and should we treat earnings from performing gigs
   differently than earnings from sharing assets? We conclude that the
   positions taken on these regulatory issues are essentially contingent
   upon political choices and will determine how the gig economy evolves in
   the future.},

Abstract = {In 1999, the Utah State Legislature allowed charter schools to enter and
   be administered under the broad oversight of school districts. The
   structure of the Utah Charter School provides a natural experiment to
   study a unique way that traditional public schools compete against new
   charter schools. Using data from the 1992-2012 waves of the Common Core
   of Data, we estimated fixed effect models to measure the increase in
   capital expenditures by traditional public schools when faced with
   competition by new charter schools. We find that total capital outlay
   and spending on improving existing structures increases with charter
   competition, but new construction and instructional spending does not
   increase at a statistically significant level.},

Abstract = {An important issue associated with empirical research is the extent to
   which statistical results continue to hold in the post-sample period.
   Although many tests of robustness within the period of a given study are
   routinely reported, relatively little attention is paid to model
   performance in the post-sample period. This paper examines the
   post-sample performance of the Congleton and Shughart (Econ Inq 28(1):
   109-132, 1990) estimates of three public choice models of Social
   Security benefit levels. The Social Security program is the single
   largest line item in the federal budget; so, examining the post-sample
   performance of the Congleton-Shughart estimates also sheds light on the
   long-run stability of political processes in the United States. In
   general, we find that the three public choice models perform well in the
   post-sample period, although there are several caveats to that
   conclusion. The results of our post-sample study also suggest that the
   political processes of the United States with respect to major fiscal
   policies are more stable and robust than news reports suggest.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether the large scale municipal amalgamations
   in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the early 1970s led to
   considerable common pool exploitation. Through amalgamation the
   resources of several municipalities are pooled together disclosing the
   former independent municipalities a larger source of funds.
   Additionally, the pooling also decreases the cost of local public goods,
   as those have to be borne by the whole of the amalgamated municipality.
   By exploiting the huge variance in the amalgamation process in terms of
   number of participating municipalities, but also in municipality size or
   amalgamation strategy, we identify considerable common pool effects.
   Amalgamated municipalities show considerably stronger acceleration in
   debt accumulation compared to non-amalgamating municipalities. This
   common pool exploitation is stronger if more municipalities participate
   and when municipalities amalgamate by annexation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of the EU in unrecognised, also known as
   contested, states and more specifically, how their level of
   international recognition and empirical statehood (i.e. government
   authority and control) influence the EU's engagement. By studying the
   case of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the article finds that
   the EU engagement takes the form of `state avoidance', mostly
   characterised by an effort to engage without endorsing state recognition
   and manifested via a) sui generis management of unrecognised borders, b)
   informal engagement with officials of the unrecognised state, c)
   replacement of public authorities with non-state actors and d) extensive
   engagement with civil society. In this regard, the article offers a
   range of causal explanations that can be tested across a greater number
   of similar cases. What is more, I contrast state avoidance to
   state-building approaches evident in aspiring states with more
   recognition but greater deficit of empirical statehood, such as Kosovo
   and Palestine, and I argue for a broader conceptualisation of the
   phenomenon of unrecognised states, allowing for variation in both the
   degree of recognition and of empirical statehood. As such, the article
   combines a discussion of rich empirical findings and inductive
   concept-building that contributes to a more informed discussion and
   further research development, especially as far as engagement from the
   EU is concerned.},

Abstract = {As more debates in American politics become constitutional questions,
   effective citizens must engage in constitutional interpretation. While
   most Americans venerate the Constitution as a part of a national, civil
   religion, levels of constitutional knowledge are also very low. In this
   paper, we analyze how ordinary Americans approach the task of
   constitutional interpretation. An analysis of two cross-sectional
   surveys indicates constitutional hermeneutics are a product of political
   factors, religious affiliation, and biblical interpretive preferences.
   We also present the results of a survey experiment where the
   manipulation of a clergy's interpretation of a biblical passage affects
   how respondents interpret both scripture and the Constitution, providing
   a potential causal mechanism for learning how to engage in hermeneutics.},

Abstract = {Objective This study seeks to learn about the development of large,
   federated voluntary associations in the antebellum era by combining
   insights from historical work and neopluralist interest group theory.
   The American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS) is the case study.
   Methods Summary statistics and logistic regression models are used to
   investigate what variables predict the presence of an AASS local group
   in a town.
   Results Total population of a town is the key predictor of AASS group
   presence across states, though the percentage of people employed in
   learned professions and the number of primary common schools per capita
   are also important in select states.
   Conclusion Population itself was the modernizing force behind group
   formation in the antebellum era, creating contexts conducive to the
   mobilization of interests.},

Abstract = {We document methods employed by Russia's Internet Research Agency to
   influence the political agenda of the United States from September 9,
   2009 to June 21, 2018. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze
   Twitter accounts with known IRA affiliation to better understand the
   form and function of Russian efforts. We identified five handle
   categories: Right Troll, Left Troll, News Feed, Hashtag Gamer, and
   Fearmonger. Within each type, accounts were used consistently, but the
   behavior across types was different, both in terms of ``normal{''} daily
   behavior and in how they responded to external events. In this sense,
   the Internet Research Agency's agenda-building effort was
   ``industrial{''} - mass produced from a system of interchangeable parts,
   where each class of part fulfilled a specialized function.},

Abstract = {Economic activity is often regulated through both permits and tickets
   (subsequent inspections). We study the effectiveness of such policies
   where corruption and an underground economy make enforcement imperfect.
   In the theoretical model, asymmetric information justifies regulatory
   action which is enforced by corruptible bureaucrats. We find that
   regulation through permits alone is useless when corruption exists,
   while tickets still offer some benefit. Surprisingly, we also find that
   a system with both permits and tickets achieves welfare that is higher
   than that which can be achieved with only tickets-that combining the two
   mechanisms has an effect that is greater than the ``sum of the
   parts.{''}},

Title = {Post-communist predation: modeling reiderstvo practices in
   contemporary predatory states},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {187},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {247-273},

Abstract = {While the economics of predatory states has been at the center of an
   emerging discussion, a rich body of literature on predation already
   exists in the scholarship on post-communist regimes. This paper offers a
   glimpse into that literature, developing (1) a typology of coercive
   corporate raiding ({''}reiderstvo{''}) and (2) a model for understanding
   the logic of contemporary predatory states. The typology starts from the
   original form of reiderstvo, carried out by criminal groups ({''}black
   raiding{''}), and introduces the concepts of ``grey{''} and ``white
   raiding{''}. We identify ``centrally led corporate raiding{''} as a form
   of state predation not considered in public choice models, despite the
   fact that it exemplifies the functioning of contemporary authoritarian
   regimes. Expanding the models of Leeson (J Inst Theor Econ (JITE)
   163:467-482, 2007) and Vahabi (Public Choice 168:153-175, 2016), we show
   how centrally led corporate raiding can be incorporated into the
   discussion of predatory states. We provide illustrations by offering two
   examples from the predatory state of contemporary Hungary, the case of
   an outdoor advertising company (ESMA) and the case of the banking
   sector.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the geopolitical imagination of the Catholic Church,
   particularly in relation to the former colonies of Portugal and Spain
   during the late imperial period (1930-1975). At that time, authoritarian
   dictators with strong Catholic ideology ruled both countries. However,
   the relationship between the Catholic missionaries and the colonial
   authorities of the Iberian imperial states was not always in harmony.
   There were sometimes contradictions between them. The geopolitics of the
   Catholic Church and the colonial geopolitics of the Iberian states were
   convergent but not always coincident. This paper describes and analyses
   the Spanish and Portuguese states' policies towards the missions. It
   also studies the missionary discourse in the metropolis, and its impact
   and reflection in the colonies.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of political cynicism in emotions, online
   campaign information seeking, and online political expression. Data from
   a two-wave online panel survey conducted before the 2016 U.S.
   presidential election reveal that cynicism is related positively to
   anger and anxiety and negatively to enthusiasm. Cynicism is also
   positively related to online campaign information seeking indirectly
   through anxiety. This indirect relationship is moderated by perceived
   exposure to insult campaigning, such that the relationship is stronger
   for those who thought they were often exposed to insulting campaign
   rhetoric. Data also show that cynicism is negatively associated with
   online political expression through reduced enthusiasm.},

Abstract = {Objective This study evaluates the bias to inequality measurement from
   survey nonrespondents. Methods Sixty-six Luxembourg Income Study surveys
   for 38 middle- and high-income countries, encompassing some 900,000
   households, are used to derive estimates of the Gini coefficient for
   countries and selected world regions. Results Household nonresponse
   typically biases national Ginis downward by 1-8 percentage points. The
   Gini for North America appears robust to nonresponse, rising by a mere
   0.34 percentage points to 44.72 when a correction is applied. The Gini
   for the European Union Single Market is sensitive to nonresponse, rising
   by 5.52 percentage points to 37.63. The OECD-wide Gini rises by 5.93
   points to 44.58. Conclusion These results appear consistent with one
   another and with prior evidence. They suggest that, across countries and
   selected world regions, household nonresponse biases the Ginis downward
   by 1-8 percentage points.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Wroclaw, Poland, the paper
   analyzes grassroots workings of European sexual citizenship. Against
   this backdrop, it attempts to problematize a concept of Europeanization
   as vertical and horizontal diffusion which spreads specific ideas,
   practices, and institutions among actual and prospective EU Member
   States. Whereas (neo)liberal LGBT rights, seen as a symbol of
   Europeanness, have definitely inspired struggles for sexual freedom in
   Poland, abstract notions of Europe and Europeanization do not form an
   important point of reference, at least at a local level. Moreover,
   premises of European sexual citizenship are in many ways contested by
   nonheteronormative persons unwilling (or unable) to use this frame for
   the conceptualization of their own experiences. On the other hand,
   because the EU and neoliberalism constitute significant antagonists of
   Polish right-wing nationalism, this allows for a certain resignification
   of interrelated phenomena criticized elsewhere as lomonormative' and
   lomonationalist.' While these phenomena undoubtedly trigger specific
   inclusions and exclusions, they also have the potential to contribute to
   critical citizenship. Consequently, instead of grasping Europeanization
   in a teleological way, the paper argues for taking it as an image that
   may fuel social change, variously conceived of.},

Abstract = {This paper explores regional convergence in schooling in France and
   Italy under decentralized primary education, that is, in the long 19th
   century. A new, preliminary harmonized dataset on schooling is
   presented, including figures on Primary Gross Enrolment Ratios,
   aggregate municipal expenditure per school-age child and state subsidies
   across French departements and Italian province. The analysis shows that
   regional convergence in schooling happened well before the shift to the
   formal centralization of school management in the two countries.
   However, the pace of regional convergence accelerated during this
   transition, and the extent of state investments and subsidies mattered
   to regional convergence. Although more research is needed to include
   demand-related factors of schooling in this framework, the results
   suggest that institutions and public policy were quite ``visible
   hands{''}, which played an important role in fostering education across
   the regions of Southwestern Europe beyond the mere response to market
   and demand-side features.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, el-Ojeili explores the scholarly treatment of utopia
   and utopianism. Examining key debates around the connections between
   utopia and science, ideology, reason, and emotion, el-Ojeili draws from
   the work of Mannheim, Bloch, and Levitas to set out seven theses on
   utopia as optic or method. These theses inform the chapters ahead. As a
   further backdrop to the studies that follow, el-Ojeili turns to
   specifically modern utopianism in social and political thought. Here, he
   suggests four important modern periods in which novel elements within
   successive utopian constellations emerged. In conclusion, el-Ojeili
   suggests that 1999 serves as a symbolic date, after which major
   transformations in the utopian constellation become visible. Certain
   dimensions of such contemporary transformations are the focus of the
   three chapters that follow.},

Abstract = {One of the concepts most commonly evoked in order to characterize and
   explain the zig-zag trajectory of political dynamics in the Islamic
   Republic of Iran has been the ``middle class.{''} Yet there is no
   scholarly consensus on a fundamental approach to identification and
   measurement of the middle class. Rather, the category of the middle
   class is both a category of analysis - long debated within social theory
   - as well as a category of practice - routinely deployed in political
   behavior and social distinction. In order to better conceptualize and
   understand the formation and role of Iran's middle classes in the
   country's sociopolitical dynamics, theories of class formation in the
   global South should be rearticulated away from a reified notion of the
   middle class as a transhistorical subject. To do so, this chapter is
   divided into four sections. First, internal debates over the role of
   Iran's middle classes in the country's recent political history are
   assessed and data from the 2016 Iran Social Survey is used to test a
   long-standing demographic assumption on the class dynamics of electoral
   behavior. Second, the tradition of theorizing the social power of middle
   classes is reassessed, drawing on the growing scholarly attention to the
   heterogenous origins and differentiated internal composition of middle
   classes across the global South. Third, a typology is proposed of four
   middle classes across the twentieth century shaped by varying state
   attempts at ``catch-up{''} development. These types are then applied in
   a revisionist telling of the making and unmaking of middle classes in
   postrevolutionary Iran. Finally, implications of this framework beyond
   Iran are sketched out for global waves of protest in the twenty-first
   century.},

Abstract = {Objective The association between economic inequality and protest
   participation has attracted much scholarly attention, and yet empirical
   tests of this association remain unsatisfactory. Methods Applying a
   multilevel model to the eight-wave repeated cross-sectional data set
   from the European Social Survey, analyses presented in this article
   distinguish between cross-national and longitudinal differences in
   economic inequality to investigate their effects on protest
   participation. Results Most of the observed effect of economic
   inequality on participation is due to between-country differences rather
   than within-country changes in inequality. Conclusion The results do not
   support theories according to which protest participation is causally
   related to economic inequality.},

Title = {Sexual Harassment or Volunteer Work? Affordances of Differentiated
   Whiteness},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {97-115},
Abstract = {This article applies the notion of affordance to analyse affective,
   intersectional emergence of differentiated whiteness in the context of
   East to West migration after the enlargement of the European Union in
   2004. I draw on autoethnography and memory work, juxtaposing encounters
   with two elderly, white, single and physically impaired Danish men in
   their homes in 2004 and 2014. Cleaning Ole's apartment in 2004, I was
   invited to provide sexual services, passing as a sexualized, too young,
   unemployable female Eastern European love migrant of limited social
   value. In contrast, interviewing Carsten for my PhD in 2014, I came
   across as able-bodied, middle-class researcher, progressively feminine
   and fluent in, perhaps even, Danish. I heard no sexual undertones in
   Carsten's invitation to `visit again', instead perceiving it as a
   suggestion to become a voluntary visitor. Analyzing the affective flows
   in these encounters, I trace how markers of difference intersect to
   afford different whitenesses. I discuss how whiteness functions as an
   affordance, accumulated over time, emerging in situated, affective
   encounters and constraining bodies' possibilities for interactions,
   movement and becoming. The article contributes to research on whiteness
   and intersectionality and to scholarship that explores emergence of
   `Europe' by examining relations between centre/periphery and racial
   formations.(1)},

Abstract = {Chapter 4 delves into the analysis of the social movement scene of
   health, by focusing on the advent of social clinics and the provision of
   primary healthcare services free of charge. The exclusion of almost one
   third of the Greek population from the health system triggered the
   expansion of social clinics across the country and granted them a
   contentious role. By paying attention to the clinics' organizational
   structure and decision-making systems, resources and identity, the
   chapter explores the contentious mechanisms that shaped the rise of the
   clinics, their coordination and the solidarity network of drugs
   distribution. At the same time, the analysis of the boundary enlargement
   process touches upon the clinics' relations with state and municipal
   authorities.},

Abstract = {Typical conversations about political matters are charged with emotion.
   Political matters are understood here as a thematic field involving
   talks about central authorities and parliament, as well as comments on
   news provided by the media. Talks about this topic often occur during
   neighborly meetings and family or social gatherings. I conducted
   ethnographic interviews to analyze how rural inhabitants talk about such
   political matters. During the interviews, especially polyphonic ones, I
   observed the accompanying emotions, such as raised voices, faces
   bloodshot with irritation, lively gestures, the use of irony, and
   sometimes vulgar language and swearing. Anger, resentment, anxiety,
   fear, contempt, hostility, and even hatred were unmistakable signals of
   emotional involvement in political matters and engagement in debate
   about the common good and public affairs. Thus, the question arises: are
   such conversations a form of civility?},

Abstract = {This study tie down the traditional vision of a nobility scarcely
   interested in intervening, in a corporate and united way, in the Spanish
   politics at the first decade of the 19th century. The creation,
   management and organization of the General Assembly of Greatness (1815)
   is analyzed, an occasion that made possible the creation of his
   Permanent Deputation, which would continue to exist until today. Some
   members of the high nobility tried to use that organism as a tool to
   intervene in politics, defending their interests and revaluing their
   prestige, by being able to address directly to the Crown, in a reign
   where she reached the highest levels of political rule of the entire
   nineteenth century. If it was a failed strategy, not for it being an
   important attempt to revalue the nobility's political protagonism.y},

Abstract = {The three Indochinese countries' resistance against the French
   colonialists continued from 1946 to 1954 in the international, regional
   and national contexts and was complicated by the impacts of the bipolar
   world order, tenser confrontation of capitalist and socialist forces and
   the outbreak of the Cold War. Despite facing difficulties and hardships
   of the seemingly unbalanced war, three Indochinese countries gradually
   overcame historic tough times and reached the final victory.
   Contributing to this achievement, President Ho Chi Minh's enormous role
   was observable and well-defined in three aspects. He generated and
   completed the guiding thoughts; performed as the supreme leader of
   outstanding capabilities and the pioneering revolutionary soldier on
   major fronts. This article focuses on clarifying Ho Chi Minh's roles in
   defeating the French colonialists (1946-1954) based on the mentioned
   fundamental aspects.},

Title = {Analyzing frenemies: An Arctic repertoire of cooperation and rivalry},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Intensive transnational cooperation and manifestations of the
   NATO-Russia security rivalry have endured for over 30 years in the
   post-Cold War Arctic. Drawing upon the concept of repertoires from the
   social movement literature, this article seeks to make a conceptual
   contribution as to how we might better analyse and articulate the
   simultaneity of these practices and narratives of cooperation and
   rivalry in the circumpolar region. Repertoires are typically defined as
   bundles of semi-structured/semi-improvisational practices making up a
   context-contingent performance (for example, by civil society towards
   the `state'). These repertoires are argued to be created and performed
   in `contentious episodes', rather than structured by long-term trends or
   evidenced in single events. Translated to global politics, a
   repertoires-inspired approach holds promise for privileging an analysis
   of the tools and performance (and audience) of statecraft in
   `contentious episodes' above considerations of how different forms of
   global order or geopolitical narratives structure options for state
   actors. The emphasis on the performance of statecraft in key episodes,
   in turn, allows us to consider whether the interplay between the
   practices of cooperation and rivalry is usefully understood as a
   collective repertoire of statecraft, as opposed to a messy output of
   disparate long-term trends ultimately directing actors in the region
   towards a more cooperative or more competitive form of Arctic regional
   order. The article opens with two key moments in Arctic politics - the
   breakup of the Soviet Union and the 2007 Arctic sea ice low. The strong
   scholarly baseline that these complex moments have garnered illustrates
   how scholars of Arctic regional politics are already employing an
   episodic perspective that can be usefully expanded upon and anchored
   with insights and methods loaned from social movement literature on
   repertoires. The 18-month period following Russia's annexation of Crimea
   is then examined in detail as a `contentious episode' with an attending
   effort to operationalize a repertoires-inspired approach to global
   politics. The article concludes that a repertoire-inspired approach
   facilitates systematic consideration of the mixed practices of amity and
   enmity in circumpolar statecraft over time and comparison to other
   regions, as well as offers one promising answer to the growing interest
   in translating the insights of constructivist scholarship into foreign
   policy strategy.},

Abstract = {Objective The objective of this article is to analyze the reasoning
   underpinning the Supreme Court's rejection of the efficiency gap in Gill
   v. Whitford as a useful measure of partisan fairness in redistricting.
   Methods I undertake this analysis by reviewing prior judicial commentary
   on measures of partisan fairness and debates among political science
   professionals concerning how and whether to use aggregate statewide seat
   and vote totals to assess whether there is bias across legislative
   district elections. Results The analysis reveals that the Supreme
   Court's rejection of the efficiency gap and other statewide measures of
   partisan fairness is based upon thoughtful skepticism of the extent to
   which votes cast under different conditions in different legislative
   districts for choices among discrete slates of candidates can be
   aggregated meaningfully into statewide measures that ignore these
   district-specific conditions. This skepticism is reinforced by debates
   among scholars about how and whether partisan votes can be aggregated in
   this manner. Conclusion The Court's rejection of the efficiency gap and
   skepticism about other aggregate measures of partisan fairness in
   redistricting reinforces the extensive criticism of using the
   single-member district electoral system. It distorts electoral outcomes,
   limits voter choice, and, thereby, renders comparisons of partisan votes
   in different districts quite questionable. A shift to multimember
   districts with some form of proportional representation such as ranked
   choice voting would resolve much of the criticism of and uncertainty in
   redistricting analysis based on the statewide aggregation of discrete
   legislative district election results.},

Abstract = {The authors use the Institutional Collective Action Framework to analyze
   the barriers, opposition, and opportunities for residential
   pharmaceutical disposal programs in the United States via a case study
   on a series of take-back programs pioneered in the state of Washington
   by local and state governments, as well as the corresponding backlash
   from federal agencies. While successful in some ways, these innovative
   solutions directly challenged the competing federal policy regimes
   controlled by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and, to a lesser
   extent, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Findings from case
   studies suggest that functional dilemmas created by existing
   institutions with entrenched regulatory regimes are a key challenge to
   finding efficient solutions to vertical ICA dilemmas. Conclusions, then,
   connect to the broader ICA research agenda, and implications for
   multi-level governance issues.},

Abstract = {It remains unclear if foreign direct investment (FDI) benefits local
   citizens in host countries. Combining georeferenced FDI data and
   household level surveys, this paper uses spatial-temporal techniques to
   assess how FDI impacts individual corruption experiences. We investigate
   if this relationship is conditional on the corruption levels, or
   engagement with the OECD's anti-bribery convention (ABC), of the FDI's
   source country. We find evidence that FDI flows reduce individual
   bribery experiences, but only when existing levels of corruption are
   high. We find it is FDI from comparatively more corrupt, and non-ABC
   engaging, countries that locates to areas of high corruption. Further,
   FDI appears to improve both the employment prospects and financial
   positions of local households. Collectively, we argue that these results
   suggest that individual empowerment via a wealth effect, rather than
   spillovers from firm professionalization or regulatory pressure
   mechanisms, is what stems individual corruption experiences.},

Abstract = {The corporate responsibility to respect human rights was formally
   introduced in 2011 with the unanimous endorsement of the UN Guiding
   Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) by the UN Human Rights
   Council. It is grounded in social expectations and forms part of the
   companies' ``social license to operate.{''} This paper argues that this
   responsibility is progressively turning into a legal duty for lead
   companies to respect human rights in those types of value chains which
   are characterized by a high level of control by a lead company over its
   business partners. Our argument rests on two recent legal developments.
   Firstly, the article analyzes the judicialization of the corporate
   responsibility to respect in the case law on parent company liability in
   various jurisdictions, which, we argue, is highly likely to have some
   implications in relation to certain types of value chains so as to
   trigger the liability of lead companies for the human rights harms
   arising out of the activities of entities over which they exercise
   sufficient control. Secondly, the article delves into the legislative
   developments which increasingly require lead companies to exercise due
   diligence so as to prevent and address adverse human rights impacts in
   their own activities and global value chains.},

Abstract = {Hong Kong's autonomy within China is akin to a house built on sand. This
   article examines how Hong Kong's autonomy has weathered the waves over
   the years by adopting a news events analysis approach, documenting the
   Hong Kong government and the CCP-state's divergence from the autonomy,
   democratization, and human rights provisions of the Sino-British Joint
   Declaration and the Basic Law since 1997. The case study of Hong Kong
   indicates the profound challenge of practicing territorial autonomy
   within a communist state and points to a new research direction for
   conducting comparative autonomies studies across communist and
   post-communist states.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the causes that underlie the mass
   participation in anti-authoritarian protests of Hong Kong in 2019. The
   research draws from the perceived performance approach and social
   learning approach and uses survey data to explain the mass
   participation. Four variables regarding perceived political performance,
   rather than perceived economic performance, are found to exert a causal
   effect on individuals' decisions to participate in mass protests. These
   perceived political performance variables include mass dissatisfaction
   with Hong Kong's lack of democracy and the police's performance. Thus,
   an attempt to stifle the demonstrations by offering merely economic
   incentives will not suffice. In light of the social learning approach,
   the younger and more educated people in Hong Kong are found to be more
   supportive of the protests. The findings highlight the failure of the
   authoritarian government in China to earn the political trust of the
   younger and more educated generation in Hong Kong. This article
   concludes by drawing attention to the dim prospects for Hong Kong's
   political stability and prosperity.},

Abstract = {A number of proposals for reducing tensions with North Korea have
   discussed alterations to the program of joint military exercises (JMEs)
   that South Korea holds. North Korea has also repeatedly called for a
   reduction or secession of JMEs. Would limiting or halting JMEs be a
   useful concession for securing a reduction of tensions on the peninsula?
   We argue that JMEs do not deter North Korea but, instead, provoke
   provocative rhetoric and actions, demonstrating that North Korea views
   JMEs as a serious threat to its security. In this paper, we establish a
   relationship between JMEs and North Korea's actions. In response to a
   JME, North Korea can issue warnings or threats as well as take costly
   signals such as conducting missile or nuclear tests. Using new data on
   JMEs and North Korean behavior, we find that North Korea systematically
   responds with aggression to South Korean JMEs. Moreover, we find that
   the intensity of North Korea's responses to JMEs is driven by the
   severity of the threat particular exercises pose, indicating that North
   Korea responds to JMEs as serious security threats.},

Title = {Peasants' rights and agrarian violence in transitional settings: From
   transitional justice to transformative agrarian justice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-109},

Abstract = {This article addresses why the rights of peasants and agrarian violence
   matter to justice promotion work that seeks to lay the groundwork for
   future peace and stability. Its central contention is that although
   rural people have participated in transitional justice processes, the
   field is yet to engage with peasants as a distinct social group, with
   the social, economic, and political issues they face, and with agrarian
   structures and processes that underlie ongoing violence against them.
   The article argues that peasant rights and agrarian violence matter in
   light of four rural trends: Peasants in post-transition societies are
   routinely exposed to complex patterns of direct and indirect nonwar
   violence; justice interventions may be expected in societies in which
   there have been large-scale agrarian protests; the root causes of
   conflict are frequently located in structures and processes of agrarian
   change; and rural grievances associated with poverty and marginalization
   are facilitating and enabling the rise of authoritarian populism. The
   article reflects on the demands these trends create for research and
   practice, arguing that developing responses to agrarian violence favors
   a radical, more transformative approach to agrarian justice that engages
   with wider agrarian political economies and issues of class and gender.},

Title = {Do Citizens Perceive Elected Politicians, Experts and Citizens as
   Alternative or Complementary Policy-Makers? A Study of Belgian Citizens},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {In the scholarly literature, studies have underlined a link between
   citizens' low levels of support for elected politicians and demands for
   a greater role of other actors such as citizens themselves or
   independent experts in policy-making. Yet, what remains unclear is
   whether such demands to increase the role of these actors are rooted in
   a desire to replace entirely politicians, or whether citizens and
   experts are perceived as complementary to elected politicians. It is
   precisely what we explore in this article. Using data from 2019 Belgian
   Election survey, we conduct a latent profile analysis to see what models
   of governance emerge among citizens. First, we demonstrate that while
   some citizens indeed perceive politicians, citizens and experts as
   separate governing groups, others combine support for multiple actors.
   Building on the typologies that emerge, we conduct two complementary
   analyses. In the second section, we try to analyse how these different
   views regarding who should govern translate into support for specific
   institutional reforms consultative referenda, binding referenda,
   assemblies of citizens and a government of experts. Our results show
   that, in general, citizens tend to favor the mechanisms that empower the
   actors they support, for instance deliberative democracy mechanisms are
   preferred by those who are positive about citizens as policy-makers.
   Finally, in the last section we examine the impact of citizens' personal
   characteristics (age, gender, education, employment) and political
   attitudes (political interest, political knowledge, political trust,
   left-right) on belonging to each of the latent classes identified. We
   determine the main socio-demographic traits and/or political attitudes
   that predict the likelihood of belonging to one of the seven classes.
   For example, we observe that people who delegate decision-making to
   politicians and experts share better socio-economic conditions and have
   higher levels of political interest and political knowledge. We close
   our analysis by explaining the importance of taking into account such
   preferences for a mix of policy-makers (citizens, experts and
   politicians) in broader debates on models of democracy.},

Title = {Is It Interests, Ideas or Institutions? Explaining Elected
   Representatives' Positions Toward Democratic Innovations in 15 European
   Countries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {In response to the alleged legitimacy crisis, representative democracies
   have in recent years witnessed increased demands for democratic
   innovations aimed at giving citizens a more direct say in
   decision-making. Such initiatives, however, often rock the foundations
   of the model of representative democracy which assumes a more indirect
   link between citizens and political decisions, and which puts political
   power more firmly in the hands of elected representatives. In this
   paper, we study how these elected members of parliament (MPs)-who are
   key actors in representative democracy, yet potentially see their role
   reduced in deliberative or participatory models of democracy-think about
   democratic innovations. We study to what extent and why they support two
   common types of democratic innovations, namely referendums and
   deliberative events. While it is generally assumed that MPs' positions
   toward these initiatives are driven by their ideological
   predispositions, we propose and test a comprehensive framework which
   considers the role played by 3 ``I's{''}: ideas, interests and
   institutions. Using original data from the PARTIREP MP survey, this
   paper maps variations in MPs' preferences for democratic innovations
   across 15 European countries, and shows that these variations can be
   explained by differences in MPs' ideological (left/right) views,
   legitimacy perceptions and role conceptions, their strategic position in
   government or opposition, and their electoral incentives. The 3I
   framework predicts MPs' support for both types of innovations, but more
   strongly so for referendums than for deliberative events.},

Abstract = {Most cross-national datasets of civil and political rights practices
   have relied on internationally distributed English language secondary
   sources as the core source of information for their metrics. This
   approach has yielded data that are highly reliable, but also suffer from
   the fact that their information sources under-represent the overall
   level of abuse internationally and do so in a way that is biased across
   countries. The combined knowledge of the individual human rights
   practitioners working to directly monitor the abuses occurring within a
   country would likely serve to overcome much of this biased
   under-reporting, but it is difficult to compare that knowledge across
   country and cultural contexts. In this article, we discuss how we
   overcome these problems in the Human Rights Measurement Initiative
   (HRMI) civil and political rights data. Using an expert survey that
   contains anchoring vignettes in concert with Bayesian scaling
   techniques, we present a new methodology for collecting and aggregating
   data on the intensity and distribution of respect for eight separate
   civil and political rights.},

Pages = {789-800},

Abstract = {How do self-determination groups move toward diplomatic recognition?
   Although recognition is the dominant activity used to understand
   international sovereignty, it is perhaps the most costly decision states
   make towards these groups. Third parties have many substantial
   interactions with aspiring states, building their sovereignty by other
   important means. I argue that our understanding of international
   sovereignty can be improved by conceptualizing it as a dynamic,
   continuous process, reflected in foreign policy decisions short of the
   legal recognition. I create a Bayesian latent variable model of
   international sovereignty, using bilateral data on diplomatic exchange,
   IGO voting, sanctions, military aid, and intervention in separatist
   conflicts. Complementing prior work on international sovereignty, my
   measure provides support for important theoretical expectations
   previously explored using only recognition as a measure of sovereignty.
   I find that diplomatic recognition, extant violence, separatist victory,
   and sour third-party-incumbent relations positively impact latent
   sovereignty of separatists, while concern for precedent negatively
   impacts it.},

Abstract = {Several recent applications of Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET) have
   yielded compelling findings linking institutional design and change
   distributions, yet, much more work needs to be done to understand
   institutional arrangements that make punctuated processes more or less
   likely. In responding to the recent call for more research on unraveling
   particular mechanisms through which bureaucracy moderates the odds of
   policy punctuations, this research explores the potential of
   bureaucratic expertise and professionalism in fostering rational
   decision making, and thus the stability in change dynamics. One
   important feature of urban government receives close attention: the
   position by professionalized, trained bureaucrats in municipalities
   (city manager and chief administrative officer) and the effects of their
   discretion on altering municipal budgetary change distributions.
   Analysis of a novel dataset of fiscal policy changes, charter and census
   information of city governments in the State of Michigan, 2005-11,
   suggests city governments, on average, produce change patterns that
   conform to the expectations of PET; more importantly, it reveals that
   heightened levels of managerial discretion can have a significant
   implication for helping cities experience less abrupt, punctuated budget
   changes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of
   these results for PET, policy change dynamics, and the design of
   city-governing institutions.},

Abstract = {Tax and spending are central to democratic politics in the United
   Kingdom and elsewhere, but psephologists have paid surprisingly little
   attention to the practice of manifesto costings or the ways in which
   fiscal promises shape voting behaviour. This article uses qualitative
   research to trace how British parties have used manifesto costings to
   frame prospective choices for voters since the 1950s and develops a
   theoretical framework for understanding why warnings about `tax
   bombshells' and `black holes' in parties' spending plans seem to be so
   powerful in Britain. The article suggests that the emphasis which
   governments have placed on budgetary constraints since the 1976
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) crisis may help explain the long
   electoral cycles the United Kingdom has experienced in recent decades.
   Whereas retrospective economic evaluations can be difficult for
   governments to control, forward-looking fiscal debates are structurally
   weighed towards incumbent parties and offer a powerful way for
   incumbents to offset the `costs of governing'.},

Abstract = {Research on differentiated integration (DI) in the European Union has
   burgeoned in recent years. However, we still know little about citizens'
   attitudes towards the phenomenon. In this article, we argue that at the
   level of individual citizens, liberal economic values increase support
   for DI. Stronger preferences for equality, in contrast, make opposition
   to the concept more likely. Similarly, concerns about discriminatory
   differentiation at the member state level lead citizens to oppose DI. We
   test the theoretical claims by analysing survey data on citizens'
   attitudes towards a `multi-speed Europe'. Supporters of DI, indeed, are
   marked by liberal economic attitudes. In contrast to general EU support,
   we do not find robust correlations with socio-demographic variables.
   Moreover, the data reveal striking differences amongst macro-regions:
   support for DI has become much lower in Southern European states. We
   attribute this opposition to negative repercussions of the Eurozone
   crisis.},

Abstract = {Can inclusive institutions tame the threat of domestic terrorism? In a
   series of recent publications, the political scientists Arend Lijphart
   and Matt Qvortrup claim that consensus democracies are not only kinder
   and gentler, but also safer: consensus democracies are less likely to
   experience deadly domestic terrorism and when they do, they suffer fewer
   fatalities than majoritarian democracies. This article reexamines the
   logic and the evidence. It argues that the underlying grievance theory
   of terrorism contains important gaps and that the statistical results
   are based on a problematic coding of cases and lack robustness. Lijphart
   and Qvortrup have opened up an important new line of inquiry, but their
   results do not withstand scrutiny.},

Abstract = {This study investigates child soldier recruitment strategies of the
   Islamic State group (Da'esh). It argues that while the dominant
   caretaker and free-ranger approaches to child soldier recruitment make
   useful contributions to understanding Da'esh's strategy, a
   self-perception-based approach to examining children's agency and
   association with Da'esh sheds new light on how the organization was able
   to systematically militarize and recruit children within occupied
   territory. Da'esh used social and/or political pressures to inform
   children's self-perception of agency, while also aligning these
   self-perceptions with the group's interests. Further examination of
   these pressures, children's reactions to them, and how they inform
   children's self-perceptions of agency is essential in understanding how
   and why children are recruited by Da'esh and how children justified
   violence within this context.},

Abstract = {Income inequality and house prices have risen sharply in developed
   countries during 1975-2010. In line with theoretical models, we argue
   that this co-movement is no coincidence, but that inequality has driven
   up house prices on the grounds that it raises the aggregate demand for
   housing. Our results suggest that absolute inequality and house prices
   in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
   countries were positively correlated and cointegrated, whereas relative
   inequality and mean income were not significant long-run determinants.
   This finding indicates that the surge in OECD house prices in part can
   be explained by a top-income-induced increase in housing demand, and
   that it is important to consider the interaction of rising mean income
   and its relative distribution when studying potential correlates of
   house prices. Moreover, our results confirm previous findings that the
   short-term real interest rate also is an important correlate of house
   prices.},

Abstract = {Democratic innovations, such as the introduction of deliberative
   mini-publics, have attracted increasing attention. The assumption is
   that involving citizens more directly in policymaking offers a way to
   address the widespread decline in public trust in the democratic process
   and traditional forms of engagement, such as voting in elections. While
   a thriving literature discusses the merits of mini-publics from a
   citizen perspective, scholars have neglected the views of policymakers.
   To fill the gap, we draw on two recent surveys conducted in Finland to
   examine citizens' and policymakers' attitudes to mini-publics. The data
   show that citizens report high levels of trust in the capacity of a
   deliberative citizen body to produce meaningful policies. However,
   policymakers are more sceptical about their value. This finding is
   important because it may well have implications for the willingness of
   policymakers to create mini-publics and take their recommendations into
   account.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4},
Pages = {557-600},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article explores the causes of authoritarian durability. Why do
   some authoritarian regimes survive for decades, often despite severe
   crises, while others collapse quickly, even absent significant
   challenges? Based on an analysis of all authoritarian regimes between
   1900 and 2015, the authors argue that regimes founded in violent social
   revolution are especially durable. Revolutionary regimes, such as those
   in Russia, China, Cuba, and Vietnam, endured for more than half a
   century in the face of strong external pressure, poor economic
   performance, and large-scale policy failures. The authors develop and
   test a theory that accounts for such durability using a novel data set
   of revolutionary regimes since 1900. The authors contend that
   autocracies that emerge out of violent social revolution tend to
   confront extraordinary military threats, which lead to the development
   of cohesive ruling parties and powerful and loyal security apparatuses,
   as well as to the destruction of alternative power centers. These
   characteristics account for revolutionary regimes' unusual longevity.},

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated how policy changes are bound to fail without
   the support of frontline employees. This study examines how performance
   information influences frontline employees' support for managerial
   policy initiatives. We develop hypotheses stating that the exposure to
   positive and negative organizational performance scores compared to
   average scores increases frontline employees' support for managerial
   policy initiatives and thus facilitate policy change. To test our
   hypotheses, we conduct a survey experiment on more than 1,500 social
   caseworkers working in Danish employment agencies. The results show that
   while the provision of positive organizational scores increases
   caseworkers' support for managerial policy initiatives, there is no
   direct effect following the exposure of negative performance scores.
   However, additional exploratory analysis reveals that the caseworkers'
   experienced work pressure moderates the effect of positive and negative
   performance information. Specifically, caseworkers that experience a
   high work pressure are more inclined to support managerial policy
   initiatives following positive and negative performance scores.
   Furthermore, the explorative analysis indicates that the caseworkers
   tend to ignore negative performance information, which strongly suggests
   that poor performance scores trigger identity-protective cognition.
   Overall, the study advances our understanding of the link between
   performance information and support of policy changes on the frontline
   of public services by showing how different performance scores influence
   employees' support for managerial policy initiatives.},

Abstract = {Municipalities play a significant role in the field of social care
   services. The basic social services are primarily provided by local
   governments. The Hungarian municipalities have strong social powers and
   duties, but their role is in a permanent transformation. The strongly
   decentralised system established in the early 1990s has since been
   centralised and the majority of specialised social services has been
   nationalised in the last decade. This has resulted in a new model; a
   mixed system having evolved after 2013. The provision of the specialised
   services has been mainly centralised, while the basic services have
   remained the responsibility of the municipal bodies. In this article,
   the impacts of this reform are analysed. The centralisation of the
   specialised services and the reforms of the financial support of
   municipal basic social services significantly transformed the former
   accessibility. The accessibility to these services depends on several
   factors: it depends on the central regulation of the entitlement rules,
   of the central funding of the municipal tasks and partly that of the
   economic power of the municipality. The central regulation and the
   central support of these services play a very important role in this
   system.},

Title = {When Victimhood Goes to War? Israel and Victim Claims},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-126},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prominent sociopsychological approaches interpret collective victimhood
   as inseparable, central characteristic of societies involved in
   intractable conflicts. Victimhood is broadly perceived as an essential
   conflict-supportive belief also in other disciplines. In the context of
   Israel, there is a cross-disciplinary consensus that collective
   victimhood is the country's foundational identity. This project argues
   that states' employment of this theme changes and is context dependent.
   It discusses under what conditions Israel's political elites incorporate
   victim narratives towards armed conflicts. It examines public
   communication during the 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense (OPD) and the
   Yom Kippur war of 1973 (YKW). Employing a modified method of narrative
   conceptualization analysis, the research demonstrates that victim
   narratives were used almost twice as much during OPD than during YKW.
   The findings suggest that we need to differentiate between the role
   these narratives play for collectives versus states. For the latter, the
   presence of victim narratives is highly variable and reflects strategic
   developments. The project is the first systematic study exposing that
   victim narratives can be a challenge for governance. By conceptualizing
   victim narratives as claims, it captures the dynamic, contextual
   characteristics of collective victimhood in state affairs offering a
   theoretical tool for understanding the political dimension of this
   identification.},

Abstract = {Most legislation neither affects nor interests citizens equally. But
   should this variation in interest and affectedness impact who gets to
   influence policy reforms? This article examines US public opinion on
   this issue using a national survey experiment varying both the policy
   outcome (a bill's passage/failure) and the type of constituency input
   granted by elected representatives (none/constituency surveys/targeting
   interested constituents/targeting affected constituents). It then
   compares reactions across treatment groups, examining the impact of
   outcome favourability as well as external and internal political
   efficacy. Results suggest that granting constituents explicit policy
   influence consistently affected perceived responsiveness in the expected
   manner, but that the different consultation procedures had more varied
   effects on decision acceptance. Furthermore, where the procedures
   impacted decision acceptance, they pushed the reactions of both the
   pleased and the displeased towards more muted responses. Finally,
   similar `cushion effects' were present when external and internal
   political efficacy were incorporated into the analysis.},

Abstract = {A key issue in analyzing how armed conflict shapes postwar politics
   pertains to the question of how rebel groups frame their wartime
   ``combatant identity{''} in the context of their postwar political
   activism. As armed-political organizations active in the midst of
   conflict, rebel groups' identities often encompass a ``combatant
   identity{''} and and what Canetti et al. have described as an ``ethos of
   conflict,{''} centered on the legitimacy of the use of force, the
   rightfulness of the rebels' goals and the defensive nature of their
   struggle, along with a narrative of victimization and patriotism. How
   does this identity crystallized in wartime shape political behavior in
   the aftermath of hostilities or after a political settlement has been
   reached? How is this combatant identity embedded, reframed and adapted
   to fit into a broader postwar political narrative? The article explores
   this question by analyzing the case of Hezbollah's political and
   militant identity in the aftermath of the Lebanese civil war; underlying
   the group's political, military and social orientation and
   contextualizing it as operating in a liminal, no-war, no-peace context
   defined by both the end of the internal civil war and the continuation
   of the open conflict with Israel. Hezbollah offers an interesting case
   to examine the resilience of the combatant framework during and in the
   aftermath of conflict. The article traces the evolution of Hezbollah's
   combatant identity from the Lebanese civil war, through its
   post-agreement political transition, until the group's involvement in
   the Syrian conflict. In doing so, it underlines how the group's
   combatant identity remained resilient while also being fungible,
   allowing Hezbollah to preserve core ideological beliefs while shifting
   its discourse based on political expediency.},

Abstract = {In 2017, scholar Joseph Nye postulated that a rising China that failed
   to deliver global public goods could result in a `Kindleberger Trap',
   failing, like the then rising United States about a century ago, to
   supply global public goods at a time of need. Chinese leader Xi Jinping
   has made expanding China's role in global public goods provision a
   hallmark of his foreign policy. This study assesses Xi-led China's
   commitment to supplying global public goods using guideposts from
   historical examples of countries that made the shift from consumers to
   suppliers of global public goods. It finds that China seeks to enlarge
   its role in providing global public goods. However, Beijing is supplying
   those global public goods that it sees as maximising its interests,
   while simultaneously reshaping existing or constructing new modalities
   for their delivery. This behaviour, associated with systemic
   challengers, weakens confidence in China's role as a stabiliser in
   future global crises.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Think Tanks in Central
   and Eastern Europe{''}, guest-edited by Katarzyna Jezierska and Serena
   Giusti. This article explores the image and reputation of think tanks in
   their reciprocal relationship with their environment. The aim is to
   unravel the logic of think tanks' institutional identity formation in
   the largely understudied context of Poland. How do Polish think tanks
   present themselves and how are they (re)presented by others? To answer
   these questions, the Goffmanian microsociological framework and
   positioning theory are adjusted to a study of institutions. The analysis
   of original interview and media data reveals that Polish think tanks
   project an image of and are perceived by the media as being weak. I
   argue that this image and reputation of weakness should primarily be
   explained by think tanks' and the media's perceptions of the political
   field, which confine the possible identity and positioning of think
   tanks.},

Abstract = {In this article, we employ theoretical tools of social psychology to
   develop a framework to understand how ideas about children, girls, and
   child soldiers are constructed and reinforced in the field of
   International Relations. We show how specific ideas of girls, children
   and child soldiers as victims are constructed in the United Nation's
   Agenda on Children and Armed Conflicts between 1999 and 2019, and how
   these contrast with alternative reports and narratives of girl soldiers'
   experiences in Colombia. Although there is a growing literature on girl
   soldiers, we conclude that girl soldiers continue to be a triply
   silenced group in international policy-making inside the categories of
   children, girl, and child soldier, particularly in Colombia.},

Abstract = {The article seeks to explain why the restructuring of the Ukrainian
   public administration - a key element in democracy promotion - has been
   patchy, in spite of EU's substantial investment in the reform process.
   On the basis of analyzing EU and Ukrainian documents as well as
   process-tracing and interviews with stakeholders, the paper highlights
   limitations of explaining the outcome of Ukrainian civil service reform
   exclusively through functional cooperation, structural factors or civil
   society mobilization. Drafting and passing new public administration
   legislation was impossible without civil society mobilization;
   high-level intergovernmental pressure or functional cooperation would
   not have been able to achieve this on their own. Subsequent challenges
   with the implementation process show that the active involvement of
   civil society does not automatically lead to effective reform.
   Ultimately, it is the collaboration - often across informal channels -
   between high-level diplomats and state-representatives, actors involved
   in functional cooperation and civil society activists that makes reform
   possible.},

Abstract = {Using data on World Bank staff identity and field placement, this
   article examines the relationship between staff presence in recipient
   countries and aid project performance. I find that merely placing World
   Bank staff in developing countries has little effect on the success of
   development projects. Greater field decision rights are, however,
   associated with differential project performance. In the most fragile
   states, the presence of senior personnel (World Bank Country Directors)
   is associated with greater project success after the ``Strategic
   Compact{''} increased Country Directors' power. However-consistent with
   a bargaining model in which greater World Bank authority is in tension
   with recipient country direction of projects-as countries become less
   fragile, the net effect of the presence of Country Directors becomes
   negative. The impact of World Bank staff decentralization is mixed and
   appears to be driven primarily by the power of senior personnel in the
   field, not the ability of field staff to gather local information.},

Abstract = {The answer to the question whether opposition to the European
   integration process is an example of backlash politics is an ambiguous
   one. While the Euroscepticism from the radical right qualifies for
   backlash politics, the Euroscepticism from the radical left does not at
   first sight, although it also shows some traces of this kind of
   politics. Both the radical left and the radical right mobilise political
   discontent and are part of a `populist backlash', but it is only the
   `nationalistic backlash' against European integration of the radical
   right which qualifies as a politics with a retrograde objective. The
   argument is illustrated by the case of Brexit, the British version of
   the `nationalistic backlash'.},

Abstract = {In 2014 and then again in 2015-16 in Jerusalem, some Palestinians
   attacked Israelis and others, including through stabbings and vehicular
   attacks. A case study of Israeli rule of Palestinians in Jerusalem
   highlights the causal role of horizontal inequality or inter-group
   disparities in cultural, economic, political, and social realms.
   Palestinians are shortchanged in each realm, and this helps fuel the
   violence in the city. The case also adds further nuance to some of the
   supporting arguments put forward by scholars in the horizontal
   inequality tradition. Miodownik \& Nir's focus on perceptions suggests
   the possibility of a gap between reality and perceptions, but in East
   Jerusalem, Israeli policy and Palestinian perceptions appear in synch.
   The spontaneous grassroots violence with only limited organizational
   support contrasts with other cases where violence was the result of the
   interaction between elites influenced by political inequality and masses
   motivated by economic inequality. Lastly, Stewart's policy
   recommendation of more aid to reduce economic inequality assumes that
   the rulers will provide more aid or allow others to do so. In East
   Jerusalem, Israel has not provided sufficient resources but also has
   blocked the most likely substitute, the Palestinian Authority, from
   freely operating in East Jerusalem.},

Abstract = {Terrorist attacks often lead to public backlashes. Following the attacks
   on July 22, 2011 in Norway, Norwegians showed support for democratic
   values such as ``openness,{''} ``democracy,{''} and ``tolerance{''} in
   the public debate and in the commemorations across the country. They
   also reported higher out-group trust. This paper explores two possible
   reasons for this increase in trust using a unique panel fielded before
   and right after the attacks. The first is that cognitive dissonance led
   people to dissociate from the terrorist and his ideology. The second is
   that the increase in trust was a response to the public backlash after
   the attacks. The increase in trust was not caused by cognitive
   dissonance. Rather, people who were already positive towards
   immigration, or who saw positive effects of the attacks, became more
   trusting than others did, and Progress Party supporters increased their
   trust less than others. These findings are interpreted as a response to
   the attacks and the political characteristics of the backlash. The study
   concludes by discussing implications for our understanding of the
   different consequences of attacks for the terrorists' imagined
   constituencies and for the broader public.},

Abstract = {Are lesbian, gay and bisexual voters in Western Europe europhile
   globalists or eurosceptic nativists? The recently established `sexuality
   gap' between lavender voters and heterosexuals in Western Europe shows
   that LGBs are more likely to support left-leaning parties and identify
   ideologically with the left than their heterosexual peers. We know very
   little, however, about how this gap plays out in the multidimensional
   space in Europe where cultural concerns like immigration and EU
   integration are increasingly important. In this paper, I use cumulative
   data from the European Social Survey to investigate the impact of LGB
   status on support for EU integration and immigration. The results show,
   in line with theoretical expectations regarding the socializing effect
   of the LGB experience in encouraging support for social liberalism, that
   lavender voters in Western Europe are significantly more
   pro-integrationist and pro-immigration than comparable heterosexuals.},

Abstract = {In recent years and decades, authoritarian regimes and illiberal
   democracies have passed and enforced punitive memory laws, intending to
   ban certain interpretations of past events or sheltering official
   versions of history against challenges. This comes with no surprise in
   countries whose governments undermine pluralism and assume the existence
   of a historical truth that is stable over time, invariable, and
   self-explanatory. But why do liberal democracies, committed to political
   pluralism and open debate, pass laws that penalize challenges to certain
   interpretations of the past and restrict freedom of speech? This article
   argues that liberal democracies may do so yielding to bottom-up pressure
   by courts and to regulate civil law disputes for which existing
   legislation and jurisprudence may not suffice. Based on case studies
   from Germany, France, Switzerland, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey,
   Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, we also found punitive memory laws in
   liberal democracies narrower and more precise than in nonliberal states.},

Abstract = {Social assistance is increasingly promoted as a means of tackling
   poverty. However, in established democracies stable delivery has often
   proved difficult because of tensions between national and local
   government, the former desiring comprehensiveness and uniformity, the
   latter requiring flexibility to meet local needs. These issues are
   explored in the context of China andDibao, the world's largest social
   assistance system, with three questions posed: Do similar tensions exist
   in China as in the Western world? How are they resolved and what is the
   nature of the political compromise? How do recipients fare? Policy
   analysis in a village in south-central China reveals similar tensions. A
   regime in which local government employed discretion to prioritize
   social stability over poverty alleviation has been replaced by an
   inherently unstable system based on surveillance of officials and local
   cadres who now prioritize their personal security over the needs of
   applicants.},

Abstract = {Why are some tramlines, as human-made common pool resources, sustained
   while others are not, even under a similar polycentric governance
   structure? Do the institutional design principles of the Institutional
   Analysis and Development (IAD) framework explain these different
   outcomes? The National Tramline Program is a national rural
   infrastructure development project started in 2009 by the research
   institute of the Department of Agriculture in the Philippines. Using
   originally collected survey data and employing mixed methods, we examine
   the determinants of the operational status of tramlines by comparing
   successful and failed cases. Building upon the IAD framework and
   polycentric governance for common pool resource management, we
   demonstrate that in addition to the farmers' commitment to collective
   actions, the institutional characteristics of micro-institutions,
   namely, the democratic selection of a leader for the farmers'
   associations, are key to sustaining tramlines. Furthermore, case studies
   of both success and failure illustrate that the active involvement of
   municipal local governments and the presence of coordination among
   related agencies at various levels are essential for maintaining
   tramlines as human-made common pool resources.},

Abstract = {In the Republic of Moldova struggles for independence and over national
   identity in the late 1980s and the early 1990s resulted in two conflicts
   with the Gagauz minority and separatists in the region of Transnistria.
   In this paper we compare and contextualize the settlement processes and
   pay specific attention to Chisinau's perceptions of the two conflicts.
   Our analysis highlights how Gagauz autonomy and Transnistrian separatism
   are situated in the complex relationship between geopolitics and
   domestic identity politics that reproduces cleavages among Moldova's
   political stakeholders. This is a major obstacle to a coherent position
   of Chisinau and the implementation of autonomy arrangements in both

Abstract = {Incessant food safety scandals in China have given rise to a loss of
   public trust in food safety, stimulating a series of studies focussing
   on food safety governance, accountability, and trust restoration.
   Against this backdrop, Chinese scholars are keen to reflect on different
   strategies for ensuring food safety public accountability and
   credibility, presenting different perspectives on issues like
   responsibility, trust, risk communication, and transparency. In this
   paper, we aim to get more in-depth insight into how Chinese scholarly
   debates co-construct public accountability for food safety as a public
   issue. We selected 51 articles from 10,790 candidates drawn from four
   Chinese academic databases for content analysis. Drawing from political
   theories on public accountability as well as science and technology
   studies, the analysis shows that arguments for a specific public
   accountability model (more or less centralised, more or less stakeholder
   participation) are intertwined with the specific role of scientific
   expertise (more or less authoritative, more or less democratising). As
   such, the analysis shows how scholarly debates on public accountability
   for food safety in China co-construct a public forum for discussing
   supervision and accountability, risk assessment, and transparency.},

Abstract = {This paper advances a synthesized theory that ethnic party institutional
   preference for clientelistic exchanges is a causal determinant in weaker
   programmatic connections. I use an elite focused mixed-method approach
   with a quantitative survey of over 506 separate political parties along
   with an inductive case study of SWAPO in Namibia. The data show that
   ethnic party endogeneity to clientelism is a causal factor in the
   general underdevelopment of ethnic programmatic linkages.},

Abstract = {This article argues that since the Meiji Restoration, the degree of
   Japan's misplacement has changed, depending on its structural power and
   ability to shape the concept of `Asia' as a region. More specifically,
   there are three historical turning points: first, from the Meiji
   Restoration to the Pacific War (hard misplacement); second, post-World
   War II to the end of the Cold War (soft misplacement); and third,
   post-Cold War to the present (relative well-placement). In each period,
   Japan was faced with a different concept of `Asia' and attempted to
   modify its identity and roles accordingly. The degree of `misplacement'
   is thus not static, but elastic, and such a status is not a permanent
   attribute of the state. Changes occur when states undertake a role
   location process, particularly during or after a change in the regional
   environment.},

Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {This article describes the efforts made by the Israeli government to
   contain the spread of COVID-19, which were implemented amidst a
   constitutional crisis and a yearlong electoral impasse, under the
   leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was awaiting a
   trial for charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. It thereafter
   draws on the disproportionate policy perspective to ascertain the ideas
   and sensitivities that placed key policy responses on trajectories which
   prioritized differential policy responses over general, nation-wide
   solutions (and vice versa), even though data in the public domain
   supported the selection of opposing policy solutions on epidemiological
   or social welfare grounds. The article also gauges the consequences and
   implications of the policy choices made in the fight against COVID-19
   for the disproportionate policy perspective. It argues that Prime
   Minister Netanyahu employed disproportionate policy responses both at
   the rhetorical level and on the ground in the fight against COVID-19;
   that during the crisis, Netanyahu enjoyed wide political leeway to
   employ disproportionate policy responses, and the general public
   exhibited a willingness to tolerate this; and (iii) that ascertaining
   the occurrence of disproportionate policy responses is not solely a
   matter of perception.},

Abstract = {Sweden's strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic stands out
   internationally as more liberal in terms of not ordering a complete
   lockdown of society. Sweden kept its primary schools, daycare centers
   and industries largely open. The government financially supported
   furloughed workers and increased its support to regional and local
   governments delivering healthcare and elderly care. However, the death
   toll in Sweden which passed 4000 by late May 2020 stands in stark
   contrast to those of other, comparable countries, raising questions
   about the design of the strategy, and its appropriateness. The paper
   argues that key assumptions sustaining the strategy, for instance that
   symptom-free people do not carry, and cannot transmit the Coronavirus,
   or that local and regional government staff had the necessary training
   and equipment to tackle the pandemic, along with problems associated
   with coordinating a decentralized healthcare system, may explain the
   poor performance of the Swedish containment strategy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the dynamic and challenges of cross-border trade
   between Mexico and Guatemala. If offers a diagnosis of the dynamic of
   trade and investments between the two countries and sets out specific
   recommendations to promote the development of the border region through
   productive investment and trade. The elimination of tariffs on bilateral
   trade in the context of the free trade agreement has not proved
   sufficient to bring this about due to regulatory, bureaucratic and
   administrative barriers, together with institutional and infrastructural
   weaknesses. To optimize trade and investment between the two countries,
   national and state governments should prioritize the bilateral
   relationship in their foreign policy agendas, using economic, political
   and human resources.},

Abstract = {Web defacement is a form of hacking that involves altering the content
   of a website, resulting in repairs to the website code, loss of revenue,
   internal loss of productivity, and reputational damage. Limited research
   has examined the frequency of web defacements, the factors that
   distinguish them from other hacking motives, and the extent to which the
   correlates mirror research on physical acts of ideologically-motivated
   crime. The current study examined over 2.4 million web defacements
   hosted in the U.S. from 2012 to 2016 to assess aspects of routine
   activities theory associated with target selection and attack methods
   among ideologically-motivated defacements. A binary logistic regression
   analysis revealed that ideologically-motivated defacers were more likely
   to use unknown vulnerabilities; engage in repeated attacks; target
   top-level domains linked to foreign nations; domains ending in.edu; and
   homepages within websites. The findings of this study suggest that the
   target selection process of ideologically-motivated defacers are more
   purposive and designed to draw attention to their cause, resembling
   target preferences of individuals who engage in physical violence in
   support of an ideological agenda.},

Abstract = {With reference to the heads of departments of moral education (HDMEs) in
   Shanghai's junior secondary schools, this paper explores middle leaders'
   logics for leading school-organized extracurricular activities (SEAs).
   This qualitative study, guided by Woulfin's lived logic framework, found
   that the interviewed HDMEs actively reinterpreted the institutional
   logics with three logics-expressive, instrumental, and hierarchical-by
   manipulating policy circulation, responding to the performative
   accountability and micropolitics in the hierarchy, and using correlative
   thinking. The lived logics of leading SEAs reveal that, as heads of a
   marginalized department in schools, the HDMEs struggled to seek
   visibility by using correlative thinking, promoting the importance of
   their work, and aligning with more helpful senior leaders. The study
   responds to theories on school middle leadership and implementation
   logic. It could deepen our understanding of the paradoxes in China's
   development and governance, especially in areas concerning both
   measurable performance and unmeasurable issues (e.g. ideology and
   sustainable development).},

Title = {The Influence of Identity Salience on Framing Effectiveness: An
   Experiment},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {1133-1150},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Efforts to influence attitudes on highly polarizing issues, such as
   climate change, often fail because individuals interpret political
   messages through the lens of their partisan identities. However,
   shifting the identity lens through which an individual interprets a
   message may result in more effective political communication. Through a
   preregistered survey experiment (n = 978), this study tested how priming
   either a partisan or a nonpartisan (parental) identity influenced the
   effectiveness of a climate change frame on several attitudinal outcomes.
   Findings suggest that identity salience-specifically partisan identity
   salience-can influence the effectiveness of a frame. Among Republican
   parents, receiving a message about the impact of climate change on
   future generations increased climate change concern and intended
   proclimate political behaviors, but this framing effect disappeared when
   a partisan identity was first primed. Among Democrat parents, framing
   had no significant effect until a partisan identity was first primed.
   The findings offer important insight into the role that identity
   salience plays in framing effectiveness and suggest that political
   communication on polarized issues is likely to be more effective at
   building bipartisan agreement when nonpartisan identities are salient.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Canadian federalism, with its complex mix of
   competencies, and the country's punctuated gradualism policy style
   interface with urgent, complex decision-making like the COVID-19
   pandemic. We find that while punctuated gradualism favors tailored
   responses to pandemic management it is weaker when coordination and
   resourcing are to be undertaken during non-crisis situations and that,
   while the level of cooperation among Canadian jurisdictions has
   progressively increased over the years, policy is still almost
   exclusively handled at the federal, provincial and territorial levels.
   Furthermore, the model appears to have critical `blind spots' in terms
   of vulnerable communities that do not emerge as such until after a
   crisis hits.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how, in Poland, the populist political orientation
   of the ruling party (Law and Justice-PiS) has coloured the historical
   discourse of the government and has affected, in turn, its foreign
   policy and diplomatic relations. We argue that the historical discourse
   of the PiS government is a reflection of the party's reliance on
   populism as a political mode of articulation in that it seeks to promote
   a Manichean, dichotomic and totalizing re-definition of the categories
   of victim, hero and perpetrator-and of Poland's roles in this trinity.
   The article details the direct and indirect repercussions of PiS
   populist-inspired historical posture on Poland's foreign policy by
   analysing its policies towards-and relations with-Ukraine and Germany.
   As such, the article sheds light on the under-explored links between
   populism and historical memory and makes a contribution to the nascent
   scholarship on the foreign policy of populist governments.},

   Theory},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Some view China as a deviant case to the modernization theory. This view
   is based on two observations. First, the Chinese middle class shows no
   distinct democratic orientations. Second, one's trust in the Chinese
   Communist Party regime rises as he or she gets financially better off.
   However, the modernization theory by its nature is a societal-level
   theory, and it has not yet been tested at the societal level in China.
   This study undertakes this task by examining the relationship between a
   province's economic development and its political trust in the central
   government and its tolerance of public criticism of the government. The
   two provincial-level variables are estimated by Multilevel Regression
   and Poststratification using data from China Survey 2008, CGSS 2010,
   2012, 2013, and the 2010 National Census. The results, which are
   corroborated by county-level Multilevel Regression and
   Poststratification, strongly support the modernization theory.},

Title = {Welfare experiments as tools for evidence-based policy making? The
   political debate on Twitter about the basic income trial in Finland},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Considered scientific and objective tools, welfare experiments have
   become increasingly attractive for testing innovative policy reforms.
   The basic income especially has been a popular policy experiment,
   trialed in several communities. However, do policymakers use welfare
   experiments as a policy instrument to gain empirical evidence for
   contested policy ideas? What can the political debate on Twitter reveal
   about the strategic functions of welfare experiments? Using a unique
   dataset of Finnish MPs' Twitter tweets on the basic income trial in
   Finland from 2017 to 2018, this article finds that Members of Parliament
   (MPs) neither waited for new empirical findings nor argued in a
   constantly coherent way. In contrast, while waiting for the evaluation,
   the tweets of the MPs became increasingly negative, even though no
   further empirical knowledge was available. The quantitative empirical
   analysis concludes that the reference to core welfare paradigms was
   essential to the legitimisation of basic income, although framing
   between political parties differed. In summary, this article contributes
   to a better understanding of the strategic function of welfare
   experiments and demonstrates the usefulness of Twitter data for social
   policy analysis that goes beyond hashtag-based, big data-driven
   research.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to analyze and characterize the influence of
   the Russian Federation on the security of Moldova through cooperation
   with the nonrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR). My
   research hypothesis is that the Russian Federation, through its
   multifaceted (time-varying) support to Transnistria, strengthens its
   pro-Russian character, thus making it an effective instrument for
   influencing Moldova's security. The research used methods characteristic
   for qualitative research, such as analysis and interpretation of
   documents of the Republic of Moldova and statements of leading Moldovan
   and Transnistrian politicians. The results of the research indicate that
   the Russian Federation's support of Transnistria with military and
   nonmilitary means in order to exert pressure on Moldova. The para-state
   is a convenient tool for influencing the shape of security policy
   created by Moldovan decision makers in order to undermine Moldova's
   aspirations to participate in Euro-Atlantic structures, for example, the
   European Union, and maintain it as part of Russia's traditional sphere
   of influence. The measures taken by the Russian side reduce Moldova's
   security, while posing a challenge to maintaining regional security in
   the long term.},

Abstract = {In 1989, the Member States of the European Union integrated their TV
   markets together in order to create a larger and more open `single TV
   market' through the Television without Frontiers Directive. The French
   film industry used this opportunity to extract additional revenues by
   implementing TV quotas and strengthening thechronologie des medias. This
   paper examines the impact of these two measures on the French film and
   TV industries and shows how they were incoherent. In contrast to the
   expectations of the French film industry, these measures have induced it
   to produce less attractive films and burdened the TV industry with
   increased regulatory costs. While the government poured massive
   subsidies into the filmmaking sector, this endeavor has not been able to
   significantly improve the attractiveness of French films. In this
   regard, the Korean film industry offers valuable lessons. Since the late
   1990s, the Korean government has significantly reduced its level of
   protectionism and scaled back its intervention in the industry.
   Crucially, business has been the main engine to produce attractive films
   that can compete with Hollywood films in the open market. For the French
   film industry, the findings in this paper suggest which direction
   itsGrandes Man oe uvresshould pursue.},

Abstract = {Whether and how Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) can and should
   be regulated is intensely debated among governments, scholars, and
   campaigning activists. This article argues that the strategy of the
   Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to obtain a legally binding instrument to
   regulate LAWS within the framework of the United Nations Convention on
   Certain Conventional Weapons is not likely to be effective, as it is
   modeled after previous humanitarian disarmament successes and not
   tailored to the specifics of the issue. This assessment is based on a
   systematic comparison of the autonomous weapons case with the cases of
   blinding laser weapons and anti-personnel landmines that makes use of an
   analytical framework consisting of issue-related, actor-related, and
   institution-related campaign strategy components. Considering the
   differences between these three cases, the authors recommend that the
   LAWS campaign strategy be adjusted in terms of institutional choices,
   substance, and regulatory design.},

Abstract = {This study argues that institutionalized authoritarian states, those
   with established political parties and legislatures, tend to pursue a
   two-pronged strategy concerning labor rights: they severely restrict
   collective labor rights but moderately protect substantive labor rights
   at the same time. This argument leads to an expectation of a decoupling
   between collective labor rights protection and substantive labor rights
   protection in institutionalized autocracies, or a strategic bifurcation.
   Using a novel global panel data on labor rights, it finds that (1)
   institutionalized authoritarianism does not protect collective labor
   rights better than noninstitutionalized authoritarianisms, (2)
   institutionalized authoritarianism protects substantive labor rights
   more than noninstitutionalized authoritarianisms, and (3) better
   protection of collective labor rights has no impact on the protection of
   substantive labor rights under institutionalized authoritarianism. The
   findings remain largely robust to alternative estimators, measures,
   reduced samples, and model specifications.},

Abstract = {In this article, we utilize the Collaborative Governance Databank to
   empirically explore core theoretical assumptions about collaborative
   governance in the context of crisis management. By selecting a subset of
   cases involving episodes or situations characterized by the combination
   of urgency, threat, and uncertainty, we conduct a plausibility probe to
   garner insights into a number of central assumptions and dynamics
   fundamental to understanding collaborative crisis management. Although
   there is broad agreement among academics and practitioners that
   collaboration is essential for managing complex risks and events that no
   single actor can handle alone, in the literature, there are several
   unresolved claims and uncertainties regarding many critical aspects of
   collaborative crisis management. Assumptions investigated in the article
   relate to starting-points and triggers for collaboration, level of
   collaboration, goal-formulation, adaptation, involvement and role of
   non-state actors, and the prevalence and impact of political infighting.
   The results confirm that crises represent rapidly moving and dynamic
   events that raise the need for adaptation, adjustment, and innovation by
   diverse sets of participants. We also find examples of successful
   behaviours where actors managed, despite challenging conditions, to
   effectively contain conflict, formulate and achieve shared goals, adapt
   to rapidly changing situations and emergent structures, and innovate in
   response to unforeseen problems.},

Abstract = {Have New Public Management (NPM) reforms in public organizations
   improved the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of
   public policies? NPM reforms, understood as a style of organizing public
   services towards the efficiency and efficacy of outputs, have been
   controversial. They have been accused of importing practices and norms
   from the private sector that could collide with core public values, such
   as impartiality or equity. Yet, with few exceptions, we lack systematic
   empirical tests of the actual effects that NPM reforms have had on the
   delivery of public services. In this introductory article, we summarize
   a special issue devoted to cover this gap. And, overall, we find that
   neither the catastrophic nor the balsamic effects of NPM reforms are
   confirmed, but the success (or failure) depends on the administrative,
   political and policy context those reforms take place.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate variability and change on security are debated.
   While this topic has received considerable attention in both policy
   circles and academia, the microlevel pathways and conditions under which
   climatic shocks increase conflict risks are poorly understood. We
   suggest that household resilience provides one key to understanding
   these relationships. Using novel household survey data from two
   conflict-affected regions in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo,
   we study variation in the support for violence related to reported
   exposure to drought and resilience metrics. Using comprehensive
   multifaceted objective and subjective indicators of resilience, we find
   that less resilient respondents who report having experienced drought
   and associated losses are more likely to be supportive of the use of
   political violence. In contrast, our findings suggest that there is no
   general association between reporting drought exposure and support for
   violence.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},

Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between face
   concerns, articulated (upward) dissent and organizational assimilation.
   In this study, articulated dissent was conceptualized as a type of
   dissent.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A questionnaire was distributed to 370 working adults in the USA via
   Qualtrics. The questionnaire measured five face concerns, namely, self,
   other and mutual-face, articulated dissent and organizational
   assimilation. Before hypothesis testing, each measure was subjected to a
   confirmatory factor analysis to ensure that the hypothesized factor
   structure held. Pearson correlation and ordinary least squares
   estimation were used to test the hypotheses.
   Findings
   Conceptualizing dissent as a type of conflict, the findings of the
   current study are as follows: self-face and assimilation are positively
   correlated, other-face and assimilation are positively correlated,
   mutual-face and assimilation are positively correlated, assimilation and
   articulated dissent are positively correlated and organizational
   assimilation mediated the relationship between mutual-face and
   articulated dissent.
   Research limitations/implications
   Theoretically, the self-presentation process (face) is more critical as
   a person becomes part of an organization; it is through assimilating
   into an organization that members become familiar with the norms of an
   organization and more comfortable dissenting to their superiors
   (articulated dissent); and the more the authors integrate with the work
   colleagues the more the authors engage in mutual face-saving.
   Practical implications
   The results of this study demonstrate that self-presentation is critical
   as a person becomes part of an organization, particularly when it comes
   to managing conflict.
   Originality/value
   This is the first study to link facework with organizational dissent.
   The results add to the understanding of how face affects whether we
   choose to express this kind of conflict behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite a growing number of studies on simulations and International
   Relations (IR), few analyses investigate how participating in a
   simulation affects students' perceptions of relevant IR issues. In
   addition, almost none of the current analyses on role playing and IR
   investigate how the involvement in a simulation affects students' views
   on university enrolment or future career. This article seeks to fill
   these gaps, addressing how students' interpretations and expectations
   change after participating in the Model United Nations (MUN). This
   article studies how the MUN is perceived as an experience that helps
   improve personal skills such as language ability, negotiation skills,
   and knowledge related to IR issues. This article also analyses how
   perceptions about selected IR issues and views on future university
   enrolment or future career vary before and after the MUN. The article is
   based on an original data set from a survey submitted to high school and
   university students participating to two MUNs held in Spring 2018. This
   article also employs ordinary least squares (OLS) multivariate
   regression analysis to test alternative hypotheses.},

Title = {Deliberating or Thinking (Twice) About Democratic Preferences: What
   German Citizens Want From Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {311-331},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The question, `which kind of democratic governance people prefer', has
   moved to the forefront in current democracy research. This article uses
   existing hypotheses on democratic preferences as an input and employs an
   advanced research design to find out what citizens want if they had
   engaged in deliberation and reflection. We conducted an
   online-experiment with a deliberative treatment asking 256 German
   citizens in 2016. Our findings show that deliberation does not lead to
   more informed or differential preferences for governance models compared
   with getting informed or `thinking twice'. One reason are high levels of
   consistency between basic democratic values and governance choices
   already before the experiment, contradicting our initial assumption that
   preferences about democracy are generally ill-formed. Overall, our
   experiment shows that post-deliberative democratic preferences are
   mainly driven by issue salience and disenchantment with the actual shape
   of representative democracy. We detect a sort of a `populist' impulse
   where disenchantment conduces to calls for a stronger voice of the
   `people' and participatory governance models, irrespective of their
   concrete design.},

Abstract = {The growing field of collaborative governance has long sought to explain
   processes of collective decision making. Insights from institutional
   analysis highlight the influence of rules in shaping collective
   decisions. Yet, less is known about how such rules are created; in other
   words, how collaborative organizations decide how to decide. By drawing
   on concepts from Cultural Theory, we examine the connections between
   worldviews and decision rules across four collaborative watershed
   organizations in Ohio, United States. Results from this comparative case
   analysis indicate correlations between the group dimension of worldview
   and decision rules about choice, as well as between the grid dimension
   of worldview and two different types of decision rules, choice and
   aggregation. These results highlight the explanatory value of
   integrating aspects of Cultural Theory with the Institutional Analysis
   and Development framework. Results also suggest how governments might
   more effectively engage with collaborative organizations.},

Title = {Voice after Exit? Bulgarian Civic Activists between Protest and
   Emigration},

Abstract = {This article belongs to a forthcoming special cluster, ``Contention
   Politics and International Statebuilding in Southeast Europe{''}
   guest-edited by Nemanja Dzuverovic, Julia Rone and Tom Junes.
   Historically, civic activists who left their home countries in the wake
   of protests would either risk disappearing in anonymity or become
   engaged in political ``exile networks.{''} However, since the outbreak
   of the ``global wave{''} of protest, the ability of activists to take
   advantage of freedom of movement and technological advances in social
   media changed the framework and conditions of such ``exile.{''} This
   article addresses the question of what happens when protest activists
   decide to go abroad to study, work, and build a life. We focus in
   particular on the case of Bulgaria, the fastest shrinking country in the
   world. On the basis of structured qualitative interviews with Bulgarian
   activists who have gone abroad in the aftermath of the 2013 Bulgarian
   protests, we trace how migration and intra-EU mobility affect the
   political participation of activists, the ways in which they
   participate, and their diagnoses of the present. In other words, we
   explore whether one can speak of ``exit after voice,{''} leading in the
   long run to decrease in activism. We argue instead that we are
   witnessing a transformation of the dichotomy ``exit-voice{''} into a
   more complex scale of forms of protest organization and participation,
   facilitated by social media and the freedom of movement within the EU.
   Herein, the real risk might be not that migration leads to political
   passivity, but that the new ``voice{''} found through the experience
   abroad remains rather marginal as activists' networks are transformed
   and community building becomes a challenge in an increasingly precarious
   world.},

Abstract = {In an important article published in this journal, Dryzek et al. (2011)
   champion the convocation of a deliberative global citizens' assembly
   (DGCA). In this article, I aim to further strengthen the case for a DGCA
   by addressing: (1) why a DGCA is likely to take a long-term perspective
   in the global interest; and (2) why it is so vital that a global
   institution should do so. I start by analyzing the nature of the issues
   requiring global policy. These issues, I will argue, are typically
   global cooperation problems. Cooperation problems pose two major
   challenges. The first is to prevent freeriding, that is, serving one's
   immediate interests at the expense of the global interest. The second is
   to align on an efficient global policy. In both respects, I will argue,
   a DGCA is a good candidate to yield desirable results (and is likely to
   do better than current supranational institutions).},

Abstract = {Since its birth as an independent republic in 1993, Slovakia has been
   served by five different presidents. Due to limited competences, the
   presidents' have often relied on political speech as their principal
   tool to influence political developments. However, text as a source of
   data has been largely neglected in existing scholarship on Central
   European presidents. In this exploratory study, I classify the content
   of presidential speeches using a topic model and analyse topical
   patterns over time and across different presidents. I find that topical
   variation can provide useful insights into relevant issues such as
   agenda shifts or intra-executive conflict.},

Abstract = {Personality traits are one piece in the larger puzzle of political
   participation, but most studies focus on the Five-Factor Model of
   personality. We argue that the normative implications of the influence
   of personality on politics are increased when the personality traits
   being studied correlate with negative social behaviors. We investigate
   the role of the Dark Triad on political participation as mediated
   through political beliefs such as interest and knowledge. We find that
   Psychopathy and Narcissism are positively associated with political
   interest, but Narcissism is also negatively associated with political
   knowledge. In addition, both Psychopathy and Narcissism exert a direct,
   positive influence on participation. Our results imply that individuals
   exhibiting higher levels of Narcissism are not only less knowledgeable
   but also more interested in politics and more likely to participate when
   given the opportunity.},

Abstract = {Using data from a survey conducted in six EU Member States, we explore
   what drives citizen demand for referendums on EU membership. We examine
   whether or not similar drivers and mechanisms can be found across the
   countries surveyed. We consider what are traditionally understood to be
   the drivers of euroscepticism, exploring whether those same drivers help
   to explain demand for referendums on EU membership. Our most important
   finding is that citizens' attitudes to EU referendums are not driven, or
   explained, by a single issue, or by uniform mechanisms cross-nationally.
   Although we find that trust in EU institutions is a significant
   predictor of referendum demand, the impact of other factors considered
   varies substantially across the six countries.},

Abstract = {Transcending the established problem-solving perspective, this article
   proposes a novel conceptualization of orchestration as a strategy to
   escape legal responsibility. To test our conceptual argument, we study
   the case of EU migration governance vis-a-vis Libya in the Central
   Mediterranean. We show how legal constraints stemming from the 2012
   Hirsi judgement of the ECtHR drove the EU from direct extraterritorial
   border operation to indirect orchestration via Libyan authorities. The
   EU used the orchestration techniques `assistance', `endorsement',
   `convening' and `coordination' to establish Libyan authorities like the
   coast guard as central intermediaries in the field of border patrol and
   search and rescue. These orchestration strategies increasingly replaced
   EU operations on the ground, thus posing new challenges for human rights
   protection.},

Abstract = {Unlike other South European member-states of the EU, Malta did not
   experience any negative ramifications from the 2008 financial crisis and
   its eurozone membership has been stable, with the country enjoying
   sustained and high growth rates. Not surprisingly, Malta did not see the
   emergence of austerity-related euroscepticism after the crisis though a
   heavy influx of foreign nationals, from Africa and the EU, saw
   immigration become a key concern of the Maltese with the subsequent
   emergence of anti-immigrant, often anti-EU parties on the fringe of the
   party system. This article analyses the reasons why party and popular
   euroscepticism remain low and why the migration crisis did not dent
   support for the EU as well the durability of this scenario.},

Abstract = {The extensive use of explosives by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)
   resulted in the highest level of contamination ever documented across
   Iraq and Syria. This article identifies the breadth and depth of
   improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and landmines as tools of terror
   permeating everyday civilian life. Utilizing multiple data sources, it
   explains factors contributing to the unprecedented scale, potency, and
   semi-industrialized production of explosives contaminating the territory
   formerly occupied by the Islamic State. It concludes with a discussion
   on the barriers to decontamination efforts, predicting an increase in
   IED campaigns by armed non-state actors. It offers contributions to
   counterterrorism, foreign policy, and humanitarian concerns.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1968-1993},

Abstract = {According to the resource curse theory, persistent violence in
   developing areas results from rebels' ability to finance warfare with
   natural resource revenues. Surprisingly, this overlooks the complexities
   of raising revenue from a mobile mining population that values security
   as well as income. The literature thus neglects a fundamental question:
   what are the incentives of rebel groups to prevent or perpetuate
   conflict in mining areas? This paper delineates a rational to both
   increase and decrease violence. Protecting a mine should allow rebels to
   extract taxes in return. Simultaneously, to maintain this demand for
   security, rebels may need to destabilize the wider area. The hypotheses
   are tested with novel data on rebel taxation at over 3'000 artisanal
   mines in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Supporting the
   hypotheses, the results show that rebel-taxed mines appear exempt from
   violence nearby but imperiled at the perimeter.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the argumentative lines employed in an
   online public deliberation concerned with legislation on same-sex civil
   union in Greece. Drawing on rhetorical and discursive developments in
   political social psychology and sexual citizenship debates, the article
   focuses on arguments regarding the relevance and the implications of
   public deliberation on the construction of LGBTQI+ claims and rights.
   The analytic corpus consisted of 1,000 comments, analyzed with the
   concepts and tools of Rhetorical and Critical Discursive Social
   Psychology. A recurring line of arguing against the legislation
   questioned the democratic quality of public deliberation, representing
   it as a means used to legitimize predetermined decisions. Moreover,
   overtly discriminatory arguments were predicated on the values of
   participatory democracy. Accounts in favor of the legislation, though,
   challenged public deliberation on the grounds that it allows room for
   the dispute of universal human rights. The potential contribution of
   these findings to the understanding of the dilemmas of participatory
   democracy, the reproduction of heteronormativity, and the assimilation
   of LGBTQI+ claims is discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the relations between
   peacemaking at work and peacemaking at home. Peacemaking is defined as
   voluntarily helping behavior in interpersonal conflict, by a person who
   has no formal authority over the conflicting parties, acts impartial and
   works with either one or more parties to solve the conflict
   constructively (Zhang et al., 2018).
   Design/methodology/approach
   In total, 639 participants engaged in a survey to measure their
   peacemaking behavior at work and at home. First, the peacemaking scale
   is validated using factor analysis. To test the hypotheses regression
   analysis is conducted.
   Findings
   Results show that peacemaking at work and at home are
   positively-related. Further, compared to peacemaking at work, people
   tend to be more often engaged in peacemaking at home; are more focused
   on settling the issues, provide more emotional support and use more
   humor, however, are less multi-partial.
   Originality/value
   The study provides the first theory-based instrument to measure
   peacemaking as informal helping behavior in interpersonal conflict, at
   work and at home. Five components are measured, namely, peacemaking in
   general, multi-partiality, settlement-oriented, emotion-oriented and
   humorous peacemaking behaviors.},

Abstract = {The article argues that distrust in government reflects a preference for
   regime change in authoritarian China. It shows that individuals who have
   stronger distrust in government also have a stronger preference for
   multiparty electoral competition which runs against the gist of
   one-party rule and would be a stepping stone toward representative
   democracy. The article suggests that the relationship between trust in
   government and system support in an established democracy is
   fundamentally different from its variant in an authoritarian state. The
   target of distrust shifts from an electorally accountable government to
   a self-appointed one, while the target of support shifts from a system
   that protects freedom and rights to one that restricts them. The article
   concludes that the buffer between distrust in government and preference
   for regime change is particularly thin and fragile in China, where the
   vices of authoritarianism are proven and the virtues of democracy look
   promising.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) - and its Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in
   particular - is often criticized as a predominantly market-oriented
   project. We analyse to what extent such claims can be substantiated by
   focusing on one key aspect of the EU's post-crisis framework for
   economic governance: the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) that
   the EU has been issuing annually since 2011. Based on an original
   dataset, we analyse more than 1300 CSRs, which show that the EU does not
   push uniformly for less state intervention. Rather, the CSRs tend to
   suggest fiscal restraint and less protection for labour market insiders,
   while simultaneously promoting measures that benefit vulnerable groups
   in society. During the second decade of EMU, CSRs have gradually become
   more permissive of higher public spending and more in favour of worker
   protection, while the share of recommendations advocating more social
   protection has stagnated at a high level.},

Abstract = {This symposium assesses the trajectory of European Union (EU)
   environmental policy and integration in light of the rising pressure for
   policy dismantling and disintegration. This introductory article
   discusses the literature and the mixed evidence of EU environmental
   policy dismantling. Building on the three symposium articles, we
   investigate the role of the European Commission in this process,
   evaluating its role as a general `motor of integration' and more
   specifically as an environmental policy entrepreneur. We find that the
   current political context does push the Commission to reconsider its
   entrepreneurial role and adopt the role of a `normalized bureaucracy'.
   Nonetheless, organizational features, such as new hierarchies and
   presidential leadership, and ideas that frame policy initiatives explain
   continued policy evolution and resistance to outright dismantling.
   Scholars should also pay close attention to implementing measures and
   patterns of enforcement to detect the more subtle policy shifts.},

Abstract = {The role of women in society every day is growing. Women achieve
   significant business outcomes, along with men, although their efforts
   are often not evaluated in the same way. Despite their extraordinary
   commitment to the jobs they perform, women still find themselves in the
   so-called ``glass ceiling{''} - barriers that prevent them from
   progressing to better careers and to be equally valued and paid as men.
   Nowadays, there is a great desire and engagement of all layers of
   society and the state to change that situation so that women can prove
   their abilities in the most responsible positions, both in companies and
   public sectors as well. This paper starts from the fact that there is no
   favoring of men in relation to women in management positions in the
   state administration in Serbia, and that the main preconditions for
   someone to perform these functions are knowledge, education and work
   experience.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to research on the relationship between
   multipolarity and multilateralism. One aim of this article is to
   consider the role of multilateralism in the age of multipolarity by
   investigating Russia's approach to multilateralism, especially in the
   context of the Donbas conflict. Russia has been a staunch supporter of a
   polycentric world order. Thus, an analysis of its attitude towards
   multilateralism provides insights into the role of multilateralism in
   the emerging multipolar world. It will be argued that, while convergence
   of interests and equal participation of states cannot be assumed in the
   age of multipolarity, multilateralism can still facilitate policy
   coordination among states, including rising powers, and provide
   legitimacy to their policy decisions. Another aim is to explore what
   peacekeeping - an international practice reflective of multilateralism -
   can deliver in the multipolarising world. This article examines recent
   debates over the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to eastern Ukraine
   and argues that peacekeeping can not only help achieve security policy
   coordination among states, including rising powers, but also help create
   a common diplomatic culture and hence a sense of we-feeling among them,
   which may in turn develop into an inclusive regional security framework.},

Abstract = {The representation of EU debates in the mass media has received
   comparatively little attention in studies on Euroscepticism, despite
   criticism on the EU having become mainstream since the early 1990s in
   particular. Recently, a number of salient crises have brought European
   politics to the fore like never before. This article presents an
   analysis of different types of criticism on and opposition towards the
   EU as present in media at the height of the Eurozone crisis in 2012.
   Using a four-fold typology, it looks at views about the EU and its
   policies as present in coverage by quality newspapers in Austria,
   Ireland and the Netherlands. An analysis of 1,085 claims from 454
   articles shows that, rather than rejecting integration or EU involvement
   in certain policies, criticism was predominantly aimed at existing
   policies and on presenting different policy options.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to bring new insights into the foreign aid allocation
   behaviour and patterns of two donors from the group of post-communist EU
   member countries, namely Poland and the Czech Republic. We use
   quantitative regression analysis to address Polish and Czech foreign aid
   objectives with a specific emphasis on geopolitical considerations and
   promotion of democracy. The results reveal a considerable level of
   similarity between Polish and Czech foreign aid allocation. Both donor
   countries use foreign aid to safeguard their own geopolitical
   self-interests-the Czech Republic and especially Poland prioritise
   post-Soviet countries in their aid allocations. They also prefer
   recipients in a relative geographic proximity. On the other hand,
   economic objectives are not significant drivers of Polish and Czech
   foreign aid. Given the recipients' needs, the middle-income effects are
   evident in both countries' aid allocations. Although support of
   democracy is an official objective of both donors, the level of
   democracy and freedom played a statistically significant role only in
   the allocation of overall Czech aid. A separated analysis on Polish and
   Czech democracy aid reveals even stronger biases of democracy aid
   towards former post-Soviet countries. Our research has also acknowledged
   the need for a more precise definition of democratic assistance.},

Abstract = {How does armed conflict affect accountability and political trust in
   democratic governments? To answer this question, we present
   quasi-experimental evidence based on survey data which, coincidentally,
   were collected in the days surrounding an unanticipated violent attack
   by a rebel group in Mali. The chance occurrence of the attack five days
   into the survey demarcates respondents into two groups surveyed before
   and after the attack and allows us to examine how the attack affected
   approval of politicians and trust in political institutions. Our results
   show that people mainly attribute responsibility to the president and
   not to parliament or local government, while trust in institutions is
   largely unaffected. We also show that these effects are strongest in the
   region of the attack. These findings suggest that voters in new
   democracies are capable of attributing responsibility to individual
   politicians and governments while maintaining trust in the fundamental
   political institutions of democracy.},

Abstract = {What happens when environmental protection is framed using human rights
   language? Here, a new type of norm change - norm fusion - is
   conceptualized. Linking norms derived from different issue areas, it is
   realized through continuous use of strategic frames obtained from
   various issues, acceptance of the norm by society, and action in
   accordance with the new norm. The fusion process is decentralized and
   dynamic, does not proceed at the same speed everywhere and involves norm
   contestation. Norm fusion is discussed through the example of human
   rights and environmental norms. Environmental activists increasingly use
   a rights-based discourse, environmental cases are brought before human
   rights tribunals, and various international documents recognize the link
   between human rights and the environment. However, due to problems in
   the implementation of environmental rights in a neoliberal economic
   framework and clashes between environmental and human rights norms,
   fusion between environmental and human rights norms remains contested.},

Abstract = {Researchers struggle to understand the relationship between science and
   policy positions, especially the complicated interplay among the various
   factors that might affect the acceptance or rejection of scientific
   information. This article presents a typology that simplifies and guides
   research linking scientific information to policy positions. We use the
   typology to examine how characteristics of both scientific information
   and policy actors' existing policy positions affect the likelihood of
   changing, maintaining or reinforcing those policy positions. We analyse
   data from surveys conducted in 2015 and 2017 of policy actors engaged in
   contested policy debates over shale oil and gas development in Colorado,
   US. Our findings confirm expectations that policy actors will most
   likely maintain and reinforce their policy positions in response to
   scientific information. Our data also show that changes in policy
   positions depend on policy actors' risk perceptions, perceived issue
   contentiousness, networks and experience with science.},

Title = {Defying Gravity: Evaluating the Trickle-Up Effects of Reconciliation
   Programmes},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Abstract = {The process by which grassroots reconciliation activities facilitate
   change in individual conflict identities gravitating upwards to shape
   other levels of society is often under-explained. In most aspects of the
   peacebuilding process impact is measured downwards, but reconciliation
   usually starts with micro-level attitudinal shifts rather than
   large-scale societal change. Yet, successful conflict resolution and
   reconciliation depends upon significant mass support. Therefore, the
   long-term success of reconciliation programmes lies in the paradoxical
   process of these individual changes simultaneously sinking into the
   heart of post-conflict societies, whilst rising to effect institutional
   change. Isolated group shifts need to both ripple outwards and
   trickle-upwards to shape decision-making processes and affect the course
   of the conflict. In order to evaluate the potential of reconciliation
   rippling and rising to transform conflict identities from the individual
   to society at large and above, the author draws upon a unique collection
   of surveys and interviews of alumni of reconciliation activities and
   reconciliation entrepreneurs in Israel-Palestine and Bosnia. The outcome
   of this research contributes to understanding the dynamic that
   facilitates the trickle-up effect of reconciliation, as well as
   providing practitioners with an evaluation mechanism to assess the
   impact of grassroots reconciliation programmes through its constituency
   building potential.},

Abstract = {Resilience has been suggested as a unifying concept in terrorism
   research. This article investigates the conceptual adequacy of
   resilience applied to terrorism. The framework for criteria for
   conceptual adequacy was applied on the academic literature that deals
   with the meaning of terrorism resilience. The conclusion of this study
   is that at its current state resilience serves more the role of cultural
   metaphor than that of a well-developed scientific concept. The almost
   endless definitions of resilience and lack of coherence in the
   descriptions of attributes is a warning signs to terrorism researchers
   that, if not careful with its usage, the resilience concept can end up
   more as a utopian goal than an actual means for countering terrorism.},

Abstract = {What factors explain the institutional shape of military interventions
   spearheaded by France? This article suggests that Intervention
   Entrepreneurs are the deciding agents. To secure the viability of their
   intervention proposal, they select an intervention venue based on
   pragmatic grounds. Most importantly, they carefully study possible
   domestic and international opposition to their intervention plans and
   conceive institutional intervention choices accordingly. The result is
   an ad hoc selection of intervention venues with little impact of
   political ideology, norms, organisational interests, or historical
   learning. Moreover, on many occasions, little attention is paid to which
   intervention format would most benefit the peace and prosperity in the
   conflict theatre in the medium to long term. The article illustrates
   this argument by tracing French institutional decision-making for
   interventions in Chad/CAR, Mali, and Libya.},

Abstract = {This research examines the impact of human rights protests on human
   rights abuses in seven Latin American countries-Argentina, Brazil,
   Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. I find that protests
   focused broadly on human rights are associated with significant declines
   in human rights abuses, controlling for important factors from previous
   studies. Furthermore, I argue that it is important to distinguish
   political repression (abuses that target political activists) from
   coercive state oppression, which has nonpolitical targets. These two
   types of abuses respond to different factors, but broadly focused human
   rights protests are found to decrease both types of abuses. I argue
   further that a strong human rights movement, indicated by frequent human
   rights protests, discourages the police abuses associated with
   oppression by raising the likelihood of accountability for such abuses,
   including by improving the likelihood of reforms to the criminal justice
   system.},

Abstract = {In the agenda-setting process, prior to the decision-making process,
   there is a predecisional process whereby some issues are systematically
   blocked by powerful actors from being placed on the formal agenda. These
   issues are termed ``nondecisions{''}. This article argues that the
   predecisional process exists not only at the issue level but also at the
   level of problem definitions. Because of the empirical challenge of
   studying problem definitions that are not on the formal agenda, the
   article suggests examining problem definitions that were on the formal
   agenda and then disappeared from it. Such problem definitions can be
   termed nondecisions when their disappearance is due to latent power
   mechanisms, such as anticipated reactions or information control. The
   article tests these arguments using two American policy cases:
   prescription drug prices and child care. In so doing, it sheds light on
   the predecisional process and expands our understanding of the politics
   of problem definitions.},

Abstract = {Most analyses of legitimacy and legitimation in international
   organizations (IOs) focus on the perceptions of external audiences. In
   so doing, they fail to consider self-legitimation, where an IO
   undertakes legitimation internally, as away of developing and
   reinforcing its identity. Moreover, most studies of IO legitimacy
   neglect the fact that IO identities are rarely uniform and instead are
   multiple and conflicting. I address these omissions by examining
   self-legitimation in three IOs-the United Nations (UN), the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the World Bank. These
   organizations are both operational and normative actors, and both
   institutions dependent on member states and autonomous bodies with
   independent expertise and capacities. These identities sometimes dictate
   contradictory goals and practices, forcing the organizations to violate
   the principles and activities considered appropriate to one of their
   identities, thus complicating legitimation. Based on extensive fieldwork
   and drawing on a range of disciplines, this article proposes a novel
   theory of IO self-legitimation: I argue that the need for
   self-legitimation depends on the degree of identity cohesion and
   identity hierarchy of the organization. I identify two temporal
   dimensions of self-legitimation, three categories of self-legitimation
   practices, and three broader repercussions of self-legitimation,
   ultimately showing that self-legitimation is a necessary and
   constitutive activity for IOs.},

Abstract = {Does restructuring security forces reduce the risk of civil war
   recurrence? Prior research has examined effects of military integration
   in alleviating commitment problems, but the evidence has been
   inconclusive. Other aspects of civil-military relations have received
   less attention. This article examines the effects of civil-military
   relations in the context of postwar struggles to consolidate authority.
   It outlines three pathways through which security forces contribute to
   renewed civil war: by excluding rival factions and facilitating
   insurgent mobilization, by exploiting control over resources to
   challenge the regime, or by escalating incipient insurgency through
   repression. Analysis of original, cross-national data on postwar
   civil-military relations shows that reducing the potential for exclusion
   and exploitation through diverse officer appointments and robust
   civilian oversight lowers the risk of civil war. These findings
   emphasize the distributive effects of restructuring security forces and
   highlight the value of examining political contests around state
   institutions to understand why civil wars restart.},

Abstract = {The Colombian postconflict period requires titanic efforts on the part
   of the local government of the Arhuaco of the Sierra Nevada de Santa
   Marta, caught between their own ancestral battles and the demands of
   central government institutions that may not even reach this region to
   administer justice and reintegration for territorial peace building. The
   reintegration of Arhuaco ex-combatants into their home communities has
   posed one of the greatest challenges. The interaction between Arhuaco
   justice and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace adopted in March 2017 is
   crucial for their effective reincorporation. Examination of the
   experiences of a group of Arhuaco authorities that has succeeded in
   building peace in a territory plagued by paramilitary and guerrilla
   violence, the military action of the Colombian government, and the entry
   of mega-projects into the region reveals the obstacles and the
   individual and collective development opportunities that have shaped
   those experiences.
   El periodo posconflicto colombiano requiere esfuerzos titanicos por
   parte del gobierno local del Arhuaco de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta,
   atrapado entre sus propias batallas ancestrales y las demandas de las
   instituciones del gobierno central que quizas ni siquiera lleguen a esta
   region para administrar justicia y reintegracion para la construccion de
   la paz territorial. La reintegracion de los excombatientes de Arhuaco en
   sus comunidades de origen ha planteado uno de los mayores desafios. La
   interaccion entre la justicia de Arhuaco y la Jurisdiccion Especial para
   la Paz adoptada en marzo de 2017 es crucial para su reincorporacion
   efectiva. El examen de las experiencias de un grupo de autoridades de
   Arhuaco que ha logrado construir la paz en un territorio plagado de
   violencia paramilitar y guerrillera, la accion militar del gobierno
   colombiano y la entrada de megaproyectos en la region revela los
   obstaculos y las oportunidades individuales y colectivos de desarrollo
   que han dado forma a esas experiencias.},

Abstract = {Campaign funding laws have failed to stem the phenomenon of money
   politics in postcolonial Nigeria. The predominant narrative in extant
   literature attributes this failure to lack of enforcement of the laws.
   This article rethinks the lack of enforcement narrative and argues that
   the laws have inbuilt biases that legitimise and perpetuate money
   politics; hence, any investment in enforcement can only yield meagre
   returns. But beyond the biased legal regime, mass poverty is largely why
   attempts to remedy the challenge of money politics via the instrument of
   law have failed. The article recommends a recalibration of Nigeria's
   political economy to usher in a resource allocation and wealth
   redistribution regime that ensures the citizenry are not so poor that
   they would be vulnerable to material inducement.},

Abstract = {While there is continued interest in Deliberative Policy Analysis (DPA)
   its practice element appears to have been underappreciated. We reflect
   on our experience of using a systemic co-inquiry to provide new insights
   into operationalizing DPA that may assist it to speak more immediately
   to issues related to governing in the Anthropocene. Natural resource
   management (NRM) in Australia embraced the global turn to governance,
   but demonstrated how difficult it is to achieve systemic, collaborative
   approaches to management policy. The treadmill of our title symbolizes
   the experience of community and organizational stakeholders in the case
   area, who were constantly in motion but achieving no forward movement in
   collaborative governance. A systemic co-inquiry into how decision making
   and action taking in NRM could be improved began in 2015. Systemic
   co-inquiry is a facilitated process that enables emergence of ideas and
   opportunities for transforming a situation. We describe this process,
   present how it was used in the case area, then critically reflect on its
   contributions for governance and practice, and its theoretical and
   political implications. Describing and critiquing our use of systemic
   co-inquiry provides new insights to address challenges for future DPA.},

Abstract = {Scholars of public opinion on military intervention agree that survey
   respondents make judgments from limited information. Yet researchers
   still question whether ordinary Americans reflect elite attitudes or
   instead reach their own ``pretty prudent{''} conclusions from the stated
   principal policy objective (PPO). This article adjudicates the debate
   while incorporating lessons from the study of bounded rationality.
   Evidence comes from an original data set of aggregate US public opinion,
   covering 1,080 nationally representative survey items about launching
   operations, across thirty-five countries, during 1981 to 2016. Tests
   show that PPO matters: pursuing ``internal policy change{''} is less
   popular than restraining international aggression. However, language
   reflecting White House cues and one prominent cognitive shortcut (the
   ``availability heuristic{''}) statistically and substantively
   outperforms PPO at predicting intervention support. The results indicate
   that when ordinary Americans are polled about using force against
   salient foes (Saddam Hussein, al-Qaeda, Islamic State in Iraq and
   Syria), elements of bounded rationality can overtake the prudence
   expressed toward less vivid problems.},

Abstract = {This article is a research synthesis addressing four questions critical
   to our understanding of the determinants of public policy. How often and
   how strongly do hypothetical determinants of policy-public opinion,
   interest groups, the party balance, and other factors-actually influence
   policy? Do some hypothetical determinants of policy have more influence
   than others? Does the way we measure policy affect our ability to
   explain it? And is there a connection between how strongly particular
   variables affect policy, and how much effort we devote to studying them?
   It turns out that variables hypothesized to influence policy more often
   than not have no effect. When variables do affect policy, researchers
   very seldom say anything about how much impact they have. Variables that
   convey the most information to policymakers about what the public wants
   have a greater impact than other variables, but it is less clear how the
   measurement of policy affects our findings. Researchers pay much
   attention to hypothetical determinants of policy unlikely to matter very
   much, and little attention to those likely to be the most important.
   Implications for future research are considered.},

   publishing, exploring what the costs and benefits of this model are/were
   for the academic community. It then moves to explore forms of open

   international relations) community in the United Kingdom and beyond. The
   article concludes by asking why (given its likely advantages), the open
   access model is not ubiquitous and suggests that the future of
   publication lies in the hands of early career researchers.},

Title = {Othering as soft-power discursive practice: China Daily's
   construction of Trump's America in the 2016 presidential election},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The relationship between Chinese soft power and Chinese media has been a
   focus of a growing body of literature. Challenging a resource-based
   conception of soft power and a transmission view of communication that
   inform much of the debate, this article adopts a discursive approach to
   soft power and media communication. It argues that their relationship is
   not just a matter of resource transmission, but one of discursive
   construction, which begs the questions of what mediated discursive
   practices are at play in soft power construction and how. Addressing
   these oft-neglected questions, we identify a typology of three
   soft-power discursive practices: charm offensive, Othering offensive,
   and defensive denial. Focusing on the little-understood practice of
   Othering offensive, we illustrate its presence in Chinese media through
   a critical discourse analysis of China Daily's framing of Donald Trump
   and the United States, and argue that the Othering offensive in Chinese
   media that portrays Trump's America as a dysfunctional and declining
   Other serves to construct a Chinese self as more responsible, dynamic,
   and attractive. Adding a missing discursive dimension to the study of
   soft power and the media, this study has both scholarly and practical
   implications for analysing a nation's soft power strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how collective skill formation systems balance
   economic objectives related to competitiveness and social objectives
   related to inclusion. Based on a simple theoretical model, we argue that
   there are clear limits to how much inclusiveness can be achieved in
   collective skill formation systems. Firms are generally successful in
   resisting pressure by governments to be more inclusive because they
   benefit from their structural power in collective skill formation
   systems. Therefore, most pro-inclusiveness policies in such training
   systems do not require any firm-specific involvement. If
   pro-inclusiveness policies involve firms, employer associations
   typically participate in their development, trying to align the goal of
   inclusion with the economic interest of employers. Our two-level game
   model helps to understand this complex interaction between governments
   and firms. Empirical examples substantiate our expectations. They show
   how important it is to consider both levels simultaneously when
   analyzing inclusion-oriented training policy reforms.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes collective emotions toward political change in a
   populist democracy. Taking the federalization of the Philippines led by
   President Rodrigo Duterte as an exemplar case, we extend prevailing
   scholarship which focuses on populist leaders' electoral discourse by
   examining the affective landscape of the populist public in a
   postelectoral context. Utilizing a sequential mixed-methods design, we
   algorithmically classify the stance and sentiment valence of 18,535
   Facebook comments about federalism, then we reflexively identify
   collective emotions based on major discursive storylines across each
   stance-sentiment intersection. Our integrated analysis reveals
   collective feelings of (1) hope and euphoria and (2) vindictive contempt
   among supporters of Duterte's federalism, while detractors of the
   campaign express (3) derisive amusement and (4) fear and skepticism. Two
   of these public emotions may be idiosyncratic to Global South populisms:
   public fear and president-invested salvific hope. We discuss the
   implications of our findings along themes of emotional polarization in a
   populist democracy, linking political affect with democratic
   participation through social media.},

Abstract = {Scholars of political violence often face problems concerning data
   availability. Research on the perpetrators of that violence is no
   exception. Over the past 40 years we have made great strides in
   understanding who joins in violent action and why, yet have rarely
   probed the representative nature of the subjects queried or contemplated
   the implications of this sampling for our conclusions. It is generally
   assumed that those left to `tell the tale' about what transpired are
   representative of those who participated in the violence. In this
   article, we use the context of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda to probe
   questions about which perpetrators of violence we include in our
   research and subsequently, who we miss. We theorize an often overlooked
   group of perpetrators, the `murderers in the middle', who take orders
   from above, mobilize others to kill, and zealously participate
   themselves. We contend that this group of perpetrators is potentially
   unique from those generally captured, identified, and studied in that
   they are likely to have actively and willingly engaged in violence for
   personal gain as well as for ideological reasons. Systematically missing
   groups of perpetrators has potential implications for research on
   participation in mass violence as well as our understanding of why this
   behavior occurs.},

Abstract = {Psychology has begun contributing to social theory by providing
   empirical measures of actually existing cosmopolitanism that complements
   more purely theoretical conceptions of the construct common in
   philosophy and sociology. Drawing from two waves of research on
   representative adult samples from 19 countries (N = 8740), metric
   invariance was found for the three factors of cosmopolitan orientation
   (COS): cultural openness (CO), global prosociality (GP), and respect for
   cultural diversity (RCD). In terms of etiology, among Wave 1 measures,
   the personality factor of agreeableness was the best predictor of the
   cosmopolitan factors of GP and RCD at Wave 2, whereas openness of
   personality best predicted CO. Wave 1 measures of education, political
   liberalism, and self-reported social status independently also explained
   a small amount of variance in COS. Functionally, COS was shown to
   predict less prejudice against immigrants, and more support for global
   civil society, even after controlling for social dominance orientation.
   All three COS factors independently predicted better attitudes towards
   immigrants. GP was the best predictor of trust in the United Nations,
   whereas RCD was the best predictor of support for environmental
   protection. The three-factor model of COS appears well-calibrated for
   assessing actually existing cosmopolitanism across cultures.},

Abstract = {This article argues that on balance globalization does not increase, and
   may even reduce, the opportunity cost of Militarized Interstate Disputes
   (MIDs), as measured by foregone merchandise trade. Specifically,
   globalization makes it easier for states to substitute trade partners,
   makes it difficult to employ trade sanctions, makes credit more
   available to states at conflict, and encourages trade-substituting
   horizontal Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and sanctions-resilient
   vertical FDI. Hypotheses are supported using High Dimensional Fixed
   Effects regression, applied to a Gravity model, with two-way clustering
   of standard errors, and an analysis of the effect of globalization on
   the marginal effect of MIDs on international trade. This suggests that
   while wars are becoming infrequent in recent decades, due to other
   factors, trade's contribution to peace is diminishing.},

Abstract = {Collective political action among divergent interest groups is not
   always easy. It requires coordination, compromise and, often, the
   persuasive action of a policy entrepreneur. Coalition strategies are
   often shaped by participants' skill in mobilising ideas.
   Business-environmental coalitions - often considered `strange
   bedfellows' - have proved to be important in emissions trading
   policy-making. In 2013, chronically low emissions prices meant that the
   EU's climate policy flagship, the EU-ETS, was holed beneath the
   waterline. But, within two years and against the odds, ambitious reforms
   were agreed to steady the ship. Crucial to the rescue were the actions
   of a pro-ETS business lobby, orchestrated by environmentalists. We draw
   on thirty-two in-depth interviews to construct a discursive
   institutionalist account of collective interest representation in
   relation to the reforms. We highlight the ability of policy
   entrepreneurs to fashion a `change-but-no-change' pro-reform narrative
   attractive to businesses, despite the fact that such discursive
   strategies risked marginalising alternative and more disruptive ideas.},

Title = {Responsibilization in contemporary Swedish crisis management: expanding
   `bare life' biopolitics through exceptionalism and neoliberal
   governmentality},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the changing relations between
   individuals and public authorities within the Swedish crisis management
   system from 1995 to 2017. After the end of the Cold War, Sweden adopted
   a broader understanding of security that utilizes alternative governance
   strategies beyond sovereign means and focuses upon domestic security and
   the protection of vital systems. This has resulted in the emergence of
   collaborative arrangements involving public and private actors and as
   well as the extensive responsibilization of individuals. The latter has
   taken place since emergency and exceptionalism persist as vital concepts
   also in domestic security management. The present discussion argues that
   these two concepts restrict possibilities for democratizing security
   management and provides the means for harnessing the inclusion of
   volunteers while not granting them due voice in collaborative governance
   arrangements. However, responsibilization strategies include
   `activation' which in turn may invoke critical agency and reflection as
   well as enable resistance toward the current apolitical notion of crisis
   management.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many scholars have investigated the incredible rise of
   executive pay and the role of institutions as moderators of this trend.
   We argue that a crucial problem for attempts to moderate these increases
   remains the heterogeneity among top managers. Redistributive
   institutions can better target pay inequality among management than
   institutions that treat all managers or companies the same. To show
   this, we use a novel data set of executive pay across 17 OECD countries.
   We compare the effect of different institutional factors: corporate and
   personal income taxation, union bargaining power, and regulation
   (shareholder protection). We find that redistributive institutions such
   as personal income tax and union bargaining power seem to be more
   effective in addressing this heterogeneity in pay and in moderating
   remuneration in firms with very large market value than smaller firms.},

Abstract = {The EU has made a major mistake by not driving through EU membership for
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. The constant delays are due to several things,
   including national considerations in EU member states and a deadlocked
   political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, making necessary reforms
   difficult. This has created hopelessness in the population and
   contributes to continued political instability. Rapid integration in the
   EU and Nato is the only safe path to peace and development in Bosnia and

Title = {Correlates of Warning: Territory, Democracy, and Casualty Aversion in
   Terrorist Tactics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {396-415},
Abstract = {Terrorists attack civilian targets but there is variation in how many
   civilians they kill. Terrorists may deliberately harm civilians, or they
   may adopt a less bloody approach, demolishing businesses, transit
   systems, and other civilian property while employing tactics to avert
   civilian casualties. One such tactic is to warn civilians before an
   attack, allowing them to flee the area. With warnings as an example,
   this study considers why terrorists might adopt casualty-aversion
   tactics. An analysis of 12,235 bombings by 131 terrorist groups in the
   years 1970 to 2016 finds that warnings are most common when terrorists
   fight democracies and when they lack territorial strongholds.
   Ideological factors such as religion are not significant predictors of
   warnings. These findings suggest a need to revisit the claim that
   religion incentivizes indiscriminate terrorism. They also suggest a
   strategic logic behind casualty-aversion tactics. Terrorists fighting
   democracies may spare civilians to appear legitimate in citizens' eyes.
   Terrorists without strongholds may spare civilians because they rely on
   the state's population for support. At first glance, my findings appear
   to contradict civil war literature arguing that militants with
   strongholds use violence more discriminately. However, terrorism occurs
   in areas of state control. Militants with strongholds can use
   indiscriminate terrorism against state-governed civilians without
   alienating their own supporters elsewhere.},

Abstract = {``Administrative intensity{''} (AI) describes the proportion of total
   resources that organizations spend on administrative support functions
   rather than primary service and production processes. We test whether
   ``sharing{''} administrative activities between organizations leads to a
   fall in AI due to economies of scale, as is often supposed, using
   organizational and financial data from more than 300 English local
   authorities. We employ multi-wave change score regression analysis to
   relate changes in AI from 2008 to 2016 to levels of shared services
   participation, and further test whether reform performance varies by
   category of local authority, type of administration, or degree of
   structural complexity. Although we find that some measures of AI fell
   slightly over this period, this was unrelated to shared service adoption
   for any category of local authority. Sharing of clerical rather than
   professional types of administration, and sharing by organizations and
   within partnerships characterized by lower structural complexity, also
   failed to improve reform outcomes. Faulty assumptions about the extent
   of administrative scale diseconomies in English local government partly
   explain this significant reform underperformance.},
