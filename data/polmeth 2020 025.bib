Abstract = {The European Union has witnessed a transformation of national political
   elites in the last decade. In addition to local factors, this is caused
   by a range of broader societal and political discontinuities. By
   applying Higley's model of political elite transformation to the
   Eurozone- and migration crises, we reveal the nature of this
   transformation: political elites today are more differentiated and less
   united than a decade ago. The analysis shows that the discontinuities
   brought forth newly founded political parties and strengthened those
   with previously little voice in decision-making. These new elites
   reflect the Euroscepticism of an increasing proportion of their
   constituency. Thus, we argue that the European political landscape has
   moved beyond the constraining dissensus to a post-constraining
   dissensus, where national elites themselves challenge European
   integration. As elite transformation continues, the process of European
   integration will have to grapple with the realities of increased elite
   diversity for the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {International bureaucracies can expand their activities into new
   domains, even when these are remote from their formal mandates. Asking
   how they do this, this article reveals that expansion often goes
   unnoticed, because international secretariats typically start new
   activities in a way which is informal, mundane and depoliticized.
   Through an examination of UNESCO's and WHO's expansion into the domain
   of bioethics, the article argues that international bureaucratic tactics
   revert to a three-fold strategy mixing technicalization, expertization
   and naturalization. This suggests that international bureaucracies'
   autonomy does not depend on their fixed characteristics, as defined by
   their legal-institutional mandates, capacities, or level of expertise.
   Expansion takes place, rather, when such resources are efficiently
   activated, assembled, or developed, thus shedding light on the need to
   examine what international bureaucracies `do', rather than what they
   `are', in order to capture their influence in global governance.},

Abstract = {The United Nations is one of the organizations charged with developing
   and promoting international human rights law. One of the primary ways
   that the United Nations tries to do that is by regularly reviewing the
   human rights practices of member states and then recommending new
   policies for that state to implement. Although this expends considerable
   resources, a number of obstacles have made it difficult to empirically
   assess whether the UN's review process actually causes countries to
   improve their human rights practices. To study this topic, we conducted
   an experiment in Pakistan that tested whether respondents were more
   likely to support policies aimed at improving women's rights when they
   learned that the reforms were proposed by the United Nations. Our
   results indicate that the respondents who were randomly informed of the
   United Nations endorsement not only expressed higher support for the
   policy reforms, but also were more likely to express willingness to
   `mobilize' in ways that would help the reforms be implemented. Our
   treatment did not have any effect, however, on respondents that did not
   already have confidence in the United Nations. This suggests that the
   international human rights regime may only be able to aid domestic
   reformers when there is already faith in those institutions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Chile's foreign policy, utilizing a multilayered
   identity model, one that covers the country's most stable identity layer
   as a sovereign state, an intermediate layer in which processes of
   identification between Chile and its peers unfold, as well as the most
   superficial layer in which key entrepreneurs advance new identities.
   Chile's identity is examined through the lens of role theory, in order
   to unpack this country's sense of being a misplaced state in South
   America. Chile's role behaviour as a soft case of misplacement is
   triggered at the most superficial layer and partly permeates the
   intermediate layer of identity, despite the country's historical
   experiences which have given rise to a sense of uniqueness in South
   America. Thus, this article shows how Chile's role-play has tended to
   increase and/or offset its sense of misplacedness in South America in
   the period starting from 1990 and continuing into the new century.},

Abstract = {This article studies the involvement of Western diaspora communities of
   Transylvanian Saxons in the humanitarian campaign for Romania during the
   flood disaster in 1970. It shows how the Saxons' private relief
   campaigns established new forms of connectivity and exchange across the
   Iron Curtain through a transnational regime of care, ethnic solidarity,
   and charitable work. The article argues that the contingent and
   precarious situation of such spatially divided ethnic communities
   refashioned a generation of World War II refugees and migrants from
   ``speechless{''} objects of humanitarian intervention into passionate
   advocates, effective mediators, and surprising champions of private aid
   giving in postwar Europe.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) can respond to a civil
   conflict only if that conflict first enters the Council's agenda. Some
   conflicts reach the Council's agenda within days after they start,
   others after years (or even decades), and some never make it. So far,
   only a few studies have looked at the crucial UNSC agenda-setting stage,
   and none have examined agenda-setting speed. To fill this important gap,
   we develop and test a novel theoretical framework that combines insights
   from realist and constructivist theory with lessons from
   institutionalist theory and bargaining theory. Applying survival
   analysis to an original dataset, we show that the parochial interests of
   the permanent members (P-5) matter, but they do not determine the
   Council's agenda-setting speed. Rather, P-5 interests are constrained by
   normative considerations and concerns for the Council's organizational
   mission arising from the severity of a conflict (in terms of spillover
   effects and civilian casualties); by the interests of the widely ignored
   elected members (E-10); and by the degree of preference heterogeneity
   among both the P-5 and the E-10. Our findings contribute to a better
   understanding of how the United Nations (UN) works, and they have
   implications for the UN's legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Failure to access reproductive health care is a threat to the security
   of women around the world. This article offers three propositions to
   recognize reproductive health as a matter of international peace and
   security. The first is to recognize current processes of advancement and
   backlash politics as a silent security dilemma that undermines rights,
   justice, and public health based approaches to reproductive health. The
   second is to draw on the human security origins of global health
   security to reorient the concept away from protecting states to
   protecting individuals. Finally, a feminist approach to security is
   incomplete without recognising reproductive health as a threat to
   women's security and as a barrier to their participation in
   international peace and security processes. Reproductive health is
   central to effective peacebuilding yet remains curiously absent from the
   international peace and security discourse. We discuss how and why
   reproductive security should become integrated within the Women, Peace,
   and Security (WPS) agenda in order to hold states to account for
   reproductive health access. Reproductive security defines the urgency
   and threat of restricted reproductive health care to the lives of women,
   health-care providers, and sustained international peace and security.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive and
   repressive measures against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We
   theorize that state learning from observing the regional environment,
   rather than NGO growth per se or domestic unrest, explains this rapid
   diffusion of restrictions. We develop and test two hypotheses: (1)
   states adopt NGO restrictions in response to nonarmed bottom-up threats
   in their regional environment ({''}learning from threats{''}); (2)
   states adopt NGO restrictions through imitation of the legislative
   behavior of other states in their regional environment ({''}learning
   from examples{''}). Using an original dataset on NGO restrictions in
   ninety-six countries over a period of twenty-five years (1992-2016), we
   test these hypotheses by means of negative binomial regression and
   survival analyses, using spatially weighted techniques. We find very
   limited evidence for learning from threats, but consistent evidence for
   learning from examples. We corroborate this finding through close
   textual comparison of laws adopted in the Middle East and Africa,
   showing legal provisions being taken over almost verbatim from one law
   into another. In our conclusion, we spell out the implications for the
   quality of democracy and for theories of transition to a postliberal
   order, as well as for policy-makers, lawyers, and civil-society
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {Is radicalization inherently conducive to terrorism? This paper
   addresses this fault-line within discourses on radicalization by
   analyzing the political awakening and mobilization of British Muslims
   operating in environments targeted by violent-extremists. The results
   show that despite undergoing the ``root causes{''} and ``triggers{''}
   associated with radicalization, and even having direct contact with
   violent-extremists, research participants still rejected terrorism. This
   paper analyzes why participants' radicalism promoted resilience to
   political violence rather than propel them toward it. It challenges the
   selection bias within terrorism and radicalization studies which
   constrain our ability to understand this phenomenon by focusing on the
   rare cases of people who support terrorism while ignoring its more
   common trajectories of non-terror related activism (or apathy). In
   correcting this bias, this paper proposes a more holistic definition of
   radicalization grounded in the lived realities of people undergoing that
   process and concludes with a discussion on what the findings mean for
   the assumptions underpinning academic discourses on this matter and
   state counterterrorism policies.},

Abstract = {The 2015 Paris agreement represents a deep-rooted change in global
   climate governance. While existing scholarly assessments highlight
   centralinstitutionalfeatures of the Paris shift, they tend to overlook
   itssymbolic and discursivedimensions. Our analysis shows that the Paris
   architecture combines two core elements: an iterative pledge and review
   process to stimulate global climate action, and a `performative'
   narrative aimed at aligning actors' expectations on the prospect of a
   low-carbon future. We therefore suggest calling it anincantatorysystem
   of governance. We then examine the origins of the new approach and find
   that the rise of `soft law' approaches and communicative techniques in
   global climate governance are both indicative of a broader process: the
   entry of management culture in international organisations. Against this
   backdrop, we examine the prospects, limitations and caveats of the new
   approach and discuss its wider implications for global politics.},

Abstract = {Energy transitions are fiercely contested. The incumbents of the fossil-
   and nuclear-based energy systems have much to lose from a transition to
   a sustainable and decentralized energy system. They therefore employ
   their material and political resources to reverse, halt, or slow down
   this transition. They also attempt to stop and reverse the
   decentralization of energy production. This article provides a framework
   that can be used to analyze the contestation that surrounds energy
   transitions. The analytical framework breaks apart the macro paths of
   energy transitions, and differentiates between three meso-paths
   (political, economic-technological, and legitimation), emphasizes the
   feedback processes between these paths, and acknowledges the crucial
   role that actors play in engendering these feedback processes. It uses
   Germany as a case study to illustrate the analytical model. It also
   provides hypotheses that will be tested in the subsequent contributions
   to this special issue.},

Abstract = {Contact between politicians and their constituents is the cornerstone of
   democracies globally but an area of scholarship that remains relatively
   underdeveloped. Political contact can help convey authority, provide
   legitimacy and facilitate governance. This article goes beyond the
   assumption that representatives need to communicate more with the public
   and suggests, instead, that the quality of contact matters. Focusing on
   four processes by which citizens can contact their representatives
   (face-to-face, by letter, email or social media), we employ an
   experimental vignette methodology to test whether the character and
   timeliness of politicians' responses to citizen communication affects
   two indicators of democratic health: (a) the latter's satisfaction with
   political contact and (b) their likelihood to re-contact
   representatives. Our findings provide evidence that personalised
   communication and to a smaller extent, speed of response, can influence
   citizen satisfaction and their likelihood of re-engagement. This
   suggests politicians can improve these indicators of democratic health
   by adjusting the style of political contact and communication.},

Abstract = {What is the Alt-Right? As a movement still taking shape ideologically
   and operationally, the Alt-Right demands a research framework for
   analyzing both what it believes and how it functions. Adopting a
   morphological approach to analyzing political ideologies, I advance a
   new criterion for ideological classification: masculinism. Alt-Right
   masculinism seeks to define and enforce forms of masculinity as
   normative and regulative ideals with far-reaching implications for the
   theoretical sources the movement appropriates, the discourses it
   articulates, and the organizational and operational modes it adopts.
   Proposing a Deleuzean approach to analyzing how radical movements
   operate, I argue the Alt-Right functions as a rhizome. In light of these
   analyses, contradictions within the Alt-Right come into view: the
   movement seeks to instantiate patriarchal, hierarchal, and phallocentric
   masculinities through leaderless, networked, and acentric strategies and
   practices. I conclude by reflecting on how Alt-Right ideology and
   practice differ from mainstream rightwing masculine ideals and
   practices-in nationalism, capitalism, militarism, and evangelicalism-and
   how the development of the Alt-Right sheds new light on the construction
   of contemporary political masculinities more broadly.},

Abstract = {Christian Democratic socio-economic ideology underwent a paradigm shift
   through the Europeanization of its party networks. Christian Democratic
   networks started with a distinctive Catholic socio-economic ideology
   emphasizing corporatism, welfare transfers and a coordination of the
   economy. This institutional blueprint influenced the early years of
   European socio-economic integration. The original social Catholicism was
   gradually replaced by Protestant and secular inspired socio-economic
   ideology, emphasizing undistorted market competition with successive
   enlargements of the European Union and the European People's Party
   (EPP). The article empirically reconstructs the contested process of
   transformation of the EPPs socio economic ideology through the inclusion
   of mainstream conservative and Protestant Christian Democratic parties
   and its impact on European Christian Democracy and the European
   integration process.},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {One of the key challenges in the domestic implementation of
   international human rights norms and standards is to adapt and translate
   them in such a way that they become locally accepted while retaining
   their transformative potential. Contrary to the common assumption that
   such translation is necessary especially in the Global South, this
   article seeks to demonstrate the usefulness of applying the lens of norm
   translation also to Western liberal democracies through a case study of
   the United Kingdom. It examines the creation of the highly controversial
   UK Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), which gave domestic effect to the
   European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in British law, in order to
   illuminate the reasons for the HRA's persistent contestation. Based on
   the reconstruction of the postwar history of British bill of rights
   campaigns, the article argues that the continuing criticisms of the HRA
   and its lack of public support are the results of a failed translation
   process of the ECHR into the British context. The increasing mismatch in
   the development of the HRA between the far-reaching structural
   adaptation of European Convention rights to the peculiarities of the
   British constitution and the absence of their adequate rhetorical
   translation created a perceived gap in the HRA's legitimacy and left the
   Act in a precarious constitutional position.},

Abstract = {Will the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic
   decision-making be stabilizing or destabilizing? What are the risks and
   trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation)
   to machines? How might non-nuclear state and non-state actors leverage
   AI to put pressure on nuclear states? This article analyzes the impact
   of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making
   process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating
   military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that
   AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human
   critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic
   decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense
   planners come to view AI's `support' function as a panacea for the
   cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making. The
   article also considers the nefarious use of AI-enhanced fake news,
   deepfakes, bots, and other forms of social media by non-state actors and
   state proxy actors, which might cause states to exaggerate a threat from
   ambiguous or manipulated information, increasing instability.},

Abstract = {This article considers the ethical tensions inherent in international
   human rights field documentation and proposes intensive, simulation
   model, pre-fieldwork training as a means of reducing the risk of
   insensitive encounters. The article evaluates the social, educational,
   class, racial, and other power imbalances between parties in the
   ordinary fact-finding process. After mapping pitfalls and challenges, it
   assesses the simulation training method and its potential to respond to
   the volatile dynamics of fact-finding. We conclude that the rigorous,
   three-day or week-long exercise, carried out in a controlled, supervised
   setting, holds potential to train future advocates to navigate power
   dynamics, challenges in intercultural engagement, and other
   communications barriers.},

Abstract = {The decline of carbon intensive technologies is a key element in the
   ongoing energy transition and our attempts to tackle climate change. At
   the same time, our understanding of technology decline and of the
   associated policies and politics is still limited. This paper builds on
   the sustainability transitions perspective, a novel approach to analyze
   socio-technical transformation, including the complex interplay of
   policy and technology change. We study the decline of coal-fired power
   generation in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2017 by analyzing the
   discourse inThe Guardian. We find scientists and environmental NGOs
   criticizing coal for climate and health reasons. Government and
   incumbent businesses tried to re-legitimate coal but eventually, their
   resistance collapsed and coal was almost completely abandoned in just a
   few years. Particularly devastating for coal were failed promises around
   carbon capture and storage, rapid diffusion of wind energy, and pressure
   from various policies. This study contributes to better understanding
   the contested nature of decline, and the interplay of discursive
   struggles, technology change, and public policy in sustainability

   Following the Swedish Health Care Waiting Time Guarantee},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Understanding mass public support for health systems and welfare polices
   is required in order to safeguard the legitimacy of democratic
   governance of the welfare state. If policies to meet dissatisfaction go
   unnoticed, the whole idea of responsive democracy is in vain. This paper
   focuses on the 2005 Swedish health care waiting-time guarantee, which
   resulted in drastically lower hospital waiting times in Vastra Gotaland
   County. Exploring questions of significant theoretical relevance in the
   literature about policy feedback effects, the paper investigates if the
   decrease in waiting times affected hospital service satisfaction and if
   this effect was moderated by policy proximity and visibility. Data from
   the West Sweden SOM survey are utilized, measuring hospital service
   satisfaction from 2004 to 2009. To disentangle the role of policy
   proximity, two indicators are used-user status and subjective health
   status. Furthermore, policy visibility is measured by an individual's
   level of political interest. The results show that the decrease in
   waiting times resulted in a substantial increase in hospital service
   satisfaction. However, the increase was not more pronounced among groups
   with higher proximity and visibility. On the contrary, results indicate
   that the increase in hospital service satisfaction was stronger among
   those already in good health.},

Abstract = {Does theory contribute to forecasting accuracy? We use event data to
   show that a parsimonious model grounded in prominent theories of
   conflict escalation can forecast civil war onset with high accuracy and
   over shorter temporal windows than has generally been possible. Our
   forecasting model draws on ``procedural{''} variables, building on
   insights from the contentious politics literature. We show that a
   procedural model outperforms more inductive, atheoretical alternatives
   and also outperforms models based on countries' structural
   characteristics, which previously dominated models of civil war onset.
   We find that process can substitute for structure over short forecasting
   windows. We also find a more direct connection between theory and
   forecasting than is sometimes assumed, though we suggest that future
   researchers treat the value-added of theory for prediction not as an
   assumption but rather as a hypothesis to test.},

Abstract = {Reducing economic inequality and combatting climate change are two
   strongly supported policy goals, but they will require significant
   public investments. In times of limited fiscal resources, governments
   struggle to raise additional revenues needed to finance both, making
   trade-offs between generally supported policy goals likely. But how do
   citizens decide if they have to choose between goals they support in
   principle, such as spending on efforts to reduce inequality and
   channeling resources toward initiatives to protect the environment? We
   discuss three major factors that help explain this choice - information,
   self-interest, and ideological orientation. Our experimental study shows
   that information is not a significant determinant of such choices, and
   that ideology is only important as long as there are no conflicting
   goals. Once citizens have to decide between redistribution and
   environmental protection, myopic self-interest trumps all other
   theoretically relevant variables mentioned in the literature.},

Abstract = {The Brexit vote has sparked renewed criticism of the United Kingdom's ad
   hoc constitutional arrangements, particularly in relation to the status
   of popular sovereignty. While the people is politically recognised as
   `sovereign' through the apparent unassailability of its referendum
   verdict, this sovereignty has no legal foundation or form - thus giving
   it an elusive, indefinite character. In turn, legal commentators have
   argued that the lack of a clear conceptual framework for constitutional
   referendums aggravated the political crisis that followed the vote and
   that the uncertain nature and authority of referendums represents a
   distinct source of constitutional crisis in its own right. In this
   article, I consider how this `constitutionalist critique' of the Brexit
   referendum, and its ad hoc constitutional framework, reflects a
   particular conception of liberal constitutionalism as a bulwark against
   the hazards and vicissitudes of unstructured popular sovereignty. I will
   argue that this perspective overestimates the capacity of constitutional
   law to regulate expressions of popular sovereignty via referendums, that
   it misconceives the character and claim of popular sovereignty more
   generally, and that it reflects certain characteristics of liberal
   legalism in its stance towards politics and political contingency.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the diverse processes of `reconstruction' that have
   taken place in Sri Lanka following the devastating tsunami in 2004, and
   the end of the war in 2009. We argue for a reading of post-crisis
   reconstruction in Sri Lanka which complicates the `liberal' versus
   `authoritarian' binary often used to characterise these reconstruction
   processes, and brings to the fore the complexity of the decisions and
   tensions around reconstruction in Sri Lanka. We advocate using the
   concept of hybridity to better understand the multiple processes of
   reconstruction that have taken place in Sri Lanka since 2004, how they
   interact and how an approach to reconstruction that is unique to Sri
   Lanka may be in the process of being negotiated.},

Abstract = {Establishing peace in Colombia has been an enigma escaping the best
   intentions of some presidents. The causes of this riddle are multiple.
   Some attributed it to the nature of the state-making process led by a
   fractured elite compounded with the state limited resources in a country
   with one of the most complex topographies in the world. This article
   tackles part of this puzzle, particularly the inability of any fraction
   of the elite to establish its hegemonic vision over the others and hence
   to pacify the polity. It explores why previous presidents who attempted
   to find a peaceful settlement of its long armed conflict failed and why
   and how did President Juan Manuel Santos succeed. Against the backdrop
   of a fragmented hegemony, I analyze two core areas that have received
   scant attention in the literature, which are essential to understand the
   previous failures. The role of the United States in the Colombian
   conflict and the excessive autonomy of Colombia military institution
   vis-a-vis the executive in conducting the war.},

   concerns of political life. However, political actors and politically
   controlled ministries still influence agencies in various intended and
   unintended ways. This article focuses on intensive long-term series of
   structural reforms and how they may undermine the original design
   philosophy underpinning agencification. We utilize a dataset combining
   staff surveys and a structural reform database to perform multilevel
   analyses of employees nested in organizations. We find that the
   frequency with which agencies have experienced structural reform affects
   the weight that employees attach to signals from political and
   ministerial principals. Frequent structural reform may lead to
   heightened perceptions of the importance of political signals. Hence,
   frequent structural reforms may increase the risk of political influence
   on agencies that were designed to operate impartially.},

Abstract = {This article concerns the recent shifts and tensions in the role of
   scientific knowledge in policymaking. Policy practitioners are striving
   to solve a compelling problem: how to deal with complex problems under
   conditions of uncertainty. This article focuses on two policy reforms in
   Finland that have been designed to address these issues: strategic
   governance reform and the take up of a culture of experimentation. It
   suggests that the knowledge-policy relations within these reforms are
   characterised by profound tensions between `good governance' and `good
   knowledge'. Whereas good governance demands that knowledge is
   controlled, good knowledge entails uncertain and uncontrollable
   elements.},

Abstract = {International Relations theorists have recently paid increasing
   attention to the hierarchical nature of international society, that is,
   to its built-in structural inequalities. In this article, we focus on
   one thus far neglected aspect of global social stratification by
   highlighting the role that international institutions play in both
   reproducing and transforming inequalities among states and other global
   subjects. We argue that this focus on institutions can advance our
   understanding of the processes through which global inequalities are
   maintained and changed, and that institutionalist research can in turn
   benefit from shifting its attention from the predominant cooperation
   paradigm to capturing the manifold `inequality' effects of
   institutionalised interactions in world politics. We illustrate this
   shift of perspective with a dual case study of the Ottawa and Oslo
   Conventions banning anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions.},

Abstract = {A potentially beneficial conflict management tool, post-conflict
   power-sharing is often marred by political crises and instability. We
   explore the link between power-sharing `adoptability' and functionality.
   Focusing on Iraq, we demonstrate that weak adoptability (when one of
   more groups have grave reservations about the settlement) harms
   power-sharing in several important ways. First, weak adoptability by the
   Sunni community led to their exclusion and mobilization against the
   state. Second, weak adoptability provided political space for Shiites to
   dominate in politics, undermining the very basis of post-conflict
   power-sharing. Third, weak adoptability further compounded
   constitutional contestation, leading to the Kurdish independence
   referendum in 2017.},

Abstract = {Dialogue can have positive effects for participants, but it is not clear
   how it affects members of the wider community. This study examines a
   dialogue project in Prozor-Rama in Bosnia and Herzegovina using survey
   data from 2012 and 2015. Results show that there is a general positive
   trend in interethnic relations, however, dialogue in Prozor-Rama had the
   effect of lowering in-group trust and dampening the increase in civic
   engagement relative to a control town. This suggests that in the
   short-term dialogue can have negative effects. They also suggest the
   need for studies of the long-term effects of dialogue. This study is
   significant because it moves beyond looking at the effect of interethnic
   contact on attitudes and prejudice and also examines its effect on
   social ties, social interaction, and civic participation.},

Abstract = {As evidence mounts about the positive effects of autonomous motivation
   such as public service motivation, there is a growing case for public
   organizations to design reforms to better support public employees'
   inherent desire to help others. But how feasible is this in reality?
   Most experimental evidence on autonomous motivation stems from
   interventions at the individual level, possibly exaggerating what
   government reforms can achieve in reality. We present a longitudinal
   study that analyses a three-year trial in Danish hospitals in which
   incentives and autonomy were changed to encourage autonomous motivation.
   This set-up offers a rare opportunity to observe the potential
   malleability of intrinsic, public service, user and external motivation.
   The results show little observable change in motivation due to the
   reform. We explore the practical difficulties of translating evidence
   about motivation into reforms given implementation challenges,
   contextual factors and a recognition that motivation might be less
   malleable than implied by research.},

Abstract = {This paper captures the on-going ``talent war{''} between Chinese cities
   by studying how municipal governments have coordinated migration
   settlement policies and subsidized rental housing policies to
   restructure the labour force for economic upgrading. Policies in four
   cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chongqing are coded and reviewed
   in detail to show the hierarchical and intersectoral policy
   coordination. The hierarchical analyses explain the responsibilities of
   the governments at each level. The cross-sectoral analyses reveal how
   domestic migration and housing policies are tightly knit together to
   support the local economic upgrading. The case studies of four cities
   show that the local policies are structurally aligned with the central
   guidelines, and the local governments adjust the thresholds for key
   indicators in the policies to attract or exclude migrants to reflect the
   local economic agenda and population control targets. This research
   showcases how the local governments in China try to balance between
   central mandates and local interests. The paradigm shift from pro-GDP
   growth to economic upgrading has clearly affected the local governments'
   attitudes towards migrants. City authorities introduce selective
   migration strategies in response to the pressure to control population
   growth.},

Title = {Diplomatic communication and resilient governance: problems of governing

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This article examines the resilience of governance. My descriptive
   argument identifies variations of resilience by analysing the evolution
   of contestation and decontestation of governance-constituting
   institutions in the foreground and background layers of governance. My
   explanatory argument distinguishes different modes of diplomatic
   communication, ranging from coercion (most closed) via declaration,
   haggle, and problem-solving to polylogue (most open). While the
   occurrence of none of these modes is inconsequential, producing
   resilience in the foreground and background layers does not become
   possible unless problem-solving and polylogue, respectively, come to
   dominate communicative encounters. My abductive analysis of nuclear
   weapons governance underlines the plausibility of this conceptual
   framework and elaborates on it further. In the past two decades,
   communicative practices sidelined open modes of communication. This made
   the resilience of nuclear weapons governance decline. This study makes
   three contributions: it provides more details on how to describe
   governance resilience; it shows that additional explanatory power is to
   be gained by looking at the breadth of communication employed by
   diplomats; and it contributes to a better grasp of what keeps nuclear
   governance together and what threatens to tear it apart.},

Abstract = {The complex relationship between democracy and the ecological crisis in
   capitalist societies and the associated challenges for social-ecological
   transformations is addressed. Based on a review that differentiates four
   strands of literature dealing with the role of the environment and
   democratic politics, it is argued that, despite their differences, most
   literature lacks a material foundation of contemporary democracies -
   both in its social and biophysical dimensions. In line with
   historical-materialist social theory, the concept of a double
   materiality of democracy is introduced to provide for an adequate
   understanding of the challenges for social-ecological transformations
   faced by current capitalist and fossil-fuel based democracies. The
   renewable energy transition illustrates these challenges.},

Abstract = {When and why might a rising China challenge the power and security of a
   relatively declining United States? Conventional wisdom argues that
   China - like other rising states - is apt to adopt an increasingly
   ambitious strategy that imperils US interests as its relative power
   grows. Drawing on balance of power theory, I instead argue that the
   threat of Chinese predation is overstated. Rising in a crowded
   geopolitical neighbourhood, China faces incentives to avoid preying on
   the United States, and may even have reason to cooperate with the United
   States over the long term.},

Abstract = {English councils have long aspired to be `self-sufficient', providing
   services within single jurisdictions with limited inter-local
   collaboration. However, by 2017 almost all local councils (97 per cent)
   participated in one or more frontline or back-office `shared service'
   involving 338 distinct partnerships. We analyse this new-found
   enthusiasm for inter-council collaboration by performing exploratory
   social network analysis on organizational and financial data for all 353
   English councils. We examine factors predicting collaboration and the
   characteristics of the service networks that result, focusing on
   resource, organizational and political considerations. Propensity to
   collaborate was found to be unpredictable, but partner choice was
   rational, driven by geographical proximity and similarity in
   organizational and resource characteristics. We argue that, according to
   the institutional theory of organizations, both efficiency and
   legitimacy influenced these reform choices, and the risks of fashionable
   collaboration were mitigated by careful partner selection. We highlight
   implications for future quantitative research into symbolic
   (non-instrumental) forms of collaboration.},

Abstract = {While evidence has suggested that international assistance projects
   become the targets of violence, political science research has often
   addressed this relationship at the state level and not the aid location
   itself. Given the heterogeneous nature of aid distribution and terrorist
   behavior within a state, it is important to study this relationship
   using higher resolution data. Using geocoded terrorist attack and
   multilateral aid distribution data, coupled with the PRIO-GRID cell
   structure, our approach sheds light on whether areas in which aid is
   distributed are more likely to be targeted by terrorist groups. Our
   results show that areas where aid is being distributed are targeted more
   heavily than areas without aid distribution. The modality of specific
   multilateral aid projects is also shown to impact whether they are more
   likely to be targeted. Further, we show that terrorists select different
   types of targets in aid locations than they do in non-aid locations,
   lending support to the notion that terrorists seek to intimidate local
   populations from collaboration with the government and to dissuade
   further government efforts. The results not only highlight and expand
   upon the dangers associated with aid distribution, but also the notion
   that aid content is a factor in terrorist targeting preferences.},

Abstract = {Current scholarship often concludes that technical expertise is one of
   the most important commodities for interest groups wishing to gain
   access to political-administrative venues. Less attention has been given
   to politicization and the scope of societal support that interest groups
   bring to bear. Specifically, I hypothesize that the capacity of interest
   groups to supply broad societal support is decisive for gaining access
   in highly politicized policy domains. To test this expectation, the
   article combines a mapping of interest group membership in 616 Belgian
   advisory councils with survey data from more than 400 organized
   interests. The empirical analyses demonstrate that interest groups with
   broad support are more likely to gain access to advisory councils in
   highly politicized policy domains, but this effect is negatively
   moderated when interest groups involve their constituencies intensely in
   advocacy processes.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to explore the objectives and possible
   consequences of the Chinese investments in Portugal in the last decade.
   Are they business as usual in a globalized economy, or something else
   inside a broad political strategy? Trying to answer this question, the
   approach will be made both through the lens economic diplomacy and the
   geopolitical analysis. The research will be developed throughout several
   points: firstly, the Chinese model of socialist market economy within a
   global environment configured by liberal ideas; secondly, the main
   characteristics of China's economic diplomacy model, one where the
   economic and the political are closely intertwined; thirdly, a focus on
   the economic attractiveness that China exerts upon Portugal, having the
   investment in the Portuguese energy sector as a case in point; and
   finally, some conclusions about the possible consequences for Portugal
   economic and strategic dependence on China in a world where the

Abstract = {Sexual violence (SV) in conflict is increasingly politicized at both the
   international and domestic levels. Where SV in conflict is prevalent, we
   argue international actors perceive gender to be salient and push for a
   gendered response. Simultaneously, women mobilize politically in
   response to the threat to their security that conflict-related SV
   constitutes, making demands for greater representation in politics with
   the goal of improving societal conditions for themselves. Jointly, we
   theorize the pressures from above and below push governments in
   conflict-affected states toward adopting gender policies. We test this
   theoretical framework in the case of gender quota adoption. We find that
   states with prevalent wartime SV indeed adopt gender quotas sooner and
   at higher rates than states experiencing other civil conflicts and than
   states experiencing no conflict in the same period. These gender quotas,
   we further show, are not mere window dressing but actually increase
   women's legislative representation.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to a forthcoming special section,
   `Conceptualizations of the Holocaust in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and
   Ukraine since the 1990s' guest edited by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe.
   This article investigates how the Holocaust was recollected, presented,
   and interpreted in Ukraine and Belarus during the Soviet era. It further
   examines the changes that have taken place in the representation of the
   Holocaust in Ukraine and Belarus in the post-communist period. First,
   the article aims to explain the ideological reasons why the Jewish
   origin of many Nazi victims was largely played down or ignored in the
   Soviet historiography. Second, it investigates the new political
   dynamics in independent post-communist Ukraine and Belarus that have
   influenced public discourse and historiographical reflections on various
   issues of the Second World War, including the persecution of the Jews.
   As well as historiography, the article investigates the developments
   that have taken place in contemporary Ukraine and Belarus regarding
   commemorative practices, monuments, museum exhibitions, and education
   initiatives to honor the victims of the Holocaust and to promote
   knowledge about this event.},

Title = {The Climate Duties of Sub-National Political Communities},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-36},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, several actors at the sub-national level (e.g.
   California, British Columbia, New York City) have taken unilateral steps
   to mitigate climate change by reducing their emissions. These
   developments have commanded considerable attention in the empirical
   literature. In this piece, we consider the philosophical dimensions of
   climate action at the sub-national level. Specifically, we argue that
   climate action at the sub-national level is an instance of a more
   general class of cases in which the failure of some collective agent to
   discharge some duty to which it is subject entails duties for the
   sub-collectives of which it is comprised to partially discharge that
   duty. We begin, then, with a discussion of such cases, and a defence of
   the devolution principle, which sets out conditions under which such
   duties arise. We then set out the argument with respect to sub-national
   political communities' duties to take action on climate change,
   specifically. The article concludes by considering complications arising
   out of the inevitable fact of partial compliance, drawing upon recent
   work in the literature on slack-taking duties.},

Abstract = {Complexity poses challenges to policy makers who intervene in the world.
   Interconnectedness, a key aspect of complexity, requires that policy
   makers acknowledge the compounded nature of policy problems in their
   design of a robust, differentiated policy. Deliberative Policy Analysis
   recommends small group deliberation to address interconnectedness.
   However, higher-order phenomena that emerge through interactions in a
   complex system have properties that cannot be reconstructed from
   lower-order phenomena by simple extrapolation. They go beyond
   interpersonal relations in that they involve aggregate phenomena, such
   as laws, organizations, and institutions. To harness this kind of
   administrative interconnectedness requires an ability to intervene
   intelligently in these aggregate entities through institutional design.
   Our aim in this article is threefold. First, we describe a remarkably
   successful historical case of integrated governance: housing policy
   during the 15-year period after WW1 known as ``Red Vienna{''}. Our
   purpose is to demonstrate that policymaking that is commensurate with
   interconnectedness is possible in real-world circumstances, even
   unpromising ones. Our second objective is counterfactual. We will show
   that the officials of Red Vienna de facto engaged in a particular form
   of institutional design that we call ``design-in-practice{''}. Third, we
   will claim that design-in-practice is a foundational tool in the
   methodological armory of DPA.},

Abstract = {EU agencies have emerged as entities offering technical coordination to
   member states and support to the European Commission in different policy
   areas. Their expertise may play a role in responding to unexpected
   crises. Against this backdrop, we examine under which circumstances EU
   agencies, through their specialized expertise, are involved in
   transboundary crisis responses, and when they acquire a leading position
   in coordinating those responses. To do so, we study four agencies which
   faced crises: the EBA and the 2012 banking crisis; the ECDC and the 2014
   Ebola outbreak; EFSA and the 2011 E. coli outbreak; and Frontex and the
   2015 refugee crisis. Our findings discuss to what extent agencies'
   involvement in transboundary crises is related to functional (sector
   characteristics) and institutional (delegation of authority) variables.
   We also identify that under certain political conditions EU agencies'
   coordination capacity is activated, allowing them to emerge as leading
   institutions in transboundary crisis resolution.},

Title = {Shaping the Scope of Conflict in Scotland's Fracking Debate: Conflict
   Management and the Narrative Policy Framework},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {This study applies a narrative lens to policy actors' discursive
   strategies in the Scottish debate over fracking. Based on a sample of
   226 newspaper articles (2011-2017) and drawing on key elements of the
   narrative policy framework (NPF), the research examines how policy
   coalitions have characterized their supporters, their opponents, and the
   main regulator (Scottish government). It also explores how actors have
   sought to expand or contain the scope of conflict to favor their policy
   objectives. Empirically, only the government strives for conflict
   containment, whereas both pro- and anti-fracking groups prioritize
   conflict expansion through characterization contests and the diffusion
   and concentration of the costs/risks and benefits of fracking. In
   theoretical terms, the study proposes that Sarah Pralle's conflict
   management model, which emphasizes symmetrical strategies of conflict
   expansion by both coalitions, is a potential tool to revise extant NPF
   expectations about the different narrative strategies of winning and
   losing coalitions. Moreover, the fact that policy actors mostly employ
   negatively rather than positively framed characters in their narratives
   may be a valid expectation for similar policy conflicts, particularly
   under conditions of regulatory uncertainty.},

Abstract = {This article, providing an example of state support for terrorists,
   looks at the cooperation between the Stasi and the right-wing West
   German terrorist Odfried Hepp in the 1980s. Based on research in Stasi
   archives, the article explains that gathering information, rather than
   using him as a terrorist weapon in the Cold War, was the main motivator
   for the Stasi to cooperate with a high-profile neo-Nazi. By looking at
   the details of the Hepp-Stasi alliance, it assesses what forms, results,
   and dangers this relationship produced. The article challenges the myth
   of the all-mighty East German State Security and demonstrates that the
   dynamics of this alliance were not always in the Stasi's favour. In the
   absence of other instruments of coercion, the Stasi used the personal
   relationship between Hepp and his officers to control him. The article
   offers insights into Hepps's terrorist career but also the pragmatic way
   in which the Stasi built its network of informants outside the GDR. It
   also adds nuances to the understanding of the relationship between
   Socialist states and terrorists during the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Migrants' healthcare entitlement represents a conflictive issue in the
   political battlefield, with research pointing towards the determinant
   role of party politics in determining policy outputs. Addressing the
   2012 healthcare reform and 2018 counter-reform adopted in Spain by a
   right-wing and left-wing government respectively and drawing on
   qualitative analysis of parties' discourses and policy measures, we
   argue that ideological differences along the healthcare-migration nexus
   were overemphasised to play symbolic politics. Partisan competition had
   less impact on actual outputs, while clashes between the central and
   regional governments, path-dependent practices and opposition from
   multiple venues played a central role in the policymaking process.},

Abstract = {On June 29, 2014, the Islamic State emerged and declared the
   establishment of its caliphate. The declaration was a direct challenge
   to other Sunni Jihadi groups including Al Qaeda and an attempt to become
   the leading Jihadi group around. The rivalry that evolved within Sunni
   Jihadism, and particularly between Al Qaeda and its renegade affiliate
   the Islamic State, entailed a hitherto unseen competitive environment
   within the Jihadi field. Interestingly, the increased competition did
   not lead to a dynamic of competitive escalation and mutual
   radicalization of behaviour. Theory tells us to expect competitive
   escalation, or outbidding, in such contexts, but despite the initial
   success of the Islamic State's brutality and offensive conquest in Syria
   and Iraq, Al Qaeda did not ``play along{''} and instead pursued a
   different path. The reason for this absence of competitive escalation,
   this paper argues, is to be found in a pre-conflict methodological
   re-orientation within Al Qaeda and in the pacifying role played by
   influential Al Qaeda-affiliated ideologues.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how appropriation of land for flower farm
   developments in Walmara district and Holeta town in Ethiopia's Oromia
   region affected smallholders' livelihoods. Between 1996 and 2018, the
   state expropriated 1487 hectares from Oromo farming communities for the
   flower industry with little or no compensation through the `eminent
   domain' principle. This article demonstrates the effects of these
   actions on the rural poor in Oromia including threats to common property
   resources and farming plots, which constitute their basic livelihood
   units and intergenerational assets. By focusing on cases of land
   expropriation in the central highlands of Ethiopia, it challenges a
   common misconception that land grabs are occurring only on the periphery
   of the state. In this case, the entanglements of the export-oriented
   flower industry in global capitalism and the centralized state
   administration have led to destitution for most smallholders within 100
   kilometres of the capital city. The study shows how policies associated
   with the Ethiopian developmental state accord priority to investors and
   state interests over local concerns, reinforcing wider concerns with
   dominant models of development.},

Abstract = {The public sector provides a broad range of incentives to apply for
   jobs, but these incentives have rarely been studied in concert. The
   present study disentangles how job candidates form intentions to apply
   for a public sector job in multi-incentive settings and how this process
   depends on public service motivation (PSM). Using a speeded
   categorization task in an experimental vignette methodology with 340
   current job seekers in the United Kingdom, we focus on perceptions that
   potential applicants have, or do not have, of a range of employment
   attributes (i.e., extrinsic, intrinsic, and prosocial) when they screen
   job advertisements. Results of multilevel analyses suggest that
   perceptions of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes are similarly strong
   predictors of the intent to apply for public sector jobs, whereas
   perceptions of prosocial employment attributes do not yield such an
   overall effect. However, PSM moderates the relationship between
   perceptions of prosocial attributes and application intentions, but only
   among nonstudents. Theoretical implications for the alignment of PSM
   with extrinsic rewards are discussed. Findings are also important for
   human resource managers in the public sector who want to adjust their
   recruitment strategies to specific target groups.},

Abstract = {There is increasing awareness that sexual violence is distinct from
   other aspects of civilian victimization in civil wars. Few studies have
   examined the independent impact of such violence on responses to civil
   wars as compared to ``traditional{''} forms of violence. This article
   explores whether reports of high levels of rape and sexual violence
   increase the probability of United Nations (UN) attention to conflicts
   and calls to action. In so doing, we combine original data on UN
   Security Council (UNSC) resolutions with data on sexual violence in
   armed conflict and estimate the impact of sexual violence on UN
   attention to all civil wars from 1990 to 2009. We show that the effects
   of sexual violence on the number and level of UNSC resolutions are
   significant even when controlling for other important determinants of UN
   action. These findings have important implications for understanding how
   the UN has expanded its view on protecting civilians.},

Title = {Political Activism Without Political Action? Towards a New Conception of
   Activism in Danish Foreign and Security Policy Inspired by Hannah Arendt},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3},
Pages = {433-444},
Abstract = {Activism is frequently used by researchers and practitioners alike as
   ``a general label on Danish foreign policy{''} (Pedersen \& Ringsmose,
   2017, p. 339, authors' translation). There is no consensus as to when
   Denmark became activist or if the label is equally fitting to all
   foreign policy issue areas. However, there is broad agreement that the
   military engagements in recent decades, particularly the wars in
   Afghanistan and Iraq, constitute a high point in Danish activism. Our
   analysis challenges and nuances this characterization by exploring an
   alternative understanding of political activism inspired by Hannah
   Arendt's political theory. Our alternative concept of activism revisits
   the central elements of activism; initiative, risk and participation,
   and distinguishes between military engagement and political activism.
   Drawing on this conceptual framework, we revisit Denmark's war
   engagements focusing on Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s. We argue that
   from a political perspective even Denmark's war engagements have been
   reactive, risk averse, and with limited popular anchorage, and are
   therefore, less activist than hitherto argued. By tearing off the
   activist label we aim to revitalize the discussion about what Danish
   Foreign and Security policy can and should be at a time when such
   questions have rarely had more relevance.},

Abstract = {The text focuses on the PKK/KCK insurgency in Turkey in 2015-2016.
   Besides the description of the course of the conflict, the article
   provides a detailed picture of the urban warfare in southeast Turkey
   during the selected period. The urban guerrilla campaign of the PKK/KCK
   was a novelty in the 30-year conflict between the insurgent organization
   on one side and the Turkish state on the other. The aim is to identify
   key characteristics and tactical features used by the PKK/KCK and the
   Turkish security forces respectively. The conclusion of the text brings
   an analysis of the conflict together with recommendations for urban
   warfare and the lessons Turkey learned in 2015-2016.},

Title = {Electoral Discrimination: The Relationship between Skin Color and Vote
   Buying in Latin America},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do elections produce racially discriminatory
   outcomes? This article proposes electoral discrimination as an electoral
   mechanism for racial marginalization in indigenous and Afro-descendant
   Latin America. Electoral discrimination occurs when voters are mobilized
   under differential terms of electoral inclusion based on their
   observable characteristics. Using the 2010-2014 rounds of the
   AmericasBarometer and a conjoint experiment, the author finds that skin
   color is a robust predictor of vote buying across countries in the
   region with large, visible black and indigenous populations. A
   significant portion of the relationship between skin color and vote
   buying is due to the disproportionate impacts of race-neutral targeting
   criteria on dark-skinned voters. Observed differences in wealth,
   political and civic engagement, partisanship, political interest,
   interpersonal trust, and geography together explain a portion of the
   skin color-client gap, although the individual contribution of each of
   these factors differs by country. In addition, the author finds an
   independent relationship between skin color and vote buying over and
   above these race-neutral factors. The argument and findings in this
   article speak broadly to the consequences of electoral mobilization in
   ethnoracially stratified states in Latin America and beyond.},

Abstract = {The formal enshrinement of European citizenship left its mark in
   theoretical and scholarly reflection on citizenship in general. In
   particular, European citizenship seemed to support the views of those
   arguing in favour of post-national characterisations of membership, and
   to undermine the case of most traditional theories of citizenship. The
   chapter first presents the citizenship turn in political theory and the
   main ideas brought forward by it, among them the inherent promise of
   European citizenship as the first truly post-national citizenship
   status. One important argument concerns the possible problems of
   ``disembedded{''} theories; theories that fail to understand the breadth
   and scope of new as well as enduring practices of citizenship. This
   argument is taken further when the case of European citizenship is
   discussed. Special emphasis is put on the problems related to
   disregarding the membership- and community-aspects of territorially
   bounded and politically conditioned citizenship in general which emerged
   from the early 1990s onwards. In this part, we further address the
   fragmentation of European citizenship into different personal statuses,
   as well as its demarcation against third country nationals. The chapter
   ends, then, with a plea for a more ``grounded{''} approach to the study
   of European citizenship.},

Abstract = {In this research, we emphasize the issues of collecting environmental
   taxes and spending for environmental protection at the EU 28 plus
   countries as a benchmark and Serbia. We find no correlation between
   environmental taxes in EU and expenses incurred for the environment,
   while at the same time there is a positive, statistically significant
   relationship between the two variables in Serbia. The observed period
   covers 2009-2017. This means that government taxes and budget are the
   main sources of financing green projects in Serbia, therefore, showing
   lower environmental awareness of companies and citizens.},

Abstract = {This article pursues two objectives. First, it provides a literature
   review of research on group radicalization and, second, building on
   previous research about narratives and their influence on
   radicalization, it introduces a new concept for comparative
   radicalization studies: bridging narratives. We use this term to address
   commonalities in the ideological elements found across various
   radicalized groups. As narratives shape perceptions of the world and
   guide processes of identification, they assume an important (internal)
   function in group formation. At the same time, various radical groups
   (ethnic nationalists, Salafist-jihadists and militant leftists) share
   core ideological elements, commonalities that can lead to the creation
   of new coalitions and unexpected alliances (an external function). The
   common factor among them are constructed conceptions of the adversary -
   be they modernity, universalism, Jewish people or feminism. Such
   constructions allow for the fabrication of an enemy as well as specific
   conceptions of hierarchical social orders. We analyze two examples in
   this context: anti-feminism (including heroic or toxic masculinity) and
   the resistance dispositif that promotes vigilante terrorism. This
   approach allows us to investigate processes of group radicalization
   while also taking into account their ideological content as well as the
   formal effects of such content on processes of group-building and the
   dynamics of radical ization. In the final section, we provide
   recommendations for action.},

Abstract = {A standard account of privacy says that it is essentially a kind of
   control over personal information. Many privacy scholars have argued
   against this claim by relying on so-called threatened loss cases. In
   these cases, personal information about an agent is easily available to
   another person, but not accessed. Critics contend that control accounts
   have the implausible implication that the privacy of the relevant agent
   is diminished in threatened loss cases. Recently, threatened loss cases
   have become important because Edward Snowden's revelation of how the NSA
   and GCHQ collected Internet and mobile phone data presents us with a
   gigantic, real-life threatened loss case. In this paper, I will defend
   the control account of privacy against the argument that is based on
   threatened loss cases. I will do so by developing a new version of the
   control account that implies that the agents' privacy is not diminished
   in threatened loss cases.},

Abstract = {Human Rights Organizations (HROs) are very important actors in the
   promotion and protection of human rights, despite being far less
   powerful than the actors primarily reponsible for human rights
   abuses--states. Naming and Shaming is one of the tools most frequently
   employed by HROs in their efforts to increase respect for rights. This
   paper reviews the contributions and limitations of existing efforts to
   collect systematic data that measure the concept of shaming, and
   introduces a class of quantitative approaches that can be employed to
   generate data that measure shaming events. The paper proceeds to
   describe how the process of automated coding works and presents two new
   datasets measuring shaming in 1) a broad cross section of HROs, and 2)
   the international media coded using the approaches. The new datasets are
   compared with existing datasets to illustrate the utility of this
   approach. Finally, we introduce a way to measure the intensity of HRO
   shaming statements and describe how measures of intensity can be used to
   differentiate among approaches of HROs and gauge their effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Radicalization and its prevention have increasingly become the subject
   of public debate in academia and in the political arena. The impact of
   prevention efforts is subject to public scrutiny - not only because
   these efforts, if successful, contribute to the common good, but also
   because many countries have increased public spending on prevention
   based on this justification. Evaluations can analyze impact and
   effectiveness and thereby advance knowledge about how prevention
   operates within different social contexts and what kind of outcomes it
   produces. However, there are significant challenges to developing a
   robust basis of evidence in the field of Prevent ing Violent Extremism
   (PVE). On the one hand, practitioners and scholars debate the notion of
   ``evidence- based approaches{''}, e.g. with regard to methods of data
   collection or appropriate evaluation designs, while some funda mentally
   question the concept itself. On the other hand, expectations regarding
   the capability and feasibility of outcome evaluations are often inflated
   and incompatible with real-world conditions in PVE practice. This
   article addresses some of the challenges that researchers face when
   conducting outcome evaluations in the field of PVE and it suggests
   pragmatic solutions. It sheds light on the state of evaluation in PVE,
   focusing on the German context, and gives recommendations pertaining to
   the commissioning, planning, implementation and utilization of (outcome)
   evaluations.},

Abstract = {The field of International Relations (IR) is barely `international'.
   Scholars have voiced their concerns and as a result, we have witnessed
   calls for diversity and inclusion in IR, be it in publication or in
   syllabi. Notwithstanding, the misrepresentation of non-Western scholars
   in the production of knowledge is significant. This article sheds light
   on the dynamics of publishing from a non-Western perspective and
   reinforces Post-Colonial epistemological critiques in IR. Based on the
   latest dataset from the International Studies Association (ISA)'s
   journals, this article argues that the current setting of IR journals is
   not suited for and receptive of non-Western scholars and epistemologies.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {78},
Number = {4},
Pages = {535-544},
Abstract = {In this short article we consider how Norwegian High North policies have
   been communicated through political ``narratives{''}. Through Narrative
   Political Analysis, we highlight the use of ideas about past, present
   and future in and as ``the north{''}. Domestically, this has meant a
   renarrativisation of identity and an increased focus on elements such as
   ocean and coastal histories; and internationally, it has meant a
   reassessment of Norway's position in the world. No least the country's
   international role has in this narrative been characterised by ideas of
   leadership, sustainability, and responsibility. We conclude that the
   High North narrative has evolved over time, but that the story is far
   from over; it continues at steady pace northwards - and towards the
   ocean.},

Abstract = {In cultural markets, where value is highly uncertain, intermediaries and
   consumers select products by using status signals, including public
   metrics and informal recommendations. However, certain intermediaries
   and consumers risk their statuses and access to informal recommendations
   if they appear to rely on these status signals. Drawing upon the case of
   contemporary art collectors in New York City, I reveal that collectors
   work to maintain their statuses while utilizing status signals through
   performances of `aesthetic confidence'. In these performances, they
   claim a willingness to choose artworks based on their independent and
   good taste. Collectors flexibly cite multiple and sometimes opposing
   qualities of their purchases and interactions as evidence of aesthetic
   confidence. Higher status collectors reinforce status hierarchies
   through their privileged access to resources for displaying aesthetic
   confidence and their policing of lower status collectors' claims.
   Performances of aesthetic confidence are both influenced by status and

Abstract = {Two different understandings of the symbolic repertoire of Islam for
   young British gang members have been used in this article. Islam was
   used to justify participation in gang life, a function of
   rationalisation and protection. Islamic ideas were exploited to
   rationalise their criminal enterprises. The repertoire was also used to
   find a path out of criminality, perceived as a clear structure to
   finding constructive alternatives to reshape their lives. Based on 18
   interviews, this paper examines these aspects of the symbolic
   repertoire, and shows how there is no monolithic interpretation for the
   role played by Islam.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the rationale and activities of the European
   Union Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR) established
   in 2014 with the objective of addressing macro-regional challenges-most
   importantly, the attempt to couple the protection of the Adriatic and
   Ionian seas with the area's economic development-while progressively
   integrating Southeastern European states into the European Union through
   multi-level governance programmes. The results of this scheme, however,
   have been so far unsatisfactory. Through an examination of two highly
   salient issues pertaining to its development, oil and gas exploration in
   the Adriatic Sea and the building of a highway linking Greece to Italy,
   this article shows how the EUSAIR influences only marginally, if at all,
   states' priorities and it does not yet contribute significantly to the
   building of cross-border cooperation and trust. Accordingly, the EUSAIR
   risks becoming irrelevant vis-a-vis the challenges that the macro-region
   is expected to confront.},

Title = {Promises under Pressure: Statements of Reassurance in US Alliances},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The United States frequently reassures allies of its protection by
   stationing troops abroad, visiting allied countries, and making public
   statements. Yet the causes of reassurance in asymmetric alliances-those
   between a great power patron and its weaker allies-are understudied in
   the academic literature. Indeed, many scholars argue that reassurance
   can be counterproductive as it invites allies to free ride or provoke
   their adversaries, knowing that they have their patron's support.
   Despite the drawbacks, I argue that the United States use reassurance to
   discourage their allies from seeking outside options and reducing their
   dependence on the alliance. Patrons such as the United States thus face
   a dilemma wherein they trade-off between withholding reassurance for
   short-term leverage and using reassurance to preserve their long-term
   influence. I test the theory using a new cross-national dataset of US.
   statements of reassurance from 1950 to 2010, and the results provide
   stronger support for my hypotheses than for the competing explanations
   of deterrence, strength from desperation, and shared preferences. The
   findings have implications for understanding how great powers manage
   their alliances, and suggest a pathway through which weaker states can
   shape great powers' foreign commitments.},

Abstract = {Under Putin and Xi, the post-communist authoritarian regimes in Russia
   and China had both initiated anti-corruption programs that exhibited
   some parallels but were also profoundly different. Through a
   contextualized comparison, and drawing on Russian and Chinese sources,
   this article puts forth an institutionalist argument that these
   campaigns were being driven by divergent strategic objectives shaped by
   different formal and informal institutional settings. Whereas Putin's
   more limited anti-corruption program was essentially a defensive move,
   embedded in factionalism, primarily aimed at protecting his political
   power under ``competitive{''} authoritarianism, Xi's broader and deeper
   campaign could be seen as an offensive initiative, targeting
   factionalism with a long-term goal to strengthen the CCP party-state, in
   addition to the obvious short-term objective of his own power
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the Anti-Extradition Bill (Anti-ELAB) Movement and
   uses claim making and claim transformation as a window to look at
   ideological struggle in Hong Kong. The analysis recounts the emergence
   of a specific configuration of movement claims: the supplementation of
   the moderate ``Five Demands{''} with the abstract slogan ``Revolution of
   Our Times{''} and other, more radical demands. The development of the
   configuration is explained by the strategic interactions among movement
   actors, the state, and perceived political opportunities. The
   configuration is also treated as symptomatic of the situation in which
   ``One Country, Two Systems{''} has lost its legitimacy and independence
   remains a perceived impossibility.},

Abstract = {Is public support for social welfare programs' contingent on an
   individual's exposure to risk? Prior work has examined whether tough
   economic times lead people to ``reach out{''} (i.e. become more
   accepting of government expansion of social welfare programs) or ``pull
   back{''} (i.e. become less supportive of welfare). However, these
   studies do not account for the conditional relationship between an
   individual's exposure to risk and his or her risk orientation. Using new
   survey data, we find that an individual's risk orientation moderates the
   relationship between risk exposure and public support for welfare
   spending. When individuals perceive exposure to economic risk, those who
   are risk averse are highly supportive of welfare expansion; those who
   are risk acceptant become less supportive. Broadly, these findings
   suggest that public support for welfare spending is contingent on
   whether an individual perceives exposure to risk and, if so, the
   individual's propensity to tolerate that risk.},

Abstract = {In a multiparty authoritarian election, candidates of the ruling
   coalition may cooperate with each other to defeat the opposition.
   Alternatively, they may compete against each other, as their support
   bases often overlap. To what extent would they compete or cooperate?
   Using disaggregate election data from Hong Kong, we conduct a systematic
   analysis of the intra-elite dynamics in elections. We find that the
   ruling coalition in Hong Kong has strived to suppress intra-camp
   competition in order to optimize nominations and vote division. We also
   find, however, that pro-establishment parties increasingly guard against
   each other, which makes within-camp, cross-party coordination more
   difficult.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This study empirically examines the ways in which anti- and pro-abortion
   rights actors utilize human rights frames with varying success in
   getting them repeated by the news media in the different legal terrains
   of the Republic of Ireland and Canada. Given the results of a content
   analysis of 1,100 news articles on abortion from six newspapers spanning
   five years (2009-2014) during periods of relative policy stability in
   these two countries, this article suggests that social movement actors
   who feel their voices have been ignored in their domestic contexts may
   find human rights frames helpful in attracting news media attention.
   This finding has implications for the way in which international human
   rights language can be harnessed by diverse actors and employed
   domestically in battles over women's rights.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-184},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The political-strategic approach is one of the most employed frameworks
   within the methodologically heterogeneous subfield of populism studies.
   In the last two decades, it has contributed to the analysis of populism
   both in Latin America and the United States and, more recently, in
   Western and Eastern Europe. That being said, a close inspection of its
   axioms and its conceptualization of the phenomenon shows that it is
   built on ill-conceived premises. This article intends to be a
   comprehensive critique of the approach that can contribute to the
   methodological progress of the field. It criticizes the three main
   dysfunctions of the approach: selective rationalism, leader-centrism,
   and normative bias.},

Abstract = {The UK Equality Act 2010 prohibits direct and indirect discrimination
   with respect to nine characteristics: age, disability, gender
   reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity,
   race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. We argue that the
   best way of understanding the Act is to see it as protecting those who
   are vulnerable to systematic disadvantage, partly in virtue of being at
   risk of experiencing discrimination that violates what we call the
   meritocratic principle. If this is a key principle underpinning the Act,
   then there is a compelling case for extending the legislation to include
   the protection of at least one further characteristic, namely,
   appearance. We consider but reject various difficulties that might be
   raised with extending the Act in this way, including the objection that
   those vulnerable to forms of appearance discrimination that violate the
   meritocratic principle could be adequately protected by treating them as
   disabled.},

Title = {Community Kitchens in the Municipalities of Mexico: a Space for Feeding,
   Social Cohesion and Violence Prevention Policy},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {78},
Pages = {163-198},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The program of community kitchens, implemented by the Government of
   Mexico in 2013-2018, had the purpose of providing food to the population
   in poverty, promoting social cohesion, and reinforcing the strategy of
   social prevention of violence in Mexico. The objective of this work is
   to identify the coverage of community kitchens in Mexico's
   municipalities and to analyse whether their distribution responds to the
   lack of access to food as well as to the homicide rate per 100,000
   inhabitants. The study is based on secondary sources of information.
   Based on statistical yearbooks and public databases of the Mexican
   government, an analysis was made to determine whether the municipalities
   that implemented community kitchens had more food poverty and higher
   homicide rates, in contrast to municipalities that did not have
   kitchens. Subsequently, a test was carried out to determine differences
   between the 711 municipalities that did have community kitchens and
   which were grouped according to the degree of violence in the states.
   The results indicate that the targeting of community kitchens is related
   to food poverty and the homicide rate in Mexico's municipalities. It is
   concluded that there was an overlapping of policies to fight food
   poverty and to prevent violence, which shaped social cohesion as the
   articulating axis of this synergy.},

Abstract = {Moral injury has recently gained much attention in the field of military
   psychiatry. However, it has not yet been applied to actors of non-state
   political violence. Investigating the incidence of moral injury in these
   populations would increase the understanding of the negative
   psychological effects of engagement in non-state political violence.
   This study examined whether moral injury could be applied to former
   Provisional IRA members who were active during the ``Troubles{''} in
   Northern Ireland. Nine autobiographical sources from former Provisional
   IRA members were qualitatively analyzed through interpretative
   phenomenological analysis. This analysis revealed preliminary evidence
   of morally injurious experiences and symptoms, and how these symptoms
   were coped with through reparative actions. There was also evidence of
   moral disillusionment with the Provisional IRA, and evidence of
   protective factors that decreased susceptibility to moral injury. The
   preliminary evidence of moral injury in this population supports the
   applicability of the concept and indicates that further investigation is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {The field of environmental justice studies has blossomed into a
   multidisciplinary body of scholarship in the last few decades with
   contributions across the social sciences, humanities, law, and the
   sciences. Our framing of environmental justice scholarship centers on
   the necessity of examining the role of state and institutional violence
   in producing environmental injustice through interlocking systems of
   racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and enslavement. We link themes
   of violence and the role of the state in the expansion of environmental
   justice studies to the major topics of land and resource conflicts,
   prisons and incarceration, and emotions. We draw on this scholarship to
   explore how theories and politics of environmental justice are inflected
   by the constraints and leverage points within racial capitalism, settler
   colonialism, and the afterlives of enslavement. This paper offers an
   assessment of theoretical advances, and charts a course for next
   possible stages of the literature's development and EJ activism.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a significant escalation in Israel's
   relations with the Palestinians, as well as in the internal political
   divide and discourse between left and right. The current research asked
   how these processes of escalation that occur on the sociopolitical level
   came into play in interpersonal political discussions held among a group
   of Jewish-Israeli young adults that partook in an annual academic course
   exposing them to Palestinian narratives, right after the 2014 war in
   Gaza. Particularly, it demonstrated how internal political discourse
   served as a strategy to cope with threats to moral perception of social
   identity. Critical discourse analysis conducted on transcripts of the
   process revealed that the internal political discourse between left wing
   and right wing served as a platform for group members to establish
   fight/flight practices within the group discussion. Research findings
   discussed in light of the sociopolitical context highlight how the focus
   on the political Other-left or right-drew attention from the Palestinian
   Other and by that from the moral consequences of harm doing.},

Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article draws on identity construction, emotions and a notion of
   productive power to address the question of why Swedish policymakers and
   public opinion are becoming increasingly supportive of NATO membership.
   It contributes theoretically by arguing that such textual phenomena
   intertwine with `disciplinary power', which operates on the bodies of
   the subjects of power, exposing them to verbal and physical sanctions, a
   host of complex feelings and enhanced levels of self-disciplining. The
   article analyses 354 editorials and op-eds related to Sweden and NATO,
   published in the four biggest Swedish newspapers in 2014-2018; 1408
   tweets, with a focus on 14 selected NATO campaigners and their advocacy;
   and semi-structured interviews with 12 such influencers. It concludes
   that Swedish NATO campaigners produce and negotiate emotional discourses
   in a way that targets other influencers and potential influencers by
   exposing them to ridicule and allegations of treason. While tendencies
   are similar on both sides of the debate, the article demonstrates that
   productive power currently intertwines with disciplinary power in a way
   that makes anti-NATO advocacy seem more fraught with personal risk than
   pro-NATO campaigning, and joining NATO appear to be the most normal,
   realistic and responsible policy option.},

Abstract = {How do people react to foreign actors' involvement in a conflict in a
   third party? Many studies have explored how individuals react to their
   country's foreign policy choices, as well as how they react to the
   policies targeting their countries. Yet, we know less about how they
   form their attitudes regarding the policies not directly aiming at their
   own countries, and hence, their well-being. Building on intergroup
   relations and employing a social psychological approach, this article
   argues that identity serves as a heuristic through which individuals
   evaluate foreign actors, and their policies targeting in- and out-group
   members living abroad. Conducting a survey experiment in Turkey, I test
   my claims in the context of the Syrian Civil War. The findings of the
   experiments reveal that transnational identity ties have an impact on
   attitude formation: Turks and Kurds express positive/negative attitudes
   towards the USA and Russia conditional on whether their involvement to
   the conflict favor/disfavor their in-group/out-group across the border.
   Broadly speaking, the results show that domestic cleavages are of
   importance in predicting the public's reaction to the developments in
   international politics, which implies a necessity of taking domestic
   politics in designing soft power promotion and public diplomacy
   strategies for many global and regional powers in attempting to win
   hearts and minds abroad.},

Abstract = {Municipalities are self-governing local governments established for the
   purpose of providing and improving social and economic life. However,
   the financial resources of the municipalities are limited, which is why
   they provide additional funds for the implementation of investments,
   among other things by taking out loans. The debt level of municipalities
   can be influenced by a variety of factors. In this paper, the authors
   limit themselves to a selection of factors, which have been divided into
   three areas - legislation, organisation and economy. As far as the
   legislative factor is concerned, we provide an insight into whether the
   total debt of municipalities has decreased with the adoption of the
   Constitutional Act amending Article 148 of the Constitution of the
   Republic of Slovenia (UZ148) and how this affects investment. With
   regard to the organisational factor, the authors try to find out, on the
   basis of correlation analysis, how the size of municipalities, divided
   into three classes according to the number of inhabitants, affects debt,
   current expenditure and total expenditure. With regard to the economic
   factor, the authors examine the impact of the municipalities' own
   revenues on their debt.},

Abstract = {This afterward synthesizes the primary arguments of each of the
   contributors to this volume, and suggests several next steps for
   analyses of gender and the far right. The chapter suggests that there is
   a need for more serious inquiry in four domains: on the intersections of
   extremism and gender-based violence, on how gender relates to
   subcultural and place-based challenges in terms of where women encounter
   extremist messages and first enter far-right scenes; comparative work on
   religion and far-right extremism, including more analyses of evangelical
   Christianity, and the inclusion of more work on gender-based efforts to
   counter far-right mobilization.},

Title = {The Integration of Emerging Powers into Club Institutions: China and the
   Arctic Council},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {51-60},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {How do emerging powers gain inclusion into club institutions, i.e.
   institutions with selective memberships that deliberately seek to avoid
   universality? We present a framework that highlights three factors: an
   emerging power's `fit' to the club's logic of exclusivity, the club's
   possession of goods of value to the emerging power, and the ability of
   the emerging power to incentivize the club to open up via different
   strategies. We hypothesize that, due to the selection effect of choosing
   to seek inclusion in a club, emerging powers will seek integration using
   integrative strategies such as co-optation and persuasion. We apply the
   framework to analyse the case of China's inclusion - along with several
   other countries - as a State Observer in the Arctic Council in 2013.
   While China did use largely integrative strategies, the political
   background to the decision to open up to new observers reveals latent
   features of power bargaining. Moreover, it is unclear whether observer
   status has been sufficient to satisfy China. The case highlights the
   significance of observers in international organizations as well as the
   importance of clubs' logics of exclusivity to their ability to adapt to
   international power shifts.},

Abstract = {The issue of presidential election petitions seems to be repeating
   itself with regularity in much of Africa, thus warranting the need for
   thorough analysis. Utilising the 2018 presidential election petition in
   Zimbabwe, the article examines whether electoral integrity and
   legitimacy can be derived from court-based action. Data for this article
   was gleaned from case law analysis, review of expert analysis from
   constitutional lawyers and election experts, video evidence, in-depth
   and critical reading of grey material. The article concludes that there
   are limitations in relying on litigation in seeking to realise electoral
   justice in much of Africa, including in Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {Linguistic purism in Croatia has long figured as one of the main
   elements of Croatian linguistic nationalism. Though it has been tackled
   in scholarly production, its newest embodiment, the so-called Sreter
   prizes, has not. The Sreter prizes are an award contest, established by
   the editorial board of the highly nationalist linguistic journal, Jezik
   (Serbo-Croatian ``language{''}), in which competitors vie for prizes
   awarded for the ``best new Croatian word,{''} often referred to as
   ``neo-Croatian.{''} This article explores the narratives centered around
   the Sreter prizes, tackling additionally the lexical and morphological
   features of the newly minted ``Croatian{''} lexemes.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to ongoing debates on security
   community-building in international relations (IR) by focusing on the
   productive role of discursive contestation in this process. It builds on
   recent work associated with the ``practice{''} turn, discourse theory,
   and the study of security communities in the Global South to propose a
   new understanding of how the diversification of security governance
   impacts security community-building. The article develops an original
   discourse-based approach that conceptualizes security community-building
   as a polysemic, omnidirectional, and contested process in which social
   agents debate the meaning of security and the boundaries of community.
   It applies this approach to the case of Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) to show how contestation over the organization's
   identity as a security community ``in the making{''} takes place along
   two dimensions. First, different (and potentially incompatible) versions
   of the community compete for dominance. Second, contestation also
   unfolds ``internally,{''} among social agents who agree on which version
   ought to prevail. I illustrate this part of the argument through an
   examination of the debate over ASEAN's identity as a
   ``people-centered{''} community. The demonstration is supported by the
   analysis of ``texts{''} enacted in the discursive field where the
   security community is talked into existence, as well as interviews with
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {In this article, I employ an interactionist perspective from sociology
   to examine the dynamics of de-stigmatisation of nuclear-armed India
   after the 1998 nuclear tests. Drawing on Erving Goffman and other
   interactionist scholars, I study the social dimension of India's
   transformation from `nuclear pariah' to a `responsible' nuclear-armed
   power that plays by the global non-proliferation rules even though it
   remains outside of the NPT club. I trace the interactive process of the
   normalisation of India's deviant identity in nuclear politics,
   highlighting the key role of the United States in the de-stigmatisation
   of India's outsider status, as well as the power-laden factors
   underpinning the process. Beyond the empirical contribution, I elaborate
   on discursive strategies that states employ to normalise their disvalued
   identities. By conceptually unpacking the logic of normalisation and
   de-stigmatisation in international politics, I aim to contribute to the
   current debates in International Relations about norms and deviance in
   world order.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the role of trust in the underground structures of
   the Polish opposition in the 1980s. The empirical material on which the
   analysis is based comprises historical sources concerning the history of
   one of the opposition groups in Warsaw, formed around an underground
   trade union structure (Inter-Enterprise Coordinating Committee),
   underground periodical ({''}Wola{''}) and a few other oppositional
   initiatives. The author looks for answers to the following questions:
   What types of trust can we find in the underground? What did it mean
   that one conspirator trusted another? and What was trust based on?
   First, the author characterizes the Solidarity movement after the
   imposition of martial law and shows why during this time the problem of
   trust was so important. Then he explains why this topic is interesting
   and useful not only for a historian of Solidarity but also for other
   researchers. He places his research in the context of historians' works
   about trust, and especially about the problem of trust in communist
   countries. The author proposes two classifications of trust in the
   underground. He distinguishes trust regarding the following traits of
   colleagues: reliability, discretion, and integrity. The second
   classification concerns the basis for trust. The first type
   ({''}old{''}) is trust based on prior contact. The second type
   ({''}new{''}) is trust built during underground activity. In the
   conclusion, the author considers the role of trust in underground
   activity. The author puts forward the thesis that in opposition
   activities, trust was much more important than shared political views,
   to which historians of the Polish opposition generally attach great
   importance.},

Abstract = {Most developed countries have accepted, in principle at least, the
   50-year-old commitment of contributing 0.7 per cent of gross national
   income to supporting the development of developing countries. But what
   ifallcountries made a universal development commitment, meaning a scaled
   contribution? We propose a new universal and scaled financial commitment
   to development, informed by but not necessarily identical to official
   development assistance. This paper: (1) sets out how a new era is
   emerging of higher global ambitions - for example, to end poverty; (2)
   proposes a new way to raise and govern international public funds; and
   (3) discusses the possible size and use of contributions, and the
   evolution in global governance and democracy that a new deal would
   entail. We conclude with a set of questions that the proposal raises.},

Abstract = {In this study I use a survey experiment to test whether the prospect of
   White demographic decline affects attitudes toward treatment of
   terrorism suspects. I find that when White subjects are informed that
   Whites are projected to become a demographic minority in the United
   States by 2060 they are more likely to approve of the use of torture on
   terrorism suspects. In contrast, White subjects who are informed that
   Whites are expected to remain a demographic majority through 2030 are
   not. I also find that the effect of White decline salience on support
   for torture of terror suspects is mediated through a heighted perception
   of threat due to terrorism.},

Abstract = {Following the rise in far-right inspired terrorist attacks globally,
   social media and electronic communications companies have been
   criticized, mainly by politicians, for allowing far-right extremist
   content to be available. This article is a comparative legal study
   focusing on Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.'
   legal provisions regarding the right to freedom of expression, hate
   crime, and proscription of terrorist organizations. This study found a
   disparity in the form of expression protected under this right. This
   disparity widens further when related to hate crime and proscribing
   groups as terrorist organizations. As such, social media and
   communications companies have difficulty setting at global level a
   baseline in determining whether content is legitimate commentary or is
   extremism promoting or inciting hatred and violence. The article
   concludes with a recommendation for how states can provide comparable
   legislation on hate crime as they have done in relation to Islamist
   inspired extremism. This will assist social media and communications
   companies in removing content and suspending accounts. These companies
   are not the guardians of freedom of expression, that is the role of
   states' legislatures and judiciary.},

Abstract = {What insights and advantages do rhetorical approaches offer over other
   methods of exploring social and political discourse? This article aims
   to clarify the contribution of rhetorical analysis by exploring its
   distinctive, hermeneutic attention to public speech. Public speaking is,
   accordingly, viewed as a practice of assembling meaningful
   interpretations in specific situations. Central here is a temporal
   dimension. Analysing rhetoric involves grasping discourse, on the one
   hand, as concretely situated in response to proximate constraints and,
   on the other hand, as a medium to move beyond the situation towards a
   future. Following John Caputo's reading of Derrida, I argue that,
   examined rhetorically, public speech enacts a `negotiation' of past and
   future, intertwining conditional - and hence partially calculable -
   positions with an `unconditional promise' to prepare for what comes.
   Although compatible with other approaches, rhetorical analysis is
   uniquely attuned to this intrinsically ethical and political quality of
   discursive action.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines conservative Christians' participation
   in two legal processes: the review of Jamaica's 2009 Sexual Offences Act
   and related laws in 2017 and the Belizean constitutional challenge by
   Caleb Orozco in 2011-2016. It reveals how some conservative Christians'
   active participation foregrounds struggles over morality and nationhood.
   It also highlights common strategies used in their mobilisations;
   namely, an appeal to certain notions of democracy, whilst asserting the
   continuous relevance of certain Christian principles and teachings.
   These engagements address the present role of religion in the public
   spheres of these `postcolonial' nation-states and the possible dilemmas
   posed for democracy.},

Title = {Determinants of corruption in China: a policy perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to investigate the major
   determinants for corruptions in the People's Republic of China
   (hereafter China) using provincial panel data from 1998 to 2012 through
   the fixed effects and Instrumental Variables (IV) method. This paper
   uniquely considers the impacts of economic policy uncertainty on
   corruption in China. The study identified that the level of corruption
   has a positive relationship with the factors such as Foreign Direct
   Investments (FDI), uncertainty, economic development, public sector
   employees, size of provincial population and income inequality. And it
   was found that corruption has no correlation with salaries of public
   employees, women's enrollment, anticorruption efforts, technological
   development, media and education. The study suggests that women's
   enrollment is pretty unique, which depresses corruption in China.
   Further, it reveals the impact of technological development to reduce
   the rent-seeking activities. This study shows that there is a positive
   relationship between uncertainty and the level of corruption. The
   increase of uncertainty would lead to distract economic agents and
   economic drivers. The study suggests initiating serious economic and
   political reforms, since the level of corruption marginally decreases
   the economic growth of the country. Further, it emphasizes that the
   necessity of a regular framework to know how and why corruption
   saturates on the pillars of the state to succeed in anti-corruption
   policies.},

Abstract = {Understanding of the role of ideas in non-paradigmatic policy change has
   been advanced by the introduction of the concept of bricolage, which
   suggests that reformers are likely to piece together ideas from
   disparate sources. However, the current literature is limited in several
   ways. As such, this article proposes three main contributions to the
   field. First, the use of bricolage as a pragmatic strategy is perfectly
   compatible with actors being motivated by relatively fixed policy goals
   or seeking to imitate policies from elsewhere. Second, the creative use
   of ideas can be limited by the imposition of narrow frames or problem
   definitions by the victors of agenda-setting battles. Third, the use of
   bricolage comes with more potential for conflict and unintended
   consequences than has been recognised. This argument is illustrated
   through an analysis of healthcare reform in the United States in
   2009/10, focusing particularly on the fate of the `public option'.},

Abstract = {Pluralist norms, which prescribe certain attitudes of openness and
   mutual respect for diverging views, have long been considered a central
   pillar of liberal democracy. While democratic theorists have championed
   these values, they have been conflicted as to the capacity of political
   parties to carry them. Partisanship is widely recognized as an essential
   institution of democratic regimes but it has also been traditionally
   associated with intransigence rather than tolerance. This paper
   investigates this theoretical debate from an empirical standpoint,
   asking whether partisans can be carriers of pluralist values. It relies
   on focus-group methodology and software-assisted textual analysis to
   evaluate the extent to which the discourse of 117 party members in two
   different national contexts, France and Hungary, resonates with the
   pluralist worldview. The results of this study provide key empirical
   insights into the nature of partisanship, demonstrating wide variations
   in the extent to which partisans uphold pluralist principles, but also
   their capacity to do so at a stringent level.},

Abstract = {In cross-national studies, ethnic exclusion is robustly associated with
   the onset of violent challenge to incumbent regimes. But significant
   variation remains at the subnational level-not all members of an
   excluded ethnic group join in challenge. This article accounts for
   intra-ethnic group variation in terms of the network properties of local
   communities, nested within ethnic groups, and the informal ties that
   regimes forge to some segments of the ethnically excluded population.
   Mobilization within an excluded ethnic group is most likely among local
   communities where members are densely linked to one another and lack
   network access to state-controlled resources. Drawing on a case study of
   the Syrian city of Homs in the 2011 uprising, this article demonstrates
   how the Syrian regime's strategies of managing the Sunni population of
   Homs shaped patterns of challenge. On the one hand, the state's
   toleration of spontaneous settlements on the city's periphery helped to
   reproduce dense network ties. On the other hand, the regime's informal
   bargains with customary leaders instrumentalized those ties to manage
   local populations. These bargains could not withstand the regime's use
   of violence against challengers, which meant that these same local
   networks became crucial factors in impelling and sustaining costly
   antiregime mobilization.},

Abstract = {In order to face the challenges associated with the so-called revolution
   4.0 and the digital transformation, it is critical to rethink the
   capacities that public organizations have. Among these capacities, those
   associated with management and data analysis stand out. The article aims
   to provide evidence and reflections to this debate, both at a
   theoretical and applied level. To this end, a conceptual framework is
   developed through two key approaches: that of analytical capacities,
   focusing on the organizational and systemic level, and that of data
   governance. With the integrated analytical framework, the case study of
   Barcelona City Council is carried out. This case includes different
   initiatives that provide evidence and arguments both on the achievements
   and on the unresolved challenges. The main findings that arise from the
   analysis are the importance of the strategy associated to a political
   and managerial leadership, as well as the relevance of the
   organizational configuration and the establishment of roles and
   responsibilities of the different actors involved. Additionally, the
   need to establish new models of relationship with the environment to
   generate shared institutional intelligence, associated to open learning
   and innovation processes, is highlighted. The conclusions highlight the
   validity of analytical schemes that integrate data governance with the
   development of analytical capacities that allow public administrations
   to face of future challenges. At the applied level, lessons learned are
   provided in relation to the organizational leadership of the
   transformation processes of public organizations. A special attention is
   given to the design of the central data governance unit which combines
   centralization at the conceptual and strategic level and the
   decentralization at the operational level, involving both internal and
   external actors.},

Abstract = {Theoretical approaches and applied research on the relationship between
   technological changes and innovations and public administration are
   usually characterized by a type of work program that explains the
   changes in public administration based on the technological
   transformations and innovations taking place in ``society{''}. However,
   comparative experience, and also that of Latin America, shows how in
   multiple occasions the technological changes and innovations produced
   within public administration systems have impacted on social processes,
   re-enrolling economic and social actors, including large business
   actors, in these innovations and producing changes with intensive use of
   ICT which transformed social associations at the national, continental
   and global levels. The article explores the cases of changes in
   financial administration, procurement and contracting and public revenue
   systems produced in Latin America, using the science and technology
   studies of the Network Actor Theory. It addresses its implications in
   relation to the transformations known as the fourth industrial
   revolution, the different ways of dealing with the processes of change,
   innovation, adaptation or modernization of public administrations, and
   the way in which innovation in State administrations, especially in the
   fourth technological revolution, can lead to broader social
   transformations.},

Abstract = {This study reports the findings from an interactive research project in
   which academics and practitioners worked closely together in designing a
   new, criteria-based assessment tool that enables local municipalities to
   measure the degree of collaboration, innovation and crime-preventive
   effect in publicly financed projects intended to keep at-risk youth out
   of criminal activities. The assessment tool also offers a much-needed
   opportunity for researchers to study the extent to which cross-boundary
   collaboration may spur the development of innovative solutions, which in
   turn may help to prevent youth crime. The key empirical finding is that
   collaboration has a strong association with public innovation, which in
   turn has a strong association with the ability of local projects to help
   prevent crime. The result makes an important contribution to the
   expanding field of public innovation research in which quantitative
   studies that combine process evaluation and impact studies are extremely

Abstract = {This article examines the origins, structure and role of the Polish
   counterterrorism system, which is then set against the rising threat
   posed by state and non-state actors employing hybrid warfare tools. We
   demonstrate the usefulness of anti-terrorist regulations, not only in
   counteracting terrorist groups, but also in the thwarting of operations
   engaged in by various entities waging hybrid warfare. We argue that
   lessons learned from the international struggle against terrorism can
   contribute to the development of proper prescriptions that seek to
   tackle hybrid threats. Extensive anti-terror instruments and measures
   implemented since 2016 are among the key elements in the contemporary
   defense and security doctrine being pursued by Poland. However, while
   the new regulations have provided intelligence agencies with strong
   powers that markedly enhance their capabilities regarding the
   recognition of hybrid threats, the same flexible legal regulations,
   subject to broad interpretation, may also serve a partisan agenda, and
   thus endanger the rule of law.},

Abstract = {Why have Central American states been able to deliver public goods in
   the energy sector when most experiences of energy regionalism in Latin
   American have run into deadlock? Through process-tracing the different
   factors that transformed the Central American Electric System (SIEPAC)
   from a policy-idea into a fully operative supranational market, this
   article finds that the Interamerican Development Bank was the
   orchestrator of governments, national utilities, and extra-regional
   state and market actors resulting in the production of energy
   infrastructure and improved energy security for Central American
   countries. Through three mechanisms-brokering, agenda-setting, and
   assistance-the Interamerican Development Bank kept the cooperation
   agenda ongoing despite coordination problems and member states'
   divergent preferences. The article concludes that regional development
   banks are particularly well-suited orchestrators of highly technical
   regionalism initiatives, such as energy integration, because they
   combine the input-legitimacy of an intergovernmental organization, the
   know-how of an epistemic community, and the resources of a bank. More
   research is needed to compare the role of various regional development
   banks in regionalism initiatives in the global South.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to critically examine how the mainstream
   International Relations (IR) theoretical perspectives - realist,
   liberalist, and constructivist - make sense of the relationships between
   Self and Others in explaining the rise of China in IR. Our argument is
   two-fold. First, although mainstream IR perspectives are believed to
   produce objective, neutral, scientific, and universal knowledge about
   reality and how the world works, they are not value-free explanations
   but normative approaches that serve the US/West hegemony, and
   Orientalism appears to constitute the hidden normative underpinning of
   those perspectives. Second, considering mainstream IR perspectives as
   problem-solving approaches for the hegemonic US/West reveals that the
   hegemonic Self uses the logic of conquest, conversion, and socialisation
   to deal with the Other, rising China.},

Abstract = {Global Performance Assessments (GPAs), which rank countries on a range
   of policy areas, can encourage domestic demands for policy reform. Yet
   can they also affect at what level of government-local or
   national-citizens want reform to take place? We theorize that, by
   emphasizing how countries fare relative to others, GPAs prompt citizens
   to view domestic policy underperformance as a ``national problem
   requiring national solutions.{''} This increases calls for vesting
   policymaking authority in the hands of central governments. We argue
   that this effect should be most salient when underperformance is
   presented as a threat to a country's security because it induces
   citizens to ``rally `round the flag.{''} To test our theory, we field an
   original survey experiment in the United States using fictitious news
   articles manipulating both the source of performance monitoring
   information and how it is presented. In line with our prediction,
   respondents are most likely to demand policy centralization when
   underperformance is framed using GPAs and citizens are primed to think
   of low scores as a threat to their country's security. These results
   indicate that GPAs could eventually increase calls for expanding the
   purview of national-level politicians over policymaking.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-261},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article seeks to integrate some of the premises of historical
   materialism into the English School (ES) of international relations in
   order to help overcome the frequent mismatch between ES theory and
   concrete historical practice. Because norms and rules, as the benchmark
   of `order', constitute the defining analytical framework of the ES,
   deviations from such codes of conduct signal the inexplicable presence
   of disorder. This theoretical limit can be seen in three examples of ES
   analysis on the rise and evolution of Latin America, which separately
   focus on the determinant role of rights, recognition and norms. Yet the
   assumed primacy of these codes of conduct produces a series of paradoxes
   that cannot be solved within the confines of inter-subjective norms and
   rules. In contrast, the article proposes a class-relational analysis
   that articulates the diverse norms and discourses of agents through the
   concrete socio-political relations of power and contestation in which
   they are embedded. Drawing upon a critical Gramscian approach, the
   article will offer an historical reconstruction of Latin America's
   emergence that better grounds the actual practice of rights, recognition
   and norms, and thus facilitating a deeper analytical purchase of ES
   concepts by recognizing the inextricable relationship between order and
   disorder in the making of international society.},

Abstract = {Examination of the negotiated relationships between feminist social
   movements and state institutions controlled by the leftist Farabundo
   Marti National Liberation Front political party in El Salvador based on
   ethnographic research in the semiurban municipality of Suchitoto shows
   that ``critical collaboration{''} characterizes the local feminist
   movement's efforts to work alongside state actors in the formulation,
   implementation, and oversight of public policies addressing women's
   rights, violence against women, and gender-equitable community
   development. Theoretically, critical collaboration shows that civil
   society actors interested in deepening emancipatory processes under
   moderate leftist governments need not be subordinated to constituted
   state power or contentiously confront it. Rather, by pursuing their
   agendas through critical and autonomous engagement with ostensibly
   sympathetic state institutions, feminist movements may engender
   practices and demands for flexible and responsive ``cogovernance{''}
   that radically transforms elements of the state and society in the long
   run.
   A partir de una investigacion etnografica en el municipio semiurbano de
   Suchitoto se hace un analisis de las relaciones negociadas entre los
   movimientos sociales feministas y las instituciones estatales
   controladas por el partido politico de izquierda Frente Farabundo Marti
   de Liberacion Nacional en El Salvador. Se muestra como la ``colaboracion
   critica{''} ha sido la caracteristica de los esfuerzos del movimiento
   feminista local para trabajar junto con los actores estatales en la
   formulacion, implementacion y supervision de politicas publicas
   relacionadas con los derechos de las mujeres, la violencia contra las
   mujeres y un desarrollo comunitario equitativo en materia de genero.
   Teoricamente, la colaboracion critica muestra que los actores de la
   sociedad civil interesados en profundizar los procesos emancipatorios
   bajo gobiernos de izquierda moderados no necesitan estar subordinados al
   poder estatal ni tampoco confrontarlo. Mas bien, al promover sus agendas
   a traves de un compromiso critico y autonomo con instituciones estatales
   aparentemente comprensivas, los movimientos feministas pueden generar
   practicas y demandas de ``cogobierno{''} flexible y receptivo que, a
   largo plazo, transformen radicalmente elementos tanto del Estado como la
   sociedad.},

Abstract = {This research proposes a methodology for extracting and analyzing
   geographical perspectives of terrorists and insurgents from online
   textual media. The information age has afforded organizations platforms
   that can be used to control their own media messages. Given that power,
   terrorist groups are able to create customized messages and define
   themselves in their own eyes on an international scale, often generating
   widespread sympathies and increased popularity. Within their online
   messaging, important information is provided that can potentially unveil
   geopolitical strategies. A mixed-method approach comprised of
   computer-aided content analysis, manual content analysis, and
   cartographic visualization is applied to ISIS's Dabiq magazine as a case
   study to demonstrate the utility of this methodology. This research
   highlights the importance of considering the territoriality of terror
   groups and movements in geohistorical and present-day contexts.},

Abstract = {This research investigates whether political, social and economic
   characteristics of local communities are related to data sharing between
   city departments and businesses and nonprofit organizations. Research
   about data sharing typically emphasizes managerial, organizational and
   technological factors in departments, largely neglecting community
   characteristics. The willingness to share data depends on the
   relationships between the government and external stakeholders, and
   these relationships are shaped by the political, social and economic
   characteristics of local communities. Using data from a 2016 survey of
   2,500 department heads in 500 US cities with populations between 25,000
   and 250,000, we find that data sharing increases in cities where
   communities are politically engaged, hold Democratic preferences, and
   there are higher rates of public sector employment and economic
   inequality. Data sharing is less likely to occur in communities with
   higher education and more nonprofit associations.},

Abstract = {The democratic transition in Tunisia and free and fair elections that
   followed offer a unique opportunity to assess whether the experience of
   participating in successful political efforts translates into subsequent
   political participation. We consider whether participation in a
   democratic revolution is associated with greater rates of participation
   in nascent `normal' democratic processes. Leveraging data from two
   surveys fielded in the wake of the revolution and the Constituent
   Assembly elections that followed, we find scant evidence of a
   relationship between protest participation and subsequent turnout. We
   also consider the possibility that young - presumably more
   impressionable - Tunisians were more likely to be `activated' by protest
   participation. However, our findings run directly counter to this
   expectation. Our findings show that the socializing effects of
   monumental historical events can be strikingly circumscribed.},

Abstract = {This article argues that many of the lessons learned and achievements
   made in the measurement of human rights over the past four decades are
   equally applicable to the measurement of modern slavery. It shows that
   modern slavery encompasses a significant subset of human rights found in
   international law, the parameters of which can be delineated and
   operationalized in ways that make the phenomenon amenable to measurement
   across a wide range of different data. These include events-based data,
   standards-based data, survey-based data, and new forms of data made
   possible through machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)
   applications. The article shows that the measurement of modern slavery
   needs to overcome many of the same challenges that confront efforts at
   measuring human rights, including the fundamental problem of
   unobservability, inherent bias through the use of convenience reporting,
   and the specification of the concept of modern slavery itself.
   Overcoming these challenges opens up new possibilities to make what many
   claim to be an intractable problem of development tractable and helps
   contribute to the Sustainable Development Goal target to end modern
   slavery by 2030.},

Abstract = {This article is about the first attempts of Soviet-French rapprochement
   in the military sphere in the early 1930s. It is based largely upon
   unpublished documents from the Soviet foreign policy (AVPRF), military
   (RGVA) and the communist party (RGASPI) archives in Moscow. It contends
   that for the top leadership of the USSR the political rapprochement with
   France did not necessarily lead to making a fully-fledged military
   alliance. Despite the attitude of Soviet diplomats in Paris, Moscow
   remained distrustful of the French. It considered military cooperation
   with them as a way to reinforce the Red Army and strengthen
   international positions of the USSR without taking excessive
   obligations.},

Abstract = {In the Xi Jinping era of rising central power and reduced local
   autonomy, is there still room for policy experimentation? If any, what
   is the nature of this innovative behavior? This article argues that the
   party state still allows much room for policy innovation, only that this
   space for innovation is conditioned by the Party's concern for political
   control. Drawing on original field research, the article examines two
   cases of the Chinese Communist Party's innovation in personnel
   management, with a particular focus on reforming the Performance
   Evaluation System (PES) to better incentivize cadres to fulfill work
   targets. The analyses of the systemic changes of the PES resulting from
   the Party's innovation efforts as well as the nature of such changes
   show that despite the Party's tireless efforts to reinvent the PES
   regime so as to better motivate cadres to fulfill work targets, these
   efforts are undermined at the same time by the Party's pursuit of
   bureaucratic stability, personnel control, and grip on power. The
   research seeks to bring findings about the PES into more meaningful
   conversations with the scholarship on policy innovation and
   experimentation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the nexus between Active
   Labour Market Policies (ALMP) and change in unemployment rate. A dynamic
   simultaneous-equation panel data models have been applied to 16 OECD
   countries studied over the 2000-2015 period. Our results indicate that
   the ALMP expenditure leads to the reduction of the change in
   unemployment. The ALMPs appear to be efficient in reducing the
   unemployment rate in these countries. Besides, any increase of the
   change in unemployment rate leads to the decrease of the ALMP
   expenditure. This occurs in connection to the high costs of the active
   spending during periods of recession and to the pressure it makes to
   provide a continuous income to the unemployed through unemployment
   benefits.},

Title = {Star(tup) wars: decoupling task from relationship conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3, SI},

Abstract = {Purpose
   A strong relation between task and relationship conflict has toxic
   impact on teams and poses a high-risk factor in startup organizations.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of
   conflict behavior and related coping strategies on the relationship
   between task and relationship conflict in startup teams.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors conducted surveys among 100 Dutch and German startup members
   (Study 1) and 75 Belgium startup members (Study 2). In Study 3, 75
   startup members completed weekly surveys in 11 consecutive weeks.
   Findings
   Both Study 1 and 2 show that the positive association between task and
   relationship conflict is buffered by problem-solving conflict behavior
   while this relationship is amplified by the use of avoiding strategies
   in startup teams. Similarly, the results of Study 3 show that individual
   and team-level problem-focused coping over a period of 11 weeks buffers
   the association between task and relationship conflict during this
   period, while individual disengagement coping potentiates it.
   Originality/value
   This study adds to the literature on conflict management and
   entrepreneurship by studying conflict behavior as a moderator in the
   association between task and relationship conflict in startup teams.
   Moreover, it takes a comprehensive perspective by including coping
   strategies conceptually related to conflict behaviors at both individual
   and teamlevel, as moderators in this relationship. The results of this
   study provide practical recommendations for entrepreneurs on how to
   prevent conflict escalation via conflict-oriented behaviors and more
   general coping strategies.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the Civic Circles Movement that paved the way for
   Viktor Orban's Fidesz party from the opposition to enduring political
   rule. It is demonstrated that through extending and connecting the
   right's grassroots networks and hierarchical organisations, reinventing
   its holidays and heroes, and mobilising followers for contention, the
   movement has transformed civil society. The article contributes to the
   recent literature on illiberal parties and leaders by showing that the
   civic activism of educated middle-class supporters may be as important
   for their rise and resilience in power as the votes of less educated
   groups within their constituency.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes `post-colonial sovereignty games' by focusing on the
   dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles within the context of the
   Netherlands and its Caribbean dependent territories. The Kingdom of the
   Netherlands was comprised of the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles,
   and Aruba. Since 10/10/10, the Dutch Kingdom has reconstituted as the
   Netherlands and `autonomous countries' and `public bodies' in the
   Caribbean. The paper argues `good governance' and `neocolonialism' are
   strategically invoked in these multilevel postcolonial sovereignty games
   where simultaneous trends of autonomy, integration, and more Netherlands
   involvement are `sui generis' in international relations.},

Abstract = {The political cycle and its impact of economy is usually monitored at
   the macroeconomic level. Nonetheless, abroad studies are emerging which
   analyzed the impact of the political cycle on economy on the level of
   territorial self-government. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the
   impact of the political cycle on the financial management of
   municipalities on a sample of 69 district towns in Slovak Republic in
   time period 2007-2017. The results point that to significant
   heterogeneity, whether at the level of individual towns or when
   comparing the results for individual years. As a result of the
   differences observed at the level of the political cycles, we analyzed
   the differences between the results in each year of each political cycle
   through CV-TOPSIS method. The financial management of the analyzed towns
   are very diverse and the increase of town's expenditures is not always
   linked to the political cycle.},

Abstract = {Since mid-2016, several policy initiatives have signaled a move forward
   in European defense co-operation, with a return to the EU as the vehicle
   of choice. The change is notable, considering the prior ineffectiveness
   of the EU's defense cooperation initiatives, and the trends observed in
   the past decade where member states opted for co-operation outside EU
   frameworks. Several crises and strategic changes, including Russia's
   annexation of Crimea, Brexit, and US retrenchment from Europe make the
   choice for more EU defense appear as self-evident. However, far from an
   obvious cause-effect relationship, a look at the actors and processes
   behind decision-making reveals that it is only through a conjunction of
   separate but converging strategies from EU and member states actors,
   that a `window of opportunity' was opened and seized in 2016. Our
   analysis examines the distinct motives and strategies, especially, of
   the commission, Germany and France, in pursuing their agendas for
   European defense.},

Title = {Measuring Nation States' Deliberativeness: Systematic Challenges,
   Methodological Pitfalls, and Strategies for Upscaling the Measurement of

Abstract = {A theoretically reflected and empirically valid measurement of nation
   states' democratic quality must include an assessment of polities'
   deliberativeness. This article examines the assessment of
   deliberativeness suggested by two sophisticated contemporary
   measurements of democratic quality, that is, the Democracy Barometer and
   the Varieties of Democracy-project. We feature two sets of challenges,
   each measurement of deliberativeness must meet: First, it must address
   the methodological challenges arising in the course of conceptualizing,
   operationalizing, and aggregating complex concepts (see Munck and
   Verkuilen, 2002). Second, attempts to measure nation states'
   deliberativeness are confronted with specific conceptual and systematic
   challenges which we derive from recent deliberative democracy
   scholarship. We argue that both Democracy Barometer and Varieties of
   Democracy-project provide highly sophisticated assessments of democratic
   quality, but ultimately fail to capture nation states
   ``deliberativeness{''} in a theoretically reflected and methodologically
   sound manner. We examine the methodological, pragmatic, and systematic
   reasons for these shortcomings. The crucial task for measurements of
   nation states' deliberativeness consists in providing a conceptual
   approach and methodological framework for ``upscaling{''} existing
   meso-level measurements (such as the DQI). The concluding section
   presents conceptual and methodological strategies that can enable
   researchers to meet these challenges and to provide a theoretically
   grounded and empirically valid measurement of nation states'
   deliberativeness.},

Abstract = {As hybrid regimes persist, we need to better understand their behaviour
   in international affairs. Concentrating on business actors, we use a
   qualitative study of Turkey's foreign relations with Azerbaijan,
   Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in the period 2014-2018 to explore how
   hybrid regimes disseminate regime-related principles. Inspired by the
   concepts of neo-patrimonialism and limited access orders, we argue that
   hybrid regimes lack cohesion and cannot compel all relevant actors to
   disseminate a coherent set of regime-related principles. Depending on
   their domestic environment, Turkish actors transmit both neo-patrimonial
   closure and competitive openness, which makes Turkey's hybrid regime a
   dual agent of transition.},

   Constructions of Political Disagreement and Opinion Climate in the
   Context of Brexit},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study applied a social representations approach to investigate the
   ways in which constructions of perceived political disagreement and the
   prevailing opinion climate were implicated in people's construals of
   political participation in the context of the United Kingdom European
   Union referendum of 2016. Interviews were conducted with 19 residents of
   the United Kingdom who voted to remain in the referendum, located in
   constituencies which represented diverse opinion climates in relation to
   the referendum. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that public
   opinion was a dilemmatic social representation; it was inscrutable and
   often ill-informed but also volatile and disruptive, which left open the
   possibility of it moving towards a more pro-EU position. Importantly,
   constructions of a polarized and dysfunctional political system worked
   to sustain a mode of political engagement which prioritized and
   positioned as efficacious individual rather than collective anti-Brexit
   political behavior. This implies that people may prefer different types
   of political participation depending on the opinion climate which they
   occupy and the way in which they construe it. Findings are discussed in
   relation to previous work linking meta-representations to political
   behavior and expression, and the implications of the findings for
   emergent forms such as Brexit are elaborated.},

Abstract = {Energy is an increasingly politicised commodity which, however, retains
   its particular technical and economic characteristics, thus complicating
   the work of foreign policy-makers. The article draws on the contribution
   of the cognitive approach to the analysis of foreign policy-making and
   investigates the energy-foreign policy nexus in the EU and the US
   through the lens of the different cognitive structures used by actors to
   understand the world energy scenery. In this conceptual framework, it
   examines how the energy-foreign policy linkage has evolved in the EU and
   the US, to what extent energy is still perceived as a useful instrument
   serving foreign policy objectives, and in reverse, how far energy policy
   objectives are integrated in foreign policy-making. Through this
   comparative exercise, it concludes by identifying differences and
   potential patterns of convergence between the EU and the US.},

Abstract = {Negotiations leading to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have
   dominated the diplomacy of global development in the past years. The
   paper looks at the actions and motivations of a relatively new
   development actor, Hungary, which co-chaired the United Nations General
   Assembly's Open Working Group on SDGs, and thus had a highly visible
   position during the talks. Hungary had a key priority of having a SDG on
   water-related issues, driven mainly by its perceived comparative
   advantage in the sector. Using the insights of the literature on small
   state influence in multilateral negotiations, the paper argues that
   Hungarian diplomats used alliance building as well as reputational and
   framing strategies to counter the structural disadvantages of the
   country's small state status, and were successful in shaping the final
   outcome. However, the Hungarian government did not act out of a strong
   commitment to sustainable global development, but rather used the forum
   to brand itself as an expert on water issues, with the hope of future
   business benefits.},

Abstract = {This article explores the structural diversity of intraministerial
   organization over time. Based on organization theory, it proposes a
   generic typology for intraministerial units applicable to any
   hierarchically structured government organization. We empirically
   investigate the critical case of the German federal bureaucracy. By
   classifying its subunits, we analyze the longitudinal development of
   structural differentiation and its correspondence to denominational
   variety. The data stem from a novel international dataset, covering all
   ministries between 1980 and 2015. We find that intraministerial
   structure differentiates over time, across and within ministries. A
   stable core of traditional Weberian structure is complemented by
   structurally innovative intraministerial units. We conclude that the
   German federal bureaucracy is more diverse than suggested in previous
   literature. Our findings indicate that less Weberian bureaucracies are
   at least as structurally diverse and that more reform-driven
   bureaucracies will have experienced at least as many changes in
   structural diversity.},

Abstract = {The processes of datafication, digitization and automation of healthcare
   and medicine are making new types and data available for analysis, and
   at greater volume. While the newly available data is often hailed as a
   solution to various problems in healthcare, there is only little
   discussion about who the use of such data empowers and who bears the
   costs. The use of healthcare data for ``nudging{''}-e.g. to get patients
   to adopt healthier lifestyles-is a case in point: While such
   interventions are presumed to be cheap and effective, I argue that their
   value is a priori unclear. Both because of its assumed value-freeness,
   and because of its focus on individual behaviour, nudging draws
   attention away from the societal, political and economic factors that
   shape human practice. I conclude with a call upon policy makers to
   facilitate the use of healthcare data to build better institutions and
   to address social determinants of health before they seek to ``fix{''}
   individual behaviour through nudging.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {58},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Belgium traditionally presents itself as a strong supporter of
   multilateral security cooperation and aims to be a reliable partner in
   the EU and NATO. Nevertheless, the uninterrupted decline of Belgium's
   defence budget paints a different picture, that of a country that rides
   cheap on the defence efforts of its partners. Belgium does make
   equitable contributions to multinational military operations, but the
   lack of defence investments threatens to undercut its ability to
   continue to make substantial contributions to multilateral operations.
   This article builds on the literature on small states and military
   burden sharing to explain Belgium's post-Cold War defence policy. More
   specifically, it argues that Belgium's behaviour is anything but
   irrational, given that it allows to gain a high degree of security and
   influence at relatively low political and financial costs.},

Abstract = {Most Americans are sorted into social networks that are largely
   politically homogeneous. A large body of political science research has
   explored the behavioral implications of being embedded in a politically
   homogeneous or heterogeneous network, but substantially less attention
   has been given to explaining why some people find themselves in
   politically homogeneous or heterogeneous social networks. In this
   article, we explore the psychological and physiological underpinnings of
   political network homogeneity. We use social network data from an
   original survey of 129 undergraduates paired with lab experimental
   evidence that measures individuals' physiological reactivity to an
   anticipated political discussion. Using our original survey and a
   separate nationally representative survey, we find suggestive evidence
   that individuals who are more socially anxious are more likely to share
   partisanship with their social network ties. Moreover, we find that
   individuals who experienced a greater increase in heart rate when
   anticipating a political discussion were more likely to be in
   homogeneous discussion networks, but we do not find a relationship
   between electrodermal activity and network homogeneity. Aversion to
   psychological and physiological discomfort induced by political
   discussions could contribute to social polarization in the American
   public.},

Abstract = {Despite recent advances in gender equality in political representation
   and the availability of resources, this article shows that there is a
   persistent gender gap in declared political interest over the life
   cycle. Using evidence from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we
   track the gender gap through the life span of citizens. At age 15, there
   is already a substantial gender gap of 20 percentage points in the
   probability of respondents reporting being politically interested,
   pointing to gendered socialization processes as the key explanation for
   such differences. In the following 10 years, as people develop into
   adults and unravel their political orientations, the extent of the
   gender gap continues to grow by about 10 additional percentage points.
   Following these formative years, attitudes crystallize and so does the
   gender gap, remaining at the same size (around 30 percentage points of
   difference between women and men) over the life course. These findings
   suggest that the development of gender roles during early childhood is a
   crucial phase in the source of the gender gap, deserving further
   attention from scholars.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Reconstruction is becoming the new battleground in the Syrian conflict -
   its continuation by other means. It is instrumentalized by the regime as
   a way to reconsolidate its control over the country and by rival
   regional and international powers to shape the internal balance of power
   and establish spheres of influence in the country. The paper examines
   the Asad regime's practices, including co-optation of militia leaders
   via reconstruction concessions and use of reconstruction to clear
   strategic areas of opposition-dominated urban settlements. The paper
   then surveys how the geopolitical struggle in Syria has produced an
   asymmetry as regards reconstruction: those powers that lost the
   geopolitical contest on the ground seek to use geo-economic superiority
   to reverse the geopolitical outcome. First the impact of proxy wars and
   spheres of influence in the country on the security context for
   reconstruction is examined. Finally, the reconstruction initiatives of
   the various external parties are assessed, including Russia, Iran and
   Turkey as well as the spoiler role by which the US seeks to obstruct
   reconstruction that would spell victory in Syria for its Russian and
   Iranian rivals.},

   Sub-Saharan Africa and highlights some aspects of African human rights

   human rights priorities are translated into practice within the UN
   system in general and the UN Human Rights Council in particular. Besides
   the strong regional characteristics of Sub-Saharan African human rights
   policy, there are significant differences among states in the region

   Under the Optional Protocol},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-84},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social
   and Cultural Rights represents a milestone in efforts to redress the
   imbalance in justiciability mechanisms for economic, social, and
   cultural rights at the international level. Six years after the Optional
   Protocol entered into force, the Committee on Economic, Social and
   Cultural Rights has an opportunity to develop the foundations of both
   its admissibility and merits jurisprudence. This article analyzes its
   evolving jurisprudence in light of the imperative to build the normative
   legitimacy of the Committee's work under the Optional Protocol. The
   challenge of navigating the tensions between respecting the sovereignty
   of states in the realm of domestic budgetary and social policy decisions
   and intervening to require accountability for economic, social, and
   cultural rights violations lies at the heart of the normative legitimacy
   of the Committee's jurisprudence. Based on a close analysis of its
   emerging jurisprudence, it is argued that the Committee has developed
   sound admissibility criteria, and a solid model of review to guide it in
   applying the reasonableness standard in Article 8(4) of the Optional
   Protocol. This jurisprudential approach has enabled the Committee to
   chart a skillful course thus far between sovereignty and accountability.
   This bodes well for strengthening the normative legitimacy of the
   Optional Protocol and advancing the broader project of the
   justiciability of economic, social, and cultural rights.},

Abstract = {Governmental subsidies are demand-side factors, which allow governments
   to `mould' interest group communities. The EU is the worlds' largest
   donor and has claimed to use public funds to promote the participation
   of organized interests in public policy. Previous studies found support
   for this claim and concluded that EU subsidies help to alleviate
   existing biases in the system of interest intermediation. In this
   article, we challenge these findings and argue that scholars paid too
   little attention to the applications for funding filed by interest
   groups. Using data collected from a survey of applying organizations, we
   consider the effect of four types of bias on the attainment of funds.
   Our results suggest that an organization's financial resources and its
   past success with applications increase the likelihood of winning a
   grant. These results question the redistributive aspect of EU funds and
   compare biases in EU funding with existing biases in the interest
   intermediation system.},

Title = {A new landscape for security? Harvesting `hope' for a better protection
   of human mobility},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {78-83},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This intervention considers the potential for `hope' to act as an
   analytical tool to examine mobility, precariousness and the quest for
   security in the context of migrants' exploitation, or `modern-day
   slavery', in Australia. The image selected depicts a bucolic landscape
   which elicits a sense of relaxation and connection with our roots. Such
   a landscape speaks of our ancestry, familiarity, security, and hopes in
   `our' territory. Yet this image represents not one but multiple stories.
   One of these stories connects to experiences of migrants' exploitation,
   which is unrecognised by those refusing to acknowledge the harsh
   realities underlying such idealised imagery. This image, in which the
   worker is not visible but their presence leaves both an economic and
   non-economic trace in the rural or urban landscapes, also represents the
   sovereign power of the state. In this context this bucolic landscape is
   the backdrop for the re-enactment of post-imperialism and
   post-colonialism, evidenced in the government's securitisation narrative
   and reinforced through the rhetoric of discontent and distrust for the
   `other'. This piece concludes with a reflection on how we can `practise
   hope' through rendering visible the invisible and proposes `hope' as a
   motivator to link positively human security with human mobility to see
   such landscape anew.},

Abstract = {Within European territories, exists a large number of borderlands
   comprising several Cross-Border Cooperation (CBC) projects and
   strategies. However, these CBC relationships are known by a high level
   of complexity. Therefore, the study of all the variables and factors
   that could influence the success or failure of these CBC projects and
   strategies are critical to reaching long-lasting territorial
   sustainability. Contextually, the present paper analyzes the border
   cooperation of eight CBC projects (seventeen European cities) focusing
   on the political engagement and transparency. Furthermore, the study
   allows us to identify and isolate the four main critical factors to
   consider from a political perspective: (i) Connectivity - Movement
   between cities; (ii) Political transparency and commitment; (iii) Common
   objectives and master plans; and (iv) Young and talented people magnet.},

Abstract = {Recently, radicalism and radicalization have been gaining a great deal
   of public attention and are considered one of many signs of political
   crisis. Yet, this belies the ambivalence of these terms. The present
   article argues for a broader understanding of radicalization in order to
   explore the entire spectrum of radicalization phenomena: from
   radicalization without violence to radicalization into violence and
   radicalization within violence. A broader concept helps to ensure that
   radicalization is not conflated with situations marked by imminent
   threats of viol ence, which too often result in the curtailment of civil
   liberties and forms of social and political stigmatization. In addition,
   a broader understanding can open a discursive and regulative space in
   the area of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.},

   The Case of International Climate Finance},

Abstract = {How do powerful states control international organizations (IOs)? In
   contrast to the conventional wisdom that treats weighted voting rules as
   the primary means that powerful states use to codify their asymmetric
   control in institutional design, we propose that funding rules are
   equally important. Our framework develops a logic of substitution
   whereby permissive earmark rules-that allow donors to stipulate how
   their contributions to an IO are used-are a design substitute for
   weighted voting from wealthy states' perspective. Whether asymmetric
   control is incorporated in design through voting or funding rules
   depends on whether egalitarian norms emphasizing political and legal
   equality, or shareholder norms emphasizing influence commensurate with
   financial power, govern voting and representation rights at the IO.
   Focusing on the domain of climate finance, we demonstrate that weighted
   voting rules are used at international climate finance institutions
   (ICFIs) associated with multilateral development banks, but that wealthy
   states pursued permissive earmark rules at ICFIs within the United
   Nations system where egalitarian norms are strong. In this way, powerful
   donors can exert control over resource allocation even when developing
   states appear to hold equal influence on governing bodies. In addition
   to providing a reassessment of how power translates into control at IOs,
   our framework offers insight into forum-shopping behavior and sheds
   light on substitution dynamics that involve other dimensions of design
   across a range of issue areas.},

Abstract = {Most of Norway's oceans are situated to the north of the Arctic Circle
   and some of the world's richest fishing grounds are there. The largest
   fish stocks are shared with other countries, and international
   cooperation on the management of the resources is therefore an important
   aspect of Norway's northern policy. Such cooperation is based on the
   international norms for how living marine resources are to be managed
   and shared, and it takes place in a number of bilateral and regional
   fora. There are challenges related to the allocation of pelagic

Abstract = {This chapter will demonstrate the category of circuitous but intended
   outcomes, or the desirable consequences accurately anticipated and
   predicted by the actors involved at the moment the act is carried out.
   The study will examine the case of the October 1973 Yom Kippur War
   between Egypt and Israel, which provides a strong illustration of how an
   actor who wages war can circuitously achieve his political goals despite
   suffering military defeat on the battleground. Egypt's President Anwar
   el-Sadat, astonishingly, predicted the indirect results of the war he
   initiated. Sadat forecast that Egypt needed a spark, ``crossing the
   canal and capturing just ten centimeters of Sinai,{''} which would
   trigger the involvement of much more powerful forces, such as the two
   superpowers, the United States in particular, leading them to
   successfully compel Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, a
   desired goal of Egypt.(1)},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we introduce the fundamental concepts used in this
   book. We observe that citizenship is an essentially contested concept.
   However, it is still possible to single out the core meaning of
   citizenship in conceptual terms as a lasting and relational personal
   status, characteristic of those who are full members of a self-governing
   polity. On such a basis, it is possible to distinguish citizenship from
   other recurrent personal statuses. The key conception in the practice of
   European states, democratic and social states citizenship, aims at
   reconciling the normative requirements stemming from the democratic
   state, the social state and the rule of law.},

Abstract = {The importance of anarchism for the fauvist movement at the start of the
   twentieth century needs recognition. This paper explores the
   significance of distinctions within anarchist theory between anarchist
   communism (which informed the majority of the neo-impressionists) and
   the anarchist individualism that inspired those members of the fauve
   movement self-identified as anarchist: Maurice de Vlaminck and Kees Van
   Dongen. The more tangential and temporary relations of other fauvists -
   Henri Matisse and Andre Derain - to the anarchist movement are explored
   as well. Growth of antimilitarism throughout the long Dreyfus Affair
   (1894-1906) equally distinguishes the late nineteenth century from the
   early years of the twentieth, deeply engaging the later artists,
   especially Vlaminck and Derain.
   These painters embodied their political refusal of the status quo in a
   style that broke all the rules of academic painting. Their choice of
   pure unmixed color, applied straight from newly available manufactured
   tubes of paint in thick additive touches, with only approximate nods to
   readable form, constituted abstract techniques signifying spontaneity
   and direct expression predicated on their uniqueness as radical
   individuals. With a parallel technique, Van Dongen expressed his
   celebration of sexual liberationism and outsiderhood as radical
   individuality for both artist and sitters.
   Whether such maneuvers furthered political goals or only positioned the
   artists in a critical relation to bourgeois norms is one of the great
   questions of such manipulations of modernist language. Recognizing the
   discursive distinctions between these two aspects of anarchism and the
   centrality of antimilitarism helps in understanding the importance of
   anarchist thought for the development of modernism in twentieth-century
   art.},

Abstract = {This concluding chapter takes a look at what the findings show-cased in
   this book concerning the role of coast guards, the growing importance of
   maritime space in politics, and the opportunities and limitations
   surrounding cooperation between states at sea (both bilaterally and
   multilaterally) hold for ocean politics more generally, as governance of
   marine resources and managing maritime disputes climb on the political
   agendas across the world. This chapter concludes that coast guard tasks
   and their role in cross-boundary cooperation are on the rise, not only
   in the Arctic but globally as oceans are increasingly on political
   agendas.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-338},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the emergence and
   integration of red tape and how its negative effects on public sector
   organizations' performance have weakened the economies of developing
   countries such as Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire survey was
   completed by 121 respondents working in 35 government departments in
   Punjab, a province of Pakistan.
   Findings -The findings revealed a link between red-tapism and employees'
   motivation and work. When there is excessiveness of rules and
   regulations, employees are prevented from completing assigned tasks,
   ultimately resulting in decreased work commitment. This indicates that
   the integration of red tape into public organizations not only affects
   employees' behavior and attitudes but also impacts the overall
   performance of public sector organizations.
   Originality/value - This paper provides recommendations for the
   Pakistani government. For example, conducting training and motivational
   workshops for public sector employees can help them stay engaged with
   their work. Government departments should also review the steps and
   procedures involved so as to eliminate unnecessary steps and reduce
   red-tapism.},

Abstract = {Large amounts of occasional voters participated in the Brexit
   referendum. Did the increase in turnout affect the referendum outcome?
   For an answer, we exploit exogenous variation in voting costs, as large
   amounts of rainfall made voting more inconvenient in some areas. With an
   instrumental variable approach, we show that citizens whose voting
   benefits just surpassed costs under normal circumstances predominantly
   supported Leave. Hence, the turnout increase likely led to a larger
   Leave vote share. Exploring the reason for this with survey data, we
   show that Leave support was not generally higher in the population of
   low-propensity voters. Rather, the mobilisation of Leave-leaning,
   compared to Remain-leaning occasional voters was lopsided: The former
   were more likely to turn out. Our research highlights that the
   issue-specific mobilisation of low-propensity voters helps to explain
   electoral outcomes. This is particularly so in referendums with weak
   partisan preferences, and where single issues dominate voter decision
   making.},

Abstract = {Are political and economic rights equally basic? This is one of the main
   issues liberal egalitarians and classical liberals disagree about. The
   former think political rights should be more strongly protected than
   economic ones; classical liberals thus accuse them of an unjustified and
   politically biased `economic exceptionalism'. Recently, John Tomasi has
   developed a special version of this challenge, which is targeted against
   Murphy and Nagel's account of the relationship between property rights
   and just taxation. In this paper, I analyze this challenge, and provide
   an account of its limitations. Tomasi's strategy to drive Murphy and
   Nagel's account into an overgeneralization problem brings to light that
   liberals weren't guilty of any kind of economic exceptionalism in the
   first place. However, this also shows that classical liberalism and
   libertarians do not disagree as much as it might seem.},

Abstract = {The discussion of the causes of the turns to the left or the right in
   Latin America is an extensive one, and comparative electoral studies in
   the region have multiplied. However, due to the fact that they are
   analyzed in isolation, their contribution to understanding why people
   vote for the alternatives at one end of the ideological spectrum or the
   other is limited. This paper examines the ideological voting behavior of
   Latin Americans between 1996 and 2016, and we find that positions for or
   against the United States and the ideology of voters are the principal
   factors to explain this, together with social class, trust in political
   institutions, the ideology of the current government and the gender of
   the voter. Belonging to an indigenous group tends to favor a vote for
   left-wing alternatives when this division has previously been
   politicized. However, there are very large national variations compared
   to the regional trends, indicating that it is a very heterogeneous
   region.},

Abstract = {The article examines legibility as atool for gauging the relationship
   between the state and civil society in collaborative governance. It
   considers the Norwegian National Plan for Self-Help as an attempt at
   legibility and compares interactions on the self-help field before and
   after the plan. Contrasting a collaborative effort under the auspices of
   the plan with a prior attempt at legibility, the article finds that
   legibility compels the civil society actors engaging in collaborative
   governance to `see like a welfare state', thus illustrating its potency
   as an instrument of metagovernance. In particular, the Norwegian
   self-help case highlights the role of legibility and other instruments
   of metagovernance in producing, consolidating or exacerbating
   asymmetrical relations of power, and the risks that standardization
   carry for both civil society and the state.},

Abstract = {Despite their less vulnerable economic status, white individuals'
   attitudes toward overseas trade in the United States may have become
   more protectionist than those of economically disadvantaged minorities.
   We present results from five different studies examining two different
   ways in which trade may have become racialized. First, we examine the
   extent to which a person's racial identity is associated with levels of
   trade support. Second, we examine whether the predominant racial
   identity of a potential trading-partner country influences people's
   willingness to trade with that country. Using various surveys and
   multiple survey experiments conducted over the past 12 years, we find
   that white individuals have become less supportive of trade than
   minorities and that whites are more likely than minorities to favor
   trade with highly similar countries. We suggest that minority support
   for trade is due to four well-documented differences in the
   psychological predispositions of whites and minorities in the United
   States. Minorities have lower levels of racial prejudice, are lower in
   social dominance, and express less nationalism than whites. At the same
   time, there is evidence of rising ingroup racial consciousness among
   whites. Each of these characteristics has been independently linked to
   trade support in a direction encouraging greater support for trade among
   minorities. As the United States grows ever closer to becoming a
   ``majority minority{''} nation, the racialization of trade attitudes may
   stimulate shifts in the likely future of America's trade relationships.},

Abstract = {The ratification of EU agreements is characterized by the application of
   different democratic procedures across member states. Building on the
   demoi-cratic theory of legitimate global governance, I argue that
   citizens benchmark their national procedure against highly visible
   direct democratic ratification votes held in other member states. If
   citizens experience unequal influence on EU decision-making, the
   perceived legitimacy of the EU regime erodes. I test this argument with
   a research design that combines a population-based survey experiment and
   a quasi-experiment. First, a survey experiment in Germany reveals that
   information about asymmetric ratification standards decrease fairness
   perceptions and satisfaction with EU democracy. Second, a natural
   experiment around the 2005 French vote on the EU constitutional treaty
   shows that the referendum decreased satisfaction with EU democracy in
   states with pending and indirect ratification. These findings suggest
   that asymmetric access of citizens to EU decision-making can decrease
   popular support for EU governance.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how local government
   bodies in Nepal are empowered to play their constitutional roles and
   engage in activities to deliver public services at the doorsteps of the
   people effectively. The focus is on the institutionalisation of
   federalism, its implications for local governance, and capacity
   development of local authorities. Design/methodology/approach Ideas of
   decentralisation, governance and public management have been used to
   interpret findings based on qualitative research methods by key
   informant interviews, focus group discussions and personal observations
   conducted in five selected municipalities in Nepal. Findings The process
   of operationalising the power of local government bodies is more
   conventional and hierarchic. At the same time, the formulation and
   implementation of inclusive plans and budgeting are confined with
   certain formalities that do not necessarily allow citizens the space for
   voices. Federal government grants constrain fiscal jurisdiction and
   control over resource mobilisation. The mere preparation and
   administration of local government legislation and relevant by-laws have
   weakened the capacity of local government bodies. Originality/value From
   interpretation of first-hand data, this paper has identified the
   pitfalls of the federalisation process, the constraints deter the
   devolution of power to local bodies as well as the transformation of
   local governments into autonomous institutions in Nepal.},

Abstract = {This article aims at clearing up a widespread misunderstanding in
   previous research that the classical strategic perspective, based on the
   writings of Carl von Clausewitz and his contemporary followers, shares
   ontological assumptions with realism. Although both perspectives
   perceive a constant state of disharmony in international politics, they
   differ substantially in their assumptions about state-centrism, actor
   behaviour, and the role of unpredictability. As the relationship between
   the perspectives is ambiguous, the article argues that scholars should
   treat them as two separate theoretical entities. The greater scholarly
   relevance of the article lies in its contribution to conceptual clarity.},

   Mentions in Party Manifestos from 1960 to 2015},

Abstract = {Looking at texts of election manifestos, this paper examines systematic
   differences among political parties within and across countries in how
   they position themselves on foreign aid and in how these manifesto
   pledges translate into commitments to disburse aid. Conventional wisdom
   suggests that left-leaning parties may be more supportive of foreign aid
   than rightwing parties, but also that foreign aid may not be
   sufficiently electorally salient for parties to stake out positions in
   campaign materials, such as manifestos. We leverage a new data set that
   codes party positions on foreign aid in election manifestos for 13
   donors from 1960 to 2015. We find that parties differ systematically in
   how they engage with foreign aid. Left-leaning governments are more
   likely to express positive sentiment vis-a-vis aid than right-leaning
   governments. We evaluate the effects of positions on aid outcomes and
   find that positive aid views expressed by the party in government
   translate into higher aid commitments, though only for left-leaning
   parties.},

Abstract = {Many disciplinary analyses have exposed international realtions (IR) as
   a Western-centric discipline, unaware of or unconcerned with its own
   ethnocentric outlook. A growing consensus in the global IR framework
   argues that it is time to move beyond disciplinary critique, but
   scholars disagree on how to proceed. Three key issues are still being
   debated: who can speak, how to go local, and how to make the local
   global. This article confronts these questions by offering three
   interlinked contributions. First, it develops a typology of scholarly
   profiles by combining the typically isolated debates on scholarly
   origin, embeddedness within local context, and location. Second, the
   article identifies three main strategies for discovering and developing
   theories outside the core. Third, it offers four different avenues for
   applying local theories to the larger global canvas, underlining that
   Global South theories should not necessarily be limited to their
   ``own{''} regions. Together these three contributions constitute a
   comprehensive roadmap for how to advance global IR's research agenda.
   The article provides examples focused on Latin America, highlighting the
   benefits of the roadmap while also giving agency to regional theoretical
   debates that are often overlooked in the Global IR debate.},

   Its Strengths and Limitations},

Abstract = {In 2019, what began in Hong Kong as a series of rallies against a
   proposal to permit extraditions to mainland China grew into a raft of
   anti-authoritarian protests and challenges to Beijing's grip on the
   city. Given the gravest political crisis confronting Hong Kong in
   decades, this research investigates why the protests have lacked
   centralized leaders and why the solidarity among the peaceful and
   militant protesters has been immense. This article also examines the
   strengths and limitations of this leaderless movement with different
   case studies. The authors argue that serious threats to the commonly
   cherished values in Hong Kong, amid the absence of stable and legitimate
   leaders in its democracy movement, underpinned the formation of a
   multitude of decentralized decision-making platforms that orchestrated
   the protests in 2019. Those platforms involved both well-known movement
   leaders organizing conventional peaceful protests and anonymous
   activists crafting a diversity of tactics in ingenious ways, ranging
   from economic boycotts, human chains around the city, artistic protests
   via LennonWalls, to the occupying of the international airport. The
   decentralized decision-making platforms, while having generated a boon
   to the movement with their beneficial tactical division of labor, also
   produced risks to the campaign. The risks include the lack of legitimate
   representatives for conflict-deescalating negotiations, rise in
   legitimacy-sapping violence, and susceptibility to underestimating the
   risks of various tactics stemming from a dearth of thorough political
   communication among anonymous participants who had different goals and
   degrees of risk tolerance. In short, Hong Kong's anti-extradition
   movement in 2019 sheds light on the basis of leaderless movements, and
   on both the strengths and risks of such movements.},

Abstract = {Multilateral conferences are the bread-and-butter of international
   politics. In such settings, countries may pursue their interests
   individually, but most of the time they prefer to act through
   coalitions. Such coalitions are overlapping, creating a network
   structure. States build and utilize networks to get agenda items pushed
   through or to block unfavorable ones. While sometimes they are formed on
   the basis of formal institutions (such as the NAM or the EU), frequently
   their membership is based on either ad hoc cooperation or existing
   informal bodies (such as the NSG, New Agenda Coalition, or Zangger
   Committee). The attention to such networks is, however, still in its
   infancy. This paper looks at how state networks within one of the most
   important recurring diplomatic conferences-the quin-quennial NPT Review
   Conference-develop and transform over time. By doing so, the paper maps
   the existing networks and explains their transformation as an instrument
   of global governance.},

Abstract = {Mexico's contentious necropolitics see different stakeholders involved
   in political struggles for control over the dead. The families of
   victims of state and corporate violence protest state necrogovernance
   and corporate necropower, the power to dictate the circumstances of
   citizens' and workers' lives and deaths. Two case studies show how the
   state and corporations deploy the criminal technique of disappearing
   bodies as a means of social control and rendering workers expendable and
   sometimes killable. Social movements counter this with a determined
   struggle to restore a sense of worth to the victims of violence through
   public mourning. Their repertoire of collective action has created a
   subversive necropower that challenges both necrogovernance and corporate
   necropower.
   La contenciosa necropolitica de Mexico involucra a distintos grupos de
   interes que participan en la contienda politica por el control de los
   muertos. Las familias de las victimas de la violencia de Estado y
   corporativa protestan contra la necrogobernanza estatal y la
   necropotencia corporativa, y du poder de dictaminar las circunstancias
   de vida y muerte de los ciudadanos y trabajadores. Dos estudios de caso
   muestran como el Estado y las corporaciones despliegan la tecnica
   criminal de desaparecer los cuerpos como un medio de control social que
   hace a los trabajadores prescindibles y a veces matables. Los
   movimientos sociales responden con una lucha decidida por restaurar un
   sentido de valor para las victimas de la violencia a traves del duelo
   publico. Su repertorio de accion colectiva ha creado una necropotencia
   subversiva que desafia tanto a la necrogobernanza como a la
   necropotencia corporativa.},

Abstract = {The recent proliferation of digital technologies for development has led
   to a new paradigm of state-citizen relations in which technology
   mediates the citizens' interactions with the agencies of government. The
   use of digital technologies has enabled the state to effectively
   distinguish between the ``deserving{''} and ``undeserving{''} poor, so
   as to parse the digital subject that is worthy of the state's projects
   of governmentality. However, the top-down use of technology occurs
   within a specific value system that is oblivious to contextual reality
   and does not question existing power asymmetries. Recent initiatives in
   northern India have questioned the state's use of such technologies to
   devalue the agency of the poor and their autonomous capacity to
   contribute to development policy and practice. This Commentary will
   briefly examine two examples from India, where citizens' movements have
   reshaped the terms of engagement through the medium of digital
   technologies, towards creating a more responsive state. Such initiatives
   have the potential to reframe the very objectives from the perspective
   of the affected people, and to reclaim digital technologies towards
   promoting equity.},

Abstract = {This paper follows European countries as they struggled through the
   first wave of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. We analyze when countries were
   confronted with the virus, how long it took until the number of new
   infections peaked and at what level of infections that peak was achieved
   via social distancing and lockdown policies. Most European countries
   were able to successfully end the first wave of the pandemic - defined
   as a two-week incidence rate smaller than 10 cases per 100,000 people.
   We find that countries in which the virus made significant landfall
   later in time enjoyed a latecomer advantage that some of these countries
   squandered, however, by not responding quickly enough and that an early
   lockdown was more effective than a hard lockdown.},

Title = {The public-private distinction in the shadow of China: Uneven and
   combined development's critique of liberal IR theory?},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Social theories of International Relations (IR) are normally premised on
   a deep distinction between public and private spheres. Whether
   articulated as `capitalism', `the market', or `civil society', all
   attribute some analytical priority to the private, with explanatory
   significance for the public sphere and therefore also central to the
   critique of realism in International Relations. Liberalism in particular
   sees the source of peace as a flourishing private sphere that narrows
   the scope of the otherwise violent, war-prone orientation of the public
   which defines states. However, we argue that this orientation is
   ill-equipped to grapple with the world-historical significance of the
   `Rise of China' that is better understood instead as a form of
   industrialism not premised on the public/private distinction. This
   inapplicability of categories foundational to liberal IR theory leaves
   it unable to meaningfully engage the Rise of China debate. Using Uneven
   and Combined Development (U\&CD), this paper elaborates industrialism as
   a pattern of state-led development in China that prioritises industrial
   capacity as an end over strictly private objectives (e.g. profits).
   Arising in substantial part from the exigencies of political
   multiplicity, industrialism seeks national unity and vindication of a
   distinct civilisational identity through the pragmatic means of
   industrial capacity under conditions of modernity. Whilst this argument
   partly echoes the developmental state literature, it goes further by
   visualising this across both the longue duree and the current
   conjuncture, right up to the much-discussed Belt and Road Initiative.
   Finally, the argument emphasises U\&CD's potential to originate a
   simultaneously non-liberal and non-realist account of the implications
   of China's rise.},

Abstract = {Large-scale efforts to measure the democratic nature of polities across
   space and time are most useful when they reflect the variety of
   conceptions of democracy developed by political theorists.
   Traditionally, the attention of political theorists as well as political
   scientists focused on what it means for the people to rule, to the
   neglect of the equally important question of who the relevant people
   should be. In recent years, however, an increasing number of political
   theorists have tackled the problem of defining the demos and offered a
   wide range of answers. The article argues that empirical democracy
   measurement projects should take into account the variety of conceptions
   of the demos debated today instead of assuming consensus on this
   dimension. It also discusses how this can be done systematically. The
   arguments are developed with reference to the most ambitious and
   comprehensive democracy measurement project yet: Varieties of Democracy
   (V-Dem).},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the factors which explain public attitudes to
   welfare chauvinism in Italy. The notion of `welfare chauvinism' refers
   to the idea that foreigners, considered as out-groups, should have
   limited or even no access to domestic social security benefits. We focus
   on the role played by individual transnationalism: i.e. direct and
   indirect ties and connections with people and cultures of other European
   countries. We postulate that transnationalism dilutes fears and
   anxieties, fostering pro-opening attitudes. We test the research
   hypotheses by using original survey data collected during the 2018
   Italian elections, in which the issues of welfare benefits and
   immigration shaped the election campaign.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {One of the most intractable debates in IR revolves around the severity
   and frequency of the security dilemma. Offensive realists argue that
   states are compelled to make worst-case assumptions about each other's
   intentions, which yields inexorable competition and conflict even
   between mutually-benign actors. Yet others have argued that rational
   benign states should always be able to find cooperative signals that are
   costly enough to be credible, but not too costly to risk sending. If
   true, this should alleviate the security dilemma and facilitate
   cooperation, even under high initial distrust. However, there is little
   empirical work on interstate reassurance and the conditions under which
   mutually-benign actors can build trust. We address this gap using
   laboratory experiments to test Andrew Kydd's canonical model of the
   security dilemma. We find strong support for the directional effects of
   the hypothesized signaling mechanisms. However, the frequency of
   cooperation is significantly lower than the model predicts, and the
   feasibility of reassurance is highly sensitive to the degree of prior
   trust. This implies that although reassurance can mitigate the security
   dilemma, offensive realism may still capture important psychological
   mechanisms that impede interstate cooperation.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that World Bank internal learning has led to
   significant changes in how the development bank interacts with
   government officials through technical assistance (TA). Reviewing
   evidence of institutional learning and associated changes in practice,
   the article identifies two main pillars of World Bank TA: TA components
   (advisory services contained within lending operations) and stand-alone
   TA projects (loans that solely finance TA). Bringing together the policy
   transfer and policy mobility literatures and international organisation
   scholarship on sympathetic interlocutors, the article contends that the
   nature of interactions between policy provocateur and recipient shapes
   the recipient's perception of the legitimacy of transferred policy
   options. Overall, World Bank reviews since the 1980s have repeatedly
   highlighted the importance of participatory interactions between World
   Bank staff and country officials to the effective movement of policy. In
   recent years, practice has begun to catch-up with these operational
   insights, leading this article to propose a twofold conclusion. First,
   for the TA provider, participatory TA mechanisms consistently lead to
   greater domestic support from country officials, leading the provider to
   more effectively transfer its policy products. Second, for the TA
   recipient, participatory TA mechanisms can lead to their empowerment and
   greater inclusion in development project management.},

Abstract = {The dissemination of citizen participation in policymaking has increased
   considerably worldwide, as in the case of participatory budgeting,
   considered as the best-known democratic innovation in this field of
   study and practice. In order to share empirical knowledge about
   participatory budgets, the article provides a comparative analysis of
   patterns of dissemination in Brazil and Portugal. These countries were
   selected for being paradigmatic cases in the dissemination of
   participatory budgets. The comparative analysis of sociopolitical
   contexts and institutional designs sheds light on similarities and
   differences on democratic frameworks, political and non-political
   agents, target public, approach to participation, and main goals.
   Findings point to similarities in the passage from the dictatorial to
   the democratic regime in both countries, and differences in the role of
   political parties and social agents behind the dissemination. It is
   within such sociopolitical contexts that non-associated citizens are the
   target of participatory budgets in both countries, although they are
   differently approached because address different goals.},

Title = {Power in the European Union: an evolutionary computing approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-244},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Even the best existing model of legislative decisionmaking in the
   European Union, the compromise model, makes huge prediction errors when
   it is assumed that each actor's power is determined by their formal
   voting weight. A few studies have attempted to improve the model's
   predictive accuracy by examining alternative distributions of power, but
   extending their brute force approach poses daunting computational
   challenges. In this paper I illustrate how techniques from evolutionary
   computing can be employed to overcome these challenges. I then
   demonstrate the new possibilities that this approach opens up by
   identifying the relative power of each actor that best predicts policy
   outcomes from the EU-15 period. Some actors appear to punch
   significantly above or below their formal weight, with power varying
   dramatically across legislative procedures. My analysis highlights
   important unanswered questions about power in EU decisionmaking, and
   potentially indicates fundamental problems with the compromise model or
   the underlying data.},

Abstract = {Policymakers sometimes argue that material assistance to rebels involved
   in a civil war can create a `ripe moment' that is favorable for
   negotiations. Ripeness theory provides support for this idea. However,
   this notion has never been systematically assessed. This article
   evaluates this claim by using global data on negotiations in all
   intrastate armed conflicts from 1975 to 2009. Contrary to popular
   belief, the article demonstrates that external state support to rebel
   groups does not increase the prospect of negotiations. Instead, the
   results suggest that external support is likely to reduce the likelihood
   of negotiations between the warring parties, especially if the state
   sponsor is a great power. The study contributes to our understanding of
   civil war processes by demonstrating that military assistance hinders
   rather than promotes the onset of negotiations and by questioning the
   utility of ripeness theory as the most suitable framework for
   understanding this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This article explores the significance ofxieshang minzhu, the Chinese
   term for deliberative democracy. As this term is also closely connected
   to the political tradition of the Communist Party of China (CPC), its
   use has caused confusion in Chinese contexts. Specifically, the CPC has
   transformed the meaning of deliberative democracy to comply with the
   party line. Based on a review of official documents from the years 1987
   to 2018, I argue that the CPC controls the interpretation of
   deliberative democracy in China by monopolizing the meaning ofxieshang
   minzhu. This discursive strategy serves two purposes. On one hand, the
   official documents have prescribed a specific genealogy ofxieshang
   minzhuwithin the CPC's political tradition; on the other hand, by
   consistently claiming that China does not copy anything from the West
   but only learns useful lessons from human civilizations in general, the
   CPC creates a safeguard against Western influences.},

Abstract = {The continuance of the revolutionary strife of Mexico's dirty war into
   the present day, both as a legacy and in the form of its survivors,
   resonates strongly in the work of the novelist elmer Mendoza. Mendoza's
   early novelJanis Joplin's Loveruses its protagonist to portray a 1970s
   Mexico torn between a revolutionary path of collective social
   amelioration and the corrupt, mercenary self-interest embodied by
   Mexican narco-traffickers, with the country pushed toward the latter
   through the repression of student activists by the Mexican state.
   Mendoza's five subsequent novels that center on the exploits of
   detective Lefty Mendieta focus on the fallout from this period of
   repression, using the figure of Lefty's brother Enrique, a former
   leftist guerrilla, to represent a lost (but not totally lost)
   egalitarian and socially just alternative to the neoliberal political
   economy that has ravaged the living conditions of most Mexicans for
   almost four decades. La continuada lucha revolucionaria en el marco de
   la guerra sucia que ha caracterizado a Mexico hasta la hoy en dia, tanto
   como legado a la vez que en la presencia de sus sobrevivientes, resuena
   poderosamente en la obra del novelista elmer Mendoza. La primera novela
   de Mendoza,Janis Joplin's Lover, utiliza a su protagonista para retratar
   a Mexico en la decada de 1970, dividido entre un camino revolucionario
   de mejora social colectiva y el corrupto y mercenario interes propio
   encarnado por los narcotraficantes mexicanos; el pais se ve empujado en
   esta ultima direccion a traves de la represion de los activistas
   estudiantiles por parte del Estado. Las cinco novelas posteriores de
   Mendoza, centradas en las hazanas del detective Lefty Mendieta, se
   centran en las consecuencias de este periodo de represion y emplean la
   figura de Enrique, el hermano de Lefty, un ex guerrillero izquierdista,
   para representar la perdida (si bien no total) de una alternativa
   igualitaria y socialmente justa en oposicion a la economia politica
   neoliberal que mermado las condiciones de vida de la mayoria de los
   mexicanos durante casi cuatro decadas.},

Abstract = {In 2019, Moscow saw political demonstrations as a result of the
   authorities' blocking of the registration of opposition candidates for
   the local elections in Moscow. As the culmination of a series of citizen
   protests around different causes that spread throughout the country,
   these protests presented a real challenge to the political regime. Their
   context, evolution and possible implications are analyzed in this paper,
   both in correlation with the methods of ``managed democracy{''} within
   Russia's regime of electoral autocracy, as well as with the perfecting
   of technological tools in light of two consequences: political pluralism
   and constraints on civic practice.},

Abstract = {The rhetoric and practice of localism has attracted significant support
   within both political and academic circles in the UK in recent years.
   However, it is the contention of this article that there are, or should
   be, limits to localism as applied to the basic citizenship rights of
   vulnerable people. Drawing on a ten-year, mixed-methods study, we use
   the example of sharply rising homelessness in England to illustrate our
   argument that localist policymaking has an intrinsic tendency to
   disadvantage socially marginalised groups. While we acknowledge the
   central role played by austerity in driving up homelessness over the
   past decade, we advance the case that the post-2010 localist agenda of
   successive UK governments has also had an independent and malign effect.
   At the very least, we seek to demonstrate that localism cannot be viewed
   as a taken-for-granted progressive model, with centralism (that is, the
   consistent implementation of a policy across a whole country) also
   perfectly defensible on progressive grounds in relevant circumstances.},

Abstract = {Economic categories are part of the everyday concepts people use to
   apprehend social reality. While scholars recognize their importance for
   social and economic processes, it is not clear how these categories
   develop when reality itself changes. I address this issue with a
   framework that incorporates a cultural emphasis on meaning-making with a
   macro-structural analysis of the conditions in which they take place. I
   apply this framework to the marginalist revolution of the late 19th
   century, which marks the birth of neoclassical economics and focus on
   the new understanding of `value' that emerged during this period. I
   trace it to the rise of finance and the problem of price fluctuations,
   and show how its class standpoint helps explain the different outcomes
   of the marginalist revolution in England, Austria and France. The
   analysis provides insights into the power of economic ideas and the
   cultural dimension of structural changes.},

Abstract = {Given China's rise and the threat that this poses to Russia, we would
   expect the two states to be at best friendly rivals. Yet the
   relationship between Putin and Xi Jinping is warmer than ever. What
   accounts for the positive change in their relationship? Based on social
   identity theory, I argue that China and Russia are cooperating to
   establish a common identity due to their rejection by the West as
   outsiders. In terms of ``ontological security theory,{''} they have
   doubled down on their outsider status. While Russian elites fear being
   treated as a ``junior partner{''} by the stronger and wealthier China,
   the PRC has managed to assuage such concerns by deferring to Russia in
   its near abroad, including Central Asia, on security issues. The
   sanctions and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have driven
   two non-liberal powers closer together.},

Title = {A micro-level analysis of the contagion effect: Evidence from the
   Kurdish conflict},

Abstract = {The unit of analysis in almost all large-N studies on conflict contagion
   and diffusion is collective actors, such as states and ethnic groups or
   movements. Thus, contagion dynamics and processes at the individual
   level have been neglected. Using original data derived from a public
   opinion survey, this study examines the micro-level dynamics of
   contagion in the context of Turkey's Kurdish conflict. The study
   suggests that transnational ethnic ties, and in particular, cross-border
   familial bonds and interactions, facilitate conflict contagion through
   several strategic and ideational mechanisms. First, transborder familial
   ties and interactions amplify the demonstration effect of ethnic-kin
   achievements in contiguous conflict countries. Second, cross-border
   familial bonds facilitate collaboration between cross-border co-ethnics.
   Finally, such ties to conflict zones with ethnic kin groups empower
   pan-ethnic identities. The empirical findings show that Kurds living in
   Turkey who have close relatives in nearby countries hosting conflicting
   ethnic-kin groups (i.e. Syria, Iraq, and Iran) have stronger
   ethnonationalist orientations and claims against the center. However,
   having close relatives elsewhere (e.g. Europe) does not generate the
   same impact. The Kurdish case evidences that contagion processes and
   dynamics might vary substantially across the members of a particular
   ethnic group. Hence, it is necessary to broaden the conventional focus
   on collective actors in conflict contagion research and pay greater
   attention to micro-level variables and factors.},

Abstract = {I test the proposition that interest groups achieve greater policy
   success when they lobby during the agency guidance document development
   process as opposed to the notice and comment process. Policymaking via
   guidance documents often receives lower levels of public attention,
   which provides greater flexibility to accommodate lobbying requests. I
   analyze the hypothesis during the creation of 41 rules by one US
   government agency-20 of which were promulgated using the notice and
   comment process and 21 via the guidance document process. I measure
   regulatory policy change using a content analysis of government
   documents and lobbying texts, and I also incorporate a telephone survey
   of interest groups who lobbied on these same rules. I find that interest
   groups perceive-and achieve-greater policy success when lobbying during
   the agency guidance process. The results yield new insights into the
   relationship between lobbying and regulatory policymaking.},

Abstract = {Wine, viticulture, and winemaking are an important cornerstone of
   economic development, culture, and tourism. Especially in wine-growing
   parts of the world where symbols related to wine are used even as local
   or national symbols. Viticulture and its complementary branches are
   differently developed in different parts of the world - the
   predisposition of further development, however, is also influenced
   importantly by positions of different identification referential groups
   which they have towards the use of wine and further development of the
   profession. Based on the research of standpoints of the mayors in the
   Republic of Slovenia, which could be presented as ``wine-growing
   country{''} with regards to the extent of the vine, we can assert that
   mayors with their relationship towards wine and their operations
   influence the use of local wine for the tourist promotion of destination
   importantly. According to that, we figure out that mayors play an
   important role in the development of ``public policy{''} in the local
   environment. In the forming of the positions towards the use of wine for
   the promotion, the direct experiences are important, as well as the
   environment where the mayors come from and all identification elements
   in the sense of cultural heritage, tradition, and development of the
   branch.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the first comprehensive dataset of frozen
   conflicts in world politics. It draws on a new, broader
   conceptualization of frozen conflicts that revolves around an unresolved
   core issue between the warring parties and transcends the common
   understanding of frozen conflicts as a recent, post-Soviet phenomenon.
   The authors identify 42 cases of such conflicts between 1946 and 2011
   that include conflict dyads involving both regular states and `de facto
   states'. The article describes the process of dataset construction,
   presents summary statistics, and identifies key patterns concerning
   conflict onset, escalation, and resolution. In addition, it provides a
   comparison of the dataset with enduring rivalries and strategic
   rivalries to situate it within existing research on conflict escalation
   and conflict resolution. The dataset is presented in a cross-sectional
   format compatible with the Correlates of War and the Uppsala Conflict
   Data Program that can be used by other researchers in peace and conflict
   studies to provide new insights into the dynamics of frozen conflicts.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new dyadic dataset measuring formal diplomatic
   relations. These data were coded from the Europa World Yearbook annually
   from 1960 to 2013 for 18,317 unique country dyads, and include the level
   of diplomatic representation (whether the diplomatic connection is
   focused on a single or multiple target countries) as well as a summary
   measure that captures both directed and shared dyadic level of
   representation. We compare the new data with data gathered previously by
   the Correlates of War project and find significant specific
   discrepancies in the period between 1970 and 1985. We then test the new
   data by replicating Neumayer (2008) generally validating those findings:
   distance, power, and ideological affinity each matter when sending and
   receiving formal diplomatic relations. However, using the new annual
   diplomatic representation data, we demonstrate a different relationship
   between power, affinity, and probability of diplomatic connection:
   dyadic foreign policy affinity is a more important driver of diplomatic
   exchange if both the sending and receiving countries have average
   relative material capabilities and matters little if one or both
   countries in the dyad are very powerful or very weak relative to
   previous model results.},

Title = {Partisan Dealignment and Personal Vote-Seeking in Parliamentary
   Behaviour},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {195-215},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {What shapes legislators' incentives for personal vote-seeking in
   parliament? Recent work suggests that partisanship among voters deters
   personal vote-seeking, by limiting its effectiveness. This has
   potentially significant implications for policy-making, election results
   and patterns of accountability. However, empirical tests of this
   argument remain few in number and have several limitations. This article
   thus offers a new test of the relationship between partisanship and
   personal vote-seeking. Using legislators' bill proposals as an indicator
   of their personal vote-seeking activity, I analyse legislative behaviour
   in the UK House of Commons between 1964 and 2017. I find that members of
   parliament make more legislative proposals when voters are less
   partisan. Moreover, partisanship appears to moderate the influence of
   other drivers of personal vote-seeking: electorally vulnerable
   legislators make more legislative proposals, but only at low levels of
   partisanship. These findings provide new evidence that voters'
   relationships with political parties affect legislators' electoral
   strategies and parliamentary behaviour.},

Abstract = {Land protests account for a large proportion of all protests in China,
   but existing scholarship on the topic does not explain the conditions
   under which large-scale land protests succeed or fail. Focusing on the
   role of domestic media in four of the largest land protests in China
   from 2012 to 2017, we argue that protests are more likely to succeed
   -i.e., to accomplish some or all publicly stated goals-when the domestic
   media side with villagers; conversely, if the domestic media adopt the
   government's framing of the events or if they do not report on them,
   protests are less likely to accomplish their goals. This article makes
   two theoretical contributions to the literature on media and protests:
   first, we show that domestic media may function as catalysts or
   watchdogs in protest outcomes in authoritarian states; and second, we
   differentiate between short-term and long-term protest outcomes,
   highlighting how initial short-term concessions are often reversed or
   followed by repression some months or years later, after unrest dies
   down.},

Abstract = {Over the last decades we have witnessed a growing support coalition for
   the welfare state and at the same time an increase in conflict over its
   specific design. In this context of high but specific support for social
   policy, parties engage in issue competition. The question therefore
   arises as to how well parties' social policy issue emphases match
   voters' preferences and which voters' preferences do they match?
   Building on issue yield theory, I argue that parties emphasise bridge
   policies; policies that enjoy high support both among partisansandamong
   the general electorate. Using an original online-survey and a new and
   fine-grained coding of social policy emphasis in party manifestos from
   seven West European countries, I find that parties, irrespective of
   party family, are indeed congruent with both supporters and the general
   electorate. Hence, general congruence is quite high, but specifically
   directed towards broadly supported issues.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of visuality and narrative in the forging
   of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the United Nations Security
   Council P5 + 1. We advance strategic narrative theory by explaining how
   narrative alignment between longstanding antagonists can occur through
   protagonists' coordination of communication - a methodology of
   orchestration - across public and private spaces of diplomacy. Analysis
   of news, policy and social media materials as well as interviews with
   protagonists allows us to trace the gestures and performances through
   which actors sought to reinforce or overcome an identity narrative of
   Iran as untrustworthy and dangerous. We draw on Foucault's concept of
   alethurgy to show how verification mechanisms were constructed to ensure
   Iran's actions (if not its intentions) could be brought into public
   view. US and Iranian leaders' political will was significant, and
   sanctions and sabotage exerted considerable pressure on Iran. This
   article demonstrates how communication can enable alignment and
   peace-making rather than confusion and conflict in world affairs.},

Abstract = {This conclusion to a special issue on backlash politics develops a
   proto-theory of backlash politics. The special issue's introduction
   defined backlash politics as a particular form of political contestation
   with a retrograde objective as well as extraordinary goals or tactics
   that has reached the threshold level of entering mainstream public
   discourse. While a sub-category of contentious politics, we argue that
   backlash politics is distinct and should not be understood as
   `regressive contentious politics'. Drawing from the contributions to
   this special issue, we discuss the causes of backlash politics, yet we
   argue that the greatest theoretical advances may come from studying
   backlash dynamics and how these dynamics contribute to different
   outcomes. We develop a proto-theory of backlash politics that considers
   causes for the rise of backlash movements, how frequent companions to
   backlash politics - emotive politics, nostalgia, taboo breaking, and
   institution reshaping - intensify backlash dynamics and make it more
   likely that backlash politics generate consequential outcomes.},

   Density Dependence and Political Opportunity Structure},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},

Pages = {1043-1067},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the formation of organized interest
   groups in the post-communist context and organizational populations over
   time. We test two theories that shed doubt on whether vital rates of
   interest groups are explained by individual incentives, namely, the
   political opportunity structure and population ecology theory. Based on
   an analysis of the energy policy and higher education policy
   organizations active at the national level in Hungary, Poland, and
   Slovenia, we find that while the period of democratic and economic
   transition indeed opened up the opportunity structure for organizational
   formations, it by no means presented a clean slate. Communist-era
   successor and splinter organizations survived the collapse of communism,
   and all three countries entered transition with relatively high density
   rates in both organizational populations. We also find partial support
   for the density dependence hypothesis. Surprisingly, the EU integration
   process, the intensity of legislative activity, and media attention do
   not seem to have meaningfully influenced founding rates in the two
   populations.},

Abstract = {The ontological and epistemological footing of narrative policy research
   remains uncertain. In this article, interpretive approaches to policy
   narrative research are advanced and scientism is eschewed. Other themes
   in the policy narrative literature that serve as points of divergence
   and/or convergence include: 1) The structural features of a policy
   narrative; 2) The semiotic nature of policy narratives; 3)
   Epistemological politics; 4) Emancipatory politics within the
   literature; and 5) The idea that narratives are a force in themselves,
   that is, that narratives have agency. In addition, this article argues
   for a curatorial approach to redescribing policy narratives, and for an
   evolutionary conception of policy change and political contestation.},

Title = {Women or Leaders? Practices of Narrating the United Nations as a
   Gendered Institution},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-369},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The United Nations has been an important forum for promoting women's
   rights, but women are still underrepresented at the most senior levels
   of its leadership. This points to persistent obstacles in reaching
   gender parity at the UN, despite the organization's overt commitment to
   this objective. Situated in feminist institutionalist insights, I argue
   that the institutionalization of gender inequality through practices in
   the UN as a gendered institution can account for continued barriers to
   women leadership. This makes contributions to feminist institutionalist
   literature in international relations by taking it to the individual
   microlevel. Gendered practices sustain, inform, and manifest themselves
   in four interconnected processes that reinforce gendered divisions of
   subordination: positional divides, symbols and imagery, everyday
   interactions, and individual identity (based on Acker 1990, 146-47;
   Scott 1986). These processes and their practices become accessible
   through the narrative analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted
   with senior women leaders at the UN. By recognizing their narratives as
   valid forms of insight into the study of the UN, this approach
   recognizes women leaders' agency as opposed to portraying them as
   numbers only.},

Abstract = {Is shale oil ``revolutionizing{''} the global oil market and the
   geopolitics of oil? If so, how? While two aspects of the shale boom-a
   new source of supply and a cause for the price collapse in
   2014-2015-dominate the conventional wisdom, I argue that the most
   revolutionary change is the least understood aspect of shale oil-shale
   oil producers' rise as new swing suppliers due to its unique extraction
   technique and cost structure. Shale oil producers also differ from
   traditional swing producers in motives, contexts, and an amount of
   accessible excess capacity such that while shale oil lowers the
   medium-term price ceiling, it does not eliminate short-term price
   volatility. By examining the geopolitics of oil since the advent of
   shale oil, I analyze how such new market realities have or have not
   altered the US foreign policy on issues involving possible oil supply
   disruptions, Saudi Arabia's long-held special status in US grand
   strategy, rationale for US withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, and the
   foreign policy of China, the largest oil importer today, and Russia, a
   major petrostate.},

   Considerations and Barriers Inhibiting the Adoption of Counterterrorism
   Protective Security Measures},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {While much of the literature concerning counterterrorism focuses on
   policies and strategies aimed at removing either the terrorist
   environment and/or the groups or individuals willing to utilize
   political violence to achieve their goal(s), there is a much smaller
   body of work concerned with antiterrorism, namely those defensive
   measures that are designed to prevent or deter terrorist attacks.
   Increasingly, crowded places have become popular targets for terrorists
   and the research presented in this article connects the planning,
   design, and development of real estate with respect to the adoption of
   protective counterterrorism measures. It seeks to develop new
   understandings of the considerations that real estate developments have
   toward terrorism, as well as the barriers that may inhibit
   counterterrorism protective security measures in future development
   projects. The analysis is based on qualitative research, namely
   semi-structured interviews conducted in the United Kingdom, United
   States, and Australia with professionals involved in all core strands of
   the real estate development process. The findings suggest that
   considerations toward terrorism vary considerably as a consequence of a
   range of factors and that while expected factors such as cost and
   aesthetics are important determinants for decision making, a range of
   other barriers exist.},

Abstract = {The authors of the article show manifestations of homophobia in a range
   of Eastern European countries. They use the example of Poland to compare
   the current situation of LGBT people with that in the communist period.
   The article defends the thesis that homophobia, which goes hand in hand
   with Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and widespread dislike for any
   cultural minority, is a cultural compensation for economic
   disappointment and an expression of the Eastern European opposition to
   the economic and political expansion of the West. From this perspective,
   the dominant nationalist orientation requires treating not only LGBT
   communities, but also their defenders, supporters of a more liberal
   culture and civic organizations, as representatives of ``foreign
   centers{''} who intend to meet ``the interests of the core European
   Union (EU) countries.{''} Thus, messianic nationalism and homophobia are
   a compensation for economic marginalization and a form of defense moved
   from the sphere of economic problems to the sphere of identity.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the differences in pledge fulfilment strategies
   in majority and substantive minority governments. Issue ownership and
   dynamic agenda-setting literature are applied, expecting that government
   parties will focus on fulfilling the party's most salient pledges, and
   also the pledges that are publicly salient for the whole electorate.
   Adding these expectations to the context of substantive minority
   governments, parties must accommodate these attempts because they face
   the opposition actor(s) with veto power and their own policy motivation.
   Compared to majority governments, the odds of adopting party-salient
   pledges should decrease for minority coalition parties. The effect of
   public-salient issues should also differ from the majority governments.
   This analysis is conducted on government party pledges in one minority
   and two majority governments in the Czech Republic (formed after 2006,
   2010, and 2013 elections). The analysis shows a generally weak effect
   for party and public issue salience on pledge fulfilment. The decreasing
   effect of party issue salience for minority government parties is
   supported; the effect of public issue salience does, however, not differ
   in its decreasing direction from the majority governments. The
   additional model including combinations of the high and low party and
   public salience shows that for minority governments, public salience
   decreases the odds of fulfilment regardless of party issue salience. The
   article concludes with a contextual explanation of the minority
   government's special character in the Czech case.},

Abstract = {The concepts and theories of small state studies, a sub-discipline of
   international relations, have been connected to Western political
   development, making their applicability in regions outside of Europe
   questionable. Using the framework of the English School, the present
   article aims at identifying the main elements of small state theory
   which are needed to be altered to make it suitable for the Middle East
   and North Africa. Investigating the regional manifestation of main
   primary institutions which form the basis of the analysis of small
   states (namely statehood, sovereignty, conflict and cooperation), the
   research concludes that the leverage of Middle Eastern small states is
   highly different than it is expected by traditional small state studies,
   especially due to the regional norms related to statehood and conflict.
   Consequently, changing our conceptual framework of ``small states{''} to
   ``small regimes{''} would be also necessary to better interpret how such
   entities behave in the Middle East or other regions of the world.},

Abstract = {During the Great Recession, radical left parties in Portugal intensified
   their opposition to Europe and public opinion became increasingly
   eurosceptic. Nevertheless, the cooperation among leftist parties
   following the 2015 elections, which brought eurosceptic parties into
   power, coincided with a rise in positive attitudes towards the EU. This
   paper aims to explain this puzzle by examining party stances and
   citizens' views on Europe before and after the crisis. It will be argued
   that the economic crisis had mainly a temporary impact on party and
   popular euroscepticism. Both ideological and strategic considerations
   help explain euroscepticism, but the Great Recession did not
   structurally alter party-voter alignments and the dynamics of the party
   system.},

Abstract = {An increasingly lamented consequence of re-regulatory efforts following
   the 2007/2008 global financial crisis has been `de-risking'-the growing
   disengagement by banks and other financial institutions with markets
   perceived as posing greater risks than justified by potential profits.
   As banks based in the Global North have moved to withdraw financial
   services from many emerging economies, de-risking has attracted
   attention for undermining financial inclusion and developmental efforts.
   Novel technologies are being harnessed to address this problem,
   including applications of blockchain, the digital ledgers of
   transactions originally underpinning cryptocurrencies. Contributing to
   IR theorising of legitimacy and re-risking, this article illustrates how
   technology-based de-risking efforts that seek to attend to the
   perceptions of foreign financiers can undermine the legitimacy of
   financial inclusion projects. Contrasting unfolding blockchain-based
   financial inclusion initiatives in two regions of small states in the
   Eastern Caribbean and Eastern Europe, our analysis stresses the need for
   greater local participation and clearer distribution of benefits from
   finance and technology (fintech) centred forms of digital development.},

Abstract = {The Marcha Verde movement emerged in 2017 to protest bribery on the part
   of the Brazilian transnational Odebrecht. It conducted 25 protests in
   the provinces and large marches in July 2017 and August 2018 but
   ultimately failed to force the government to try those responsible. As a
   movement for the democratization of democracy through the construction
   of citizens' rights, it was a watershed moment in Dominican political
   history. However, it did not have time to build the social base that
   would have allowed it to challenge the authorities. The political
   parties that supported it were only interested in weakening the official
   party, and the electoral race intervened as the way to channel the
   movements' demands, leaving the radicals alone in calling for a
   transformation of the political sphere. El movimiento Marcha Verde
   surgio en 2017 en protesta contra los sobornos efectuados por la
   transnacional brasilena Odebrecht. Aunque organizo 25 protestas en las
   provincias y grandes marchas en julio de 2017 y agosto de 2018, no logro
   forzar al gobierno a enjuiciar a los responsables. En tanto se trata de
   un movimiento para la democratizacion de la democracia a traves de la
   construccion de los derechos ciudadanos, este fue un momento decisivo en
   la historia politica dominicana. Sin embargo, no tuvo tiempo de
   construir la base social que le hubiera permitido desafiar a las
   autoridades. Los partidos politicos que lo apoyaron solo estaban
   interesados en debilitar al partido oficial, y las elecciones que
   intervinieron en el proceso se convirtieron en la via de canalizacion
   para las demandas del movimiento, dejando a los elementos radicales
   solos en su exigencia por una genuina transformacion de la esfera
   politica.},

   rise of new threats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-268},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {When new threats arise, how do weaker partners allied with great powers
   choose among loyalty (remaining allied to their great power patrons),
   hedging (improving political relations with the challenger, or - in the
   nuclear age - pursuing nuclear weapons), and exit (leaving the alliance
   by declaring neutrality or defecting to the rising challenger)? We argue
   that, in general, as proteges come to doubt the ability or willingness
   of patrons to defend them, they are likely to shift away from loyalty
   and towards exit. Where they end up on this alliance spectrum, however,
   depends on additional factors that we identify, including signals of
   commitment from patrons and the territorial claims of challengers
   against proteges. We illustrate our argument and these conditions in
   three cases from interwar and early Cold War Europe and draw
   implications for U.S. alliances today.},

Abstract = {Purpose Firms often encounter complicated external relationships and
   conflicts in inbound and outbound open innovation (OI). Conflict
   management significantly affects innovation results. Guided by resource
   dependence theory (RDT), this study aims to examine the moderating
   effects of conflict management styles in the relationship between OI and
   organizational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach This study
   focuses on manufacturing and service firms in China, with the
   respondents composed of senior managers. Using hierarchical regression
   analysis, data from 270 firm samples are used to empirically test the
   hypotheses. Findings Inbound and outbound OI openness positively affects
   OP. Cooperative conflict management positively moderates the
   relationship between inbound OI openness and OP, whereas it negatively
   moderates the impact of outbound OI openness on OP. By contrast,
   competitive conflict management positively moderates the relationship
   between outbound OI openness on OP. Research limitations/implications
   Guided by RDT, this study explores the relationship between OI and OP
   and the moderating role of conflict management styles. However, it does
   not measure the level of resource dependence, which is among the future
   research directions for further validating the results of this study.
   Originality/value This study is among the first to investigate the
   impact of OI on OP in different conflict management styles. Findings
   suggest that choosing a suitable conflict management style may
   strengthen the positive effects of OI on OP.},

Abstract = {The strategic culture approach has been suffering from a prolonged
   theoretical stalemate, despite a surge in case studies, which culminated
   in the Johnston-Gray debate and subsequent schism. The present paper
   outlines a new approach designed to overcome this deadlock, and consists
   of three arguments. First, the three previous generations of strategic
   culture studies have failed to explain how strategic culture influences
   behaviour. Second, aligning strategic culture theory-building with
   discursive institutionalism offers a way to overcome this fundamental
   fallacy. Third, a research programme for strategic culture should draw
   on computational social science to enable it to present and test
   middle-range theories.},

Abstract = {Trans-municipal networks (TMNs) have reshaped the landscape around local
   government action on global climate policy. Past research has focused on
   why cities join TMNs and the impact that membership has on local action.
   This study considers a potential reverse effect: namely, that cities'
   membership choices position them to influence TMNs' overall priorities.
   In considering this, we emphasize the role of network administrative
   organizations (NAOs) and posit that the multiple climate-related
   networks, which share members and operate in overlapping geographic and
   issue spaces, are bound together as part of a meta-network. We utilize
   social network analysis and data on membership in four climate-related
   TMNs to examine the factors that shape how cities can influence
   meta-network priorities. We find that cities with local vulnerabilities
   tend to be located in network positions that enable them to influence
   the meta-network's overall priorities.},

Title = {Migration regimes and the governance of citizenship: a comparison
   between legal categories of migration in China and in the European Union},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {633-657},

Abstract = {This paper aims at providing a general picture of how the citizenship
   migration nexus currently unfolds in China and in the European Union
   (EU). Although China is a nation state and the EU is a supranational
   entity, both entities are characterised by internal and external
   politico-legal borders delineating two self-contained migration areas.
   Drawing on a definition of citizenship which transcends its usual
   national connotation, this paper will review and compare how different
   migration categories available to individuals on the move (citizens and
   non-citizens) come with differential accesses to citizenship rights
   within the two contexts. The comparison will show that in spite of
   different approaches towards irregular migration, welfare and
   humanitarian issues, current categories of migration within these two
   migration regimes converge in the way in which they grant differential
   access to citizenship rights based on the (assumed) economic worth of
   individuals on the move. The final part of this paper reflects upon the
   lessons that each system could draw from the other and postulates such
   convergence as an indicator of the correlation between the granting of
   citizenship rights and neoliberal imperatives in the governance of
   migration worldwide.},

Abstract = {Contestation over European integration has been widely studied in the
   rhetoric of parties, leaders, and movements on the far right in a
   variety of media. Focusing on Twitter use by far right actors in Western
   Europe, we apply corpus-aided discourse analysis to explore how
   imaginative geographies are used to politicize Europe among their
   digital publics. We find that the idea of a crisis of cultural identity
   pervades imaginaries of Europe amongst far right digital publics. While
   Europe is presented as facing a crisis of cultural identity, we find
   that the far right articulates an aspirational imaginary of Europe, the
   `Europe des Nations' that rejects liberal-democratic pluralism in the EU
   and the `establishment'. We find that the contestation of Europe in far
   right digital publics relies on a crisis of cultural identity,
   representing a translation ofNouvelle Droiteimaginaries of Europe into
   the social media space.},

   Policies Towards Terrorist Semi-States},

Abstract = {Israel's policy towards both terrorist semi-states (TSS)-Fatahland and
   Hamas-controlled Gaza-shows a puzzling variation over time between
   threat-management (i.e., deterrence and/or brute force
   capacity-reduction) and entity-elimination. We hold that a
   military-based cost-benefit analysis cannot fully account for this
   variation. This explanation predicts that Israel would avoid the costly
   and risky TSS-elimination as long as Israel can effectively manage the
   military danger through the much cheaper deterrence/periodical capacity
   reduction or when there is a high risk of not getting a much better
   option partly due to the danger of creating a power-vacuum into which
   other terrorists may reenter. Yet, some Israeli Prime Ministers pursued
   TSS-elimination notwithstanding the vacuum consideration and deterrence
   working. By adding a non-military variable-the extent to which Israel's
   policy-makers believe that the TSS harms their ideologically-preferred
   foreign policy goals-we can better reconstruct changes in threat
   perception and hence better explain policy variation. The TSSs became an

Abstract = {Since 2015, the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc, PiS)
   governments in Poland have engineered a revolt against the post-1989
   `liberal consensus' and a shift towards a regime rooted in executive
   aggrandisement, populism and nativism. In this article, we contextualise
   this shift in terms of a persistent `metapolitical' dispute over the
   legitimacy of political actors and the contestability of certain areas
   of policy. PiS claims to be reintroducing pluralism to a Polish politics
   dominated by monistic technocratic liberalism. In response, the party
   has implemented a series of changes entrenching an even more
   exclusionist form of monism. Whilst economic policies have empowered
   social groups that felt excluded from post-1989 reforms, nativist
   cultural policies and colonisation of the political-institutional
   infrastructure have militated against the pluralist understanding of
   politics as structured disagreement. We conclude that Polish politics
   remains dominated not by disagreements over policy, but by the
   metapolitical question of who has the right to govern Poland.},

Abstract = {As the first country stricken by the COVID-19 pandemic, China deployed a
   policy response that was chaotic at the start but effective in the end.
   A complete account to explain China's COVID-19 experience should explain
   both. By examining policy changes in China's fight against the pandemic,
   I show that pandemic as an exogenous shock invalidated the normal policy
   logics followed by multiple policy actors, resulting in policy
   inconsistency and chaos. A policy mix comprised traditional measures,
   i.e. strict community lockdown, cross-jurisdictional mobilization of
   resources and officials' sanction contributed to the eventual
   effectiveness of China's response to the pandemic. I argue that the
   policy mix during crises should conform with rooted national policy
   style to be consistent and effective.},

Abstract = {This article shows that, in the health policy sector, an infrastructure
   of expertise external to the state has developed in the United States
   from the 1970s on, representing a reserve of health-care specialists in
   many ways comparable to a specialized, high-level civil service.
   Decision makers can delve into that pool of experts when looking for
   advice, or to find loyal and competent managers to fill administrative
   positions. By identifying this infrastructure as a
   ``peri-administration,{''} this article links up with a recent line of
   thinking on the American State that reconsiders the classical
   interpretative frames proposed by the Weberian model. The article
   examines the contribution of this category of policy experts to the

Title = {The Paranoid Style in American Politics Revisited: An Ideological
   Asymmetry in Conspiratorial Thinking},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is often claimed that conspiracy theories are endorsed with the same
   level of intensity across the left-right ideological spectrum. But do
   liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial
   thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical,
   philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard
   Hofstadter's bookThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto doubt this
   claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (totalN = 5049)-including
   national samples-we investigated the relationship between political
   ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and
   conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in
   the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse
   specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse
   conspiratorial worldviews in general (r = .27, 95\% CI: .24, .30).
   Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to
   engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges'g =
   .77,SE = .07,p < .001). The relationship between ideology and
   conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom
   and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives,
   consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American
   politics.},

Abstract = {As mobility is increasingly reshaping social relations, understanding
   how it affects new forms of social exclusion is an important challenge
   in today's polarized societies. From a political-psychological
   perspective, this challenge requires recognition of how identity
   processes linked to exclusion are significantly shaped by sociospatial
   mobility practices. Identity, mobility, and exclusion are at the core of
   the psychological experience of people living in segregated areas from
   where they are impelled to leave. Building on this argument, we present
   a qualitative case study based on ethnographic and narrative methods,
   which aimed to understand identity processes among young people who have
   lived most of their lives in four ``stigmatized neighborhoods{''} in
   Santiago de Chile. The analysis indicated that young people navigate a
   paradoxical identity project in such neighborhoods, driven by
   contradictory cultural mandates. This case study contributes to
   knowledge on how sociospatial exclusion and the politics of mobility can
   manifest in the form of ``identity trouble,{''} as young people struggle
   between belonging and running away, while attempting to maintain a
   coherent sense of self.},

Abstract = {The article explores the complex interaction between war-dynamics and
   non-state armed groups' approaches to governance and politics at the
   local, sub-national level. It focuses on understanding how broader
   conflict trends influence rebel groups' choices with respect to
   establishing local governance partnerships, both with civilian agents
   and other armed factions. The study examines this question through the
   lens of the Syrian landscape and through an overview of local governance
   arrangements by Jabhat al-Nusra(1)in the Idlib and Aleppo provinces
   between 2012 and 2017. In tracing the evolution of rebel co-governance
   arrangements at the local level,(2)the article highlights two dynamics:
   first, how the breakdown of centralized governance and the gradual
   processed of militarization of local authority(3)altered the balance
   between civilian and armed actors, shifting power in the hands of the
   latter. Second, how the combination of prolonged strategic stalemate,
   resource scarcity and ideological competition between armed factions
   resulted in a shift from cooperative to competitive rebel governance.
   The article seeks to further nuance the study of rebel governance and
   rebel-to-political transitions by focusing on how multi-level
   relationships affect armed groups' governance choices.(4)},

Abstract = {Although public reaction to disaster has been the subject of much
   research, reactions to acts of terrorism have been studied less,
   sustaining a common assumption that fear is the generic response. The
   present paper tests this assumption through a survey of reactions to the
   Manchester Arena bombing and London Bridge attack of 2017, and the
   findings suggest that an important likely additional modal citizen
   reaction to such events is one of anger at the perpetrators, holding
   important implications for public policy and security practice in the
   wake of such acts.},

Abstract = {Targeted killing is a cornerstone of counter-terrorism strategy, and
   tactical mistakes made by militant groups are endemic in terrorism. Yet,
   how do they affect a militant group's suicide bomber deployment? Since
   joining Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab has carried out various types of suicide
   attacks on different targets. Using a uniquely constructed dataset, I
   introduce two typologies of suicide bomber detonation profiles - single
   and multiple - and explore the strategic purposes these have served for
   the group during multiphasic stages following targeted killings against
   the group's leadership and targeting errors committed by Al-Shabaab. The
   findings reveal that targeted killing has the opposite effect of
   disrupting suicide attacks, instead, leading to a rapid proliferation of
   unsophisticated single suicide attacks against civilian and military
   targets to maintain the perception of the group's potency. Thus, I argue
   that targeting errors made by Al-Shabaab have a more serious detrimental
   effect on its deployment of suicide attacks than any counter-terrorism
   measure.},

Abstract = {The subsequent research attempts to explore if and how county
   governments might be significant in administering welfare policy when
   discretion has devolved to these local governing bodies. First, I ask
   how descriptive representation might lead to substantive representation
   in local governments by examining how women and minorities serving on
   local governing bodies might affect TANF programmatic outcomes. I find
   that when the proportion of women serving on county boards is greater,
   TANF administration is less punitive. Second, I explore how local
   partisanship might affect programmatic outcomes, given that previous
   research demonstrates a strong relationship between local political
   leanings and the punitiveness of welfare policy. I find that the
   partisan leanings of the local governing body substantively affect
   welfare administration, where Republican-dominated boards institute more
   punitive welfare policy than their Democratic counterparts. Finally, I
   assess if and how electoral rules, like whether the local governing body
   is elected at large or to serve single-member districts, might affect
   program administration, finding that local governing bodies with a
   greater proportion of members serving single-member districts result in
   welfare participants being less likely to be sanctioned.},

Abstract = {This article reports on trends in organized violence, building on new
   data by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). The defeat of Islamic
   State (IS) in Syria and Iraq has pushed the number of fatalities, almost
   75,600, to its lowest level since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war
   in 2011. However, this de-escalation in Syria is countered by increased
   violence in Africa, as IS and other transnational jihadist groups have
   relocated their efforts there. Furthermore, violence has continued to
   increase in Afghanistan; UCDP recorded more than 31,200 fatalities in
   Afghanistan in 2019, which accounts for 40\% of all fatalities from
   organized violence across the globe. The general decline in fatalities
   from organized violence does not correspond with the trend in the number
   of active conflicts, which remained on a historically high level. UCDP
   recorded 54 state-based conflicts in 2019, including seven wars.
   Twenty-eight state-based conflicts involved IS (Islamic State), al-Qaida
   or their affiliates. In the past decade, conflicts involving these
   transnational jihadist groups have driven many of the trends in
   organized violence.},

Abstract = {In this article we map and explain the sources of knowledge cited on 85
   Brexit impact appraisals, 46 of which were formal impact assessments
   ordered and published by the European Parliament and 39 `sectoral
   reports' ordered by the UK Government and released by the House of
   Commons Exiting the EU Committee. All reports were published between the
   day after the UK referendum and the year after the start of the UK-EU
   negotiations. We conducted a citation analysis of 3537 references and
   testedauthor pushandpolicy sector pullhypotheses with non-parametric
   tests. Our findings highlight the epistemic function of the professional
   referent groups to which authors belong. Authors tend to generate
   information and cite sources that are congruent with their `home group'
   in the departmental unit where they work, or their larger professional
   group, even in urgent high-salient risk situations like Brexit.

Abstract = {Bringing together terrorism studies, subcultural theory, and narrative
   criminology, we here test the thesis that neutralization theory might be
   (further) developed to provide a framework for understanding stories of
   ideologically informed subcultural violence. Beginning with Gresham
   Sykes's and David Matza's original five neutralizations, we illustrate
   how actors engage them in three modes: the encultured, the subcultural,
   and (tentatively) the postnarrative mode. We test the first two modes in
   particular against narratives and narrative fragments from interviews
   with men convicted of right-wing violence in Germany. Our findings
   provide a preliminary illustration of what neutralization theory might
   bring to research into political violence.},

Abstract = {Taking stock of critical peace research and agonistic politics, this
   article revisits the Basque conflict to examine the role of the state's
   counterterrorist narrative and that of the Basque civil society in the
   elimination of violence. It argues that violence could have ended sooner
   if Spanish governments had sought to engage with the non- and
   antiviolent independentist discourse of broad sectors of the Basque
   society, rather than criminalizing it as they rightly did with the
   radical/extremist nationalists. Had they done so, they could have
   capitalized on Basque civil society's strong antiviolent and
   anti-Euskadi Ta Askatasuna discourse to marginalize the terrorist
   organization and its networks of support. The article presents a
   framework that makes possible the marginalization of militancy and
   extremism in cases where the state accepts to negotiate the legitimacy
   of the demands of non- and/or antiviolent nationalists.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present the results of an analysis of print media
   reporting on the spectacular trial in 1984 against the murderers of
   Jerzy Popieluszko in communist Poland. The aim of my research is to show
   how the coverage contributed to the de-legitimization of the Communist
   Party despite the mass media system's tight structures of control.
   Because of mass media functionality, the coverage of this event
   contributed to political transformation not only by publicizing a
   hitherto tabooed topic but also by establishing an initial point for
   informed public criticism of the government.},

Abstract = {The critique of Eurocentrism has become one of the main benchmarks for
   critical scholarship in International Relations (IR). Unsurprisingly,
   the effort to overcome Eurocentric conceptions of world history has been
   at the forefront of the bourgeoning subfield of International Historical
   Sociology (IHS). In many anti-Eurocentric theorisations of IHS,
   Political Marxist approaches to world history have been posited as
   counter-models imbued with methodological `internalism' and
   Eurocentrism. In this article, I critically re-evaluate the extent to
   which IHS has remedied the problem of Eurocentrism. Furthermore, I argue
   that the conventional critique of Political Marxism (PM) is largely off
   the mark and, indeed, IHS in general and the theory of Uneven and
   Combined Development in particular need PM to deepen the international
   sociological imagination and deliver a non-hierarchical reading of world
   history.},

Abstract = {It is often claimed that NATO's post-Cold War geographic enlargement
   threatened Russian security interests and caused the downturn in
   Russia's relations with the West. This article unpacks and challenges
   that causal claim, making three basic arguments. First, NATO enlargement
   made the alliance weaker. Russia knew this and did not react militarily
   to any perceived threat from Europe until after it seized Crimea in
   2014. Second, the downturn in Russia's relationship with the West was
   overdetermined and most likely caused by Russia's reaction to its own
   declining influence in the world. While NATO's geographic enlargement
   aggravated this situation, it was probably not the most significant
   causal factor. Third, while Russia certainly reacted negatively to NATO
   enlargement right from the start, the reaction was manipulated and
   magnified by both the nationalist opposition, and Vladimir Putin's
   regime, to serve domestic political interests.},

Abstract = {In spite of the substantial liberalization of China's film industry, it
   is still highly regulated and protected from foreign competition through
   a series of policy measures. In the midst of pushing both liberalization
   and protectionism, Chinese firms tend to exploit favorable government
   policies and avoid restrictive regulations through alternative options
   to maximize profits. Most preceding studies emphasized the
   liberalization efforts by the Chinese government as a significant
   contribution to the film industry, while neglecting the response and
   strategies of Chinese filmmakers that have upgraded their overall
   competitiveness. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the
   government-firm interplay and their influences on the enhanced
   competitive advantages of Chinese filmmakers and the film industry, by
   utilizing the theoretical framework of the ABCD model to demonstrate
   this interaction. Based on the comprehensive analysis of both Chinese
   achievements and remaining challenges, this study further provides
   useful policy implications for improving China's film industry.},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {65-71},

Abstract = {In the 1930s Hollywood enjoyed a popular following in the Japanese film
   market, accounting for almost 90 per cent of imported sound films.
   Against a backdrop of emerging political tensions and war in China, the
   Japanese government announced in 1937 that it would place a ban on
   Hollywood film imports. This was a move that ushered in a new era of
   protectionism for Japan's emerging film industry. Following this
   decision, Hollywood studios engaged with Tokyo and sought an agreement
   to ease the new restrictions. After a period of intense discussions, the
   Japanese government agreed to lift the ban albeit with certain
   conditions. This paper examines protectionism in the Japanese film
   market and considers the impact of political forces, both domestic and
   international, on the decisions made. It will show that economic factors
   were mostly behind the decision to implement the ban and therefore
   facilitated the reaching of an agreement between the two sides.
   Furthermore, the interests of the domestic film industry who would
   benefit from the import of Hollywood films helped lift the ban.},

Abstract = {States can seemingly defy the dictates of globalization. In practice,
   although being pressured by their competitors, states rarely engage in
   the race to the bottom by downgrading labor rights laws that are
   politically costly to pursue. I argue that states' resistance is made
   possible by adopting more viable policy alternatives, i.e., concluding
   preferential trade agreements (PTAs). PTAs can generate considerable
   economic gains in a less politically costly way than does reducing legal
   labor protection. As a result, it is expected that a pair of states is
   more likely to form a PTA in the face of policy pressure to lower legal
   labor protection. I also argue that facing such pressure, these states
   are more likely to include strong labor provisions in PTAs. Finally, in
   the face of the policy pressure, states may feel that signing a PTA is a
   bit less urgent when they are able to diminish practical labor
   protection. Applying structural equivalence technique to a new global
   labor rights dataset to capture the policy pressure to lower legal labor
   protection, I find robust evidence in support of these conjectures.},

Abstract = {The EP plays a crucial role in defining the power of implementing
   agencies in the EU. In this article, we move beyond the `unitary actor'
   approach to the EP and examine the influence of intra-parliamentary
   dynamics on the delegation patterns in the Union. We maintain that party
   polarization as well as the level of policy salience shape delegation
   patterns in the EU. Reflecting the differences between political elites,
   increasing party polarization motivates the EP to curtail the prospect
   of bureaucratic drift when delegating power. Lacking effective control
   mechanisms over the supranational agency, the EP hinders the extent of
   delegated power if the Commission oversees the policy. In contrast to
   the extant literature, we do not find policy salience to be influential
   for the EP's delegation decisions. We test these conjunctions using data
   from the Euromanifesto project and the dataset on delegation dynamic in
   the Union.},

Abstract = {Poland's accession to NATO in 1999 undermined Russian-NATO relations. A
   similar contestation occurred before the EU's eastern enlargement when
   the transit of Russians to and from Kaliningrad was a contentious topic
   in EU-Russian diplomacy. Currently Russia's deployment of missiles in
   Kaliningrad has become a security concern. This article argues that
   NATO's security concerns replaced EU-Russian contestation about visa
   liberalisation as the main source of conflict in their relationship. It
   demonstrates that the case of Kaliningrad reflects a dual shift from a
   contested to a fluid boundary in EU-Russian relations, and from a
   contested to a solid boundary in NATO-Russian relations.},

   leverage synergies and the integration of critical capabilities across
   space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum. The PLASSF will
   support joint operations and provide new strategic capabilities to
   complement the PLA's existing arsenal. In any future conflict scenarios,
   the PLASSF will play an integral role in the PLA's quest to `fight and
   win' wars. Looking forward, the PLASSF may also become a critical force
   for innovation as the PLA prepares for future warfare.},

Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {446-462},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Political trust has become a central focus of political analysis and
   public lament. Political theorists and philosophers typically think of
   interpersonal trust in politics as a fragile but valuable resource for a
   flourishing or stable democratic polity. This article examines what
   conception of trust is needed in order to play this role. It unpicks two
   candidate answers, a moral and a responsiveness conception, the latter
   of which has been central to recent political theory in this area. It
   goes on to outline a third, commitment conception and to set out how a
   focus on commitments and their fulfilment provides a better account of
   trust for political purposes. Adopting this conception discloses how
   trust relies on a contestable public normative space and has significant
   implications for how we should approach three cognate topics, namely,
   judgements of trust, the place of distrust and the relationship of
   interpersonal to institutional trust and distrust.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the notion of `transnational representation' to
   refer to claims by national parliamentarians on behalf of citizens of
   other national constituencies. Thus defined, transnational
   representation combines insights from the constructivist turn in the
   theory of democratic representation with a renewed focus on national
   parliaments as the prime institutional sites of representation. A focus
   on transnational representation advances the debate on democratic
   representation in an age of internationalisation in two ways. First, it
   allows for a systematic and comparative analysis of how representation
   in parliaments responds to internationalisation. Second, it suggests a
   new perspective on the possible alignment of political representation
   with the range of affected interests. We illustrate these two claims
   with a case study of transnational representation in parliamentary
   debates on the European Financial Stability Facility and by outlining an
   agenda for further research.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice faces growing expectations about its ability to
   support democratisation processes in countries transitioning from
   conflict and/or authoritarian rule. Empirical research investigating
   these claims, however, remains divided on its effects. Certain aspects
   also remain underexplored, such as transitional justice's impact on the
   security forces, despite broad recognition that the latter's
   transformation is key to supporting transitions. This paper seeks to
   fill this gap by undertaking a structured comparative analysis of four
   countries - Brazil, Chile, Sierra Leone and Uganda - to critically
   examine some of the commonly postulated pathways through which
   transitional justice is expected to impact the security forces: reform,
   removal, narrative reframing and resistance. We find there is little
   evidence of transitional justice having had a distinctly positive or
   negative effect.Where there was impact, this was often discrete,
   time-bound and accompanied by broader societal and political dynamics
   that simultaneously drove processes of change within the security
   forces.},

Abstract = {The search for sustainable peace after conflict has pushed refugees onto
   the global peacebuilding agenda, and these days it is common for
   national peacebuilding processes to extend their reach to those living
   in exile. This is significant because ordinarily, our modern political
   system considers the citizen the proper subject of political life, and
   refugees typically struggle to be seen and heard in national processes.
   This article examines two examples of refugee participation in
   peacebuilding: the state-led Liberian Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission, and a grassroots dialogue group created by Liberian refugees
   in Ghana. Based on five months' fieldwork, it considers how refugee
   narratives concerning harm, loss and recovery differed between the two
   forums, and draws attention to the role of the state in recognising - or
   not recognising - refugee narratives. It argues that while the inclusion
   of refugees in peacebuilding processes is a positive development,
   greater attention should be paid to the factors restricting or
   diminishing refugee voices and thus impeding the restorative value of
   such forums. The article concludes by identifying ways to support more
   diverse refugee voices in national peacebuilding programmes.},

Abstract = {This article presents a general analysis of the presidency of Enrique
   Pena Nieto, who came to power in 2012 as the result of the pri victory
   following twelve years of pan governments. From the outset a central and
   paradoxical element of the six-year administration is identified: the
   passage from a high-impact start to the term, with the ``Pact for
   Mexico{''} and the emblematic reforms that emerged from this, to an end
   of term that saw the president's popularity fall to historical lows, and
   his party suffer an unprecedented defeat. The paper considers the
   different structural reforms that derived from the Pact, examining the
   principal changes they brought about, together with the political
   dynamic that defined its implementation process. Meanwhile, emphasis is
   placed on two major factors that explain the decline in the image of
   both president and government: one, the numerous cases of corruption
   which not only implicated the president and his family but also several
   state governors from his party; secondly the spike in criminal violence
   and the failure of the policies aimed at fighting it.},

Abstract = {Female combatants play a central role in rebel efforts to cultivate and
   disseminate positive narratives regarding the movement and its political
   goals. Yet, the effectiveness of such strategies in shaping audience
   attitudes or generating tangible benefits for the group remains unclear.
   We propose and test a theory regarding the channels through which female
   fighters advance rebel goals. We argue that female fighters positively
   influence audience attitudes toward rebel groups by strengthening
   observers' beliefs about their legitimacy and their decision to use
   armed tactics. We further contend that these effects directly help them
   secure support from transnational nonstate actors and indirectly promote
   state support. We assess our arguments by combining a novel survey
   experiment in two countries with analyses of new cross-national data on
   female combatants and information about transnational support for
   rebels. The empirical results support our arguments and demonstrate the
   impact of gender framing on rebel efforts to secure support.},

   Model of Political Representation in China's Local Congresses},

Abstract = {Can authoritarian regimes provide meaningful representation to their
   citizens? Political representation has been primarily considered and
   discussed in liberal-democratic settings. However, why do authoritarian
   rulers care about representation? How can authoritarian rulers engender
   representation in their relationship with the ruled? China presents an
   ideal case to examine these questions in light of the party regime's
   strong claims to represent its people and the recent reforms in
   utilizing mobilizational means to generate representation. Drawing on
   first-hand data collected from thirteen fieldwork sites across eastern,
   middle and western regions of China, this article outlines a
   mobilizational model of political representation under non-liberal
   environments by unpacking the dynamics, process, and logic of
   congressional representation in China. The findings of this article
   suggest that the Chinese party regime is strongly motivated to employ
   mobilizational means to engineer congress representation in the context
   of declining use of electoral accountability. Although it still meets
   with shortcomings and challenges, the mass-line mobilizational pattern
   of representation is instrumentalized by the ruling party for
   regime-sustaining purposes, therefore creating the potential for a form
   of representative authoritarianism to emerge in China.},

Abstract = {Scholars argue that the 1991 Gulf War, when the United States worked
   hard to secure approval from the United Nations (UN), set a precedent
   for legitimate military intervention that other states, especially other
   liberal democracies, subsequently felt compelled to follow. France,
   however, continued to intervene unilaterally in its traditional African
   sphere of influence for several years, without seeking approval from the
   UN or regional bodies. Even after France drew widespread opprobrium for
   its support of a murderous regime in Rwanda, French leaders deployed
   thousands of combat troops unilaterally on various missions. This
   article relies on original interviews with French policymakers as well
   as on primary documents to make the case that the 2002-04 Cote d'Ivoire
   intervention finally steered French Africa policy towards greater
   multilateralism. It drove home the danger that unilateral interventions
   could fuel anti-French sentiment among African audiences, undermining
   France's regional influence. Ultimately, therefore, concerns about
   African acceptance more than broader international pressure led France
   to fully embrace new norms of legitimate intervention.},

Abstract = {Critics of deliberative democracy have worried that deliberation may
   mirror (or even exacerbate) inequalities in participation across
   categories such as gender, race, and age. Accordingly, we investigate
   the potential for technology and design to ameliorate these concerns,
   looking at the extent to which online deliberative sessions facilitate
   inclusive participation. In a large study of online deliberation (over
   1600 participants nested in hundreds of online sessions), we examine
   differences in the amount and nature of participation across demographic
   categories, as well as the effect of forum characteristics on such
   differences. Though our results are mixed, we read them with cautious
   optimism: the online format is not immune to inequalities in
   participation and satisfaction, but we do not observe differences across
   some demographics, and most observed differences are substantively
   minor. Moreover, features of online deliberation environments show
   promise for addressing some of the problems plaguing in-person designs.},

Abstract = {This article examines the sociopolitical factors that influenced the
   framing of counterterrorism measures (CTMs) in Nigeria. It argues that
   the government strategically excluded civil society organizations CSOs
   from participating in the process of formulating CTMs. Thus, this
   situation renders CSOs without agency in the making of CTMs and their
   legal capacity to advocate for the marginalized and vulnerable groups in
   the context of counterterrorism in Nigeria. Additionally, the employed
   strategic exclusion of CSOs aided in the construction of a service
   delivery role that restrained political advocacy. Furthermore, the study
   argues that, despite the government counterterrorism approach, CSOs did
   not seek public support on the need to contest CTMs in Nigeria and have
   complied with these laws and policies. The empirical analysis is based
   on mixed-method research of CSOs and government agents. This research
   seeks to contribute to the debate regarding the effects of CTMs on CSOs
   by tracing the establishment of service delivery roles for CSOs to these
   organisations strategic exclusion in the formulation of CTMs.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},

Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {85-112},

Abstract = {According to most of the literature available so far, international and
   European cross-border banks and investments firms are considered the
   primary beneficiaries of the CMU and related revitalization of
   securitization. Nevertheless, an in-depth analysis of the transnational
   financial industry lobbying and influence, in the light of the final
   agreement on the securitization reform package, is still missing. This
   paper intends to fill this gap in the story by assessing if, and to what
   extent, the alleged industry beneficiaries played an active role in
   shaping the regulatory agenda within the CMU project and its related
   outcomes. An in-depth analysis of corporate lobbying in the
   securitization reform is thus provided, by looking at the interactions
   between structural and political contextual factors in shaping
   private/public coalitions along the different stages of the EU
   policy-making process. As it is argued here, the policy entrepreneurship
   of the European securitization industry has been the key factor to
   explain the emergence of the EU regulatory approach and its legislative
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article, based on archival documents, reveals resettlement
   processes in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1932-34, which
   were conditioned by the repressive policy of the Soviet power. The
   process of resettlement into those regions of the Soviet Ukraine where
   the population died from hunger most, and which was approved by the
   authorities, is described in detail.
   It is noted that about 90,000 people moved from the northern oblasts of
   the Ukrainian SSR to the southern part of the republic. About 127,000
   people arrived in Soviet Ukraine from the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist
   Republic (BSSR) and the western oblasts of the Russian Soviet Federative
   Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The material conditions of their residence
   and the reasons for the return of settlers to their previous places of
   inhabitance are described.
   I conclude that the resettlement policy of the authorities during
   1932-34 changed the social and national composition of the eastern and
   southern oblasts of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Supreme audit institutions (SAIs) are fundamental institutions in
   liberal democracies as they enable control of the exercise of state
   power. In order to maintain this function, SAIs must enjoy a high level
   of independence. Moreover, SAIs are increasingly expected to be also
   relevant for government and the execution of its policies by way of
   performance auditing. This article examines how and why the performance
   auditing of the Danish SAI pursues independence and relevance. It is
   argued that, in general, the simultaneous pursuit of independence and
   relevance is highly challenging and amounts to a zero-sum or, at the
   very best, a very modest plus-sum game. More specifically, while the
   Danish SAI actively pursues both objectives, it has persistently
   prioritized independence over relevance. This priority seems to be the
   most effective strategy for the Danish SAI to maintain its legitimacy in
   a situation where the parliament is characterized by minority
   governments.},

Abstract = {How do countries settle disputes in the shadow of the law? Even in the
   presence of legalized dispute settlement, countries still rely on
   diplomatic channels to resolve conflicts. But it can be difficult to
   assess diplomacy's impact on dispute resolution because those channels
   tend to be opaque. We present both an original theory of the impact of
   diplomacy on dispute resolution and a novel measure of diplomacy. If
   countries with close or, conversely, distant relationships use legal
   channels for dispute resolution, diplomacy will have little impact on
   dispute settlement; resorting to legal recourse among friends or
   adversaries likely means that the dispute is intractable. However,
   diplomacy can increase the chances of settlement between countries with
   moderate levels of affinity. We test this argument using a
   protocol-based proxy for diplomatic interactions-gifts given at the
   occasion of meetings between diplomatic counterparts-that would
   otherwise be difficult to observe. Using the case of the United States
   and its disputes in the World Trade Organization, we find support for
   our argument. This suggests that even when countries resort to legalized
   methods of dispute settlement, bilateral dealmaking still plays an
   important role.},

Abstract = {The wars in Syria and Iraq attracted about 45,000 individuals from
   outside the arenas. Most joined the Islamic State, but interestingly,
   other prominent armed groups showed less interest in foreign volunteers.
   This paper introduces the Demand for Foreign Volunteers Theory (DFVT) to
   explain the diverging choices Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and the
   People's Protection Units made. The theory links four variables that
   shape groups' positions: political considerations, operational needs,
   organizational capacity and ideational fit. Both operational and
   political considerations emphasize the motivation for using foreign
   volunteers, though the two are not equally important; when they
   conflict, political considerations take priority. Organizational
   capacity, on the other hand, determines a group's ability to translate
   need into action, serving as a necessary-but insufficient-condition for
   foreign mobilization. Finally, ideational factors, specifically a
   group's identity and ideology, determine the pool of potential recruits.
   The case studies show that political considerations made all three
   actors cautious about recruiting foreign fighters, though these
   considerations differed between groups. Ultimately, despite the
   availability of sufficient organizational capacity, all groups found it
   risky and even undesirable.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how precision has become a ubiquitous prefix in
   medicine, agriculture and education. The accompanying imagination in
   each of these domains is that ``data{''} will enable greater predictive
   accuracy through new sensors and interfaces. In this paper, we aim to
   provide insights regarding the ways in which precision assemblages
   function to augment and extend existing knowledge and data
   infrastructures, while also being underpinned by the anticipatory
   promise of the ubiquity of digital and sensing technologies. We argue
   that precision is marked by new data production and aggregation
   frameworks to measure and intervene. At the same time, precision draws
   on - and augments - established clinical, agricultural and educational
   subjectivities in ways that depict new logics of patient, student and
   environmental care. As we outline below, the threshold of the shift to
   precision is articulated and institutionalized at different points in
   each field we analyse in the subsequent sections of this paper - namely
   medicine, agriculture and education. This suggests that precision should
   be understood as an unevenly realized moment in policy development,
   rather than as simply produced through processes of technological
   change.},

Abstract = {Free movement is intended to bring Europeans together. This article
   suggests it may have the opposite effect: it may drive them apart. The
   mechanism involved is sorting. This happens when people are free to
   choose where to live, and choose a community which matches their
   preferences. This match can come about in different ways, but the result
   of them all is that people of particular preferences are clustered
   together, leading to society being structured as a series of adjacent
   mono-cultures. It is not a large step to suggest that this arrangement
   is likely to cause alienation between the communities. The fact of
   sorting means that they have less in common than they did before. For
   Europe, if sorting happens, this would imply that polarization between
   states would increase and the governability of the EU would be
   threatened. Free movement may be less a mechanism of integration than
   one of disintegration.},

Abstract = {That hydrocarbon abundance may lead to more violence is an established
   truism in the literature on the resource curse. Looking at the Middle
   East, however, the literature relates bellicose state behaviour entirely
   to oil-producing revolutionary republics. Instead, dynastic monarchies
   are claimed to be the more peacefully behaving actors. Current
   developments turn this conclusion upside down, however. Since 2015 at
   the latest, the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, the leading monarchy in
   the Middle East, has transformed from multi-dependence to
   petro-aggression. By discussing this striking transformation, the paper
   puts forward a framework looking at the interaction of three crucial
   dimensions: first, the decreasing power projection towards the Middle
   East by the United States, the decade-long hegemon, due to gradual
   changes in world energy markets and war fatigue at home; second, the
   lasting fiscal potency of the Saudi regime; and, third, the
   personalization of the Saudi monarchy under King Salman as a
   historically contingent result of transferring power to the generation
   of Ibn Saud's grandsons.},

Abstract = {As Russia-West relations hit a post-Cold War low and a sterner Western
   approach toward China has become more manifest, great power rivalry
   appears to have returned. It is often assumed that these developments
   will have important consequences for the durability of the so-called
   `liberal international order'. This paper seeks to clarify precisely
   what the liberal international order is and how it relates to English
   School understandings of international society and international order.
   First will come an analysis of these concepts as they are currently
   understood in recent literature, with the aim of providing a more
   wide-reaching framework for understanding hegemony and liberal order in
   today's world. Then, the paper will turn to Russian and Chinese
   perspectives on the liberal order and the extent to which Moscow and
   Beijing are challenging it. Finally, it will discuss the implications
   that all of this holds for the conceptual relationship between
   international society and international order.},

Abstract = {Evidence on the consequences of war for community cohesion is mixed,
   pointing to both positive and negative effects of conflict. This study
   examines symmetry of force between warring actors as an explanation of
   heterogeneous conflict effects. Using survey data from 224 Colombian
   villages, I compare cohesion in communities exposed to asymmetric and
   symmetric conflicts, a guerrilla war between rebels and the state and a
   more conventional war between rebels and paramilitary groups,
   respectively. I find that symmetric war increases participation in
   community organizations, while asymmetric war decreases trust. Evidence
   suggests three mechanisms that explain these findings. Symmetric war
   increases cohesion (i) by spurring individuals to band together to cope
   with significant disruption of services and (ii) by strengthening group
   identities that map onto fairly clear wartime cleavages. Asymmetric war
   reduces cohesion (iii) by instilling fear and suspicion linked to
   wartime experiences of civilian collaboration and denunciations.},

Abstract = {Hope is an essential component in the pursuit of political change. In
   order to hope, citizens need to wish for the change and have some
   expectations that it could materialize. This article explores how the
   two components of hope (i.e., wishes and expectations) are constructed
   in the seemingly hopeless case of a protracted and violent conflict.
   Utilizing a large-scale survey administered in Israel, the West Bank,
   and the Gaza Strip, we show that citizens' appraisals of their
   adversary's wishes and expectations for peace affect their own wishes
   and expectations, which, in turn, influences their willingness to
   support peacebuilding efforts. Regrettably, citizens' tendency to
   underestimate their rival's wish for peace lessens their own hopes,
   which further abates the support for peacebuilding. The study is the
   first to illustrate a mechanism by which hope for peace is constructed
   and the pathways by which hope facilitates resolution. Theoretical and
   applied implications are discussed.},

   small politicians in Andhra Pradesh},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {82-99},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Based on an ethnographic case study of the 2014 electoral process in a
   small town of the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, this article
   explores the tensions between the self-making of political
   entrepreneurs, the loyalties to political leaders and the everyday
   making of electoral manipulation. By looking at the Dalit henchmen of
   bosses-political candidates, it argues that electoral democracy is
   considered by henchmen as an issue of life and death: by performing
   electoral manipulation, they have the opportunity to appear as men of
   resources, capable of extraordinary actions, and to transform their
   precarious social and political positions.},

Title = {Work-family reconciliation policies and women's and mothers' labor
   market outcomes in rich democracies},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-161},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prominent research has claimed that work-family reconciliation policies
   trigger `tradeoffs' and `paradoxes' in terms of gender equality with
   adverse labor market consequences for women. These claims have greatly
   influenced debates regarding social policy, work, family and gender
   inequality. Motivated by limitations of prior research, we analyze the
   relationship between the two most prominent work-family reconciliation
   policies (paid parental leave and public childcare coverage) and seven
   labor market outcomes (employment, full-time employment, earnings,
   full-time earnings, being a manager, being a lucrative manager and
   occupation percent female). We estimate multilevel models of individuals
   nested in a cross-section of 21 rich democracies near 2005, and two-way
   fixed effects models of individuals nested in a panel of 12 rich
   democracies over time. The vast majority of coefficients for work-family
   policies fail to reject the null hypothesis of no effects. The pattern
   of insignificance occurs regardless of which set of models or
   coefficients one compares. Moreover, there is as much evidence that
   significantly contradicts the `tradeoff hypothesis' as is consistent
   with the hypothesis. Altogether, the analyses undermine claims that
   work-family reconciliation policies trigger trade-offs and paradoxes in
   terms of gender equality with adverse labor market consequences for
   women.},

Abstract = {The rise of the regulatory state has led to the global diffusion of
   independent regulatory agencies (IRAs). IRAs are the result of the
   tension between the functional demands of regulatory capitalism and the
   need of politicians to control policies. Their life cycles have not been
   linear. Their legal statuses have changed over time, affecting their
   degrees of independence. This article revisits Gilardi's formal
   independence index, makes an in-depth diachronic and cross-sectorial
   analysis of 11 regulatory bodies in Portugal, and searches for
   explanations for the observed variations. It concludes that the formal
   independence of IRAs tends to increase due to external pressure and the
   need of governments to project credible commitment, but principals only
   grant as much independence as they see fit to satisfy those (external)
   demands (for change).},

Abstract = {How do local power-sharing arrangements affect levels of ethnopolitical
   hostility? The introduction of decentralisation in contexts previously
   marked by communal conflict underscores the need to assess local
   power-sharing mechanisms. However, existing literature on power-sharing
   has mainly examined national-level arrangements. In this article we
   contribute to the literature on decentralisation and ethnopolitical
   conflict by analysing two conflict-affected cases in Kenya. We find that
   local power sharing in Nakuru made intercommunal relations less hostile
   than in Uasin Gishu, where no such arrangement was present. The
   introduction and effects of local power sharing, however, is highly
   conditioned by national politics.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is, in part, an information handling system
   that can remove humans from the information handling process. The
   particular problem explored is how we are to understand privacy when
   considering informational systems that handle personal information in
   ways that impact people's lives when there is no human operator in
   direct contact with that personal information. I argue that these new
   technologies need to take concepts like privacy into account, but also,
   that we ought also to take these technologies into account to reconsider
   and perhaps reconceptualise privacy. This paper argues that while an
   inhuman system like the IoT does not necessarily violate the
   interpersonal privacy of people, if the IoT is used as part of a state
   surveillance program, a political notion of privacy may be violated.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade a number of changes can be observed within the
   development policy system. This paper presents and discusses these
   changes along three dimensions: narratives, strategies and operational
   approaches. Changes are manifold, ranging from the application of new
   narratives, such as the migration narrative, to alternations in
   strategic objectives (e.g. developing countries' graduation issues), new
   instruments (in the form of development finance at the interface with
   the private sector), and the application of new concepts for project
   implementation (e.g. through frontier technologies). We discuss the
   implications and effects of these changes for the current and potential
   future role of the development policy system, as well as preliminary
   ideas for a concept of global co-operation for sustainable development
   (GCSD), spanning beyond the development policy system.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines German-Jewish anarchist Gustav Landauer's social
   critiques and his anarchism, which grew in part from artist associations
   such as the Poet's Circle of Berlin-Friedrichshagen and the Neue
   Gemeinschaft (New Community). They experienced a heyday during the last
   few decades of the nineteenth century just like many other artistic and
   social reform movements across Europe. The New Community in particular
   combined elements of the life reform and garden city movements, along
   with Nietzschean philosophy and its own independent strand of socialism.
   In the few years of its existence, it became a meeting place for poets,
   vanguard artist-anarchists, and bohemians. Landauer adopted the
   community's mix of nostalgia and eager anticipation of the future, which
   shaped its philosophy, festival culture, and everyday life. He expanded
   upon this twofold longing in his future political works, many of them
   also influenced by Fritz Mauthner's philosophy of language. Landauer's
   notion of revolution, his theories on libertarian socialism, and his
   Sozialistischer Bund (Socialist League, founded in 1908) grasped the
   present as merely transitional: to him, it meant a time of new
   beginning, yet this beginning originated in the past and was directed
   towards the future. Hence the vanguard somewhat paradoxically stretched
   out in two contradictory temporal directions. The chapter attempts to
   understand this specific concept of time in Landauer's writings, which
   included his thoughts on anarchism, Jewish revival, messianism, and the
   artistic avant-gardes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines both the process of, and the constitutional and
   legal dilemmas in, forming the Association of Serb Majority
   Municipalities in Kosovo. The association, which aims to be established
   and has emerged as a demand of Kosovo Serbs, has caused a lot of trouble
   to the government in establishing it. This paper presents these
   difficulties and how they commenced. It is shown at the outset that in
   2013, Kosovo assumed an international and constitutional obligation to
   establish this Association. A long time has passed since that year and
   the association is not established even to this day. The paper shows
   that this passivity was further cemented by a decision of the
   Constitutional Court which, instead of explaining the way in which it
   was formed and competencies used a strange and dubious language. In this
   paper, however, it is clearly shown that the formation of the
   Association is an international obligation that Kosovo must fulfill. It
   is further noted that there is a risk that its formation will take place
   in a format other than the one envisaged in 2015 as a result of the
   delay on the side of the Kosovo party. The paper also seeks to point out
   a deficiency of this entity, which has to do with the fact that the
   drafting of legal texts on its establishment did not involve local Serbs
   at all, to whom the Association is supposedly dedicated.},
