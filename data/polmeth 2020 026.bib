Abstract = {In recent years, design approaches to policymaking have gained
   popularity among policymakers. However, a critical reflection on their
   added value and on how contemporary `design-thinking' approaches relates
   to the classical idea of public administration as a design science, is
   still lacking. This introductory paper reflects upon the use of design
   approaches in public administration. We delve into the more traditional
   ideas of design as launched by Simon and policy design, but also into
   the present-day design wave, stemming from traditional design sciences.
   Based upon this we distinguish between three ideal-type approaches of
   design currently characterising the discipline: design as optimisation,
   design as exploration and design as co-creation. More rigorous empirical
   analyses of applications of these approaches is necessary to further
   develop public administration as a design science. We reflect upon the
   question of how a more designerly way of thinking can help to improve
   public administration and public policy.},

Abstract = {The conflict between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic Community has taken
   the form of a systemic crisis, in which we face the risk of running from
   incident to incident. It is argued that the European post-Cold War order
   has undergone a norm-transforming, rather than norm-governed change. The
   normative framework and shared purpose on which it rests and which are
   essential to stabilise and perpetuate an international order have been
   eroded. The crisis is assessed on the basis of both the acts of
   violation and retreat by key ordering agents and their intersubjective
   assessment of the order. It is argued that normative pillars have
   gradually dissolved in four key areas: the principles of the Paris
   Charter on the indivisibility of security, the arms control regime,
   collective security and the European border regime. Tackling these
   issues is particularly complicated, because some, such as arms control,
   require today a global approach, involving China.},

Abstract = {This research note looks at the radical influencers of Bosnian foreign
   fighters. This group is important, as the Balkan region has been seen as
   a spot of jihadist activism and recruitment for the IS and Al-Nusra
   Front. Previous research on foreign fighters emphasized that a small
   number of individuals (religious leaders, former combatants, and others)
   at the local level play a significant role in this recruitment. The
   influence of such figures results in hotspots of radical activism, which
   are called ``power centers{''} here. This research note argues that such
   dynamics are likely to be even more evident in postwar societies due to
   state weaknesses, which create more power for social actors and inhibit
   counterterrorism. The paper also analyses the role of leader-led radical
   ``institutions{''} that have appeared after the Bosnian War. By doing
   so, it stresses the significance of local radical influencers in the
   recruitment of Bosnian foreign fighters. The research note shows that
   radical influencers in postwar radical milieus manage to
   ``institutionalize{''} their authority by filling the void left by
   domestic war(s) with life guidance and religious values. The paper
   provides insights into the social relations, authority and
   decision-making connected with foreign fighter departures to Syria and
   Iraq (2012-2016).},

Abstract = {The article examines the four electoral contests (municipal, regional,
   European, and parliamentary) that took place in Greece in 2019 through
   the prism of the growing polarisation that has dominated Greek political
   life since the early 2010s. It is argued that with these elections, the
   decade-long political cycle that began with the economic crisis came to
   its conclusion. The new party system resembles the pre-crisis one,
   featuring a return of two-partyism, single-party governments, and
   competition along the left-right dimension. However, the legacy of the
   crisis period remains present, as the `new' two-party system continues
   to be characterised by high degrees of affective polarisation and
   negative partisanship.},

Abstract = {A large body of research now indicates that climate likely matters for
   conflict. This climate-conflict scholarship, however, has involved
   divergent findings, sometimes strident disagreement, and resulting
   limits to the usability of the scholarship for policymakers and
   practitioners. This viewpoint essay draws from recent expert assessments
   of climate-conflict linkages to position the research field among
   climate change research and assessment more broadly. We explore
   potential insights from the climate realm. As is often the case for
   climate change research, science-society dynamics are inherent in
   scholarship on climate and conflict. They contribute to contestation
   about the state of knowledge, the best ways to characterize it, and its
   implications for societal choices and investments. Our critique is
   grounded in the literature evaluating policy-relevant climate change
   assessment across diverse disciplines, from sea-level-rise adaptation
   science to energy-system modeling. Through comparisons with such fields,
   this perspective article considers several implications for
   climate-conflict knowledge production. We examine, in particular, the
   necessity of integrating diverse lines of evidence to understand the
   risks of responding to societally relevant uncertainties and priorities,
   and of encouraging interactions among researchers, practitioners, and
   policymakers. The experiences of other climate change disciplines can
   provide inspiration for potential directions for climate, conflict, and
   security scholarship. They include risk framings in integrating
   underlying evidence, through to options for supporting the interactions
   among researchers and societies.},

Abstract = {At some point in your life, you will need to allocate resources among
   individuals, but how should you do so? One prominent suggestion is the
   envy test: the envy test is satisfied when and only when no one prefers
   someone else's bundle. In Part I, I explain and then reject Tom Parr's
   recent attempt to justify the envy test. Yet, like Parr, I believe the
   envy test captures something important. Thus, in Part II, I distinguish
   two approaches to resource allocation. Parr's defense of the envy test
   assumes what I will call an individualist approach: what matters are
   each individual's preferences. In lieu of the individualist approach, I
   endorse the solidarity approach: what matters are everyone's
   preferences. After explaining the distinction, I show that the envy
   test-or at least something like it-can be defended using the solidarity
   approach even if it cannot be defended using the individualist approach.},

Title = {Talks before the talks: Effects of pre-negotiation on reaching peace
   agreements in intrastate armed conflicts, 2005-15},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pre-negotiation is widely accepted as a means to convince intrastate
   conflict parties to negotiate formally; however, research has not yet
   established a causal link between early efforts to bring warring parties
   together and the outcome of any negotiated settlement. This gap begs the
   question: To what extent do activities during the pre-negotiation phase
   contribute to the signing of a peace agreement? Theory on interstate
   conflict suggests that pre-negotiation reduces risk, thereby convincing
   conflict parties that they have more to gain from negotiating than from
   fighting. However, in conflicts between governments and non-state armed
   actors, this article argues that reciprocity paves the way for reaching
   peace agreements. This article introduces a new dataset on
   pre-negotiation including nearly all intrastate armed conflicts between
   2005 and 2015. Confirming previous findings, mediation is significantly
   and positively correlated with reaching a type of peace agreement;
   conflicts over government are more likely to end in a negotiated
   agreement than conflicts over territory or both government and
   territory. In contrast to existing qualitative research, this study
   finds little evidence that pre-negotiation increases the likelihood that
   conflict dyads sign peace agreements. Future quantitative research on
   this topic requires more nuanced measures of the conditions under which
   conflict parties shift from unilateral to joint decisionmaking.},

Abstract = {Our experience with COVID-19 has yet to show that either democracies or
   autocracies are unambiguously better at dealing with this threat. What
   the pandemic has instead demonstrated is that these two forms of
   government each have specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to
   dealing with external emergencies. In autocracies centralization of
   power allows for decisive action, but their ability to maintain secrecy
   means that they can also suppress information and ignore a problem. In a
   democracy greater transparency makes it hard to cover up a threat, but
   the decentralization of power that is inherent to a democracy can lead
   to a slow and potentially ineffective response. Using both current and
   historical comparisons between China and western countries, I show that
   these different patterns have deep roots, dating back a thousand years
   or more. I then consider three alternative proposals for democracies to
   be able to act more decisively: allowing for rule by decree, devolving
   responsibility to localities, and investing in preventative state
   capacity. History shows that the latter of these three is the safest and
   most effective strategy, but for it to work voters must reward
   politicians for investing in prevention. Unfortunately, this reward
   cannot be assumed.},

Title = {Can policy-packaging increase public support for costly policies?
   Insights from a choice experiment on policies against vehicle emissions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Public support is usually a precondition for the adoption and successful
   implementation of costly policies. We argue that such support is easier
   to achieve with policy-packages that incorporate primary and ancillary
   measures. We specifically distinguish command-and-control and
   market-based measures as primary measures and argue that the former will
   usually garner more public support than the latter given the
   low-visibility tendency of costs associated with command-and-control
   measures. Nevertheless, if included in a policy-package, ancillary
   measures are likely to increase public support by reducing negative
   effects of primary measures. Based on a choice experiment with a
   representative sample of 2,034 Swiss citizens, we assessed these
   arguments with respect to political efforts to reduce vehicle emissions.
   The empirical analysis supported the argument that policy-packaging
   affects public support positively, particularly generating more support
   when ancillary measures are added. Lastly, we ultimately observe that
   command-and-control measures obtain more public support than
   market-based instruments.},

Abstract = {The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the accountability
   capacity of the two main EU watchdog institutions. The overarching
   research question is: how powerful are these watchdog institutions in
   holding the EU executive to account? The paper presents an expanded
   analysis of the formal and organisational accountability powers of these
   EU watchdogs and how these are exercised, based on an in-depth case
   study. We apply an assessment framework of accountability powers
   developed previously. Both watchdogs have comparable formal powers when
   it comes to accountability. Despite these similarities, the EO and the
   ECA differ in their organisational power and in the exercise of their
   powers. In the organizational dimension, there are differences regarding
   leadership. In the exercise of power dimension, the EO has increasingly
   developed standards for good practice with an emphasis on transparency
   and principles of good administrative behavior, while also using its
   networks to further improve complaint handling.},

Abstract = {Academic and policy interest in civil society participation in the
   European Union's trade policy has been growing since the late 1990s. We
   analyse civil society's engagement with the Domestic Advisory Groups
   (DAGs)-consultation mechanisms established by the European Commission at
   the implementation stage of its free trade agreements. While the
   Commission's formal rationale for the DAGs is partnership with civil
   society, in fact this relationship involves a marked power and
   resistance dynamic. We focus on civil society's agency and resistance,
   develop a conceptual framework laying out different possible types of
   resistance, and empirically demonstrate the wealth of both overt and
   subtle resistance practices employed by DAG members. Most of this
   resistance is (moderately) comprehensive and directed against the DAGs'
   rationalities and technologies. While showing that DAGs are deeply
   contested, our study also provides a nuanced analysis of resistance with
   particular attention for divisions between business and non-business
   members.},

Abstract = {This briefing engages the militarised conservation literature. Three
   factors key to understanding present militarised conservation in Uganda
   are discussed: colonial legacies, the country's post-colonial history of
   war and conflict, and the current militarisation under the Museveni
   government as exemplified in the military collaboration between the
   Uganda Wildlife Authority and the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces. It
   argues that the debate about militarised conservation in today's Uganda
   has to be situated within the widening mandate of the military
   institution under the Museveni government, which came to power through
   the military path and then gradually militarised significant sections of
   society more broadly.},

Abstract = {The study addresses the question of whether there is a global pattern of
   terror organization (TO) lifespan. Based on two datasets which include
   hundreds of organizations, we show that there is a global statistical
   law of TO lifespan distribution. This distribution describes populations
   of TOs in different contexts of periods, geographical locations,
   ideologies, etc. The data as a whole, as well as its subpopulations,
   seem to emerge from an exponential distribution, which is formulated as
   a mathematical model. This model enables the prediction of TOs' global
   population decay rate. The findings were obtained by introducing a novel
   procedure, which formulates and validates this mathematical law for
   discrete empirical data. We suggest that human behavior generating
   informational cascades and a positive feedback loop, which influence the
   number of core members in a TO, may be the source of this global
   pattern.},

Abstract = {How long does it typically take a returned foreign fighter to launch a
   domestic terror attack? The issue of returnees, and appropriate national
   and international responses to potential threats, has become a
   preeminent security concern of the 2010s, impacting policies on
   everything from refugees to whether to permit ISIS fighters to leave the
   theater of conflict alive. This article attempts to illuminate these
   contentious debates through a new data set of Lags in Attack Times of
   Extremist Returnees (LATER) that examines 230 jihadi returnees to
   Western countries. The data indicate that the majority of attempted
   attacks occur within one year, with a median lag time of just four
   months. Prison appears to play no role in lag times. Our findings
   indicate that security and reintegration efforts should be targeted
   within the critical six months after return, which diminishes the risk
   of attack considerably.},

Abstract = {This study examined the application of Benford's Law to analyse the 2015
   and 2019 presidential election data in Nigeria. Data obtained from the
   electoral body were analysed using frequency distribution and Spearman
   Rank Correlation tests at 0.05 level of significance. Findings revealed
   that the second digits distributions of the vote counts for the two
   major political parties, registered voters and total vote counts in both
   elections do not conform to the distributional pattern predicted by
   Benford's Law. The study recommends that stakeholders should aim for an
   electoral reform that allows the use of forensic analysis of electoral
   data in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Whilst the international politics of climate change-related loss and
   damage has received growing scholarly attention, there has been less
   focus on national level policy responses. This is puzzling because
   climate change impacts are inherently local and political. What
   knowledge and ideas do policy actors at the national level use to
   conceptualise the problem of climate change loss and damage? What are
   the injustices that result from the multi-scalar construction of
   governance problems? Drawing on insights from Science and Technology
   Studies about the politics of knowledge production, we analyse how
   governance problems are constructed and explore resultant injustices. To
   do so, we focus on the paradigmatic case study of Antigua and Barbuda,
   illustrating the complex interactions between knowledge and politics in
   governing loss and damage. We conclude by calling for greater scholarly
   attention to the production of epistemological injustices, as specific
   forms of knowledge are translated across scales of action.},

Abstract = {We call for strengthening the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) to
   manage the economic effects of COVID-19, in particular the massive
   capital outflows from emerging market and developing economies EMDEs and
   the global shortage of dollar liquidity. Both the United Nations (UN)
   and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that EMDEs need an
   immediate \$2.5 trillion, yet the financing available to them is just
   \$700 to \$971 billion. To meet these immediate needs we propose to: (1)
   broaden the coverage of the Federal Reserve currency swaps; (2) issue at
   least \$500 billion of special drawing rights through the IMF; (3)
   improve the IMF's precautionary and emergency facilities; (4) establish
   a multilateral swap facility at the IMF; (5) increase the resources and
   geographic coverage of regional financial arrangements; (6) coordinate
   capital flow management measures; (7) initiate debt restructuring and
   relief initiatives; and (8) request that credit-rating agencies stop
   making downgrades during the emergency. It argues that leaders should
   swiftly move to address these structural gaps in the GFSN: (1) agree on
   a quota reform at the IMF; (2) create an appropriate sovereign debt
   restructuring regime; (3) expand surveillance activity; and (4) adopt
   IMF governance reform and strengthen its relations with all agents of
   the GFSN. All of these reforms must be calibrated toward a just
   transition to a more stable, inclusive, and sustainable global economy.},

Abstract = {A central aim of terrorism is to drive people apart and destroy social
   trust. Still, there is little empirical research which has
   systematically investigated the relationship between terrorist attacks,
   fear of terrorism, and social trust. In addition, the impact of
   terrorism is usually assumed to be uniform across different individuals
   and societies. In order to investigate the impact of terrorism as well
   as the fear of future terrorism on trust levels of different types of
   individuals and societies, we combine individual-level survey data of
   the most recent World Values Survey (WVS, Round 6, 2010-2014) with
   several indicators at the country-level. Our findings show that social
   trust is principally damaged by the fear of future terrorist attacks,
   more so than by past terrorist attacks. Moreover, this deleterious
   impact of the fear of terrorism on social trust is most prevalent in
   more democratic countries and among individuals who are more frequently
   exposed to television news. Hence, with relatively limited capabilities
   and resources, terrorists may therefore evoke disproportionate fear
   effects within democratic societies which are, at least partially,
   fueled by media exposure.},

   enhanced individual performance, employee retention, and enhanced
   organizational commitment and citizenship behavior. However, a closer
   inspection of the literature reveals mixed empirical evidence for each
   impact of PSM. The present study carries out a meta-analysis of five key
   impacts of PSM to explain the divergence of results in the existing
   literature. We find evidence of the existence of a true effect for PSM
   over all the dependent variables, except for turnover intentions. In
   addition, we find a possible explanation for the mixed empirical
   evidence found in previous studies. We demonstrate that individual and
   organizational benefits of PSM are not accrued equally in all public
   sector workplaces and that the contextual variables legal origin and
   endemic countrywide corruption influence the extent to which PSM can
   produce positive outcomes in the workplace.},

Abstract = {How do citizens in authoritarian states feel about their leaders? While
   some dictators rule through terror, others seem genuinely popular. Using
   the Gallup World Poll's panel of more than one hundred-forty countries
   in 2006-2016, the authors show that the drivers of political approval
   differ across regime types. Although brutal repression in overt
   dictatorships could cause respondents to falsify their preferences, in
   milder informational autocracies, greater repression actually predicts
   lower approval. In autocracies as in democracies, economic performance
   matters and citizens' economic perceptions, while not perfectly
   accurate, track objective indicators. Dictators also benefit from
   greater perceived public safety, but the authors find no such effect in
   democracies. Covert censorship of the media and the Internet is
   associated with higher approval in autocracies-in particular, in
   informational ones-but ratings fall when citizens recognize censorship.
   In informational autocracies, executive elections trigger a ratings
   surge if there is leader turnover, but, unlike in democracies, reelected
   autocrats enjoy little honeymoon.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether minority representation in democratic
   institutions impacts frontline public service outcomes, investigating
   specifically the association between the shares of ethnic minorities on
   California city councils and the measured level of racial disparities
   practised by the police in the corresponding jurisdictional areas. The
   findings suggest that an increase in ethnic minority council members is
   associated with a respective decrease in racial disparities against
   ethnic minority groups only if ethnic minority groups are well
   represented in police forces. This study is among the first to
   empirically examine the link between political representation and
   bureaucratic behaviours at the street level. The findings have
   implications for understanding how political representation can
   contribute to the democratic accountability of street-level bureaucracy
   and how political and bureaucratic representations can complement each
   other.},

Title = {Power politics: Armed non-state actors and the capture of public
   electricity in post-invasion Baghdad},

Abstract = {Scholars observe that armed non-state actors (NSAs) often provide social
   services to reinforce their popular support and legitimacy as guarantors
   of local order. On the other hand, NSAs usually face funding constraints
   that make the independent provision of distributive goods difficult.
   This article argues that armed NSAs employ an alternative, more
   cost-effective tactic to deliver services. It argues that militant
   groups can leverage their armed capacity to capture control of and
   monopolize access to state-sponsored services. As an example, it
   documents the capture of public electricity infrastructure that took
   place in post-invasion Baghdad under the Sadrist Movement, an armed
   group formed shortly after the ouster of the Ba'athist state. Using
   local-level information about the location of Sadrist offices and remote
   sensing data, it estimates that Sadrist-affiliated neighborhoods in
   Baghdad saw an average increase in access to electricity between 2003
   and 2006 that was significantly greater than in other areas of the city.
   The article concludes by addressing threats to inference, showing that
   these differences are not alternatively explained by demographic
   differences or changes therein due to ongoing conflict. It also
   discusses how this NSA strategy might contribute to an equilibrium of
   low state legitimacy and weak capacity in fragile contexts like that of
   post-2003 Iraq.},

Abstract = {Does firm lobbying in the EU increase firm profitability? While there is
   a well-established literature on this issue in the US context, existing
   EU studies have overlooked this question. Ours is the first study to
   examine links between firm lobbying and firm profitability. To this end,
   we tailor theoretical insights from the US context to the EU. While
   money plays a fundamentally different role in EU lobbying compared to
   the US, the lobbying context and legislative processes of the EU are
   conducive to firm lobbying efforts translating into firm profits. Our
   two-stage OLS regression results, using a novel dataset for 728 firms
   over a four-year period, support this argument. Specifically, we find
   that the more money firms channel into their lobbying activities, the
   more tangible returns on this investment they can expect.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, many developing countries have enacted policies of
   decentralization to create localized, representative forms of
   government. A highly under-studied body of local governance are village
   development committees (VDCs). Utilizing a mixed-method approach in
   three districts of Southern Malawi, we combine surveys, focus groups,
   and interviews to examine the role of VDCs in local politics. Selected
   by their peers, VDC members navigate a complicated landscape including:
   local and central politicians, government bureaucrats, NGOs and special
   interest groups, and traditional authorities. We find that citizens are
   accurately able to evaluate the development work that VDCs are doing and
   consistently rate their trust in these institutions higher than their
   trust in elected authorities. Still, challenges persist: members receive
   no standardized training and there are consistent gender gaps in the
   experiences of men and women members of the VDCs.},

Abstract = {Studies of political parties have evidenced a clear impetus for
   organisational change and professionalisation when a party crosses the
   representation threshold, though the process by which this change occurs
   remains under-researched. We use a case study of the UK's three Green
   parties to provide a focused examination of the
   professionalisation-through-representation process. Our study finds
   clear evidence that all three parties have professionalised to an extent
   as a result of securing representation. By evaluating the empirical
   findings in relation to key debates within the party organisational
   change literature, we show that
   professionalisation-through-representation does not necessarily require
   deliberate decisions by actors across a party, it can be largely
   uni-directional (though in this case the Greens have maintained a
   relatively consistent presence in legislatures) and is shaped by
   institutional rules on the public provision of funding and staff as well
   as parties' own origins.},

Abstract = {Why are backlash politics so prevalent in the context of demographic
   change? And so that we may understand how to mitigate social conflict,
   what role do government and political actors play in their inflammation
   or reconciliation? Drawing from a larger study of six societies that
   have dealt with significant demographic change, I review the ways that
   government and political leaders' actions can produce three different
   social cleavages: (1) an overriding and enduring cleavage between ethnic
   constituencies in national politics, (2) an overriding cleavage that is
   suppressed by political actors, or (3) a new definition of social
   cleavages that re-constructs public understandings of the nation. I find
   that the drivers of these different trajectories relate to state actions
   in the construction of national identities, which either exclude certain
   subgroups or absorb them into a state of coexistence. I identify five
   ways governments channel backlash politics towards exclusion or
   coexistence, and provide examples from Hawai'i, a case where historical
   cleavages between natives and immigrants nearly disappeared. Ultimately,
   I find that these politics are subject to competing understandings of
   the nation - the pivotal sense of `we' - that can unite or divide a
   multiethnic society.},

Abstract = {Many communities across the US struggle to access clean and affordable
   water. We examine civil society responses relying on ``water as a human
   right{''} through case studies in California, Michigan, and the
   Appalachian Mountains. This trend presents a paradox, given that
   socio-economic rights are not perceived as relevant for domestic policy
   and are even met with hostility in the US. We analyze this tension
   through the lens of different conceptions of power:power within,power
   with, and power to that help us explain why advocates turn to this
   framing. We find that many activists perceive the human rights framework
   as an alternative to the government, which they distrust. Engaging with
   human rights conveys a sense of universality, connectedness, and
   validation. Building on this validated sense of self-worth and their
   collective strength, using the human rights framework can provide
   communities with thepowerto act and hold governments accountable.},

Abstract = {Voters constrain democratic leaders' foreign policy decisions. Yet,
   studies show that elite polarisation restricts the choices available to
   voters, limiting their ability to punish or reward incumbent
   governments. Building on a comparative elections and accountability
   perspective, we hypothesise that the governing context moderates the
   effectiveness of domestic punishment and reward. The rise of elite
   polarisation in many democracies undermines voters' ability to sanction
   leaders through elections. Linking data on international crises to
   domestic polarisation, we find that leaders are more likely to be
   involved in the initiation of inter-state disputes, resulting disputes
   will be more likely to result in prolonged conflict, and ultimately that
   foreign policy outcomes exhibit greater variance. Results from our
   analysis and extensive robustness checks demonstrate evidence that
   increased dispersion of preferences among key actors can lead to extreme
   and negative foreign policy outcomes as electoral mechanisms fail to
   reign in and hold governing parties to account.},

Abstract = {This article considers what treating individual international
   interveners engaged in peacebuilding work as referent objects can tell
   us about emplaced security. This is important because individual
   interveners are diverse, embodied agents who can impact the agency,
   peace and security of conflict-affected populations. It argues that
   applying an ontological security lens can provide a partial explanation
   for why interveners develop narratives and perform practices, including
   why they sometimes identify and behave in counterproductive, and even
   damaging, ways. The final section considers why an analytical focus on
   place is valuable, noting that place-based experiences and
   place-identities are formative of ontological security. It argues that
   treating interveners as a referent object provides opportunities to
   rethink the tendency to focus on home as the key site of emplacement in
   the ontological security literature. Building on this, it argues that
   examining the emplaced security of interveners invites us to examine the
   political nature and consequences of interveners' physical and
   ontological security-seeking narratives and practices, including their
   creation of the material and ideational structures of intervention
   spaces and places.},

Title = {Reassessing the Cold War and the Far-Right: Fascist Legacies and the
   Making of the Liberal International Order after 1945},

Abstract = {This article intervenes in IR debates on the origins and character of
   the postwar liberal international order. Dominant theorizations of the
   US-led Western order rest on a shared assumption of its essentially
   post-fascist character based on the liberal-democratic properties of its
   constitutive members. This article challenges this prevailing view. It
   does so through a critical historical and theoretical exploration of the
   role of far-right ideopolitical forces in the development of the liberal
   international order during the early Cold War period. Drawing on the
   concepts of ``uneven and combined development{''} and ``passive
   revolution{''} as alternative theoretical frames, the article focuses
   particular attention on the significance of former fascists in the
   workings and institutional fabric of a number of West European states
   and the relationship between the United States and NATO in far-right
   coup-plotting and violence that punctuated their national histories.
   Demonstrating these far-right ``contributions{''} to the making and
   evolution of the Cold War order, the article offers a
   reconceptualization of liberal order construction and US hegemony that
   not only problematizes existing accounts of Cold War geopolitics but
   also demonstrates the structural interconnections between the far-right
   and liberal order-building projects that goes beyond the Cold War era.},

Abstract = {Governments pursue their goals by adopting various mixes of policy
   instruments. This article proposes a specific operationalisation of
   these mixes and applies it to the analysis of reforms that many Western
   European governments have pursued, as they have adopted a similar policy
   design in their higher education systems (HESs) over the last 20 years.
   In fact, although these policies have similar templates, performance
   indicators exhibit remarkable variation between countries. Thus, by
   applying Qualitative Comparative Analysis to a large data set containing
   all changes in policy instruments undertaken in the last 20 years in 12
   HESs in Western Europe, this article explores the possibility that
   differences in performance across national HESs could be associated
   -ceteris paribus- with different policy mixes. This article finds not
   only that the common template has been applied through very different
   national policy mixes but also that only a few instruments are regularly
   linked to good teaching performance, regardless of the other components
   of the actual policy mix.},

Abstract = {How might rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
   affect the construction and application of military power? Despite the
   emerging importance of AI systems in defense modernization initiatives,
   there has been little empirical or theoretical study from the
   perspective of the international relations (IR) and security studies
   fields. This article addresses this shortcoming by describing AI
   developments and assessing the manner in which AI is likely to affect
   military organizations. We focus specifically on military power, as new
   methods and modes thereof will alter the constitution of security
   relationships around the world and affect the ability of states to
   bargain, signal, and influence in the twenty-first century. We argue
   that, though rapid adoption of AI technologies stands to transform
   states' ways of war on a number of fronts, an AI revolution brings with
   it new forms of risk that must be reconciled with the widespread
   integration of algorithmic systems across military functions. Where new
   technology promises a transformation of the character of military power
   in some veins, it also complicates the cognitive aspects of
   decision-making and bureaucratic interactions in security institutions.
   The speed with which complex integrated AI systems enable entirely new
   modes of war also stands to detach human agency in a potentially
   destabilizing fashion from the conduct of warfare on several fronts.
   Preventing the negative externalities of these ``ghosts in the
   machine{''} will involve significant efforts to educate decision makers,
   promote accountability, and restrain irresponsible employment of AI.},

Abstract = {Part I of `The African hero in Mozambican history', published in issue
   163, launched a discussion of the possible role of the individual in
   African history horizontal ellipsis both in general terms and in terms
   of understanding more precisely the implications of the assassination of
   Eduardo Mondlane for the further development of Mozambique. Now, in Part
   II, this essay similarly considers (in subsection3) the assassination of
   Mondlane's successor as leader of Frelimo (and the man who would later
   become the first president of a liberated Mozambique), Samora Machel. It
   remains focused on the broad theme of death and its impact on the
   history of Mozambique in subsection4that follows. But it now does so by
   reflecting upon the possible import of `execution as a mode of
   governance', and specifically by re-examining Frelimo's secret
   executions, sometime in the first decade of Mozambican independence, of
   Uriah Simango, his wife and a number of his colleagues, a group that had
   come to form the movement's internal opposition when in exile in
   Tanzania in the 1960s. It suggests that these extremely secretive
   executions can best be seen as negative outcomes of the self-righteous
   vanguardism that has come to haunt Frelimo in power up to the present.
   Part II then concludes (in subsection5) by examining a further series of
   deaths: the wave of mafia-style killings that, in this century (and
   beginning with the assassination of crusading journalist Carlos Cardoso
   in 2000), has come to be called `Mozambique's quiet assassination
   epidemic'. How best, finally, to interpret such an unsavoury recent
   phenomenon as this grisly `epidemic'?},

Abstract = {Why has the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria supported a
   total glyphosate ban proposed by the Social Democratic Party? We examine
   this research question and pursue two goals: first, to explain the
   specific empirical puzzle; second, to develop a general argument on the
   environmental policy profile of right-wing populist parties. We contend
   that certain environmental issues and the way that policymaking handles
   them provide this party family with an opportunity for maximising its
   vote share. The parties might adopt - in specific contexts underlining
   their character as a right-wing populist party - strict stances on
   environmental issues. In the case of glyphosate, the Freedom Party could
   promise benefits to domestic groups, indicate the misconduct of
   (foreign) companies in the process of risk assessment and question the
   integrity of scientists. For these reasons, the party joined a coalition
   of parties demanding a glyphosate ban.},

Abstract = {Existing scholarship has established that environmental NGOs influence
   political and ecological outcomes across a variety of settings. Yet this
   work tells us relatively little about how the networks, strategies, and
   organizations in the environmental NGO sector compare to other NGO
   sectors. This article argues that adopting a cross-sectoral perspective
   illuminates how theory and best practice developed for other INGO
   sectors can apply to the study of environmental INGOs, and vice versa.
   Drawing on quantitative data we find that a) on average, the ENGO sector
   is not more collaborative, better networked, more institutionalized, or
   more geographically imbalanced than other sectors; b) the ENGO sector is
   marked by a uniquely high level of concentration in terms of relational
   and economic resources. We call for more attention to the origins of
   these sectoral differences, and also draw out their implications for
   ENGO performance, suggesting that theories of `gatekeeping' may be
   particularly relevant to the study of environmental groups.},

Abstract = {While Giorgio Agamben's political theory of the exception received a
   great deal of attention in the early 2000s, he is once again riding a
   wave in International Relations theory as the growing community of
   ``theologies of the International{''} investigates the many
   contributions of theological inquiry for world politics. At the same
   time as his works provide a common point of conversation between
   critical IR and political theology, the latter field is undergoing a
   profound shift to answer to Agamben's call for a ``double paradigm{''}
   of political and economic theology. This article investigates Jacqueline
   (Int Polit Sociol 12:328-345, 2018) theory of technocratic
   exceptionalism as a moment where these waters meet. At the very moment
   where IR theorists seek to draw lessons from political theology, Best's
   concept of technocratic exceptionalism offers an opportunity for the
   completion of the double paradigm of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The multiple crises that the EU has faced over the last decade could
   lead observers to expect an increase in conflicts within its legislative
   process and, eventually, a shift from a consensual mode to a
   majoritarian and politicized mode. The datasetThe EU Legislative Output
   1996-2019indicates that this has occurred only to a moderate extent. To
   explore this enduring consensus, we analyse quantitative and qualitative
   data on law making within the Council of the EU and the European
   Parliament and proceed to a systematic diachronic comparison. We argue
   that, as before the crisis, consensus remains a norm and results from
   cooperation based strategies. Furthermore, new factors, such as the
   extension of the ordinary legislative procedure, a pro-EU alliance
   within the European Parliament and the smaller number of legislative
   proposals, foster consensus.},

Abstract = {This article explores the social construction of American grand strategy
   as nexus of identity and national security. The article first highlights
   how the identity construct of American exceptionalism has underwritten a
   grand strategy of global leadership and military interventionism since
   the end of the Cold War, constituting liberal hegemony as dominant
   position within the bipartisan US foreign policy establishment. The
   article then explores the political impact of counter-hegemonic
   discourses of restraint and offshore balancing under the Obama
   presidency. It argues that in `leading from behind' the Obama Doctrine
   represented a moderate intra-elite challenge to the status quo. Obama's
   use of exceptionalist rhetoric to legitimate restraint simultaneously
   exposed the political limits of this strategic paradigm shift, which
   oscillated between continuity and change. Finally, the article examines
   Trump's `America First' stance, concluding that its combination of
   nationalism, nativism, and protectionism has resulted in the erosion of
   the Washington consensus on liberal hegemony.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of social movements and environmental
   organizations in crafting contingent coalitions to advance renewable
   energies in Chile. Until recently, Chile presented several conditions
   predicting the continuation of an arm's-length energy policy and a
   deregulated energy market heavily concentrated on environmentally and
   socially unfriendly sources. However, gradual but transformative policy
   change in the last decade has made the country a world leader in
   renewable energy development. Studying two key moments in energy policy
   reform, we argue that the contingency of the coalitions that social
   movements and environmental organizations forged was crucial to the
   advancement of renewable energy policy and the transformation of the
   energy sector in the country. The paper advances our understanding of
   policy change in contexts of high path dependency and status quo bias,
   and builds the concept of ``contingent coalitions,{''} unifying similar
   but scattered and under-theorized notions that capture the fluid
   dynamics of coalition formation and policy change in environmental
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {To overcome the euro area (EA) crisis, the core pushed the periphery to
   cut labour costs. However, this paper documents that internal
   devaluation (ID) only mildly improves exports and it can significantly
   harm firms' non-price competitiveness factors. This raises the question
   of whether ID entered the bail-out conditionality only for economic
   reasons or also with political motivations. We argue that the economic
   crisis reignited a trust-confidence crisis between the core and
   periphery countries, with the latter emerging as non-credible reformers.
   While some adjustment to regain competitiveness was necessary in the
   periphery, it is hard to conceive that the policy mix adopted was the
   outcome of taking all costs into account. Political reasons appear to
   have exerted a notable influence and this may undermine the
   effectiveness, ownership and sustainability of present and future
   reforms.},

Abstract = {The role of policy styles in policymaking has attracted renewed
   scholarly interest in recent years. One of the central debates in this
   literature revolves around the question of how to reconcile archetype
   national policy styles with considerable differences in modus operandi
   across policy sectors. A sector-specific feature that is considered a
   key determinant of the manifestation of archetype national policy styles
   in the European Union is the degree of Europeanisation of policy
   sectors. This paper picks up this suggestion by addressing the question
   of whether and how Europeanisation affects the degree to which features
   of an archetype national policy style are manifest within a sector. We
   address this question by exploring sectoral policy styles in
   agricultural and food-related public health policymaking across three EU
   Member States: The Netherlands, the United Kingdom (England), and
   France. Our findings suggest that the degree of Europeanisation of a
   policy sectordoesprove an important condition that helps to understand
   the relationship between national and sectoral policy styles. More
   specifically, Europeanisation has the strongest effect when sectors face
   a higher adaptation pressure, i.e., when there is a larger misfit
   between sectoral regimes and EU-induced institutional demands. We
   suggest various promising avenues of future research on this
   relationship.},

Abstract = {Scholars have credited a model of state-led capitalism called the
   `developmental state' with producing the economic miracles of Japan,
   South Korea, and Taiwan. This article examines how the developmental
   state was shaped by the Cold War. US grand strategy focused on
   accelerating economic development among allies that were under the
   greatest threat from Communist China and North Korea. American aid
   agencies became involved in the process of state-building in Japan,
   South Korea, and Taiwan and supported economic planning. I verify this
   claim by contrasting US policies on Taiwan with US policies in the
   Philippines, which faced a weaker Communist threat.},

Abstract = {The literature on collaborative governance has generated several
   comprehensive models detailing the conditions which collaborations must
   meet to achieve collaborative performance. The importance of each
   separate condition - such as the presence of incentives to participate,
   appropriate institutional designs, or facilitative leadership - has been
   validated in various studies. How all of these conditions interact with
   each other, and whether all of the conditions need to be present to
   achieve performance, is less well understood. Leveraging the rich
   resource of the newly created Collaborative Governance Case Database,
   this article explores the different pathways to performance used by 26
   local collaborations. The analysis shows that the presence of strong
   incentives for partners to collaborate is a crucial condition for
   success; almost all performing cases shared this starting point.
   Performance was then achieved by combining strong incentives with either
   clear institutional design (e.g. explicit rules, transparent
   decision-making) or with intensive collaborative processes (e.g.
   face-to-face dialogue, knowledge sharing). This analysis shows that the
   current models for collaborative governance can serve as roadmaps,
   laying out all of the different conditions than may be important, but
   that collaborations can follow different routes to reach their
   objectives.},

Abstract = {Is Europe headed towards nonpolarity? What would that entail for the
   future stability and security of the continent? Taking its cue from IR
   debates about the effects of polarity on international order, the
   article develops conceptual tools and an analytical narrative concerning
   Europe during the post-Cold War era. It refines the concept of a Great
   Power by suggesting the notion of `ordering agents' and ponders whether
   Europe is in danger of drifting towards a period of nonpolarity with no
   power being able to shoulder the responsibility of ordering and
   providing good stewardship over Europe.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to build on the existing research regarding
   workplace conflict by arguing that task conflict (TC) leads to resource
   gains for individuals with non-routine technical jobs, which increases
   individuals' work engagement (WE) and leads to positive individual-level
   outcomes. Specifically, this study uses a resource
   investment/acquisition approach with the aim of offering insight into
   the consequences of group-level TC on individual-level outcomes,
   including task performance (TP), contextual performance and turnover
   intention. Design/methodology/approach Multi-rater data was collected
   from 508 telecom engineers and 35 supervisors working in Pakistan's
   telecom sector. The engineers were divided into 31 teams and the data
   were analysed using confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation
   modelling to test the interrelationships among study constructs.
   Findings As expected, TC was positively correlated with both TP and
   contextual performance, while it was negatively correlated with turnover
   intention; these relationships were mediated by WE. The results reveal
   that TC in technical jobs leads to resource gains and, through WE,
   facilitates task and contextual performances at the individual level.
   Similarly, TC mitigates individual-level turnover intention through the
   mediation of WE. Originality/value The current study contributes to the
   literature on the conflict by delineating a resource
   investment/acquisition process within the conservation of resources
   theory, whereby TC (an exchange and acquisition of cognitive resources)
   leads to resource investment (in the form of WE), which, in turn, leads
   to positive individual-level outcomes.},

Abstract = {According to the `rebels-turned-narcos' premise, increasing involvement
   in the illicit drug industry causes insurgent groups to lose sight of
   their political aims, as they shift their focus to profit-making. The
   (former) Colombian rebel group, the FARC-EP, became a paragon for this
   idea. Drawing on primary research, we argue that the FARC-EP's
   involvement in the illicit drug economy wasitselfpolitical. Their
   involvement included governance activities, which are by their very
   nature political. Furthermore, these activities formed part of the
   FARC-EP's political project, aimed at ensuring the reproduction of the
   peasant smallholder economy. Our argument challenges the
   rebels-turned-narcos premise more broadly by showing why involvement in
   the illicit drug economy, on its own, is insufficient evidence to posit
   the depoliticization of an insurgent group.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the radicalization of all of the five young
   offenders -aged between fourteen and eighteen years- who have been
   convicted in Spain between 2004 and 2019 of membership of a jihadist
   terrorist organization. It is based on: a) unprecedented access to the
   assessments of these youths produced by the Agency for the Reeducation
   and Reintegration of Young Offenders in the regional Government of
   Madrid; b) personal semi-structured interviews with the staff at this
   Agency responsible for their psycho-socio and educational intervention
   during their custodial measures; and c) judicial reports related to
   their cases. The article assesses the main features of the
   radicalization processes of these minors following a three-dimensional
   analysis at the micro, meso and macro level. It provides empirical
   evidence to test the validity of the main hypotheses on the causality of
   radicalization.},

Abstract = {Feminist scholars and activists have historically been written out of
   peace research, despite their strong presence in the early stages of the
   field. In this article, we develop the concept of ``wifesization{''} to
   illustrate the process through which feminist and feminized
   interventions have been reduced to appendages of the field, their
   contributions appropriated for its development but unworthy of mention
   as independent producers of knowledge. Wifesization has trickle-down
   effects, not just for knowledge production, but also for peacebuilding
   practice. We propose new feminist genealogies for peace research that
   challenge and redefine the narrow boundaries of the field, in the form
   of a patchwork quilt including early theorists, utopian writing, oral
   history, and indigenous knowledge production. Reflections draw on the
   authors' engagements with several archives rich in cultures and
   languages of peace, not reducible to a ``single story.{''} Recovering
   wifesized feminist contributions to peace research, our article offers a
   new way of constructing peace research canons that gives weight to
   long-standing, powerful, and plural feminist voices, in order to make
   peace scholarship more inclusive and ultimately richer.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Peacebuilding scholarship has not responded adequately to critiques of
   peacebuilding practice. This failure results from two related problems;
   an implicit assumption of a dichotomous relationship between conflict
   and peace, and an attendant failure to appreciate the challenges posed
   by complex global conflict systems. Stuck debating the dynamics of
   specific interventions in single states, the field has failed to fully
   appreciate how much conflict and peace are mutually constitutive across
   contexts and how underlying legitimating logics driving contemporary
   conflict transcend borders and reach across scales. Therefore, this
   paper argues, we must fully accept a more nuanced, trans-national, and
   trans-scalar conception of how conflict and peace are interrelated
   within states, internationally, and globally. The goal of the paper,
   therefore, is to tie together disparate arguments within the field to
   encourage new thinking regarding peacebuilding and more a holistic
   conception of a trans-scalar global peace system to replace the
   prevailing global conflict system.},

Abstract = {Dumiso Dabengwa's death in May 2019 offers the opportunity to reflect on
   Zimbabwe's fraught liberation struggle and its consequences today. (1)
   That Robert Mugabe's passing was a few months later makes such
   considerations more pertinent. This article thus revisits some of the
   liberation war's moments of evident tension between its two main
   nationalist movements, as well as those in the post-1980 era. It also
   considers some of Dabengwa's last, most historically important and
   philosophically interesting reflections.},

Abstract = {Scholars of American politics debate the consequences of polarized and
   divided government on lawmaking but have largely neglected the impact of
   institutional conflict on the policy outputs of the bureaucracy. We
   argue that lawmaking gridlock creates opportunities and demands for
   governors and civil servants to pursue policy goals through rulemaking.
   To explore these dynamics, we draw upon a comprehensive dataset of over
   150,000 proposed and adopted rules issued by US state agencies from 1994
   through 2009 and compare differences in rulemaking output within states
   across periods of divided and unified party control. We find that policy
   conflict (measured by the presence of a party divided legislature) leads
   to a 3\%-7\% increase in the number of proposed and adopted rules. We
   then explore how variation in state powers of legislative oversight
   affect rulemaking, and find that these effects are concentrated in
   governments with weaker powers of legislative review. Our research
   speaks to debates in the literature regarding the nature of bureaucratic
   policymaking and highlights practical consequences of legislative
   gridlock and partisan polarization.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that great power patrons prop up client
   dictatorships. But this is generally assumed rather than systematically
   analyzed. This article provides the first comprehensive analysis of the
   relationship between foreign sponsorship and authoritarian regime
   survival, using an original data set of all autocratic client regimes in
   the postwar period. The results demonstrate that patronage from Western
   powers-the United States, France, and the United Kingdom-is not
   associated with client regime survival. Rather, it's only Soviet
   sponsorship that reduced the risk of regime collapse. The author
   explains this variation by considering the effects of foreign
   sponsorship on the likelihood of military coups d'etat. He argues that
   the Soviet Union directly aided its clients by imposing a series of
   highly effective coup prevention strategies. By contrast, the US and its
   allies didn't provide such aid, leaving regimes vulnerable to military
   overthrow.},

Abstract = {The `two worlds of morality politics' framework suggests that the
   historical structure of the party system has a major influence on the
   politics of morality issues. This study uses the case of Ireland to
   examine that proposition. Ireland is unusual in that it combines the
   absence of an historical church-state conflict in its party system with
   an historically strong Roman Catholic Church. It is therefore a
   `critical case' for the `two worlds' framework, which brings to the fore
   the interaction of the Church and the party system. It is also a
   puzzling case in the timing and sequence of its reforms. Focusing on the
   politics of contraception, abortion, same-sex marriage, and divorce, we
   show that the Church had no strong secularising opponents ('enemies');
   however, when public attitudes changed and when liberalising interest
   groups mobilised, nor did the Church have parties who were close allies
   ('friends'). Case studies of abortion and same-sex marriage show in
   greater depth how, in the presence of changing attitudes and
   mobilisation, the Church lacked a foothold in the party system that
   would allow it to obstruct reforms. The study's findings open a
   conversation between the heretofore separate literatures on morality
   politics and Church influence.},

Abstract = {Contemporary U.S. politics is characterized by polarization and
   interpartisan antipathy. This is accompanied by a media landscape
   saturated with coverage of political scandals. Applying a social
   identity perspective, we examined whether exposure to scandals that
   threaten partisan's moral group image (i.e., in-party scandals), may
   motivate defensive hostility against opposing partisans. Across three
   experiments we exposed U.S. partisans to scandals attributed to either
   in-party or out-party politicians. We then assessed partisan hostility
   using a variety of operationalizations, including anger at a real
   outgroup politician (Study 1), judgments about the alleged misdeeds of a
   fabricated outgroup politician (Study 2), and negative perceptions of
   opposing party members (Study 3). Strength of partisan identity was
   assessed as a predicted moderator (Study 3). As expected in- (vs. out-)
   party scandals, were perceived as group-image threats and elicited
   greater hostility towards opposing partisans, independent of partisans'
   ideological extremity or prior affective polarization.},

Abstract = {A political opportunity structure that emerged in the Dominican Republic
   between 2009 and 2012 facilitated the victory of a movement that forced
   the government to begin spending 4 percent of the gross domestic product
   on preuniversity education, but the movement was unable to develop a
   social base that would ensure the effective implementation of its
   demand. This case suggests that a movement's success in reaching its
   formal goal is just the first stage in a struggle whose second stage is
   continued pressure on the state to ensure that demands are implemented.

   entre 2009 y 2012 facilito la victoria de un movimiento que obligo al
   gobierno a comenzar a gastar el 4 por ciento del producto interno bruto
   en la educacion preuniversitaria. Sin embargo, dicho movimiento no pudo
   desarrollar una base social que asegurara la implementacion efectiva de
   sus demandas. Este caso sugiere que el exito de un movimiento en torno
   al cumplimiento formal de sus metas es solo la primera etapa en una
   lucha cuya segunda etapa exige presion continua sobre el estado para

Abstract = {Corporate political strategies have been used extensively by firms
   attempting to shape their political environments. In this context,
   access to targeted policymakers is essential to allow their deployment.
   Thus, we propose to study the determinants of access to the European
   Commission representatives. This research builds on the resource-based
   view (RBV) of firms to argue that political knowledge is a valuable
   resource to increase firms' degree of access to the European Commission.
   To test our hypotheses, we built a novel dataset merging firms
   characteristics with lobbying meetings information, and analyze it
   through negative binomial regression. The results suggest the importance
   of political knowledge, emphasizing that it may represent a source of
   sustainable competitive advantage. This study highlights interesting
   information that broadens the understanding of corporate political
   strategies in the European Union.},

Abstract = {The election of a Socialist and pro-Russian candidate in December 2016
   as president of Moldova marks a new turn in Moldovan politics. This is
   in contrast with the pro-Western attitudes of the previous government
   Political instability and changing international orientations, as
   emphasized by this article, are partly due to political alternative
   victories of parties supported by different social groups. Focusing on
   young people's activism, the article underlines the differentiation
   between the political success made possible by street protests in April
   2009 and the political failure in December 2016. The findings may add a
   new explanation to Moldova's permanent instability.},

Abstract = {The return of the local democracy to the military training areas raises
   a number of complex challenges even under the conditions of a democratic
   state. In the municipalities that were established in the Czech Republic
   on 1 January 2016 by a separation from the territory of the military
   training areas, a nondemocratic paternalist system has dominated for
   many decades at the local level, which in some cases was deepened by a
   presence of the foreign Soviet army. While other municipalities in the
   post-communist period after 1989 have undergone a complex development
   and have gradually responded to new challenges (e.g., the use of subsidy
   titles, intermunicipal cooperation), and, in the case of the settlements
   in the territory of the military training area districts, nondemocratic
   local paternalism was preserved until the end of 2015. In the first
   phase of their term, the elected representatives of the local government
   primarily focused on securing the basic functions of the municipality
   (issues of housing and basic amenities of the village-school facilities,
   shops), saving local sights as remnants of historical memory, and
   developing cooperation within different networks of actors on a general
   level (e.g., issues of tourism development, environmental protection).},

Abstract = {Why do some insurgent organizations launch maritime attacks? To examine
   why organizations would engage in this behavior we draw on a new dataset
   of insurgencies to investigate the organizational characteristics
   associated with maritime attacks. We find that there are two types of
   maritime attacks by insurgencies. While both types of attacks are
   associated with the trappings of a state, beyond those factors, maritime
   revenue-raising attacks take place in a milieu of criminal activity,
   while maritime non-revenue-raising attacks are associated with an
   insurgency's organizational sophistication and capacity.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Politics and Current
   Demographic Challenges in Central and Eastern Europe,{''} guest-edited
   by Tsveta Petrova and Tomasz Inglot.
   Like other countries in Europe, Poland's population is growing older,
   because of a combination of increasing life expectancies and decreasing
   birth rates. Such demographic change poses challenges for policy makers,
   who often understand population aging to put strain on social-service,
   health care, and pension systems. In response, governments and civil
   society often emphasize ``active aging,{''} a rubric encompassing a wide
   range of policies and programs meant to promote health, workforce
   participation, lifelong learning, and social engagement. Although active
   aging is often part of neoliberal policies that focus on individual
   responsibility, recent anthropological theory shows that neoliberal
   ideals of self-care cannot fully explain contemporary forms of
   responsibility and social relations. Anthropological theory and
   ethnographic data can thus help to analyze the effects of demographic
   change as evident in social policy and programs. In this article, I
   integrate an analysis of Polish governmental documents meant to promote
   active aging with an analysis of ethnographic data of older Poles'
   experiences of active aging. This article provides an ethnographically
   grounded perspective on the concept of active aging that focuses on how
   people actually experience such policies by exploring the meanings such
   programs and activities take on in the lives of individual and groups.
   Ethnographic data reveal that the past has multiple emotional valences
   that shape people's experiences of these programs, stemming from
   histories of violence and rupture in the region. This suggests that
   making explicit the multiple, complex meanings of the past could shape
   active aging policy and thus civil society to be more inclusive.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and relevance of
   the Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol-18 (TRAP-18), an
   investigative framework to identify those at risk of lone actor
   terrorism. Using public information, we rated TRAP-18 items for 35 U.S.
   and 38 European jihadism-inspired lone actors (total N = 77). Results
   reveal challenges completing the TRAP-18 using public information: only
   four of 18 items (Pathway, Identification, Personal Grievance, Framed by
   Ideology) were rated present more often than absent or unknown. Findings
   suggest greater relevance of TRAP-18 items to U.S. lone actors, who had
   a higher average number of items rated present.},

Abstract = {A key question facing scholars of party politics is the journey engaged
   individuals take to becoming party members. We argue that the existing
   literature largely outlines one aspect - motivation. In this article, we
   present an alternative position: that a membership journey is only
   complete when a motivation, process and trigger are present. We outline
   this utilising a case study of the Green Party of England and Wales
   including previously confidential internal party documents, membership
   figures, elite interviews, focus group research and participant
   observation to provide a different means to understand membership
   fluctuations. We present these findings as an exploratory and inductive
   reinterpretation of existing debates. However, we also suggest that the
   findings are of interest not just in the case of the Green Party, nor
   the United Kingdom, but to all those who study party membership.},

Abstract = {This article explores how beliefs affect preferences leading to policy
   instrument choices of elite actors. Beliefs are general attitudes
   regarding a given policy field, for example toward the role of the state
   or the urgency of a problem. Both beliefs and preferences are central
   for applications of Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition Framework, but their
   interrelationship has remained undertheorized. Understanding how beliefs
   and preferences are linked can provide important insights into policy
   instrument choice, while improving the comparability of studies across
   policy subsystems. The article compares the relative contribution of
   beliefs to shaping instrument choices of elite actors in the domain of
   Swiss renewable energy policy. Results suggest that beliefs are likely
   to play a prominent role in shaping instrument choice. We find that
   policy core beliefs translate into preferences through a process
   involving two main pathways. First, some policy beliefs primarily
   influence the preferred characteristics of the overall instrument mix.
   Second, some policy beliefs are primarily associated with preferences
   for specific instruments. Some policy beliefs are influential via both
   pathways. These, therefore, emerge as especially important factors
   shaping the policy process. Our results offer insights for policymakers
   into how potential future conflicts in negotiations can be attenuated.},

Abstract = {A bargaining framework and a measure of conflict polarization are
   developed from two elements: (i) hatred-based negative externalities
   experienced by the parties to the conflict, and (ii) penalties the
   parties impose on their delegated negotiators when concessions are made
   in the bargaining process. The framework establishes agreement and
   disagreement regions and it is shown that a necessary condition for a
   negotiated solution is the adoption of a dual policy that combines
   dissociative political and military strategies. This analytical approach
   is applied first to polarized conflicts generally and then to the
   specific case of the internal conflict in Colombia between that
   country's government and the FARC guerrilla group. The model provides a
   rationale for the complex dynamic of Colombia's current peace process,
   which has involved a preliminary agreement and its subsequent rejection
   in a national referendum. Our analysis highlights the successful
   dissociative political-military strategy followed by the negotiators
   that enabled them to reach the agreement and the negotiators'
   underestimation of the hatred levels that led the majority of the
   Colombian society represented in the referendum to vote the agreement
   down because they considered the concessions made by the government too
   generous to be acceptable.},

   Planning in US States(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras Clave},

Abstract = {The United States is experiencing growing impacts of climate change but
   currently receives a limited policy response from its national
   leadership. Within this policy void, many state governments are stepping
   up and taking action on adaptation planning. Yet we know little about
   why some states adopt State Adaptation Plans (SAPs), while others do
   not. This article investigates factors that predict the emergence of
   SAPs, both in terms of policy adoption and policy intensity (goal
   ambitiousness). Applying the diffusion of innovation theory, I consider
   the relative influence of internal state characteristics, regional
   pressures, and test for conditional effects between government
   ideologies and severity of the problem. The results show interesting
   differences between predictors that influence policy adoption and
   ambitiousness. States are more motivated to adopt a policy when faced
   with greater climate vulnerability, have more liberal citizenry, and
   where governments have crossed policy hurdles by previously passing
   mitigation plans. The intensity of policies and goal setting, moreover,
   is more likely to be driven by interest group politics and diffuse
   through policy learning or sharing information among neighboring states
   in Environmental Protection Agency regions. These findings support an
   emerging scholarship that uses more complex dependent variables in
   policy analysis. These variables have the potential to differentiate
   symbolic from substantive policies and capture finer information about
   predictors of importance.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the role of social empathy in policymaking.
   Social empathy extends empathy from an interpersonal disposition to the
   social and political structures that inform policy processes and
   outcomes. Empathy requires an emotional understanding of phenomena,
   which we suggest can be cultivated through an emotional analysis of
   policy, and can result in more socially just outcomes. Building on
   social work and emotional policy analysis research, we present a
   framework for both nurturing and applying empathy in policy contexts,
   which is then applied to the case of Canada's Caregiver Program. We
   demonstrate how emotional discourse analysis exposes the various subject
   positions of both the analyst and policy subjects, implicating
   disciplinary forces that hinder connection between actors. Once such
   forces are illuminated, policymakers can reconfigure policy in more
   socially just ways. We thus emphasize the transformative potential of
   fostering empathy in and through policymaking.},

Abstract = {Existing scholarship in comparative politics has either focused on
   regionalism or on political and economic decentralisation to explain the
   growth of regional parties. Using quantitative evidence from India, I
   show that a hitherto ignored explanation, the level of regional branch
   autonomy within polity-wide parties, also has a significant impact on
   the growth of regional parties. When regional branches of polity-wide
   parties have autonomy, regional parties find it difficult to grow. In
   contrast, regional parties benefit electorally when regional branches of
   polity-wide parties are less autonomous. To further account for
   endogeneity between regional party growth and regional branch autonomy,
   I use quantitative and qualitative evidence to show that the growth of
   regional parties is not positively correlated with more regional branch
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {The current paper analyzes the recent wave of violence in the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and especially the occurrences on the
   Gazan border since March 2018, from a less covered point of view - the
   battle over the image and narrative. The Palestinians' main tools of
   resistance during this wave of violence have been civilian protests near
   the fence and the launching of explosive kites and balloons across the
   border - causing massive damage to Israeli agriculture. We argue that
   the Palestinians had waged a sophisticated Image War on the border of
   Gaza, and while they are performing, the world is watching.},

Abstract = {When and why did the United States first contemplate NATO's enlargement
   into Eastern Europe? Existing research generally portrays U.S. backing
   for NATO enlargement as a product of the policy debates and particular
   beliefs inside the William Clinton administration (1993-2001) starting
   in the mid-1990s. New evidence, however, shows that U.S. backing for
   enlargement began earlier, under the preceding George H.W. Bush
   administration (1989-1993). Moreover, the Bush administration favored
   enlargement for fundamentally realpolitik reasons, viewing it as a way
   of sustaining U.S. preeminence and suppressing challengers in post-Cold
   War Europe. The results carry implications for historiography, foreign
   policy, and international relations theory.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This article further theorizes exemplary practitioners' roles in
   neighborhood governance by building on the framework of the four ideal
   types of practitioners-frontline worker, everyday fixer, social
   entrepreneur and boundary spanner. An actor-focused approach was applied
   which delivered data to reconstruct processes in which a single citizen
   practitioner engaged in an Amsterdam neighborhood. Data were collected
   through shadowing and interviewing him for 2 months. It is shown how
   this exemplary practitioner combined and switched between the role
   characteristics of the four generic types, just like chameleon, during
   his interactions with other actors in various situations and contexts.
   During this dynamic role switching, he took on the tasks of a community
   developer, previously delivered by civil servants. He also facilitated
   stakeholder collaboration leading to more inclusive and democratic local
   governance. However, role switching caused him to loose the trust of
   some citizens on the long term. These findings gain relevance in the
   context of the reorganization of the Dutch welfare state.},

Abstract = {Pro-government militias (PGMs) are armed, political organizations that
   assist regime and state elites through illicit violence. This article
   considers how and where to situate militias within larger frameworks of
   political violence and its emerging contexts. Pro-government militias
   have increased in recent years, along with their participation in
   conflict events, including those resulting in fatalities. This is in
   step with increases in domestic political competition and regime
   fragmentation across developing states. Using a new PGM dataset that
   collects discrete events perpetrated by these groups across Africa from
   1997-2016, two conclusions are reached: PGM groups are more active
   outside of civil war periods than within, and their actions and numbers
   have increased as more countries transition to democracy. Further,
   activity by PGMs is not well explained by government attempts to
   delegate violence for reputational reasons or low capacity. Political
   fragmentation at the national level and diffuse opposition threats
   better account for the spatial and temporal patterns of PGM activity.},

Abstract = {Policy positions are used extensively to explain coalition formation,
   advocacy success and policy outputs, and government consultations and
   stakeholder surveys are seen as important means of gathering data about
   policy actors' positions. However, we know little about how accurately
   official consultations and stakeholder surveys reflect their views. This
   study compares advocacy organisations' publicly stated positions in
   their responses to official consultations with their positions expressed
   in confidential surveys conducted by the authors. It compares three
   decision-making processes in Switzerland - in energy,climate and water
   protection - to analyse responses via two different types of data
   gathering methods. The results show a substantial divergence between
   official and private expressions of policy positions. Specific types of
   policy actors (losers), instruments (persuasive measures) and subsystems
   (collaborative network) produce more divergent positions. This has
   important methodological implications for comparative policy studies
   that use different data gathering methods and focus on different policy
   domains.},

Abstract = {Visual communication is at the heart of international relations in the
   digital age. Using a range of media tools, political elites communicate
   so-called `strategic narratives' to persuade and influence the behaviour
   of target audiences. The existing body of research on `strategic
   narratives' examines both spoken and written messages. While an academic
   focus on visual texts is emerging, limited attention has been given to
   the visualization of peaceful topics such as infrastructure projects.
   This paper examines the ontological and methodological foundations of
   `strategic narratives', `visuality', and `infrastructure', to ascertain
   what seeing strategic narratives on infrastructure means in the study of
   global politics. The theoretical claims are demonstrated using the case
   study of China's Maritime Silk Road Initiative. Herein, it is shown how
   China communicates strategic narratives on infrastructure to persuade
   target audiences of its foreign policy priorities, and to secure its
   self-concept. This communication process is supported by images in the
   digital sphere.},

Abstract = {What has driven China's policy toward United Nations (UN) sanctions on
   North Korea? While insisting on a peaceful settlement of North Korean
   nuclear issues via diplomatic dialogues, China has gradually loosened
   its protective stance regarding UN sanctions on North Korea. This
   article examines the factors that have pushed China to take a tougher
   position toward North Korea: North Korea's increasingly aggressive
   nuclear policy, the influence of the United States on Chinese foreign
   policy, and the changing perception of North Korea in China. Through
   close examination of China's domestic discussions on North Korea, this
   article concludes that, besides the external factors, a growing negative
   perception of North Korea has played an increasingly important role in
   changing China's official stance. The findings suggest that closer
   attention should be paid to the changes in the domestic political
   environment of China to understand its current and future approach
   toward North Korea.},

Title = {Things We Lost in the Fire: How Different Types of Contestation Affect
   the Robustness of International Norms},

Abstract = {Contestation of international norms has become the new focus of IR norm
   research. The optimism of the 1990s that fundamental liberal norms would
   diffuse globally has remained unfulfilled in recent years-even human
   rights norms have witnessed strong contestation. Time and again,
   controversy has erupted regarding international norms such as the ban on
   torture or the Responsibility to Protect. Meanwhile, we know little
   about how such controversy affects the robustness of norms-whether it
   contributes to their weakening or to their strengthening. Existing
   research offers two competing hypotheses: One branch of norm research
   often conceptualizes contestation as a sign of norm weakening. By
   contrast, another branch assigns contestation a normative power of its
   own, which strengthens norms. It does not specify the limits of such
   normative power, however. In this article, we argue that contestation
   per se is a poor predictor of norm robustness. The type of contestation
   a norm faces matters. Contestation can either (1) address the dimension
   of application of a norm or (2) examine its validity by questioning the
   righteousness of the claims a norm makes. The article draws on two
   illustrative case studies of extensively contested norms, the
   Responsibility to Protect and the ban on commercial whaling. We argue
   that widespread contestation of the very validity of a norm is likely to
   lead to a loss of norm robustness. Applicatory contestation, by
   contrast, can-under specific circumstances-even strengthen it.},

Title = {What is the responsibility to respect human rights? Reconsidering the
   `respect, protect, and fulfill' framework},

Abstract = {The world's understanding of the action needed to advance human rights
   is deeply structured by the `respect, protect, and fulfill' framework.
   But its potential is significantly undermined by a narrow conception of
   `respect' for human rights. This paper systematically addresses these
   weaknesses and advances an original alternative. It first provides a
   historical account of the `do no harm' conception of `respect' in the
   political context of the late Cold War. It then analyzes this
   conception's empirical functioning today, using the example of
   unauthorized migration along the US-Mexico border. These points
   illustrate an overarching theoretical argument: the responsibility to
   respect human rights should be based on a responsibility not to
   dehumanize, rather than exclusively on a duty to do no harm. This
   involves the consideration of each person as a moral equal, the
   elevation of human rights practice as a basis for judgment inside of a
   moral agent's self, and the rejection of state-centrism as the basis for
   all political responsibility. This argument has implications traversing
   the theory and practice of human rights, including: the ability to
   translate and embed into practice the new meanings of `respect,'
   `protect,' and `fulfill'; and the need to re-consider the contemporary
   significance of 1980s liberalism.},

Abstract = {Whilst there is no shortage of analyses on the politics of regions in
   International Relations, little attention has been paid to states who
   perceive that they do not properly fit in the regions they happen to be
   located in. These are the `misplaced states': they stand out not so much
   because of material capacities but because they espouse an identity,
   manifested in different ways, in marked contrast to the states around
   them. This article asks what causes this process of a change in identity
   amongst misplaced states in different parts of the world. Comparing
   across regions, it analyses why and how states reconstruct their
   identities in order to enhance or deemphasise their degrees of regional
   conformity. By focusing on the `role-location process' rooted in role
   theory, this article contributes to the literature by conceptualising
   the phenomenon of `misplacement.' A state is misplaced when there is
   mismatch between its aspirations and others' expectations for it. The
   article also details how and why misplacement occurs and studies its
   implications both for the states in question as well as for the politics
   of their geographical regions.},

Abstract = {Seoul and Washington have conceded that Terminal High Altitude Area
   Defense (THAAD) in South Korea cannot protect the capital region of
   Republic of Korea (ROK), including Seoul and Incheon, from North Korea's
   missile attacks. Why did the South Korean government decide to deploy
   THAAD, risking possible retaliation from China, although it already knew
   its limited utility on the Korean peninsula? This article addresses the
   puzzle by connecting the deployment of THAAD in South Korea with the
   U.S. conception of a strategic rebalancing to Asia. By linking South
   Korea's decision to deploy THAAD with contemporary alliance politics,
   extended deterrence, and abandonment and entrapment risks, it argues
   that Seoul's THAAD decision was primarily intended to sustain and
   strengthen the U.S.-ROK alliance amid escalating nuclear threats by
   North Korea and deepening Sino-American rivalry.},

Title = {Psychological contract violation and patient's antisocial behaviour A
   moderated mediation model of patient trust and doctor-patient
   communication},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {647-664},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to examine the dual effects of the
   violation of psychological contract on patient's antisocial behaviour
   via the mediator of patient trust and the role of doctor-patient
   communication as a critical contingent variable in the psychological
   contract violation of patient's antisocial behaviour relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The data were collected from 483 hospitalized patients distributed in
   Shanxi province, China by using a self-administered survey.
   Findings
   The results indicated that psychological contract violation is
   positively associated with patient antisocial behaviour via patient
   trust. Moreover, the study found that doctor-patient communication
   moderates the mediated effects of psychological contract violation on
   patient's antisocial behaviour through patient trust; that is, the
   mediated effect on antisocial behaviour is weaker when both doctor and
   patients have more communication.
   Research limitations/implications
   Due to a cross-sectional design in nature, the causal relationship
   cannot be developed based on the results. Despite the limitation, the
   present study provides insights for improving doctor-patient
   relationship by emphasizing the importance of increasing patient trust
   and doctor-patient communication.
   Practical implications
   To improve the quality of doctor-patient relationship, this study
   addresses the significance of properly showing understandings and care
   to regain mutual trust and reducing the likelihood of patient's
   antisocial behaviour. Social implications - The research findings have
   implications for both the health system and medical schools in China to
   reinforce the professional ethics and improve their medical humanities
   as the main concerns to generate a more sustainable doctor-patient
   relationship.
   Originality/value
   This study includes patient trust as a mediator and doctor-patient
   communication as a moderator to investigate the moderated mediation
   relationship among patients and medical professionals. By further
   examining the doctor-patient relationship, the results may not only help
   improve the efficient implementation of medical practices but also
   support the institutes and develop medical professionals for more
   positive doctor-patient relationships.},

Abstract = {Building resilience to violent extremism has featured in preventing
   violent extremism efforts for over a decade. Validated and standardized
   cross-cultural measures can help identify protective capacities and
   vulnerabilities toward violent extremism for young people. Because
   drivers for violent extremism are multi-factorial, a measure of
   resilience cannot be used to predict who will and will not commit acts
   of terror. Instead, its purpose is to track the multiple forms of
   capital available to youth at risk of adopting violence to resolve
   ideological, religious and political grievances, and to use this data to
   inform interventions that increase young people's capacity to resist
   violent extremism's push and pull forces. In this study, we developed
   such a measure, using data from 200 Australian and 275 Canadian
   participants aged eighteen-thirty years old. Following exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analysis, a fourteen-item measure emerged consisting
   of five factors: cultural identity and connectedness; bridging capital;
   linking capital; violence-related behaviors, and violence-related
   beliefs. The Building Resilience against Violent Extremism (BRAVE)
   measure was found to have good internal reliability (alpha = .76),
   correlating in expected directions with related measures. The BRAVE
   shows promise for helping understand young people's resilience to
   violent extremism.},

Abstract = {The notion that younger people hold more favourable attitudes towards
   the European Union (EU) is prevalent in both academic and popular
   discourse. While certain events like the Brexit referendum in the United
   Kingdom fit this intuition, other developments such as Eurosceptic
   parties garnering considerable support among millennial voters in some
   member states do not. To understand these diverging trends, this study
   draws our attention to how specific events shape EU support. It
   empirically demonstrates how the Eurozone crisis shapes generational
   divides. Younger cohorts in debtor countries have become significantly
   more sceptical of the EU than their peers in creditor states. The
   opposite pattern emerges for older cohorts. Older generations are more
   supportive of the EU in debtor countries compared to creditor states.
   These findings have important implications for our understanding of how
   public support for the EU will develop in the future by suggesting that
   generational divides are highly context-dependent.},

Title = {Policy Change: An Advocacy Coalition Framework Perspective},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-86},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {One purpose of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is to explain
   policy change. Previous holistic reviews of the ACF by Weible, Sabatier,
   and McQueen (2009) and Pierce, Peterson, Jones, Garrard, and Vu (2017)
   of the framework have not explicitly analyzed all the concepts and their
   interactions in a systematic manner. To address this gap and inform
   scholars and practitioners about past findings, strengths, weaknesses,
   and opportunities for future research, this article analyzes how the
   ACF's theory of policy change is applied to 148 policy processes among
   67 journal articles from 2007 to 2014. Similar to Weible et al. (2009),
   this research finds the frequent use of multiple primary pathways to
   policy change, infrequent use of many of the ACF's concepts, a plurality
   of applications in the environment and energy domain, comparison of
   subsystems, and a need for greater clarity and transparency among
   applications. Unlike Weible et al. (2009), this article explores
   associations between primary pathways and policy domains, the frequency
   of associations between primary pathways and secondary components,
   policy change and stasis, and identifies threats to internal validity of
   key ACF concepts.},

Title = {The `genetic' effect: Can parties' past organizational choices condition
   the development of their internal distribution of power in the cartel

Abstract = {This study critically assesses the claim of the cartel party theory that
   the party in central office (PCO) has lost its powers to the party in
   public office (PPO) as parties have adapted to various changes in their
   operating `environment'. The study argues that a party's tendency to
   adapt is conditioned by the party's `genetic' heritage: if the PCO
   assumed a prominent position during the party's institutionalization, it
   can more likely stand against external pressures compared to a PCO that
   has been traditionally weak. The study compares the development
   (1983-2017) of two Finnish parties, which hail from polar `genetic'
   traditions: a social democratic mass party and a conservative cadre
   party. The change of the party `environment' has strongly supported
   PCO's decay. Unlike earlier longitudinal studies on intra-party power
   balance, the study assesses all significant power dimensions and finds a
   contradictory development: while the distribution of leadership
   positions and resources increasingly favour the PPO in both parties,
   significant `genetic' differences in the distribution of formal
   decision-making power have not diminished at all. If statutory
   regulations matter, the results suggest that the PPO cannot `insulate'
   like the cartel model expects in parties where the PCO's strong role has
   been strictly codified.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the contributory role of the bio-economy and the
   UN General Assembly Sustainable Development Goals in facilitating and
   fostering land-grabbing in sub-Saharan Africa. It argues that with the
   rapidly increasing demand for land and the use of agricultural produce
   for food and energy purposes, the bio-economy, together with the
   Sustainable Development Goals, has inexorably exacerbated the practice
   of land-grabbing in sub-Saharan Africa, where land is considered to be
   abundant, empty and unused. Sub-Saharan Africa has again been perceived
   primarily as a steady supplier of land for the production of food and
   non-food crops.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The question of what constitutes the legitimacy of using force against
   an external adversary has become especially relevant since the wars that
   followed 9/11, and post-Cold War interventions in human crises. This
   article is conceptually motivated to bridging some of the scholarly
   gaps, mainly by developing a systematic methodological approach to
   analyzing how democratic governments try to establish domestic
   legitimacy for using force, defining that legitimacy and
   operationalizing it. Thereafter, it analyzes the two components of this
   legitimacy-the ingrained and the dynamic-and the interrelationships
   between them, thereby developing a framework for an empirical analysis
   of specific cases.},

Abstract = {In order to tackle democratic backsliding in EU member states, the
   European Commission proposed a new financial conditionality in May 2018
   that would allow the suspension of EU funds in cases of systematic rule
   of law infringements. This article seeks to evaluate the Commission's
   proposal in terms of its chances at successfully deterring or redressing
   such infringements. Drawing on both the literature on EU enlargement and
   on international sanctions, we identify a list of scope conditions for
   conditionality in order to systematically evaluate the institutional
   design and analyze the context of application of the proposed rule of
   law conditionality on EU funds with regard to its expected
   effectiveness. We find that the current proposal would indeed improve
   the speed and likelihood of sanctions compared to existing mechanisms,
   but lacks in the determinacy of conditions and procedures, thus
   undermining its perceived legitimacy and chances of success.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {140-155},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Existing research on the causes of electoral violence has focused on
   structural determinants and election-specific characteristics but has
   paid less attention to the role of political agents that contest
   elections. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationship
   between the organizational strength of political parties and the risk of
   electoral violence. The study argues that strong political parties
   enhance the prospect for peaceful electoral dynamics for two reasons.
   First, having strong party organizations reduce incentives for violent
   electoral manipulation because these organizations enable more
   cost-efficient ways to mobilize voters. Second, strong party
   organizations constrain political actors from deploying electoral
   violence, both at the leadership and grassroot levels. The relationship
   between political party strength and electoral violence is studied by
   combining global data on the overall strength of political parties in
   the polity with data on violence across all national elections from 1946
   to 2010. The statistical analysis accounts for a number of potentially
   confounding variables related to formal political institutions and
   election-specific characteristics. The results point to a statistically
   significant and substantively important association between strong
   political parties and a reduced risk of violent electoral conflict.},

Abstract = {As a politics of time, pre-emption establishes a `messianic'
   relationship between past, present, and future, whereby an indeterminate
   but certain eschatological event is posited and indefinitely postponed.
   This gives reality plasticity while obstructing actual change.
   Pre-emption plays a growing role in environmental politics, building on
   two types of eschatology, catastrophic or regenerative, and two types of
   forces preventing its actualization, technological or natural, relying
   in all cases on state power. To challenge the logic of pre-emption,
   which overturns the traditional role of apocalypticism as radical
   contestation of the socio-ecological order, I consider `inoperosity',
   which does not mean passivity, or political resignation, but a type of
   action that refrains from instrumentalizing the world toward relentless
   achievement and growth. As a concept, inoperosity may help us study
   emergent social mobilizations and orient the revision of core
   institutions, such as science, for the realization of which the
   environmental state is crucial.},

Title = {Between Domestic Learning and External Coercion: Budgeting and Fiscal
   Management Reform in Greece},
Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-26},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The article examines the interplay between external pressure and
   domestic learning through a case-study of Greek budgetary and fiscal
   management reform. Pre-crisis, budgetary management inadequacies were
   not efficiently addressed, mainly due to lack of awareness of problems,
   a low uncertainty environment and a strong political propensity to
   maintain discretionary use of financial resources. In contrast,
   crisis-era bailout conditionality represented a drastic change in the
   environment, increasing uncertainty and encouraging domestic openness to
   reform. The fiscal governance framework was significantly transformed,
   to a point of paradigm change. While there is no doubt regarding the
   impact of external pressure, the analysis highlights certain aspects
   that point to a domestic learning process, though variable in different
   parts of the political-administrative system.},

Abstract = {Since 1989 the European Commission's policy on border regions has slowly
   shifted focus. Current Interreg policy is increasingly focused upon
   innovation and cooperation between SMEs. In this paper we question
   whether this emphasis on firms and innovation neglects the build-up of
   other kinds of activities and institutions antecedent to effective firm
   innovation cooperation. We argue that antecedent developments should
   occur prior to stimulating innovation cooperation between firms,
   highlighting that building effective environments for regional
   innovation in cross-border regions encompasses four qualitatively
   different micro scale phases of development, each requiring
   qualitatively different policy measures. This four-phase model is
   applied to a case study of a Dutch-Flemish Interreg programme, using
   documentary material, a policy-maker survey and a documentary analysis
   of funded projects to explore incoherences between strategy and reality.
   We highlight a gap between the strategy's strong ex ante focus upon
   innovation, policy-maker perceptions of necessary improvements, and the
   projects selected for funding.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the literature on protracted
   conflicts and more specifically on the characteristics of such
   conflicts, as they create a fertile ground for the development of the
   alternative modes of securitization examined in the book, namely the
   routinized, institutionalized, horizontal and bottom-up securitization.
   Particular attention is given to the psychological investments of the
   conflict parties and how it affects the social context in which
   securitization and audiences interact, construct and deconstruct
   conflict-perpetuating routines.},

Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {299-320},
Abstract = {Children of prisoners are often negatively affected by their parents'
   incarceration, which raises issues of justice. A common view is that the
   many negative effects associated with parental imprisonment are unjust,
   simply because children of prisoners are impermissibly harmed or
   unjustly punished by their parents' incarceration. We argue that
   proposals of this kind have problems with accounting for cases where it
   is intuitive that prison might create social injustices for children of
   prisoners. Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the question of
   whether children of prisoners are impermissibly harmed, we should ask
   whether the inequalities that these children endure because of their
   parent's incarceration are objectionable from a social justice
   perspective. To answer this latter question, we examine the negative
   effects associated with parental imprisonment from the perspective of
   luck egalitarianism. We develop a luck egalitarian account that
   incorporates insights from the philosophy of childhood. On our account,
   children of prisoners might endure two different types of objectionable
   inequalities, since they are often deprived of resources that are
   important for ensuring fair equality of opportunity in adulthood, but
   also because they are likely to suffer inequalities in terms of
   childhood welfare. After defending this account, we explore its
   implications for policy.},

Abstract = {Scholars think that friendly nations adopt secrecy to avoid domestic
   costs and facilitate cooperation. But this article uncovers a historical
   puzzle. Between 1870 and 1916, over 80 percent of alliance ties were
   partially or completely covert. Otherwise, hidden pacts are rare. Why
   was secrecy prevalent in this particular period and not others? This
   article presents a theory of ``portfolio consistency.{''} Public
   agreements undermine the rank of hidden alliances. A partner willing to
   openly commit to another country but not to you signals the increased
   importance of this other relationship. States pressure their covert
   partners to avoid subsequent public pacts. This creates a network
   effect: the more secret partners a state has, the greater the incentives
   to maintain secrecy in later military agreements. Covert alliances have
   a cumulative effect. In seeking the flexibility of hidden partnerships,
   states can lock themselves into a rigid adherence to secrecy.},

Abstract = {Policy design has returned to the centre of discussions of public
   policy, both for academics and practitioners. With that interest in
   policy design has come an interest in organisations and institutions
   that will do the designing, with much of the interest being in
   structures such as policy laboratories that attempt to foster
   innovation. These organisations tend to exist outside government
   hierarchies and support collaborative designing with stakeholders and
   citizens. This paper examines the potential of these structures from an
   organisational perspective. Although they do offer great promise as
   sources of innovation they also confront a number of institutional
   barriers and dilemmas. This paper focuses on those barriers and
   dilemmas, as well as some possible means of overcoming them.},

Abstract = {Outlining the mental life of foreign policy decision makers is fraught
   with challenges. In this article, it is argued that studies of political
   psychology may supplement foreign policy analysis by revealing
   undetected causal variables and by giving available interpretations
   improved micro-level accuracy. The methodological viability of the
   presented arguments is illustrated through a confined examination of how
   the psychological mechanism of conformism contributed to deficient
   sharing of views among members of the Bush-administration in the wake of
   9/11. The illustration is backed by principal arguments.},

Title = {Contra Externalisation: Analogies between Anarchism and Mysticism},
Booktitle = {ESSAYS IN ANARCHISM AND RELIGION, VOL. III},
Series = {Stockholm Studies in Comparative Religion},

Abstract = {In her classic work The Silent Cry, Dorothee Solle referred to mysticism
   as ``the antiauthoritarian religion per se{''} (Solle 2001: 36),
   suggesting an analogy between mysticism and anarchism. In this essay we
   explore this analogy by first discussing the mystical experience as a
   `stepping out', as ekstasis, whereby the `I' leaves itself as the being
   defined by the commotion of the world, achieving an at-one-ment with
   itself. The `stepping out' of the mystic enables a mode of being marked
   by being `present in relation', which contrasts sharply with the
   practices of `externalisation' that outsource agency and surrender
   self-direction. Drawing on Plato's critique of politics in the Republic,
   we identify `externalisation' as the very essence of political life.
   Among modern philosophers, Rousseau is the foremost analyst of
   `externalisation', and he provides the link to the radical reformers and
   anarchists who followed him. It is thus in the rejection of
   `externalisation' that mysticism and anarchism converge, and accordingly
   we suggest that they occupy analogous positions within their respective
   fields of political theory and theology. How these ideas work together
   is most clearly illustrated in the life and work of Gustav Landauer,
   whose encounter with Meister Eckhart's sermons was formative for his
   mystic anarchism and the concomitant rejection of politics as encrusted
   `externalisation'. The parallel discussion of mysticism and anarchism
   shows that, even if articulated in secular or even atheist terms, and to
   the extent that it advocates the overcoming of externalising practices,
   anarchism has at its core a spiritual concern.},

   budgeted public expenditure and the amounts actually spent by state

   present evidence about this gap for the period 2003-2016, and to use a
   panel corrected standard errors analysis to determine if vertical
   alignment of political parties has an impact on their behavior. The
   results show that the difference between what is budgeted and what is
   spent is a common practice, particularly in the form of overspends, and
   in contexts of vertically divided government this amount tends to be
   higher.},

   explores the role of stakeholders in post-conflict peacebuilding in

   Assessing PREVENT in the UK},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {851-873},
Abstract = {The `suspect community' thesis has been a primary tool for exploring
   counter-terrorism strategies like the UK's PREVENT and their effect on
   communities. However, in seeking to shed light on the differentialist,
   complex nature of modern counter-terrorism, it was recently redesigned
   by Ragazzi as the `suspect category' thesis. This article engages with
   this thesis' concept of distinguished `risky' and `trusted' suspect
   categories defining PREVENTS counter-terrorism engagement with Muslim
   communities. With the author's own reservations about this thesis, this
   article also explores this important concept to critically assess
   PREVENT as a counter-terrorism strategy. Principally, it provides an
   exploration of PREVENT's construction of risky and trusted suspect
   categories and their potential for fostering alienation, as well as a
   reflection on the effects of alienation on counterterrorism. These
   discussions prove that PREVENT fosters alienation that is detrimental to
   counter-terrorism efforts. Damaging constructions as such not only make
   PREVENT redundant, but are also emblematic of Jackson's theory of the
   epistemological crisis of counterterrorism, as this article will
   discuss. Recommendations regarding rethinking the conceptual basis for
   PREVENT will be also made with a specific emphasis on addressing the
   epistemological crisis of counter-terrorism.},

Abstract = {Typologies of terrorist attacks enable researchers to analyze the
   complex phenomenon of terrorism in an organized manner, while
   facilitating the formulation of effective counter-terrorism policies.
   This paper contributes to the literature on typologies of terrorism by
   proposing a new conceptual model which classifies the various terrorist
   attacks that take place around the world according to two axes of
   reference: (1) the extent to which a terrorist organization is involved
   in the attack, and (2) The nature of interaction of the attacker/s with
   others. By placing the properties of various attacks on both axes, this
   article presents a new methodology that creates a typology of 32
   different profiles of terrorist attacks, which can be grouped into 15
   prototypes. The proposed model facilitates the examination of different
   types of terrorist attacks, while opening up new avenues of research.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the status of governance
   and administration in Sri Lanka in light of current crises and the
   impact on the quality of governance. Design/methodology/approach The
   mixed method approach is employed to explore the problem based on
   secondary data and results from two major surveys. Findings This paper
   shows political and administrative commitment and quality of governance
   are two basic ingredients for rapid development and fighting
   administrative malpractices. Sri Lanka's system of governance is a
   mixture of paternalism and alliance developed through political dynasty,
   kinship, ethnicity, caste, religion, and elitism. Originality/value This
   study fills the research gap as few studies have examined the recent
   crises of Sri Lanka's governance and the impacts on governance quality.
   Policy implications Only by implementing administrative and policy
   reforms will not improve governance quality in the absence of strong
   political and bureaucratic commitment. Moreover, global anti-corruption
   measures are unlikely to work in the Sri Lankan context.},

Abstract = {The climate emergency demands that principles and practices of justice
   and injustice, harm, loss, suffering, and hope are revisited, to
   encompass both the human and the natural world and the many
   interconnections between them. Following work on the Unknown Other in
   climate justice discourse, I examine a relational space of proximity,
   empathy, and responsibility across human and non-human Others to advance
   current understandings of multispecies justice. Via four types of
   encounters - the visual, the embodied, the ethical, and the political -
   it is possible to engage in empathetic experiences with and enact
   responsibility toward infinite other beings and confront layers of
   shared vulnerabilities and histories of silencing and erasures. These
   encounters across space and time make tangible what a nature of human
   and more-than-human togetherness and solidarity may look like and what
   ethics and politics would be required to overcome untenable human
   exceptionalism in today's crises.},

Abstract = {Soft power debate has not analytically moved beyond the questions of
   whether soft power matters and of whether soft power can work
   independent of hard power since Nye's initial formulation. Furthermore,
   the question of how a state selects the source(s) of its soft power
   remains silent in the literature. This neglect leads to the
   underspecification of the nature and content of a given state's soft
   power policy. In this article, we fill in these gaps by recasting the
   conventional understanding of soft power conceptually and analytically.
   Conceptually, we make the case that soft power should be understood as a
   form of productive power for its conceptual and analytical distinction.
   On the basis of this reformulation, we specify an analytical framework
   that helps map out how a state determines the sources of its soft power.
   The crux of the framework is the notion of `dual process' of
   international recognition and domestic self-identification mutually
   informing and reinforcing each other for the identification of a
   specific source of a given state's soft power. We illustrate the
   analytical framework with an empirical example of South Korea's launch
   and consolidation of its new ODA policy, Knowledge Sharing Program.},

   Militias},

Abstract = {Researchers have identified naming and shaming as a strategy used by the
   international community to reprimand state leaders for their repressive
   actions. Previous research indicates that there is variation in the
   success of this tactic. One reason for the heterogeneity in success is
   that leaders with an interest in repressing opposition but avoiding
   international condemnation have adapted their behavior, at least
   partially, to avoid naming and shaming. For instance, some states choose
   to create and utilize alternative security apparatuses, such as
   pro-government militias (PGMs), to carry out these repressive acts.
   Creating or aligning with PGMs allows leaders to distance themselves
   from the execution of violence while reaping the rewards of repression.
   This analysis explores this dynamic. In particular, I examine how naming
   and shaming by Amnesty International and the United Nations Commission
   on Human Rights influences the creation of PGMs to skirt future
   international condemnation by the offending state for all states from
   1986 to 2000. I find that countries are more likely to create PGMs,
   especially informal PGMs, after their human rights abuses have been put
   in the spotlight by the international community.},

Abstract = {Much of the existing literature on the gender gap in support for war has
   focused on average differences between men and women. Little research
   has focused on variations in men's and women's support due to differing
   aspects of the situational context, such as regime change, economic
   interests, threat of terrorism, or humanitarian crisis. Previous
   research has suggested that gender differences are reduced when the
   objective of a military intervention is to promote human rights and stop
   a humanitarian crisis (Brooks and Valentino 2011; Eichenberg 2016,
   2017), but the underlying reason for this finding remains elusive. In
   this article, I seek precisely such an explanation-values. Using
   original data from an experiment, I find that different values, such as
   militaristic and humanitarian values, mediate the gender gap, depending
   on the reason for intervention. These results add to the accumulation of
   knowledge on foreign policy attitudes, the gender gap, and values.},

Title = {Theorizing institutional change and governance in European responses to
   the Covid-19 pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Volume = {42},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1177-1193},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {After initial responses that appeared to be a disappointing replay of
   previous crises, EU governance in the Covid-19 crisis may very well
   result in paradigmatic change toward deeper European integration in some
   areas, incremental change in others, or even reversal toward
   dis-integration in yet others. It is therefore important to evaluate
   what changed in terms of policies and who governed in what ways during
   the pandemic. This concluding article does so by building on the other
   articles in this SI. It first sheds light on policy change during the
   crisis using a historical institutionalist framework, then on governance
   by asking which EU actors, intergovernmental or supranational, drove
   integration and how, using rational choice and discursive
   institutionalist frameworks. Finally, it also considers the effects of
   post-functionalist politicization to elucidate the more positive
   dynamics of interaction among EU actors during the pandemic, in contrast
   to the Eurozone.},

Abstract = {This explorative study presents some theoretical reflections on the
   influence that family may exert in the context of Islamist
   radicalization. In doing so, a new preliminary framework consisting of
   four levels of analysis is introduced and its relevance illustrated
   using examples from the Palestinian, Indonesian, Chechen and, more
   broadly, Western context. If sufficiently adaptive, the proposed
   framework may not only raise the analyst's awareness of the ``bigger
   picture{''} in which family's influence on radicalization should be
   investigated. It can also serve as a useful analytical model to uncover
   certain trends and characteristics of family's attitudes toward
   terrorism in specific contexts, rendering the framework valuable from
   both a theoretical and practical analysis.},

Abstract = {Some use the model of independent central banks to posit that
   independent Debt Management Offices (DMOs) can enhance public debt
   sustainability. This study argues this is unlikely in developing
   countries. Developing country DMOs have limited space to apolitically
   manage (a) debt levels and (b) borrowing strategies. A comparison of
   South Africa and Botswana, using in-depth interviews and primary
   sources, traces public debt processes to argue DMOs are unlikely to
   significantly affect the link between political interests and these two
   key public debt outcomes over time. This argument has three
   implications. First, it gives rise to questions about the role of
   institutions in the governance of public debt. Second, it adds to recent
   literature on developing country external borrowing preferences by
   highlighting ideological effects. Third, it reinforces the idea that
   political economy theories of the relationship between interests,
   institutions, and policy outcomes should vary by policy area and
   national income level.},

Abstract = {The regulatory state that developed in Britain and elsewhere in the
   1980s and 1990s was characterised by independent agencies,
   efficiency-based objectives, `econocratic' analysis, and an emphasis on
   output- and outcome-based legitimacy. Yet, with economic regulation
   becoming increasingly politicised, the `responsible' regulatory state
   has come under pressure. How have British regulators adapted to these
   changes? Building primarily on interviews with regulators, we find that
   the regulatory state has become more responsive to broader political and
   public concerns. Key responsible features have been maintained, but new
   responsive layers have been added, contributing to a broadening of
   decision-making and conceptions of regulation, a greater role for
   communication and outward-oriented activities, and a widening of
   stakeholder engagement and accountability. Though supporting theories of
   organisational reputation and survival, the (ongoing) changes raise new
   questions about how much `political space' independent economic
   regulators can feasibly and legitimately occupy.},

Abstract = {Like many public service workers, politicians must manage the emotions
   of others as well as themselves in order to facilitate cooperation or
   goal accomplishment. Coined by Arlie Hochschild, this type of work is
   known as emotional labour. This article analyses a unique data set on
   the emotional labour and occupational wellbeing of over 500 elected
   politicians in the United Kingdom to understand how this important
   feature of public service plays out in political office. On one hand,
   all three facets of emotional labour (emotion work, personal efficacy,
   and false-face acting) are found to be prevalent among elected
   politicians, with self-reported levels of emotional labour differing
   among men and women. On the other hand, emotion work and personal
   efficacy appear to improve job satisfaction and occupational pride among
   politicians, but false-face acting increases symptoms of occupational
   burnout. These findings raise important questions about the nature of
   political institutions and the sustainability of political work.},

Abstract = {This article constructs a grounded framework to study how corruption is
   consolidated in local governments. We focus on the fine-grained texture
   of corrupt practices that can only be achieved by looking at rich
   contextual studies. We argue that neglecting the way corruption becomes
   the `rule of the game' has led to the creation of anti-corruption
   policies that tend to be overly reliant on formal institutions,
   addressing only dyadic and venal types of corruption, and have therefore
   proven ineffective. Based on a two-staged, mixed methods research
   design-including 50 in-depth interviews in two Mexican cities and three
   surveys applied to citizens and public officials-this article's
   framework focuses on how networks are shaped and organized to perform
   corrupt practices, and how opacity and weak checks and balances grant
   them impunity. Results show corrupt schemes to be outstandingly
   malleable and resilient, able to circumvent formal anti-corruption
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The Euro crisis has produced a plethora of new institutions, policies,
   and projects to reform the Euro Area. This paper offers a theoretical
   and empirical contribution in the study of the New Economic Governance.
   By building on insights from classical Neofunctionalism and Liberal
   Intergovernmentalism, the paper revisits the static component of
   Philippe Schmitter's `Neo-Neofunctionalist' framework. Static
   Neo-Neofunctionalism is then applied as a means to provide a systemic
   interpretation of crisis-led integration in the Euro crisis. The large
   majority of episodes of crisis-led integration in the 2011-2016 years is
   included in the analysis. In assessing Neo-Neofunctionalist expectations
   on the New Economic Governance, the paper matches analysis of legal
   documents with the results of a dedicated Expert Survey on the EMU
   governance fielded in October 2018.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {476-498},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Although important roles in peacebuilding are attributed to civil
   society (CS), few studies have so far analysed how CS actors fare amid
   ongoing war. Our empirical analysis of CS organisations in Yemen shows
   that their potential for peacebuilding is severely restrained not only
   by the security situation but also by political capture, corruption, and
   problems associated with foreign support. Our findings have implications
   for theories on CS and peacebuilding, which need to be adapted to messy
   realities in which boundaries between the state and non-state, civil and
   uncivil, and domestic and international domains are blurred. They also
   offer food for thought to peacebuilding donors, whose funds have
   inadvertently become encapsulated into a highly problematic political
   dynamic. However, the study shows that not all types of organisations
   are equally affected by political capture. Grassroots and new activist
   organisations, it argues, deserve more academic and policy attention as
   ways out of the Yemeni quagmire are sought.},

Abstract = {Governments worldwide have sought to introduce greater choice and
   competition as mechanisms to improve the quality of education provision
   and outcomes. However, there is considerable cross-national variation in
   education policy, particularly regarding the role of local government.
   To explain such differences, this article focuses on recent reforms in
   compulsory education in England and Sweden. It shows that although
   governments in both countries have advocated choice, competition and
   participation, education reform has led to the centralisation of school
   governance in England but decentralisation in Sweden. Drawing on the
   concept of `scalecraft' as a specific form of `statecraft', it argues
   that these differences in the rescaling of education policy reflect
   different conceptions of central-local relations and the role of local
   government. More broadly, the article shows how national governments
   strategically use scalar reorganisation (scalecraft) to support broader
   political goals (statecraft), contributing to a better understanding of
   the spatial dimensions of public policy reform.},

Abstract = {One of the legal forms of action to be applied by a commune for the care
   of homeless animals is to develop and implement homeless animal care
   programmes and prevent animal homelessness. The whole regulations
   examined below clearly demonstrate that the commune carries out its
   duties as mentioned above, cooperating with registered and legally
   operating animal shelters. Derogations from this principle may be
   regarded as the unlawful fulfilment of commune's own tasks, which is the
   subject of an audit by the State Veterinary Inspectorate or the
   voivodeship governor. However, it may be difficult to make a clear
   identification of the legal nature of homeless animal care programmes
   and animal homelessness prevention as acts of local law or planning acts
   as internal law acts. The views of scholars and case-law on this issue
   are not uniform.},

Abstract = {In an era defined by shifting distributions of power, states are not
   only pushing for change in formal international organizations, they are
   increasingly using informal intergovernmental organizations (IIGOs) to
   mediate change. Why and how do states use IIGOs - institutions without a
   treaty or secretariat - to manage global power shifts? IIGOs are useful
   for states on both sides of the power shift. Established powers use
   IIGOs for system management through `collaboration' and strengthening
   the `hegemonic consensus' to preserve their institutional privileges
   while adapting to changing power realities. Rising powers use IIGOs to
   redistribute through `power bargaining' and `rhetorical coercion' to
   strengthen their institutional roles without overly disrupting the
   current order. Established and rising powers also work together to use
   IIGOs for integrative strategies including `cooptation' and `principled
   persuasion', creating a mutually beneficial solution that accommodates
   both increased demands but also mounting responsibilities. IIGOs help
   states manage power transitions by providing flexible institutional
   arrangements that facilitate bargaining without freezing outcomes in
   permanent institutions while the power distribution evolves. We provide
   case vignettes of the G7 (system management) in the early phase of a
   power shift, BRICS (redistributive strategies) in the middle phase, and
   the G20 (integrative strategies) in the later phase.},

Abstract = {Contemporary extensions of Leon Trotsky's argument have seen the
   introduction of uneven and combined development (UCD) into the field of
   International Relations (IR) as a theory that is uniquely able to unite
   sociological and international processes. Yet, despite UCD's historical
   materialist foundation, its contemporary applications have been largely
   abstracted from ecological issues. This presents the theory with a
   problem that it needs to overcome if it wishes to retain explanatory
   relevance in a future of ecological uncertainty and crisis. This paper
   argues that UCD's historical materialist basis includes a distinctly
   ecological dimension, which-if recovered-may enable the theory to make
   sense of contemporary environmental problems and also provide IR with an
   approach that unites international, sociological and ecological factors.
   The argument proceeds in three steps. It begins with an overview of UCD
   and its contemporary omission of ecological processes. To recover the
   theory's deep ecology, it then foregrounds the ecological dimension of
   Karl Marx's historical materialism, showing how an eco-socialist
   analysis reveals the capitalist nature of the ecological crisis.
   Finally, it demonstrates that an enhanced version of UCD-re-grounded in
   this ``ecologized{''} historical materialism-is uniquely able to
   integrate the international into a Marxist socio-natural reading of the
   global ecological crisis.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the driving forces of public endorsement of two
   major intergovernmental organizations-the UN and NATO. More
   specifically, I scrutinize the effects of two sets of independent
   variables on individual support for security intergovernmental
   organizations: respondents' subjective evaluation of the domestic
   economic conditions and the gap between the home country's foreign
   policy preferences and the mean preference within the said
   intergovernmental organization. For the empirical analysis, I employ
   cross-sectional survey data acquired from Pew Global Attitudes Surveys
   covering a sample of 37 countries and 10 waves spanning 2007-2017. The
   statistical analyses lend strong support for both hypotheses.
   Specifically, citizens who are dissatisfied with the national economic
   conditions are less likely to be in favor of intergovernmental
   organizations. The negative correlation between the perceptions of
   domestic economic performance and attitudes toward intergovernmental
   organizations is particularly compelling in countries that contribute
   more to the budget of that intergovernmental organization. Second, in
   countries where the foreign policy preferences converge with the other
   members of an intergovernmental organization, public opinion is more
   favorably disposed toward that intergovernmental organization.},

Abstract = {Taking as reference a cost-benefit analysis of cyberterrorism published
   in 2004 by Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, this article briefly
   reviews what happened in the last 15 years in cyberterrorism research,
   what was correctly forecast, what was wrong and what may happen in the
   future. Some of the analyses published in during this period have been
   accurate, indicating that terrorists would use the Web and then social
   media for supporting operations in financing, recruiting and, especially
   ``propaganda{''} (information operations), instead of wasting resources
   in ineffectual cyberattacks against critical infrastructures. The same
   analyses, however, did not appreciate enough how successful information
   operations by terrorist groups would have been. Overall, the approach,
   research methods, findings and forecasting have been quite valid and
   fruitful and thus they can represent a solid foundation on which
   scholars of (cyber)terrorism may base their future research.},

Abstract = {Using document analysis and fieldwork to analyse the issue of fairness
   in the implementation of China's environmental and climate policy goals,
   we examine two top-down mechanisms put in place to steer implementation:
   binding environmental targets that have been allocated on different
   administrative levels since the 11(th)Five-Year Plan in 2011; and
   central environmental inspections, which have been rolled out across the
   country since 2016. The evidence shows that the way in which both
   mechanisms have assigned responsibilities among localities is, by and
   large, inequitable. This inequity stems from not only insufficient
   differentiation based on economic and capacity criteria but also a
   discretionary approach to enforcement. These structural implementation
   defects affect the legitimacy of environmental planning and incentivise
   disgruntled local officials to either resort to drastic, costly and
   unfair measures to satisfy upper-level demands or to fake performance,
   thus undermining the sustainability of environmental protection and
   transition efforts.},

Abstract = {The study examines Czech-China relations in the 2010s within the
   theoretical framework of relationalism, through the prism of which Czech
   ruling and financial elites have been trying to gain economic benefits
   from the partnership with China. These efforts are examined on several,
   often overlapping, levels, including elite, national and local. On the
   other side of the relational spectrum, in the process of improving ties
   with the Czech ruling elites, Prague was selected as the center of
   European operations of the powerful-at least until recently-CEFC China
   Energy conglomerate. This nominally private company, now taken over by
   the state-owned CITIC, attributed its operations not only to economic
   benefits but also as intended to strengthen friendly relations between
   the two countries: that is, as part of China's economic statecraft.
   Therefore, the practice and effects of the Czech efforts are examined in
   the relational context of Beijing's attempts to secure the support of
   the Czech ruling elites for China's core interests: Tibet, Taiwan, and
   (implicitly) Huawei.},

Abstract = {This article discusses political state capture in the context of party
   patronage. Evidence of this is delivered from state-owned enterprises
   (SOEs) and the rotations of members of their management and supervisory
   boards. In this case, it is deemed that an interest group, which
   consists of politicians and representatives in the government
   administration, decides about the appointment and dismissal of board
   members through the corporate governance of SOEs and ownership policy of
   the state. We analyzed the scale and intensity of rotations in Poland of
   about twelve thousand joint-stock companies in the years 2001-2017
   according to their ownership structure. We show that changes of managers
   and supervisory board members in state-owned enterprises are higher than
   in private companies and are related to political elections. We
   estimated that on average three months after a new government is formed,
   a peak of changes in the composition of boards is observed, though they
   are earlier in the case of a supervisory board. We conclude that this
   can be regarded as an example of state capture by politicians.},

Abstract = {While there is a large literature on attitudes toward immigrants,
   scholars have not systematically examined the determinants of attitudes
   toward refugees. Often, refugees are simply treated as a subset of
   immigrants, under the assumption that attitudes toward both sets of
   foreigners are similar. In this article, we examine whether there are
   distinctions between attitudes toward refugees and immigrants, as well
   as variation in their determinants. We address these questions using
   individual-level data from 16 countries in the 2002 and 2014 waves of
   the European Social Survey. We demonstrate that these two groups of
   foreigners are, indeed, viewed as distinct and that differences emerge
   because attitudes toward refugees are more often related to macro-level
   factors while immigrants are more frequently associated with micro-level
   economic concerns. By distinguishing between refugees and immigrants,
   this article addresses an important gap in the academic literature on
   attitudes toward foreigners in Europe.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to the literature on how
   stratification affects professions. Our case study is the `first teacher
   reform' in Sweden, which introduced a more prominent position for some
   teachers. In this article, we elaborate six different first teacher
   types and analyse how these affect the profession. While elites are
   generally described as hybrids, we conclude that several of our types
   rather led to a de-hybridization of roles, where managers became more
   administratively focused, and elites more anchored to professional
   tasks. We conclude that elite roles reveal various potentials in being
   strengthening/weakening or shattering/integrating to the profession,
   but, in contrast to other studies on professional elites, the majority
   of roles studied here are both strengthening and integrating to the
   profession. The study is qualitative and is based on 111 interviews, 12
   weeks of shadowing and 53 observed meetings.},

Title = {Improving the performance of public organizations: Financial resources

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Abstract = {The link between expenditures and organizational performance is central
   to our understanding of public sector governance. Despite various
   empirical and theoretical accounts of how organizations buffer or
   exploit financial situations to stabilize outcomes, the literature
   remains split on how money influences organizational performance. This
   study sheds new light on this puzzle by developing an analysis of
   clientele contexts, and how such contexts intervene in the relationship
   between expenditure and performance. We analyse competing hypotheses for
   the heterogeneous effects of clientele contexts on funding and
   performance-one in which these contexts strengthen the relationship, and
   one in which they weaken the relationship. Through district-level
   empirical analyses of public education data over a 17-year period, we
   find that instructional spending changes influence student performance,
   and that the impact is conditioned by the socioeconomic mix of students.
   Organizations that serve low-income communities see the greatest
   performance gains from increased monetary resources.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Rituals are customarily muted into predictable routines aimed to
   stabilise social orders and limit conflict. As a result, their magic
   lure recedes into the background, and the unexpected and disruptive
   elements are downplayed. Our collaborative contribution counters this
   move by foregrounding rituals of world politics as social practices with
   notable disordering effects. We engage a series of `world pictures' to
   show the worlding and disruptive work enacted in rituals designed to
   sustain the sovereign exercise of violence and war, here colonial
   treatymaking, state commemoration, military/service dog training,
   cyber-security podcasts, algorithmically generated maps, the visit of
   Prince Harry to a joint NATO exercise and border ceremonies in India,
   respectively. We do so highlighting rituals' immanent potential for
   disruption of existing orders, the fissures, failures and unforeseen
   repercussions. Reappraising the disordering role of ritual practices
   sheds light on the place of rituals in rearticulating the boundaries of
   the political. Rituals can generate dissensus and re-divisions of the
   sensible rather than only impose a consensus by policing the boundaries
   of the political, as Ranciere might phrase it. Our images are essential
   to the account. They help disinterring the fundamentals and ambiguities
   of the current worldings of security, capturing the affective atmosphere
   of rituals.},

Abstract = {How do the perceived motives of donor states shape recipient attitudes
   toward foreign aid in a conflict zone? This research note evaluates the
   impact of two frames that characterize the motives of foreign powers
   involved in a civil conflict in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
   These frames portray foreign actors as providing aid either to alleviate
   suffering during conflict (humanitarian frame) or to increase their
   power and influence in the recipient country (political influence
   frame). We demonstrate how framing impacts attitudes toward foreign
   assistance from the European Union and the Russian government among
   potential aid recipients in the Donbas. The results show that frames
   impact support for foreign aid from the European Union but have no
   effect on views of Russian aid. Counter to conventional expectations,
   aid provided for geopolitical, strategic reasons may be viewed as a
   positive, stabilizing force-even more than foreign aid provided for
   humanitarian reasons.},

Abstract = {Why do native citizens of the Middle East and North Africa express
   greater opposition to certain types of migrants, refugees, and displaced
   persons? Why, particularly, do they express greater opposition to
   sub-Saharan African migrants? This article investigates these questions,
   leveraging results from an original, nationally representative survey of
   2700 native Moroccan citizens. We find support for traditional theories,
   mostly developed from studies of Western Europe, that hypothesize that
   the perceived cultural, economic, and security threats migrants pose
   provoke citizen opposition to certain migrant subtypes. Diverging from
   past research, however, we argue that the importance of these threats
   waxes and wanes dramatically at the subnational level due to variation
   in community-level postmaterialism. In areas where economic development
   is high, and many citizens live in European-style conditions,
   postmaterialism-preoccupation with cultural, identity, and
   security-based concerns-helps to predict greater citizen opposition to
   sub-Saharan African migrants. However, in areas where economic
   development is low, and many citizens do not live like Europeans, this
   greater opposition to African migrants derives from economic concerns,
   notably job competition. While postmaterialism is considered an
   individual-level phenomenon, our work highlights its importance at the
   community level: The personal circumstances of citizens and the
   circumstances of the community in which they live interact to condition
   which perceived threats become more (or less) important to explaining
   anti-migrant attitudes.},

Abstract = {Rising from the margins of EU aid documents, resilience became
   acentrepieceof the 2016 EU Global Security Strategy, especially in
   relation to the neighbourhood. While new resilience-thinking may signify
   another paradigmatic shift in EUmodus operandi, the question that
   emerges is whether it iscriticalenough to renderEU governance a new
   turn,to make it sustainable? This article argues that in order for
   resilience-framed governance to become more effective, the EU needs not
   just engage with `the local' by way of externally enabling their
   communal capacity. More crucially, the EU needs to
   understandresilienceforwhat it is-a self-governing project-to allow `the
   local' an opportunity to grow their own critical infrastructures and
   collective agency, in their pursuit of `good life'. Is the EU ready for
   this new thinking, and not just rhetorically or even methodologically
   when creating new instruments and subjectivities? The bigger question is
   whether the EU is prepared tocritically turn the corner of its
   neoliberal agendato accommodate emergent collective rationalities of
   self-governance as a key to make its peace-building project more
   successful.},

Abstract = {The events of Arab Spring that swept across the Middle East have altered
   the face of domestic politics within Arab states, spurring a rise in
   Shia/Sunni sectarianism across the region. Yet, to view sectarianism as
   an inevitable outcome ignores the fact that both factions have lived
   together peacefully in the past. This article employs securitisation to
   interrogate the construction of Shi'ism as a societal threat in Saudi
   Arabia. It addresses two questions: first, what empirical insight can
   the framework provide regarding the religious securitisation of Shi'ism
   by Saudi Arabia? Next, what are the implications of the securitisation
   discourse on the Shi'a minority and the wider Saudi society?
   Theoretically, this article engages with contemporary debates concerning
   Eurocentric aspects of securitisation and the concept of religious
   securitisation. Empirically, it argues that the Saudi state has
   instrumentally securitised Shi'ism to curb the perceived threat from
   Iran. Crucially, it analyses how the securitisation discourse has
   justified institutionalised discrimination against the Shi'a minority,
   and shows how this has unleashed centrifugal trajectories that undermine
   societal stability. This has unfolded in an empirical cycle of violence,
   as Sunni citizens become normalised to violence against the Shi'a,
   spurring the minority to mount an increasingly violent campaign of
   resistance.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the potential contribution to the concept of
   backlash in social movement studies. If we consider backlash politics as
   characterised by the convergence of an intensified organisational
   networking, increased capacity for collective actions and aggressive
   framing by retrograde actors (including movements), social movement
   studies might provide (a) theoretical suggestions to embed the analysis
   in an established sets of concepts and hypotheses on the development of
   contentious politics, of which backlash politics is a type and (b)
   empirical knowledge on a specific form of retrograde movements, those
   related to the radical right. Building upon some established concepts in
   social movement studies, I will address the identity framing,
   organisational resources and contextual opportunities for backlash
   politics.},

Abstract = {One of the most important features of the multi-level governance
   research programme is the parallel conceptualisation of the vertical and
   the horizontal relationships within multi-level governance systems.
   Different systems of multi-level governance are characterised by the
   relationships between political institutions on the same level (Are
   there many task-specific organisations?) and by the relationship between
   different levels (On which level do we see political communities?). By
   conceptualising scale and community in a substitutive way as Hooghe and
   Marks in tendency do, some of the potentials are lost. I put forward the
   suggestion that treating the two dimensions as independent would allow
   for an even fuller picture of the dynamics of politics in multi-level
   governance systems.},

Abstract = {We analyze the economic performance of countries after a multi-decade
   political ruler, defined as having been in office 20 or more years,
   loses power. For 37 countries experiencing such an end-of-reign event in
   the period 1971-2005, we use an event study approach to compare growth
   in the decade following the event with growth in pre-event periods. The
   results show that event countries have below average growth in the year
   a long-term political leader leaves office and that cumulative growth in
   the ensuing decade at best matches and at worst falls significantly
   short of pre-event growth levels. Growth contractions are no different
   following irregular transitions than after regular transitions,
   suggesting our results are not explained by inadvertent post-reign
   turmoil. Our results instead suggest that post-event contractions may be
   shaped by deliberate efforts by long-term leaders to concentrate power
   while in office and poison the post-reign economic or political
   environment.},

Abstract = {The article provides a framework for understanding the historical
   trajectory of China's rise and its impact on the conventional
   stratification of the capitalist world-economy of the core,
   semi-periphery and periphery. Inspired by World-System Theory, the
   author analyses the process through which China's global economic rise
   is challenging the status quo of the world-economy's established
   structure. In other words, China's economic rise is modifying the
   `classical' stratification of the world economic zones as conceptualised
   by World-System Theory in terms of the core, semi-peripheral and
   peripheral relationships and in terms of the composition and
   proportional size of the three economic zones. As a result, the
   conventional stratification of a small core, a scattered larger
   semi-periphery and a vast periphery is being altered. The article goes
   through China's different positions in the world's economic
   stratification during different periods, and concludes that the global
   transformations led by China's economic rise is leading the world
   towards a regional and global re-division of labour, which is exerting a
   great deal of impact on both the Global North and the Global South in
   terms of opportunities and challenges.},

Abstract = {The improvement of Natural Resource Governance systems plays a crucial
   role in the building of an ecological civilization in the new era. This
   study looked into the three major objects and elements of Natural
   Resource Governance, namely natural resources and the supervision of
   natural resources, ecology and ecological protection, and environment
   and environmental governance. It identified two sets of logical
   relationship lines: `carrier supervision and product supervision' and
   `prevention beforehand and remedy afterward.' The logical relations
   between the three elements are as follows: (1) the coordinated
   expression and legal basis are different for the three elements; (2) the
   supervision of natural resources and ecological protection are similar
   in terms of management essence, object scope, and behavioral
   orientation; (3) the supervision of natural resources and environmental
   governance have different focal points with regard to management
   connotation, object scope, behavioral orientation, and technical
   measures; and (4) in the specific regulatory process, constructive
   ecological protection is similar to pollution control.},

Title = {Is `Health in All Policies' everybody's responsibility? Discourses of
   multistakeholderism and the lifestyle drift phenomenon},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-246},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {In relation to health promotion, the lifestyle drift is a phenomenon
   whereby health policymakers begin with a recognition of the social,
   political and economic determinants of health ('distal' determinants of
   health), only to drift back into designing policies targeted largely at
   modifying individual behavior ('proximal' determinants of health).
   Looking at the `Health in All Policies' (HiAP) agenda in the European
   Commission (EC), this article investigates the discursive construction
   of the lifestyle drift. It starts by analyzing why, in the EC context,
   HiAP is interpreted as inherently about multistakeholder engagement. It
   then draws on the EU Diet Platform as a contrasting example to explore
   the relation between this multistakeholder interpretation and the
   lifestyle drift. The article then unpacks the discursive legitimation of
   the multistakeholder rationale, and shows how multistakeholder
   engagement is presented as a reasonable and normatively neutral way to
   approach public policy problems. Finally, the article critically
   reflects upon the technocratizing effects of the normatively neutral
   language deemed to be required of policy-relevant knowledge.},

Abstract = {Post-Weberian scholarship remains divided between a conception of
   legitimation as an exercise of justification by rulers and legitimation
   as the necessary consent given by the ruled. Going beyond these
   contending approaches, the field now envisions legitimation as an
   interactive process linking the authorities of international and
   regional organizations to various stakeholders. This is a significant
   step forward, but the field has still not taken resolutely the
   ``empirical turn.{''} The paper seeks to fill this void by introducing
   the concept of bi-directional legitimation and proposing a framework for
   research on the material practices of legitimation/delegitimation inside
   regional organizations using the Mercosur as a case study. I analyze the
   practices of regional authorities and civil society organizations at the
   input stage of the legitimation process. The case study illustrates the
   usefulness of the notion of bi-directional legitimation, combined with a
   focus on material practices, for the analysis of the dynamics of
   legitimation.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the special issue by going beyond the
   traditional debates about geopolitics and great power rivalry. Instead,
   it examines the emergent and highly complex world of Central Eurasia, in
   its transformative effort to reorder itself in response to both global
   and local change. In particular, the paper (and the volume) focuses on
   two interrelated themes: one of achanging Russia, that is anxiously
   trying to adapt to the uncertain dynamics within and beyond the wider
   Eurasian space; and the other-of an emerging complexity of new
   order-making regional (integration) initiatives that are poised to
   reshape the future of international and global order. The overarching
   intention of this paper and the volume is to advance the need to focus
   on `the local', to gain a more holistic understanding of the present-day
   challenges and the kind of global response needed to stay attuned to the
   increasingly complex world.},

Abstract = {Research about the religion and environmental attitudes relationship in
   the United States has yielded mixed results. Some studies find that
   religion relates to heightened concern about environmental threats and
   greater environmental interest whereas others find religion relates to
   diminished concern and interest. A new perspective that applies ideas
   from psychology and sociology may help resolve these discrepant
   findings. It is hypothesized that religious meaning reduces concern with
   environmental threats since meaning helps people cope with distressing
   stimuli. This reduction is specific to threats and does not extend to
   environmental interest. Using the 2016 General Social Survey to test
   this hypothesis, after controlling for sociodemographic and political
   variables, structural equation modeling shows Americans who are more
   religious experience diminished sense of danger from environmental
   threats, yet exhibit heightened general environmental interest. These
   findings align with the proposed theory and suggest new ways to promote
   environmentalism and policy change.},

Abstract = {Scholars who study the failure of climate change policy in the United
   States tend to focus on the mechanics of denial and the coordinated
   efforts of political operatives, conservative think tanks, and partisan
   news outlets to cast doubt on what has become overwhelming scientific
   consensus. In contrast, we address a factor that has been understudied
   until now - the role of climate change advocacy in the U.S. Congress.
   Using quantitative text analysis on a corpus of floor speeches published
   in theCongressional Recordbetween 1996 and 2015, we find notable
   differences in the language partisans use. Democrats communicate in ways
   that are message-based, emphasizing the weight of scientific evidence,
   while Republicans tend towards a softer, cue-based narrative based on
   anecdotes and storytelling. We end with a discussion of what climate
   change advocates can hope to accomplish through the `politics of talk,'
   especially in an age of heightened polarization.},

Abstract = {The two decades either side of the global financial crisis have seen a
   remarkable surge and an equally remarkable reaction to global
   inequalities. This has played some part in fuelling the recent populist
   backlash against globalisation. In response, many global institutions
   and some national governments have embraced the concept of inclusive
   growth - proposing a policy agenda designed to share the benefits of
   economic growth and development more equitably. This paper argues that
   the current debate about inclusivity suffers from two major
   misspecifications that weaken the concept and undermine the prospect of
   the economic and political goals it stands for being achieved. For
   inclusivity to be meaningful and sustainable it must be understood in
   multidimensional terms, but attaching it to orthodox thinking on growth
   continually draws the debate back to narrow economic considerations. The
   concept has also been hampered by `methodological nationalism', whereby
   policies for inclusivity are considered predominantly at the national
   level without adequate attention being given to the multilateral
   dimensions of inclusivity in a world of global interdependence. To be
   coherent and applicable, inclusive growth must be (re)conceived
   multilaterally and embrace a more multidimensional notion of
   inclusivedevelopmentthat hinges around a meaningful conception of human
   wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Conflicts over mitigation measures involve processes of contentious
   governance in which governmental and non-governmental players contest
   policies proposed or implemented by other governmental players or their
   business partners. Comparing a case of carbon capture and storage (CCS)
   with that of a nearshore windfarm in the Netherlands, I ask: how did
   local governmental players and their non-governmental allies succeed in
   getting the CCS project in Barendrecht taken off the table, while unable
   to block plans for the nearshore windfarm off the coast of Katwijk,
   Noordwijk and Zandvoort? Focusing on persuasion, I find that rhetorical
   framing based on expertise and `not in my backyard' (NIMBY) escapist
   framing did not make much difference in either case. In the CCS case, a
   process of scaling up procedural critique to the national level led to
   repeal of the plan. A similar process did not happen in the windfarm
   case.},

Title = {The Territorial Contours of Terrorism: A Conceptual Model of Territory
   for Non-state Violence},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1027-1046},

Abstract = {Our article challenges a common discourse that terrorist groups are
   relatively disinterested in territory by exploring emerging theories
   about territory and territoriality. We use these theories to introduce a
   new conceptual model of the importance of territory for terrorism that
   contrasts a group's Sovereignty Claims over Territory (SCOT), which
   corresponds with the ultimate territorial aims of the group, with its
   Effective Control of Territory (ECOT), which relates to the ability of
   an organization to exert influence over a particular territory.
   Contrasting these dimensions of territory allows us to develop several
   archetypes of territorially-motivated terrorism. Our model predicts
   that, in contrast to common deterritorial discourses, truly
   non-territorial terrorism is likely to be quite rare as most groups
   engaged in violence have territorial ambitions in one way or another. We
   then use our model to interrogate the salience of territory to three
   representative cases: the Islamic State, ETA, and FARC-EP. Our analysis
   shows that territory remains a central motivating factor for these
   groups as their overall territorial aims tend to remain constant whereas
   their ability to control territory is more susceptible to change. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of our model and analysis for
   future research.},

Abstract = {We can observe a well-documented decline of trust levels in Western
   societies: from the reputation of political representatives as being
   `not trustworthy' to the rise of anti-system-oriented populist parties.
   Yet the implications of different forms of distrust for a society and
   democratic institutions have been theorized in conflicting ways so far.
   In order to illuminate existing inconsistencies in social and democratic
   theory, this article addresses two research questions: What are the
   implications of different manifestations of distrust for the acceptance
   of democracy and democratic institutions? How do different forms of
   distrust affect the motivation to become engaged in democratic
   decision-making and in civil society institutions? Taking empirical
   evidence from 25 focus groups in Germany, our findings show that growing
   social divisions affect the role distrust plays for political interest
   representation of social groups and for the acceptance of liberal
   representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Italy was the first large epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
   Western world. Since the country has not had any serious experience with
   this kind of disease in recent decades, its response has been indicative
   of a first reaction to an (un)known and (un)expected event. At the same
   time, the Italian experience is an emblematic case of how a lack of
   specific preparedness measures drives a country to deal with this kind
   of crisis through a process in which the existing characteristics of the
   policy and political system, with all their pros and cons, prevail. This
   means that the existing country characteristics that affects policy
   design, state capacity, institutional arrangements and political games
   forge the process and content of the response. Based on this
   observation, this paper analyses the policy dynamics of the first four
   months of management of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, focusing on how
   the health and economic responses were designed and implemented.},

Title = {The `local turn' and notions of conflict and peacebuilding - Reflections
   on local peace committees in Burundi and eastern DR Congo},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-299},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Both political scientists and development practitioners express renewed
   interest in the `local' in peacebuilding, and a need to better engage
   with local communities' concerns, perspectives and capacities.
   Developing scholarship highlights how such discourses essentialise the
   `local', and obscure the role of interveners in its construction. This
   paper argues that thinking in terms of `local' peacebuilding configures
   particular understandings of what conflict and peacebuilding entail. It
   depicts local conflict as something that can be addressed in isolation,
   and neutralises local peacebuilding agendas. Experiences of
   community-based peacebuilding in Burundi and eastern DR Congo instead
   show `local' peacebuilders' pragmatic efforts to move beyond `local'
   conflict, and significant local contestation about the kinds of peace,
   justice and social transformation envisaged. The paper concludes that a
   concern with the `local' in peacebuilding may make interveners gloss
   over important contributions of so-called `local' stakeholders to
   structural peace and state-formation, and so effectively disempower
   them.},

Abstract = {This article scrutinizes two concepts central to the ontological
   security framework, agency and anxiety. Its point of departure is the
   view that conceptions of agency are expressed in the attempt to become
   ontologically secure, which requires a more careful look at how humans
   try to satisfy the need for a `stable sense of Self' by putting in place
   `anxiety controlling mechanisms'. This, in turn, raises the question
   what these mechanisms are supposed to control, which shifts attention to
   the concept of `anxiety'. Going back to Kierkegaard's original treatment
   and Heidegger's existential phenomenology, the article reviews the
   emergence of anxiety as a core feature of the human condition and
   highlights what it calls the `anxiety paradox': the tendency of
   reflexive humans facing the freedom of being in time to attach
   themselves to constructs that provide a sense of temporal continuity, or
   certainty. The article argues that the existing ontological security
   literature is trapped in this paradox and therefore cannot account for
   radical forms of agency.},

   ECONOMY OF THE ESKOM CRISIS},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Number = {476},

Abstract = {This article analyses the causes, outcomes, and political significance
   of the inter-connected operational, financial, and governance crises
   afflicting Eskom, South Africa's electricity parastatal. These crises
   emerged in the context of African National Congress initiatives to turn
   Eskom and other key parastatals into instruments of an envisaged South
   African developmental state, through increased investment and strategic
   procurement to support economic transformation goals. Instead, Eskom's
   spiralling costs, procurement irregularities and inability to translate
   increased investment into functional new infrastructuremeant it impeded
   these goals. Its indebtedness became a severe macro-economic risk,
   making Eskom a precarious nexus for the circulation of public funds,
   while the cost and unreliability of electricity has undermined South
   Africa's energy-intensive industrial core. Intertwined with this were
   multiple high-profile corruption scandals associated with the
   `state-capture' controversies of the latter stages of Jacob Zuma's
   presidency. The article argues that Eskom's extreme dysfunctionality
   results from long-running, and as yet unresolved, contestation of the
   parastatal and electricity policy more broadly by various interest
   groups, in a context of an increasingly fragmented political and
   business elite. This created a range of incoherent distributional
   pressures and institutional constraints. Rather than a straightforward
   outcome of corruption and `state capture', this reflects deeper tensions
   in the post-apartheid political economy.},

Abstract = {Euroscepticism in Spain has so far constituted a marginal phenomenon. A
   decade of political and economic crises could, however, be setting the
   stage for rising Spanish opposition to the European Union (EU). By
   analysing recent survey data and party manifestos, we verify to what
   extent this might be the case. We find that both public and party-based
   euroscepticism has gained ground in the traditionally euro-optimist
   Spanish context over the period under study. We argue, however, that
   such critical stances towards the EU do not constitute a fundamental
   turn against the process of integration in Spain. Rather, the country
   has witnessed the rise of `faulty' euroscepticism rooted in the domestic
   political crisis.},

Abstract = {Governments have long-standing interests in preventing market failures
   and enhancing innovation in strategic industries. Public policy
   regarding domestic technology is critical to both national security and
   economic prosperity. Governments often seek to enhance their global
   competitiveness by promoting private sector cooperative activity at the
   inter-organizational level. Research on network governance has
   illuminated the structure of boundary-spanning collaboration mainly for
   programs with immediate public or nonprofit objectives. Far less
   research has examined how governments might accelerate private sector
   cooperation to prevent market failures or to enhance innovation. The
   theoretical contribution of this research is to suggest that government
   programs might catalyze cooperative activity by accelerating the
   preferential attachment mechanism inherent in social networks. We
   analyze the long-term effects of a government program on the strategic
   alliance network of 451 organizations in the high-tech semiconductor
   industry between 1987 and 1999, using stochastic network analysis
   methods for longitudinal social networks.},

Abstract = {As the debate on whether Hamas should be designated a terrorist
   organization intensifies across Europe and North America, policymakers
   and practitioners seek to identify the core principles that unify the
   group and its ideology. This paper contributes to this discussion by
   examining how Hamas uses Twitter to frame its narrative to
   English-speakers around the world. From March 2015 until November 2019,
   when its account was suspended from Twitter, Hamas operated an
   English-language Twitter handle under the name @HamasInfoEn. Using
   thematic content analysis to explore the first 2,848 tweets sent by
   Hamas in English-between March 2015 and March 2018-this paper explores
   the socio-political and religious narratives that lay at the core of
   Hamas's online public diplomacy throughout its first three years on
   Twitter. Since its entrance into politics in 2006, some academics argue
   that Hamas has increasingly sought to distance itself from acts of
   terrorism and legitimize its actions as a governing actor, thereby
   seeking to carve out a place for itself in the international community.
   This study presents a nuanced understanding of how Hamas represents
   itself internationally, to better understand where the group is going,
   and how to best counter its narratives.},

Abstract = {Recent research has focused on the legacies of civil war violence on
   political preferences, finding that wartime victimization decreases
   support for the perpetrator or its political identity in the long run.
   However, we know little about the conditions under which this effect
   takes place. Historical accounts from civil wars suggest that the
   long-term effect of violence is not homogenous, nor consistent across
   areas within a single conflict. Addressing this gap, this article
   explores the effects of wartime victimization on long-term political
   preferences at the local level, looking at the conditioning effect of
   the local social context. In particular, I argue that the effect of
   wartime violence depends on the existence of local networks that create
   and maintain memories of the violence and capitalize on them for future
   mobilization. This argument is tested in the context of the Spanish
   Civil War. I build a novel dataset using archival data, historical
   secondary sources, and already existing datasets, covering 2,100
   municipalities across Spain. In line with the argument, it is found that
   Francoist wartime victimization during the civil war is linked to an
   increase in leftist vote share after democracy was restored four decades
   later, but mainly in those municipalities where clandestine,
   left-leaning political networks were active after the conflict.},

Abstract = {Does terrorism inhibit a country's ability to attract international
   direct investment? If so, terrorism may have large costs in terms of
   employment losses, macroeconomic instability, and missed development
   opportunities. However, do investors fear terrorism because of direct
   risks to their assets, or because the opportunities in the host country
   deteriorate? And how do they adjust investments? We study the impact of
   terrorism on merger and acquisition decisions of 8,872 firms over 116
   countries over 16 years. The firm-level perspective allows the isolation
   of host-country terrorism from firm-level characteristics such as size
   or experience as an explanation, by comparing decisions for the same
   firm across destinations. It also allows separation of investment
   responses into reductions or entire withholding of investment. A sample
   standard deviation increase in terrorism reduces merger and acquisition
   investment by around 30\%. Firms do not generally reduce the size of
   their investment in the face of terrorism - instead, they decide not to
   enter the country altogether. We find no evidence to suggest that
   multinational firms are more sensitive to attacks on local business
   assets. A country-level analysis, which necessarily does not control for
   firm-level characteristics, yields materially different conclusions.},

Abstract = {Since culture has been considered as a pillar of national identity,
   prevailing ideas for cultural industries and policies are closely linked
   to protectionism and anti-globalization. However, these moves are
   derived from a narrow understanding of globalization. In this regard,
   this paper deals with this fundamental question on how to understand
   globalization in cultural industries with a focus on the film sector.
   For this research question, this paper identified inbound and outbound
   globalizations. Inbound globalization happens domestically with the
   interconnectedness among domestic and international factors whereas
   outbound globalization occurs overseas. These two types of
   globalizations can be undertaken both actively and passively depending
   on how to utilize (dis)advantages. Based on such an analysis, this paper
   argues that government policies should be set up to maximize benefits
   from both inbound and outbound globalizations in order to enhance the
   international competitiveness of the film industry while strengthening
   its industrial base.},

Abstract = {The current debate on populism is mainly concerned with populist parties
   and movements. Less is written about populist leadership. Yet, political
   scientists need to pay more attention to populist leadership, especially
   in order to understand how populism functions in the absence of a
   populist party. In situations in which a political leader adopts a
   populist way of exercising political power without the backing of what
   is considered a populist party, populism is often reduced to a
   particular style of acting and speaking of that particular politician.
   By formulating a theory-based concept of political leadership based on
   the literature of celebrity politicians-the superhero-I show that
   populist leadership is not limited to a particular style, but also
   allows to explain particular policy choices. The concept of the
   superhero goes beyond that of charismatic leadership, because it
   explains how the leader's exceptionality is performed and how this
   performance can be analyzed.},

Abstract = {Exchanges of expertise and experience between personnel involved in
   different peace processes are now a common feature of peacemaking
   worldwide. However, the goals, methods and impact of such interactions
   have been subject to little research. This article is the first
   scholarly analysis of what is here called `comparative consultation'.
   The article begins by conceptualising this work as a unique form of
   Track Two unofficial diplomacy, sharing the practical format and
   theoretical grounding of other Track Two approaches but differing in
   content. The empirical section is based on semi-structured interviews
   with 16 practitioners - primarily conflict resolution non-governmental
   organisation personnel and academics - who have facilitated dialogues on
   peace process topics (such as negotiation, transitional justice,
   grassroots peacebuilding) between peace process actors at various levels
   and from many contexts. It also draws on the author's participation in a
   series of comparative consultation events. The findings focus on aspects
   of the organisation, purpose and potential, and limitations and possible
   risks of the practice. The conclusion sets out a model of the dimensions
   and potential impacts of comparative consultation and argues for its
   recognition as a distinct peace methodology. Avenues for further
   research and practice are outlined.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {164-182},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Although research on the deliberative systems has been extensive,
   relatively little attention has been paid to indigenous deliberation.
   This article provides an analysis of how indigenous civic organizations
   use deliberative means to influence the policy decisions pertaining to
   indigenous lone-term care service and how indigenous deliberation and
   advocacy has helped in enhancing the deliberative capacity and forming
   the shared narratives of indigenous groups. Indigenous groups initiated
   the ``grassroots civic forum{''}, promoted policy storylines, and
   invited various civic groups that provide multiple care services to
   share experiences. This enabled them to speak for the needs of
   indigenous elderly people, initiate dialogue with decision-makers and
   legislators, and connect with other organizations for advocating policy
   change. Deliberative forums and indigenous activism contribute to
   knowledge production and policy shift away from the cultural dominance
   and urban style of long-term care services towards cogovernance and
   coproduction of services. It also led to the amendment of the Indigenous
   Long-Term Care Service Law to better reflects indigenous difference. The
   continuous political involvement of indigenous organizations in the
   service policy and cogovernance of long-term care increases the
   opportunities of equal access to care service resources, which can be
   seen as the product of deliberation.},

   undertaken on the history of teaching and learning. Based on extensive

   combines data sources, which have not previously been used in writing
   the history of political science. These are used to construct a history
   of the taught discipline which traces the development of courses and
   curricula within UK universities during the 20th century. In doing so,
   it makes a significant contribution to the history of political science,
   challenging existing accounts and chronologies of the development of
   politics in UK universities, through a more comprehensive account of its
   diverse origins.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an endogenous perspective on policy change,
   combining the analysis of the policy process (policy framing, decision
   and implementation) with the analysis of the transformation of
   professional groups and their organizational representation. It deals
   with the case of territorial undersupply in primary care provision,
   which has become a key issue in healthcare policies in France and
   Germany since 2000 (the analysis goes up to 2018). Policy changes in
   these two health insurances systems cannot be explained only by the
   salience of the problem, framed as ``medical deserts{''} in France and
   as ``lack of physicians{''} in Germany. We propose an explanation based
   on the internal fragmentation of the medical profession, playing a
   paradoxical role: as limiters of change (for the established and
   institutionalized organizations) and as promoters of change (for the
   medical entrepreneurs shaping new organizations defining and supporting
   new primary care service structures).

   Resumen Este articulo propone una perspectiva endogena sobre el cambio
   de politicas, combinando el analisis del proceso de politicas
   (formulacion de politicas, decision e implementacion) con el analisis de
   la transformacion de los grupos profesionales y su representacion
   organizacional. Se ocupa del caso de la falta de oferta territorial en
   la prestacion de atencion primaria, que se ha convertido en un tema
   clave en las politicas de salud en Francia y Alemania desde 2000 (el
   analisis se extiende hasta 2018). Los cambios de politica en estos dos
   sistemas de seguros de salud no pueden explicarse solo por la
   importancia del problema, enmarcado como ``desiertos medicos{''} en
   Francia y como ``falta de medicos{''} en Alemania. Proponemos una
   explicacion basada en la fragmentacion interna de la profesion medica,
   desempenando un papel paradojico: como limitadores del cambio (para las
   organizaciones establecidas e institucionalizadas) y como promotores del
   cambio (para los empresarios medicos que configuran nuevas
   organizaciones que definen y apoyan las nuevas estructuras de servicio
   de atencion primaria).},

Abstract = {Political finance scholars have paid little attention to the partisan
   preferences of business donors. This was because business donors were
   overwhelmingly concerned with the left-right dimension and enjoyed
   stable relationships with centre-right parties. These parties are
   increasingly tempted by economic nationalism. This new ideological flux
   provides an opportunity to measure the extent to which donors are party
   identifiers or react to changes in the policy space. Dramatic shifts in
   party policy on both the left-right and globalisation dimensions and a
   relatively transparent political finance regime make the United Kingdom
   a particularly apposite case to study this question. I analyse 19,000
   donations to the Conservative Party and show that business donors
   reacted strongly to recent shifts on both the left-right and
   globalisation dimensions. Thus, centre-right parties may not be able to
   rely on party identification and their left-right position to maintain
   business funding. Economic nationalism is likely to cost centre-right
   parties money.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The Special Procedures is a unique human rights monitoring mechanism of
   the UN Human Rights Council. China has a long history of interacting
   with Special Procedures, yet, little research has been done on how these
   interactions impact both entities. Compared to other UN human rights
   mechanisms, China seems to have a particularly challenging relationship
   with the Special Procedures. Both sides have publicly expressed
   complaints against each other. As such, this study intends to look into
   the details of the interaction between China and the Special Procedures
   through social and political contexts, with the purpose of finding if
   and how they can work better together. The article starts with a
   historic review of China's participation in the UN human rights system.
   Within this context, the article investigates whether China has been
   cooperative through examining its interactions with the Special
   Procedures in two major methods: the communications and country visits.
   The article, then, examines what the Special Procedures and China expect
   from each other and ends with analysis on whether both sides can improve
   their cooperation with each other and how to achieve that goal.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this briefing is to make visible the invisible and bring
   light to the role African workers are playing in developing key emergent
   and everyday digital technologies such as autonomous vehicles, machine
   learning systems, next-generation search engines and recommendations
   systems. Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies
   rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to
   piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work
   looks like and build a greater socio-political response (both at the
   global and local scale) to make some of these value chains more
   transparent, ethical and rewarding.},

Abstract = {Some theories predict that profits facilitate peace in illegal markets,
   while others predict that profits fuel violence. I provide empirical
   evidence from drug trafficking in Venezuela. Using original data, I
   compare lethal violence trends in municipalities near a major
   trafficking route to trends elsewhere, both before and after
   counternarcotics policy in neighboring Colombia increased the use of
   Venezuelan transport routes. For thirty years prior to this policy
   change, lethal violence trends were similar; afterward, outcomes
   diverged: violence increased more along the trafficking route than
   elsewhere. Together with qualitative accounts, these findings illuminate
   the conditions under which profits fuel violence in illegal markets.},

Abstract = {This review discusses four recent books which engage in a discussion on
   the euro and its meaning for European integration. Two of the reviewed
   books claim that the single currency is killing the European Union from
   the inside. They argue that even the most comprehensive proposals for
   the Eurozone reform are unable to repair the monetary union that was
   doomed to fail from the start. The other two studies reject this notion
   and insist that Europe's greatest mistake was not the creation of the
   single currency itself, but rather the negligence to supplement the euro
   with an institutional set-up appropriate for handling the banking crisis
   and overreliance on the US-style wholesale funding market. Read
   together, these contributions shed new light on the euro's biggest
   dilemmas after its twentieth anniversary and provide a valuable overview
   of the possible paths the euro might take in its third decade.},

Abstract = {The armed resistance offered by the Organization of Ukrainian
   Nationalists (OUN) to the Soviet state was the toughest internal
   political challenge that the Soviet regime faced from World War II to
   the 1980s. However, OUN's grand strategy was based on self-delusion and
   was, therefore, always irrational. It resulted in misinterpretation of
   the sentiments of Ukrainians and the international situation,
   collaboration with Nazi Germany despite incompatible goals,
   counterproductive ethnic violence and sweeping terror against alleged
   Soviet collaborators. Local civilians rather than the representatives of
   the Soviet regime were OUN's primary target; this alienated most
   residents of Western Ukraine.},

Title = {When democratic governance unites and divides: Social status and
   contestation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-64},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners are increasingly attentive to contestation
   against symbols and institutions underpinning international order(s).
   Yet International Relations scholarship can benefit from greater
   understanding of ways in which contestation interacts with salient
   dimensions of social status in specific international organizations
   (IOs). Drawing on evidence from the history of the Organization for
   Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with a focus on democratic
   governance and human rights, this article analyzes status-related
   contestation as a significant, yet under-examined type of contestation
   in multilateral diplomacy. Status-related contestation conveys
   dissatisfaction about symbols, institutions, and actors which reinforce
   socially significant divisions that place a state (or group of states)
   at a social disadvantage in a particular multilateral venue.
   International organizations provide unique social contexts which affect
   the content of contestation. Building on scholarship in social
   psychology, constructivism, and status hierarchies in world politics,
   the article analyzes the evolution of a dimension (or basis) of social
   status in the OSCE and illustrates that, beyond domestic and material
   interests, state representatives communicate social identity-related
   concerns through language, for example, that expresses discontent with
   dividing lines, unfairness, or (dis)respect, in attempting to minimize
   negative social identities in multilateral organizations.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to show how revolutionary nationalism was for decades
   the foundation of the institutions and efforts of the post-revolutionary
   system and of Mexican society. These ideas, which were transformed into
   government programs and institutions to apply them, produced results
   that defined the state and its functions, together with the dominant
   party, as an integral part of this institutional development. The deeper
   transformation of these principles and of state itself began with the
   substitution of economic policy and the resulting change in the elite in
   power, beginning with the government of President Miguel de la Madrid.
   However, revolutionary nationalism maintained a presence in the
   criticism of governments, both pan and PRI, after 1988, and constitutes
   the social underpinning that swept Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to power
   in 2018.},

Abstract = {In the article, the author discusses the main reasons for the failure to
   achieve sustainable development. He believes that the main reason for
   that failure is the excessive and one-sided orientation of Western
   civilization toward the material dimension of our lives. Behind that
   lies an even deeper mechanism that controls our actions: the human
   desire ``to be happy{''}. The author believes that we are not aware that
   the path to happiness is associated with both spiritual and material
   growth, not material growth alone. Our obsession with materials is
   rooted in the belief that material (economic) growth is the way to
   happiness. We have interfered in the environment and in other people's
   lives so recklessly primarily due to our material insatiability.
   However, love is essential in our lives, and the path to love goes
   through spiritual and material growth. Therefore, the author stresses
   the necessity of transforming the existing development paradigm into a
   new one with a comprehensive view of development, which will include
   spiritual and material growth. We should ``use{''} the state and the law
   as primary tools in achieving happiness as our main goal. To achieve
   sustainable development, we need a ``sustainable state{''} and
   ``sustainable law{''}.},

Abstract = {Sovereignty is the core concept of international relations. Almost
   without exception, approaches to sovereignty in IR have followed a
   binary framing where sovereignty is seen to consist of two components:
   `internal' versus `external' sovereignty, `positive' versus `negative'
   sovereignty, and so on. These dichotomies stem from the prevailing
   understanding of sovereignty as the boundary between the inside and the
   outside of the state. This article builds on and expands these existing
   approaches by reconceptualizing the sovereign border line as a liminal
   border space. Relatedly, we theorize the concept of liminality in
   greater depth by distinguishing between four distinct kinds of
   liminality: marginal, hybrid, interstitial, and external. Each of these
   problematizes the dividing line of sovereignty in unique but comparable
   ways. We empirically illustrate these four kinds of liminality with
   reference to contested states, `tribal' or `indigenous' groups, NGOs
   such as Amnesty International, and extremist groups such as ISIS,
   respectively. Each of these types of liminality entails unique actors,
   practices, and consequences for the concept of sovereignty. We suggest
   that liminal sovereignty practices represent the most radical source of
   change for the concept of sovereignty, yet at the same time, somewhat
   counterintuitively, they also serve as the best means of clarifying
   existing, established meanings and practices of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {How do the characteristics of military leaders relate to battlefield
   outcomes? To answer this question, we employ original battle-level data
   and biographical information on hundreds of commanders in more than 250
   battles in the American Civil War. We examine the relationship between
   two common measures of battlefield success (victory and casualties) and
   two latent features of commanders-competence and loyalty-that have long
   been seen as important in the broader study of executive appointments.
   We find that competent commanders are associated with more successful
   battlefield outcomes, as are more loyal Confederate commanders. More
   broadly, our analysis suggests that focusing on the relationship between
   military appointments and battlefield outcomes-with the latter's
   relatively clear definition of ``success{''}-allows for direct
   examination of the relationship between appointee traits and
   organizational performance. As such, our results have implications for
   the study of conflict as well as bureaucratic politics.},

Abstract = {Corruption in the public sector is an elusive and obscure phenomenon.
   Government's reaction to disasters constitutes a favorable opportunity
   for nepotism, embezzlement and other criminal situations due to the
   investment in economic resources that it implies. The detection of these
   scenarios requires sophisticated methodologies that should be
   incorporated into disaster risk management processes. The use of
   corruption risk maps has been extended to face this problem. Through
   collective and agreed anticipation of acts of corruption, this technique
   acts as a disincentive to corrupt behavior in government processes. This
   happens at all levels of government, taking into account that the
   economic resources for disaster response are distributed at the
   municipal, provincial and national levels. On one hand, this tool allows
   the detection and calibration of the occurrence of corruption events in
   government processes and, at the same time, the design and execution of
   corrective mechanisms. This paper discuss the benefits derived from the
   application of this instrument, presenting the requirements for its use,
   its potentialities and future challenges.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to discuss some of the political and institutional
   determinants behind the changes in the organization of the Colombian
   Presidency during the governments of Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010) and Juan
   Manuel Santos (2010-2018). To this end, it identifies to which extent
   the presidential style of each of these two presidents was manifested in
   the institutional and administrative changes experienced by the
   Presidency during the period studied. Government reform in Colombia is a
   unique case in Latin America. In a regional context where the priorities
   were market-oriented State reforms, the changes in the organization of
   the Colombian Presidency, carried out in the context of the internal
   armed conflict, have shaped a model that has provided the various
   governments with a strategic political base endowed with operational
   flexibility and administrative ramifications, avoiding the dismantling
   of structures already consolidated at the center of government.},

Abstract = {This special issue showcases some contributions presented during the
   symposium ``Arctic policies in perspective{''} which was held at
   Sciences Po, in Paris, on December 18 and 19, 2019. These two days of
   discussions aimed at shedding light on the Arctic in a context of the
   international development of the region, where the signs of cooperation
   are always vibrant, as indicated by the signing of the moratorium to ban
   fishing in the central Arctic Ocean. At the same time, weak signals
   would indicate an increase in security tensions with the jamming of the
   gps disrupting civil aviation in the Barents region or the return of the
   United States Navy to Iceland. Far from an image of a unified, frozen
   and exotic space, the Arctic is now being recognized as a space at the
   heart of international relations. This special issue is therefore
   dedicated to discussing and reflecting on the diversity of these Arctic
   worlds, based on innovative and transdisciplinary research. The links
   between different prisms of analysis - geographic, strategic,
   historical, political science make it possible to see in the Arctic
   Ocean and the circumpolar territories a space particularly sensitive to
   the recomposition of the international political scene as to the
   climatic upheavals which modify singularly this vulnerable region.},

Abstract = {Leaders who wish to resolve their disputes through face-to-face
   negotiations often find themselves in various relational problems. An
   invitation to talk might be sincere, but it can also be a scheme to
   exploit one's counterpart; a claim of value and threat to walk out
   unless certain demands are met might be serious, but it can also be a
   bluff; a claim that no further concessions is possible might be
   heartfelt, but it can also be an attempt to exaggerate one's
   ``Reservation Price{''}; and an urge to commit to an agreement might be
   genuine, but it can also be a ploy to trick a counterpart into a deal
   one does not intend to honor. What, then, are the interpersonal
   mechanisms that enable leaders to credibly communicate their intentions?
   In this article, I identify the diverse repertoire of emotions that
   leaders exchange when they interact up close, explain the different
   relational problems they overcome, and, as such, shed light on how their
   expressions enable leaders with otherwise conflicting interests to
   proceed through the different stages of a negotiation. Empirically, I
   present a number of episodes of face-to-face diplomacy from recent
   history. I also discuss a number of promising topics for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This article examines women's wartime experiences with a focus on
   Latvia's women volunteers in the Red Army in World War II. An estimated
   8 percent of the Red Army was composed of women, who played a wide array
   of roles, including as snipers, combat engineers, medics, and frontline
   journalists. This level of female participation was unique in World War
   II, but a close examination of the phenomenon shows that motives and
   means for entry into the Red Army at the beginning of the war were not
   uniform. Our examination of the case of women volunteers from the
   Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic reveals key factors that fed women's
   fervent desire to ``get to the front.{''} It shows particular ways in
   which the Red Army functioned as an unlikely refuge, sheltering women
   from some of the hardships and threats of life in the Soviet Russian
   interior, including hunger, loneliness, and a lack of warm clothing,
   while providing a means of exacting revenge against a mortal enemy. At
   the same time, it exposed women to extremes of violence and conflict.
   Dominant Soviet narratives of women in war have presented them in
   largely marginal roles or have silenced stories that failed to comport
   with triumphalist and masculine representations of World War II. This
   work uses the voices of women volunteers in the Latvian Riflemen's
   Divisions of the Red Army to construct an agent-centered history of
   motives, experiences, and memories.},

Abstract = {The idea of time is critical to intergenerational environmental justice
   (IEJ). Focusing on time as discrete instantiations on a forward
   projection limits the capacity of IEJ to theorise justice for future
   generations. Framed by this understanding of time, IEJ then excludes
   peoples for whom time is spirally bound and for whom nonhuman and human
   are entangled within the spheres of justice. In a contribution towards
   decolonising IEJ theory, drawing on Maori ontology of time, IEJ is
   theorised as integral to being, rather than as an act of sacrifice or
   beneficence.},

Abstract = {An intriguing phenomenon documented within political science research is
   the association between nation-building programs and increased
   subnational intergroup conflicts. Based on data collected in Hong Kong,
   an epicenter of subnational conflicts in China, this article suggests
   that nation building may intensify the tension between subnational
   groups because it helps to spread the belief that groups have fixed
   inherent characteristics. Specifically, in the face of deep intergroup
   cultural and political differences, people who see their nation as a
   historically unified entity are more likely to believe that those
   differences are unchangeable and, in turn, develop negative attitudes
   toward other subnational groups. We support these arguments with a
   representative survey of the population and two laboratory experiments.
   In the first experiment, respondents who are exposed to narratives that
   emphasize the homogeneity of the Chinese nation report a higher level of
   fixed group perceptions than those who receive the opposite message. In
   the second experiment, respondents who are primed to believe that group
   characteristics are fixed report significantly more negative attitudes
   toward migrants from other parts of China. Our findings contribute
   conceptually to the study of nation building and shed new light on the
   formation of immigration attitudes.},

Abstract = {Internationalization is a key aim of the International Society of
   Political Psychology (ISPP). This article uses bibliometric techniques
   to explore international collaborations in the Society's core
   activities, namely the journal Political Psychology and annual meetings.
   We explore how authors from different regions of the world are
   interconnected through coauthorship, using country information extracted
   from authors' affiliation and coded as Western, Educated,
   Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) or non-WEIRD. Study 1
   analyzes coauthorship in the Society's journal Political Psychology from
   1985-2014 (30 years), with 1151 authors from 42 countries and 1337
   coauthorship ties between them. Study 2 mapped the coauthorship
   relationships for annual meetings for which documentation was available,
   eventually collecting data from 2006 to 2014 (9 years). In total, 4260
   authors from 74 countries were represented, with 6884 collaborative
   ties. Annual meetings reflected more international collaboration than
   the journal on several dimensions, including a large internationally
   connected giant component of collaborating authors evident in annual
   meetings, but not the journals. In annual meetings, there were more
   collaborations between WEIRD and non-WEIRD authors. However, even at
   annual meetings, deep internationalization involving non-WEIRD authors
   was rare, and the activities of the Society primarily represent
   academics from WEIRD countries, particularly the United States.},

Abstract = {The liberal international order is widely believed to be resilient
   because it has always had a remarkable ability to adapt in response to
   crisis and adversity. Today, the liberal order is clearly in crisis, and
   yet decisive action to adapt it is not taking place. Using insights from
   the resilience-thinking literature supplemented with insights from the
   literature on ontological security, the article seeks to understand why
   agents often fail to take decisive adaptive action, even when such
   action is clearly needed. The article develops a conceptual framework,
   including agent-level theorizing, to better understand agent motivation
   for undertaking adaptive action and a conception of the social site for
   resilience as an ideal-type social domain in which resilience is
   constituted and defined in the interaction between patterns of power,
   principles, and practice. The article contributes to resilience-thinking
   by demonstrating a plausible link between agents' ability to invoke
   their agency and their ontological security.},

Abstract = {We propose a conceptual framework of policy deception to help identify,
   analyse and explain Brexit as a policy fiasco. The framework casts light
   on the political use of the device of an in/out European Union (EU)
   referendum by David Cameron. The paper develops the argument that the
   referendum did not offer a binary choice between two policy options for
   the United Kingdom's (UK) relationship with the EU representing
   different, but commensurable preferences, because one option was
   `baseless' in that it was unfounded in any policy analysis. The label of
   policy deception usefully reveals that many of the political, process
   and programme failures at the heart of the Brexit fiasco have their
   roots in the referendum. We conclude that the concept of policy
   deception contributes usefully to emerging work on why the Brexit policy
   fiasco occurred, and is likely to be a fruitful topic for future work.},

Abstract = {Based on data from Argentina's Permanent Household Survey, the method of
   analysis used in this study permits the rate of precarious work in
   Argentina in 2017 and its trend in 2003-2017 to be determined more
   accurately than before. The figure in 2017 was 47 percent, and women,
   younger people, the less educated, and the foreign-born were more likely
   to have precarious jobs. A separate analysis of the categories that
   constitute precarious work provides unique insight on the interrelation
   among employment relations, economic growth, and labor-capital conflict.
   Lastly, the findings provide support for the existence of a range of
   productivity levels across firms instead of a sharp distinction between
   formal and informal sectors of the economy and a continuous inverse
   relationship with precarious employment. En base a datos de la Encuesta
   Permanente de Hogares de Argentina, el metodo de analisis utilizado en
   este estudio permite determinar la tasa de trabajo precario en Argentina
   en 2017 y su tendencia en 2003-2017 con mayor precision que antes. La
   cifra en 2017 fue del 47 por ciento, y las mujeres, los jovenes, los
   menos educados y los nacidos en el extranjero tenian mas probabilidades
   de tener trabajos precarios. Un analisis separado de las categorias que
   constituyen el trabajo precario proporciona una vision unica de la
   interrelacion entre las relaciones laborales, el crecimiento economico y
   el conflicto laboral-capital. Por ultimo, los hallazgos respaldan la
   existencia de una gama de niveles de productividad de las empresas del
   mismo sector en lugar de una distincion clara entre los sectores
   formales e informales de la economia y una relacion inversa continua con
   el empleo precario.},

Abstract = {After the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Cuban
   Missile Crisis, the countries in Latin America created a communal
   framework for nuclear security and a nuclear-free zone through the
   Tlatelolco Treaty. Mexico, a middle power, emerged as the leader of the
   negotiations and Mexican diplomats later used Tlatelolco to actively
   participate in the formulation of international nuclear norms and
   institutions. How did a middle power, with limited capacities in the
   hierarchies of authority, influence global nuclear governance? Mexico
   strategically used the Latin American coalition and the nuclear standard
   as a way of amplifying its influence in the international negotiations.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents evidence relating to political conceptions of
   well-being in Africa. First, the southern African philosophy of Ubuntu
   is discussed, and areas of overlap with other ethical frameworks are
   explored. Next, the national constitutions of countries in North, East,
   West and Southern Africa are examined, with the aim of identifying the
   central principles of the political settings of well-being in these
   countries. Findings from the World Values Survey give a broad view of
   mass priorities across the region. The analysis shows numerous
   commonalities, including Material living standards, Health, Education,
   Work, Community and Family, Political and Cultural Participation, and
   access to a healthy Natural Environment as constituents of a good life.
   Also apparent across the national constitutions is the aim of
   maintaining and developing each country's national identity, including
   through the blending of traditional and modern customs and values. This
   can be interpreted as a recognition of the importance of shared
   histories, traditions and cultures, in political and ethical reasoning
   at the national, community and individual levels. Belonging is a crucial
   aspect of the good life. To summarise, the dominant commonality to
   emerge at each of the philosophical, political and civilian levels is
   the value of harmonious social relationships.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I explore the ways in which consideration of adolescent
   parents forces us to confront and question common presuppositions about
   parental rights. In particular, I argue that recognising the right of
   adolescent mothers not to be forcibly separated from their newborn
   children justifies rejecting the notion that parental rights are (a) all
   acquired in the same manner and (b) acquired as a `bundle' of
   concomitant moral rights. I conclude that children and adolescents who
   conceive and give birth have some parental rights concerning their
   newborn children - in particular, the right not to be forcibly separated
   from those children - even if they do not have the `full complement' of
   parental rights as we generally characterise these.},

   essays and pamphlets expounding his maturing views on violence, the
   state, the church, and how to improve the human condition. Since then,
   these `Christian anarchist' and pacifist views have often been dismissed
   as utopian or naive, and despite inspiring numerous activists, often
   forgotten or ignored. This chapter seeks to examine them in greater
   detail. Tolstoy's political thought is divided into four main themes:
   pacifism, anarchism, anticlericalism, and activist methods. For each
   theme, Tolstoy's main contentions are first summed up, then some of
   their criticisms are discussed, and then some reflections are offered on
   their ongoing relevance today. The chapter concludes that despite being
   an odd Christian, an odd pacifist, an odd anarchist and an odd activist,
   Tolstoy put forward: a compelling denunciation of violence which
   influenced numerous thinkers and activists; a condemnation of state
   violence and deception which can be extended to today's globalised
   political economy; a bitter critique of the church which can be extended
   to religious institutions of our time; and a method of activism through
   withdrawal which continues to generate debate and is increasingly
   adopted by a variety of activists today. In short: Tolstoy's Christian
   anarcho-pacifist political thought continues to deserve to be taken
   seriously.},

   {[}Anonymous], 7 Whether it is possible to use phylogenetic data to determine the transmission of HIV virus from one person to another is a matter of active contestation in the HIV community. CDC and an international cohort of experts on this topic insist that it not possible using currently available methods. However, some scholars and activists claim that the science behind this statement is immaterial in the hands of over-zealous actors. I explore aspects of this controversy in the pages that follow, but it is not a central focus.

   relationship between the public funding of the arts and their
   consumption? and (b) what mode of justification and what perception of
   the place of art in society is reflected in this relationship? Based on
   the philosophical work of Alan Badiou, I develop a novel conceptual
   framework to delineate three types of normative justifications for the
   public funding of arts organizations: romantic, didactic and classical.
   Using data from the public funding of 92 orchestras, theaters and dance
   troupes in Israel between 1999 and 2011, I estimate a cross-lagged panel
   data model to study how arts funding both affects and is affected by the
   levels of consumption of the organizations' productions. The results of
   the study show a complex pattern of different relationships between
   funding and consumption that accord with the three types of normative
   justifications for public arts funding.},

Abstract = {This article introduces an extended data set of 760 terrorist groups
   that engaged in attacks during 1970 to 2016. Unlike most extant group
   data sets, the extended data on terrorist groups (EDTG) is not tied to
   terrorist groups and attacks listed in the RAND terrorism data; rather,
   EDTG is linked to terrorist groups and attacks given in the Global
   Terrorism Database. Terrorist groups' variables in EDTG include
   ideology, main goals, start date, duration, base country, attack
   diversity, peak size, alternative endings (if relevant), and others. We
   display interesting features of EDTG through a series of tables and
   figures. Our EDTG-based survival analysis is at odds with some of the
   literature: for example, the demise of a leader and a larger share of
   transnational terrorist attacks increase the group's odds of failure.
   After 2001, religious terrorist groups are more resilient than those
   with other ideologies. We also analyze terrorist group lethality and
   productivity.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the effects of the introduction of South-South
   Cooperation (SSC) practices in a traditional aid-hosting context. Using
   a Bourdieusian approach, it shows that SSC practices encountered
   traditional aid practices embodied in host actors' engagement within SSC
   initiatives. Such encounters engendered a practical mismatch that
   affected SSC projects. The effects of the practical battle on project
   implementation underscores the determining role of host actors in
   shaping development cooperation practices. Finally, this article argues
   that changes in development cooperation practice, in contrast to changes
   in development cooperation paradigms, depend more on the hosts than on
   the donors and providers' agenda.},

Abstract = {What impact does engagement in crime have on terrorist group survival?
   In theory criminal activity may decrease group survival by damaging
   group legitimacy or prompting government crackdowns. Conversely, crime
   might boost group survival by facilitating access to revenues or by
   further taxing state policing capacity. Moreover, different types of
   crime might have different effects. We investigate the impact of crime
   on terrorist group survival using cross-sectional data on 578 terrorist
   groups observed between 1970 and 2007. We find that engagement in crime
   reduces a group's chance of demise by around 50\% and extends its
   lifespan by around 7 years on average. Terrorist groups involved in
   narcotics are less likely to end by police or military force, but are
   also less likely to win political concessions. We find that groups
   involved in extortion live the longest and are also less likely to end
   by force or by splintering.},

Title = {Work design and task conflict in interdisciplinary groups},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {623-646},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of enriched
   group work design and objective and perceived expertise diversity in
   interdisciplinary research groups with a focus on two critical group
   processes: task conflict and idea sharing.
   Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from 148
   researchers and their advisors in 29 research labs at two
   doctorate-granting universities. The study tested the hypothesized model
   using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression and hierarchical
   linear modeling.
   Findings Results showed that objective and perceived (salient) expertise
   diversity jointly influenced task conflict. In addition, whether task
   conflict had a positive or negative impact on idea sharing depended on
   group work design enrichment and expertise diversity salience. Idea
   sharing improved group outcomes over and above the effects of task
   conflict.
   Research limitations/implications Although this study could not test the
   causal relationships owing to a cross-sectional nature of data, it
   provides theoretical implications for the group work design, diversity
   and conflict literature.
   Practical implications Group work design represents an important tool
   for stimulating idea sharing in research groups. The findings suggest
   that managers should consider and manage the level of expertise
   diversity salience and the level of task conflict to increase the
   effectiveness of group work design.
   Originality/value The study provides insights on when task conflict may
   help creative groups. Work design and diversity salience represent
   important contextual features. The paper also examines both the
   objective and perceived diversity and disentangles task conflict and
   idea sharing.},

Pages = {119-143},
Abstract = {Many theories of international relations assume that public opinion
   exerts a powerful effect on foreign policy in democracies. Previous
   research, based on observational data, has reached conflicting
   conclusions about this foundational assumption. We use experiments to
   examine two mechanisms-responsiveness and selection-through which
   opinion could shape decisions about the use of military force. We tested
   responsiveness by asking members of the Israeli parliament to consider a
   crisis in which we randomized information about public opinion.
   Parliamentarians were more willing to use military force when the public
   was in favor and believed that contravening public opinion would entail
   heavy political costs. We tested selection by asking citizens in Israel
   and the US to evaluate parties/candidates, which varied randomly on many
   dimensions. In both countries, security policy proved as electorally
   significant as economic and religious policy, and far more consequential
   than nonpolicy considerations such as gender, race, and experience.
   Overall, our experiments in two important democracies imply that
   citizens can affect policy by incentivizing incumbents and shaping who
   gets elected.},

Abstract = {What explains conspiracy thinking in Europe and America? This is the
   first and largest comparative study of conspiracy thinking to date,
   presenting findings using a representative sample of 11,523 respondents
   in nine countries. First, it shows that the overall level of conspiracy
   thinking in Europe is equal to or slightly lower than the United States,
   contradicting the notion that conspiracy theories is an especially
   American phenomenon. Second, people more inclined to conspiracy thinking
   position themselves towards the right of the political spectrum, engage
   in magical thinking, feel distrust towards public officials and reject
   the political system. Finally, we find that - surprisingly - the country
   context in which respondents reside has hardly any effect as predictor
   of levels of conspiracy thinking or as a moderator of individual-level
   determinants. Heterogeneity in conspiratorial thinking seems to be
   largely a function of individual traits.},

Abstract = {Building on the U.N. human security taxonomy of 1994, this article aims
   to explore the constructability of a reliable, valid, parsimonious,
   useful measure of human security that is relevant to contemporary
   environments and situations? A seminal 1994 U.N. report, Human Security
   in Theory and Practice, outlined seven types of human security
   (personal, health, food, community, economic, environmental, political).
   A quarter-century on, we added two more, cyber and national security,
   and tested if a single measure could capture all nine security concerns.
   A national sample of N = 1033 New Zealanders completed a brief online
   measure in which participants reported yes or no to experiencing each
   type of security and basic demographics. Guttman scaling placed these
   needs in an ascending order of difficulty. Analogous to a staircase,
   security may be scaled from personal up to political security
   (coefficient of reproducibility = .88), with three distinct but
   interrelated flights: (1) proximal (personal, health, food security);
   (2) social (cyber, community, economic, environmental); and (3) distal
   (national, political). We confirmed this nine-step, three-flight measure
   in our sample (X-2 = 81.72; df = 24; RMSEA = .048, 90\%CI {[}.037, .06];
   CFI = .976; TLI = .964; SRMR = .028). The measure showed configural,
   metric, scalar, and factorial invariances (across random-split
   subgroups). Ethnic groups and the precariously employed scored
   significantly differently, in coherent ways, on the security staircase
   scale.},

   Closure in the Context of Covid-19?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {This paper is assessing the legality of border closures decided by a
   vast number of countries with the view of limiting the spread of
   Covid-19. Although this issue has raised diverging interpretations in
   relation to International Health Regulations and regional free movement
   agreements, international human rights law provides a clear-cut answer:
   the rule of law stops neither at the border nor in times of emergency.
   Against this normative framework, border control can and must be carried
   out with the twofold purpose of protecting public health and individual
   rights, whereas border closure is unable to do so because it is by
   essence a collective and automatic denial of admission without any other
   form of process. This paper argues that blanket entry bans on the ground
   of public health are illegal under international human rights law. They
   cannot be reconciled with the most basic rights of migrants and
   refugees, including the principle of non-refoulement and access to
   asylum procedures, the prohibition of collective expulsion, the best
   interests of the child and the principle of non-discrimination. The
   paper concludes on the ways to better integrate at the borders public
   health and human rights imperatives in due respect with the rule of law.
   In both law and practice, public health and migrant's rights are not
   mutually exclusive. They can reinforce each other within a comprehensive
   human rights based approach to health and migration policies.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Chinese government increases the
   effectiveness of policy implementation by resorting to citizen
   participation. Based on an in-depth case study of the waste
   classification policy implementation in county T, province Z, this
   article demonstrates three citizen-enlistment strategies applied in the
   local state: (1) local-elites enlistment, (2) social norms innovation,
   and (3) blurring the role boundaries between citizens and frontline
   bureaucrats. This article also illustrates the citizen-enlistment
   motivations of governments: (1) to increase the dynamic and controllable
   working staff in policy implementation, (2) to maintain a flexible
   social control system to reduce accountability pressure, and (3) to
   overcome information asymmetry by holding citizens responsible for their
   suggestions and claims. In general, the citizen-enlistment strategies,
   to some extent, facilitate the effectiveness of policy implementation in
   the local state.},

Abstract = {The EU has demonstrated increasing commitment to combating climate
   change. In December 2019, the European Commission published the European
   Green Deal (EGD) - an evolving, overarching strategy that aims to
   achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Just as the plans were underway to
   implement the EGD, the Covid-19 crisis hit. We ask whether it is likely
   that the Covid-19 crisis represents a critical juncture for EU climate
   policy, and why? Experience from previous economic crises suggests that
   climate policy may be set aside. In 2020, the EU's crisis response seems
   rather to advance EU climate policy, at least on paper. Given the
   potential for transformational change already embedded in the EGD, we
   suggest that additional positive effects of the Covid-19 crisis may not
   add up to a critical juncture. We reflect on the role of Commission
   entrepreneurship and the politicisation of climate change and climate
   policy to explain this outcome.},

Abstract = {This article constitutes an effort to examine the prospect of long-term
   refugee radicalization, beyond the dominant ``short-sighted{''} debate
   on the possibility of radical Islamist militants posing as refugees. The
   main argument of the article is that refugees are inherently different
   from second-generation economic migrants, on whom most radicalization
   models are based. The article proposes a composite model that enriches
   our understanding of radicalization drivers with insights from refugee
   militarization studies. The model demonstrates that not only do some
   radicalization drivers present different dynamics in refugee
   populations, but that there are also other important factors, such as
   refugees' cause of flight or prior political organization, which are
   absent in traditional radicalization models. Moreover, the article
   highlights the importance of a host state's will and capacity to address
   refugees' needs and the influence of external actors in policy
   formulation, particularly in weak or struggling host states. One
   implication of this study is that early-stage policies largely
   predetermine future radicalization. Another implication is that the
   possibility of refugee radicalization is not the same for every refugee
   population and in every (European) country. Thus, the policies the
   European Union or specific states adopt should be tailored to the
   specific needs of each community and state.},

Abstract = {This paper examines aspects of violent, traumatic terrorist video
   propaganda produced by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) within
   the theoretical confines of abjection and the use of utopian/dystopian
   themes. These themes have been present in a number of studies that have
   examined consumption of the dark dystopic variety. We seek to elucidate
   on the use of specific techniques and narratives that are relatively new
   to the global propaganda consumerspace and that relate to horrific
   violence. Our work here is centered on interpretative analysis and
   theory building that we believe can assist in understanding and
   interpreting post-apocalyptic and abject-oriented campaigns in the age
   of social media and rapid transmission of multimedia communications. In
   the present analysis, we examine eight ISIS videos created and released
   in 2015 and 2016. All of the videos chosen for analysis have utilized
   techniques related to abjection, shock, and horror, often culminating in
   the filming of the murder of ISIS's enemies or place-based destruction
   of holy sites in the Middle East. We use inductive content analytic
   techniques in the contexts of consumer culture, ``cinemas of
   attraction,{''} and pornography of violence to propose an extension of
   existing frameworks of terrorism and propaganda theory.},

Abstract = {This work conducts a comparative analysis of strife between governments
   and multinational corporations (MNC) in Venezuela and Tanzania,
   postulating that subtle shifts in bargaining power stemming from
   petroleum in Venezuela and diamonds in Tanzania lead to large
   differences in government-MNC strife. Oil-rich Venezuela tends to
   experience incrementally consistent and capital-intensive strife pinned
   against prices, which quickly becomes inter-sectionalised and
   internationalised. Conversely, diamond-wealthy Tanzania suffers from
   intermittent, erratic, localised, and labour-focused strife independent
   of diamond prices, which becomes neither inter-sectionalised nor
   internationalised. Such asymmetric shifts in bargaining power, though
   initially insignificant, ultimately produce variations in outcomes,
   contributing to different styles of resource nationalism.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the cultural traction and media visibility yielded
   by left-wing ideas and people during Jeremy Corbyn's tenure as British
   Labour Party leader (2015-2019), while also offering some more general
   reflections on the relationship between left politics and popular
   culture. I begin by noting that the cultural and media aspects of
   Corbynism have largely been neglected in the scholarly literature. I
   then go on to caution against the temptation of subsuming the cultural
   aspects of Corbyn-era left politics under the label of `left-wing
   populism'. Instead, I defend a conception of `popular leftism' as
   distinct from `left-wing populism', via an engagement with Stuart Hall's
   classic essay `Notes on Deconstructing the Popular', as well as Sarah
   Banet-Wesier's recent work on popular feminism. The second half of the
   article maps key features of `popular leftism' as a distinct
   cultural/political formation that has emerged `in and against'
   neoliberalism. In particular, it focuses on media visibility, affective
   tenor, and tactical and intellectual dynamics. While popular leftism's
   entanglement with neoliberalism has proved problematic for its
   transformative capacity, I nonetheless conclude that its emergence is
   testament to the importance of popular cultural production and
   consumption in shaping recent iterations of left politics in Britain.},

Abstract = {One of the major drivers of societal conflict are the intergroup
   relations which rely mainly on social identity and which are rarely
   analyzed for immigrant groups. This article changes this point of view
   by investigating the extent to which national, ethnic, and religious
   identities relate to outgroup hostilities towards the majority of the
   German population, towards other immigrant groups, and towards Syrian
   refugees among immigrant-origin citizens. We employ a theoretical
   framework based on the social identity approach and use new
   representative survey data from 2017 for Germans of Turkish descent (N =
   480) and Russian Germans (N = 471). Based on multivariate linear
   regression analysis, we show that ethnic identity has the strongest
   positive relation with outgroup hostilities, with the exception of the
   Russian-Germans' evaluation of the German majority population. National
   identity among Germans of Turkish descent lessens their hostility
   towards other immigrants. Our results show the importance of analyzing
   immigrant groups with different migration trajectories separately before
   making generalized claims. Not only are the identity relations different
   between an ingroup identification and various outgroup targets, but they
   are also different between the immigrant groups for the same ingroup
   identification and outgroup target.},

Abstract = {Stories and representations of suffering are frequently central to
   attempts to arouse our emotions and initiate political action. Yet, the
   evocation of emotion and, in particular, empathy, remains politically
   ambivalent. It does not necessarily lead to the acknowledgement of
   political responsibility or to actions to address the
   historically-constituted roots of contemporary structural injustices.
   Moving beyond the legal, moral, and institutional boundaries of
   political responsibility, this article argues for greater recognition of
   its affective dimensions. In particular, it differentiates between a
   sentimental politics and testimonial empathy to better understand the
   affective dynamics of political responsibility. While the former finds
   close company with pity and a lack of acknowledged political
   responsibility, the latter offers an ethical-political orientation
   towards radical reflexivity and social transformation, situating
   experiences of injustice within wider networks of power, privilege, and
   agency. Drawing on the work of feminist, cultural, and social theorists,
   the article offers a critical conceptualisation of testimonial empathy
   and its limits. The article illustrates the insights offered by
   re-thinking political responsibility in terms of testimonial empathy
   through a close reading of a historical account of structural injustice
   - slavery in the United States - as written in Harriet A. Jacobs' 1861
   slave narrative.},

Abstract = {Conflict-related sexual violence is an international security problem
   and is sometimes used as a weapon of war. It is also a complex and
   hard-to-observe phenomenon, constituting perhaps one of the most hidden
   forms of wartime violence. Latent variable models (LVM) offer a
   promising avenue to account for differences in observed measures. Three
   annual human rights sources report on the sexual violence practices of
   armed conflict actors around the world since 1989 and were coded into
   ordinal indicators of conflict-year prevalence. Because information
   diverges significantly across these measures, we currently have a poor
   scientific understanding with regard to trends and patterns of the
   problem. In this article, we use an LVM approach to leverage information
   across multiple indicators of wartime sexual violence to estimate its
   true extent, to express uncertainty in the form of a credible interval,
   and to account for temporal trends in the underlying data. We argue that
   a dynamic LVM parametrization constitutes the best fit in this context.
   It outperforms a static latent variable model, as well as analysis of
   observed indicators. Based on our findings, we argue that an LVM
   approach currently constitutes the best practice for this line of
   inquiry and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

Title = {A quantitative approach to studying hierarchies of primary institutions

Abstract = {In this article, we aim to contribute to two contemporary debates within
   the English School. The debate about how to observe primary institutions
   and the debate concerning hierarchy between primary institutions.
   Specifically, we analyse references to primary institutions in United
   Nations General Assembly disarmament resolutions in the decade 1989-1998
   and their distribution using descriptive statistics. In this way, the
   article offers a novel approach to identifying primary institutions
   empirically, and provides some insight into the hierarchy-question in
   the sense of documenting the relative numerical presence of references
   to different primary institutions in a specific issue area and temporal
   context. With respect to the latter, the key finding is that great power
   management, diplomacy and international law are by far the most
   prominent primary institutions in the analysed material. This is an
   intriguing finding, not least given the importance attached to them by
   Hedley Bull in his classic work The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order
   in World Politics. The main contribution of the article is thus to spell
   out a new approach to how the aforementioned debates might proceed
   empirically.},

Abstract = {In 2018, 43 leading International Relations scholars in the United
   States signed a public statement in support of an urgent call to
   preserve the current international order, triggering heated scholarly
   debates. The idealized form of the liberal international order was
   criticized by many scholars for its chronic problems, including the
   contradictions between proclaimed liberal values and illiberal
   behaviors, the inability to reform its institutional pillars to
   accommodate the diverse group of emerging powers, and the tensions
   between the defenders of this order and its challengers. These problems
   became fully exposed under the external shock caused by the coronavirus
   pandemic. As the coronavirus spreads globally and disrupts the world's
   political, economic, and social fabric, several forces that have gained
   momentum and strength during the last decade are now converging as a
   formidable force that may reconfigure the post-pandemic international
   order. This paper addresses three significant challenges to the
   foundations of the current liberal order: (1) the entrenchment of
   authoritarianism, characterized by authoritarian resilience,
   autocratization, and the consolidation of competing authoritarian
   political-economic models; (2) the exacerbation of nationalism enabled
   by nationalist and populist politicians; and (3) the intensified
   competition among major powers. China has played mixed roles in the
   process of reconfiguring the current order. It challenges the
   mythologized liberal international order and exposes the contradictions
   in the dominant Western model, while promoting an alternative hybrid
   political-economic model. The shock brought by the pandemic has provided
   ample opportunities for China to extend its networks and expand
   international space for its model.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to open a conversation about multispecies justice in
   environmental politics. It sets out some of the theoretical approaches,
   key areas of exploration, and obvious challenges that come with
   rethinking a core plank of liberal theory and politics. First, we
   discuss some of the diverse scholarly fields that have influenced the
   emergence of multispecies justice. We then discuss core concerns at the
   centre of this reconfiguration of justice - including broadening
   conceptions of the subject of justice and the means and processes of
   recognition (and misrecognition). The importance of deconstructing and
   decolonising the hegemony of liberal political discourse is crucial, and
   is part of a larger project for multispecies justice to rework a
   politics of knowledge and practice of political communication. Finally,
   we begin to explore what a commitment to multispecies justice might
   demand of politics and policy.},

Abstract = {Iran has a longstanding connection with terrorism, in particular after
   the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It has been recognized as both a victim and
   state sponsor of terrorism, but has predominantly been accused of
   supporting terrorism worldwide. Iran has been accused of training,
   financing, and providing weapons and safe havens for nonstate militant
   actors, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. While Iran considers such groups as
   national liberation movements, they are by contrast designated as
   terrorist groups according to other countries. At the same time, Iran
   has suffered from terrorist attacks, although Iranian security has
   proven much superior to its neighbors, such as Iraq, Syria, and
   Afghanistan. Regardless of claims relating to Iran as a victim or
   sponsor of terrorism, no official policy or document has been published
   by the government by way of a counterterrorism policy because any stated
   policy would be subject to accountability, human rights, and the rule of
   law. In practice, its focus is placed on the ``War by Terror{''} as an
   external instrument as opposed to internal ``Counterterrorism.{''} By
   analysis of official documents, statements, and laws, both Persian and
   English sources, this article aims to clarify Iran's counterterrorism
   policy and framework and the actual practices of Iran in the Middle
   East.},

Abstract = {One of the commune's own tasks is to meet the collective needs of the
   community. The most important issue from this perspective is the place
   designated for commerce. The commune may designate such a place on on
   the territory owned or managed by it. This designated place is called
   the market, which is every place where the sale is carried out. The
   regulations in force in Poland show some inconsistency in the approach
   to sales conducted in places other than shops. On the other hand, the
   use of the municipal market entails payment of the market fee, the
   objective scope of which raises doubts. Sale outside the designated
   place constitutes an infraction punishable by a fine. Its object of
   protection is public order and peace. The act consists in conducting
   sales activity. It may be committed by anyone, both intentionally and
   unintentionally. The offender is subject to punishment even in the case
   of a one-off, small sale, but it is possible to waive the penalty.},

Abstract = {The development of local government units is determined by many factors.
   The most important is the financial condition, which determines the
   possibilities of the effective implementation of tasks, both current and
   as an investment. In the face of an unstable macroeconomic environment,
   as well as growing expectations of residents regarding the improvement
   of living standards, local government finance management takes place
   under conditions of strong pressure and great uncertainty. Therefore, a
   rational budget policy is a prerequisite for achieving the approved
   development goals. It should be based on greater control of the
   performance and discipline in the use of budget funds. The purpose of
   this article is to assess and compare the financial situation of small
   towns and large cities in Poland in 2012-2018. The study used budget
   indicators in the areas of revenues, operating surplus and indebtedness.
   The study made it possible to draw conclusions regarding the development
   opportunities of Polish cities.},

Abstract = {Why and under what conditions do a challenger's legitimation strategies
   shape decisions for institutional reform? I argue that legitimation
   strategies are critical in defining how institutional defenders evaluate
   the costs and benefits of institutional reform, and thus in shaping
   their reaction to a challenger's demands. Legitimation strategies do so
   through principled persuasion, where defenders come to believe that
   accepting a challenger's demands will have both material and symbolic
   benefits, and rhetorical coercion, where defenders accept change out of
   fear that they will bear costs by undercutting their own legitimacy. Not
   all challengers effectively legitimate their demands, however. A
   challenger's capacity to affect change depends on its position within
   institutions, which gives it the authority to effectively deploy
   rhetoric. I demonstrate this argument with a brief case of Japan's
   challenge to the unequal treaty system in the late 19th century.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Weber, this study tests whether the normative principles of
   merit orientation and impartiality are more prevalent in shaping public
   hiring preferences among civil servants-both junior and senior-than
   among private sector employees. In a conjoint experiment, respondents
   are asked to compare two hypothetical applicants for an office job in a
   municipal administration and to decide which they would hire. The
   application profiles vary with respect to a set of meritocratic and
   nonmeritocratic attributes. The empirical findings suggest that first,
   in all three samples, hiring decisions are primarily based on
   meritocratic attributes. Second, there is evidence of ethnic
   discrimination in the private employee sample, while there is no such
   effect in either of the two civil servant samples. Third, private
   employees' hiring preferences are influenced by personal political
   beliefs, while civil servants are less likely to let political attitudes
   affect their hiring choices. Thus, while civil servants hiring
   preferences are largely consistent with passive representation and
   nondiscrimination, support for a representative bureaucracy among
   citizens should be improved.},

Abstract = {The article points to the forms of commercial companies and
   partnerships, provided for in Polish law, i.e. the Act of 2000
   Commercial Companies Code in conjunction with the provisions of the Act
   of 1996 on municipal services management, that can be used by a commune
   to run municipal services management - in particular in the procedure of
   their incorporation or accession to them by the commune (or holding
   their shares) - both in the public sphere and outside that sphere,
   taking into account the diverse views expressed in the literature so far
   relating to that issues, and extended from March 2021 based on the Act
   of 2019 amending the Commercial Companies Code with simple joint stock
   company, a catalogue of commercial companies and partnerships in
   general, the legal relationship between the provisions of Articles 2, 9
   and 10 Act on municipal economy, the specific conditions for the
   incorporation (and acceding to) by the commune (or holding share rights)
   of commercial companies/partnerships outside the public service sphere,
   as well as related legal categories of companies/partnerships acting for
   the benefit of local government and other companies/partnerships
   important for the development of the commune, as well as proposals for
   the law as it should stand (de lege ferenda) in this area.},

Abstract = {This article, focusing on Italy, aims to broaden our understanding of
   the recent striking electoral fortunes of (differing types of) populism
   in the country, by locating them within multiple crises (political,
   economic, migration) that have shocked Europe in the last two decades.
   By combining individual-level survey data on voters with
   organizational-level interviews conducted with national and local
   representatives and activists of the Five Star Movement and the League,
   the role played by these crises in the two different Italian populisms
   will be disentangled from `demand' and `supply' perspectives - which are
   usually treated in isolation. The findings indicate a coherence between
   the political parties' message and their respective potential voters'
   orientations and attitudes (with regard to the three crises),
   underlining the ability of different varieties of populism to intercept
   (and mobilize) different grievances: whereas the economic crisis of
   representation is a key ingredient of both the populists' success, the
   cultural crisis is more salient for the exclusionary populist League,
   while the political crisis is more salient for the inclusionary 5SM. For
   both the mobilization and representation of those citizens unsatisfied
   with traditional politics seems crucial. These different causes of
   success appear to be a useful lens through which to examine the failure
   of an attempt to govern by combining two differing types of populism.},

Abstract = {Most citizens agree that legislators should reflect their
   constituencies' stances. Yet constituents rarely speak in a single
   voice. Instead, constituents often vary not only in their policy
   preferences, but also in the degree to which a given policy impacts
   their lives. Politicians thus at times pursue targeted representation,
   offering increased input to especially affected groups. As efforts to
   address anti-Black police misconduct make clear, such measures can
   protect vulnerable minority groups-but they may also be perceived to
   sideline the less-affected majority. We fielded two national survey
   experiments to investigate how Americans respond when legislators give
   more attention to some citizens than others. Results suggest that
   members of targeted groups react more positively on average than
   nonmembers and that reactions among nonmembers are strongly driven by
   racial resentment. The impact of racial resentment is largely unaffected
   by the race and partisanship of the politician proposing the measure,
   but it is exacerbated in cases of a clear preference conflict between
   the African American community and the broader constituency.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {As far as local governments are responsible for the practical
   implementation of many European Union (EU) policies, they codetermine
   member states' EU compliance records and the fate of EU legislation.
   Yet, they do so in remarkably different ways, as exemplified by the
   variegated implementation of the Ambient Air Quality Directive
   2008/50/EC by Dutch municipalities. Taking guidance from the literature
   on EU compliance, in this article we explain the differences in local
   implementation performance based on the political and managerial
   approaches. Understanding which of the two approaches drives different
   local responses to EU policy bears consequences for the appropriate
   remedy for nonimplementation. Four municipalities were purposefully
   selected along with the two-by-two implementation performance scoring
   matrix in the realm of air quality. A comparative within-case analysis
   specifies how political explanations outweigh managerial explanations in
   accounting for variation in implementation performance and distils
   `policy saliency' as the driving causal mechanism.},

Abstract = {Regional conflicts increasingly require multilevel efforts by regional,
   subregional, and international actors. When states are confronted with a
   cooperation problem, often there are several institutions available to
   address this issue. Drawing on the literature of overlapping regionalism
   and forum-shopping, we argue that existing explanatory models benefit
   from adding power-based explanations. By conceptualizing an
   issue-specific dimension and factors specific to the national
   environment as additional power-based criteria for forum-shopping, we
   expand the existing literature. Applying our framework to the response
   to the Boko Haram uprising, our study examines why Nigeria preferred
   specific regional entities to others. We find that Nigerian resistance
   toward external intervention and hegemonic interests inherent in
   national elites as power-based aspects of forum-shopping explain the
   counterintuitive creation of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF)
   under the umbrella of the rather unknown Lake Chad Bassin Commission
   (LCBC) instead of reliance on the Economic Community of West African
   States (ECOWAS) or the African Union (AU) as important security
   providers in Africa.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent global uptick in white supremacist terrorism,
   governments continue to face accusations of not taking the threat
   seriously, either discursively or in terms of policy responses. Why do
   acts of white supremacist violence consistently fail to constitute
   turning points for policy change? Rather than considering acts of
   political violence as critical junctures for change, I argue that such
   acts instead reveal how persistent institutions of power actually are. I
   develop a theory of hegemonic components of national identity that links
   institutionalized white supremacy to the differential treatment of
   non-white perpetrators, even when they are deemed terrorists, through a
   process of institutional reproduction. Drawing on interviews with German
   national security elites, I show that even when white supremacist
   violence is treated as terrorism, both legally and discursively, it does
   not engender policy responses and attitudinal changes on par with those
   following other terrorist threats.},

Abstract = {Dr. Strangelove continues to be viewed as one of the most acclaimed
   films of all-time. Likewise, international relations (IR) experts
   commonly list the film among the most essential IR-themed movies. The IR
   scholars who discuss Dr. Strangelove as a text or recommend it for
   courses generally claim that it can be used to explain nuclear
   deterrence, the security dilemma, mutually assured destruction, Cold War
   competition, and various other traditional serious concerns of the
   field. They also recognize that the satirical film is critical of
   nuclear strategy. This article considers Dr. Strangelove's sexual
   subtext, involving important metaphors and symbols that IR scholars
   characteristically ignore. Yet, for decades, film critics and scholars
   from other disciplines have identified and emphasized the importance of
   the film's comedic ``sexual framework{''} and concluding ``wargasm.{''}
   Director Stanley Kubrick even acknowledged these key elements in private
   correspondence. The film suggests that the national security
   establishment's masculine view of the utility of nuclear weapons and
   deterrence are comparable to absurd male sexual fantasies. Feminist IR
   scholars frequently note that mainstream scholars largely ignore their
   critique of masculine views of the discipline and nuclear strategy. The
   article concludes that scholars in the field should both prioritize Dr.
   Strangelove's sexual subtext and rely upon feminist contributions to
   help understand those elements.},

Abstract = {Why do governments send their soldiers abroad for military training?
   Governments frequently expose their troops to training offered by other
   countries, although this may undermine military control and even lead to
   coups. Focusing on the demand side of security assistance, I argue that
   governments accept these costs to achieve diplomatic and military goals.
   Governments first send some soldiers abroad to substantiate their
   cooperation with the host country. Once this diplomatic commitment is
   made, governments increase training rates to counter threats using
   military skills unavailable at home. I test both arguments by studying
   training patterns at the most notorious US training facility: the School
   of the Americas. Using original data based on more than 60,700 course
   attendance records between 1946 and 2004, I find support for the
   proposed diplomatic and military logics of foreign training. Governments
   were more likely to send soldiers to the school after they had aligned
   their foreign policy with that of the United States, and only increased
   training in response to insurgent attacks. The findings demonstrate why
   and when governments are willing to cede significant parts of their
   political power to foreign-trained soldiers and other states. This has
   important implications for understanding military effectiveness and
   security cooperation.},

Abstract = {Developing nations demand a different scholarly approach in the field of
   public administration. We advance an agenda for research that stands on
   four pillars. First, in the absence of easily accessible data scholars
   of developing world public administration must assemble it for
   themselves. Second, building and testing theory plays a paramount role
   because researchers face limited information. Third, in developing
   countries, multi-national and non-governmental organizations are often
   crucial and must be considered in studying public administration.
   Fourth, given the novelties and ambiguities researchers face,
   qualitative information must be integrated throughout the research
   process. Our article-and the articles in this volume-constitute a call
   for developing country research to contribute to the study of public
   administration writ large, informing our understanding of both
   developing and developed states.},

Abstract = {Research on innovation in government often focuses on ideas introduced
   by senior leaders or managers, but ideas from public servants themselves
   are an important and underexplored channel for improving performance in
   government bureaucracies. We provide new evidence on the potential for
   bottom-up work process innovation, using data from 744 individual and
   team innovation plans and 51 qualitative interviews in Ghana's civil
   service. In contrast to common negative stereotypes of developing
   country bureaucrats, most officials do have meaningful ideas for
   improving performance. However, the overwhelming constraint to voicing
   these ideas is hostility by supervisors to new ideas from their
   subordinates. We argue that this anecdotally common yet understudied
   behavior is consistent with theories of psychological attachment to
   hierarchy rather than alternative theories rooted in material,
   structural, or cultural resistance to employee voice and innovation. We
   discuss implications for bottom-up work process innovation in government
   and interventions to promote it.},

Abstract = {While there is growing interest in the relationship between
   pathogen-avoidance motivations and partisanship, the extant findings
   remain contradictory and suffer from a number of methodological
   limitations related to measurement and internal and external validity.
   We address these limitations and marshal the most complete test to date
   of the relationship between the behavioral immune system and
   partisanship, as indexed by which party people identify with and vote
   for. Using a unique research design, including multiple well-powered,
   nationally representative samples from the United States and Denmark
   collected in election and nonelection contexts, our study is the first
   to establish in cross-national data a consistent, substantial, and
   replicable connection between deep-seated pathogen-avoidance motivations
   and socially conservative party preferences across multiple validated
   measures of individual differences in disgust sensitivity and using
   large representative samples. We explore the relative contribution of
   the pathogen-avoidance model and sexual strategies for accounting for
   this relationship.},

Abstract = {Studying collaborative governance has become a booming business.
   However, the empirical literature still struggles to produce robust
   generalizations and cumulative knowledge that link contextual,
   situational and institutional design factors to processes and outcomes.
   We still have not mustered the broad and deep evidence base that will
   really help us sort fact from fiction and identify more and less
   productive approaches to collaboration. The current empirical evidence
   in the study of collaborative governance consists chiefly of small-N
   case studies or large-N surveys. The challenge is to move from
   case-based, mid-range theory building to more largeN-driven systematic
   theory-testing, while also retaining the rich contextual and process
   insights that only small-N studies tend to yield. This article, and the
   articles in the accompanying special issue, introduces an attempt to
   provide this middle ground - the Collaborative Governance Case Database.
   The database has been developed to serve as a free common pool resource
   for researchers to systematically collect and compare high-quality
   collaborative governance case studies. This article is an introduction
   to the database, exploring its design, opportunities and limitations.
   This article is also an invitation; inviting all researchers to freely
   use the cases in the database for their own research interest and to
   help strengthening the database by adding new cases there are eager to
   share with colleagues.},

Abstract = {Throughout the European Parliament's nearly forty years of existence,
   electoral turnout in European parliamentary elections has consistently
   been lower than electoral turnout in the national elections of the
   member states. This is particularly the case for the majority of states
   in Eastern Europe where turnout in European elections has resulted in
   low electoral participation of eligible voters. Focusing on the 2014
   election to the European Parliament, we highlight that low
   election-specific knowledge contributes to these low participation
   rates. In more detail, we rely on name recognition of the main
   candidates of the three main party groups, and show that knowledge of
   these candidates is more than twice as high in Western Europe as in
   Eastern Europe. Second, we illustrate that these low knowledge levels in
   the East also help explain the larger turnout gap between national and
   European elections in the East.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how corporations appear in media coverage on six
   policy domains through a complexity lens in two major British newspapers
   between 2012 and 2017. Corporations are often thought to avoid press
   coverage, though another strand of literature indicates that they
   dominate the news compared to other organized interests. We argue that
   corporations use multiple lobby strategies including media strategies in
   order to maximize influence. They do so to signal technical expertise to
   specific constituencies that is not necessarily accessible to the
   general public. The results show that corporations are more likely to be
   involved in news coverage that is technical in nature which is an
   important finding as it tells us more about the media involvement of key
   players in the political process. Yet, this coverage is not necessarily
   less accessible which is a positive finding for the functioning of our
   democracies.},

Abstract = {This article breaks new ground by revisiting the Multiple Streams
   Framework as central public policy theory and modifying it to take into
   account multilevel reinforcing dynamics. This is important as it allows
   policy change to be explained more accurately given the empirical
   interdependencies between policy-making on the national, regional (e.g.,
   European) and international levels, which so far have not been
   sufficiently taken into account by traditional public policy theories.
   It process-traces how EU-level policies motivated by energy security
   considerations and global climate leadership ambitions influenced
   international-level agenda-setting. Global climate change commitments in
   turn influenced European renewable energy and climate policy. Such
   multilevel reinforcing dynamics were central for the 2009 European
   Renewable Energy Directive, the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework and
   the 2050 European Green Deal proposal to emerge and subsequently
   facilitated the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which in turn
   motivated developed and developing countries to legislate and implement
   climate and renewable energy policies.},

Abstract = {During the recent European refugee crisis, more than two million people
   applied for asylum in Germany. Female applicants stand a higher chance
   to gain protection than male applicants. Whilst small on average, this
   gender gap in asylum recognition rates varies strongly across countries
   of origin which has remained little noticed. We analyse the gender gap
   in asylum recognition rates for the 56 major countries of origin of
   refugees whose asylum claims are decided on over the period 2012-2018.
   We show that both general or gender-unspecific human rights abuses and
   gender-specific human rights violations are associated with
   cross-country variation in the gender gap in recognition rates - but in
   opposite ways. Specifically, we find that the gender gap is lower for
   refugees coming from countries with worse general human rights abuses in
   the form of political terror perpetrated by state agents but is higher
   for refugees from countries with a higher prevalence of female genital
   mutilation and a higher prevalence of child marriage.},

Abstract = {The shattering Ottoman order in the early nineteenth century offers an
   intriguing puzzle about the behaviors of subordinates within declining
   hierarchical orders. While Greece, Egypt, and many other provinces
   challenged the Porte, Algiers preferred to remain within the Ottoman
   order. The puzzle turns into a riddle when considering that Algeria was
   bounded to the center in a loose way and uprising against the Porte was
   less risky and less costly. Why did a geographically remote and loosely
   integrated subordinate remain within the Ottoman hierarchical order at a
   time when well-integrated and geographically close subordinates, one
   after another, picked the challenge option? This paper proposes three
   factors, which may be more generally applicable to the clients of
   declining patrons: the inability of the Porte to force Algeria against
   its interests, which decreased the costs of continued allegiance;
   Algeria's need for a balancer against threats from European naval
   powers, which the Porte provided; and the domestic political legitimacy
   that allegiance to the Porte also provided to Algeria's rulers.},

Abstract = {The concept of the personalization of politics has become increasingly
   popular when studying current political systems. Despite the growing
   scholarly interest in the personalization of politics in the European
   Union, the institutional sphere of politics has remained rather
   neglected. The aim of this article is to evaluate whether there is a
   personalization of politics at the institutional level of the European
   Commission (EC). Based on quantitative and qualitative content analysis
   of the documents that govern the functioning of the EC (since the early
   1990s), this article finds that in general, it is possible to observe a
   tendency towards adopting more personalized reforms in the EC. Moreover,
   personalized reforms clearly led to enhancing the role of the EC
   President. This article supplements previous findings by concluding that
   in many cases, the enhancement of the President's position has taken
   place at the expense of the College as a whole.},

Abstract = {In the United States (U.S.) wide differences exist in the environmental
   policies that individual states adopt. To better understand the reason
   for this variation I examine the conditions that shape the roll call
   voting behavior of state lawmakers on environmental policy proposals. I
   examine a variety of potential explanatory factors ranging from
   individual legislator characteristics (e.g., party, ideology and gender)
   and constituency-level conditions (e.g., citizen ideology, demographic
   characteristics and industry employment patterns) to indicators of
   campaign effort (business and pro-environment campaign contributions).
   Analyses of 22 states across four legislative sessions demonstrate
   support for many hypothesized effects. Similar to findings at the
   national level in the U.S. Congress, political party and ideology are
   identified as strong predictors of voting, but additional factors also
   have an influence. For example, the political leanings of district
   voters and activities of environmental interest groups have substantive
   effects on legislative voting patterns.},

Abstract = {This article examines under what conditions armed Islamist groups
   intentionally demilitarize and de-legitimize violence, and under what
   conditions they deprioritize violence temporarily. The central argument
   is that the decision to de-escalate is driven by the interaction between
   political context, organizational dynamics and public attitudes. When
   violence becomes costly and non-violent alternatives are available,
   groups have incentives to pause armed action, but they do not
   necessarily feel the pressure to change their ideological tenets or
   permanently renounce military capabilities. However, when organizational
   weakness reaches a point of crisis, and when the public explicitly
   condemns groups, leaders are faced with a sink or swim scenario that
   forces them to reconsider the role of armed action and the very mission
   of the group. The ability of leaders to impose any changes in the
   behavior, ideology or organizational structure depends on the cohesion
   of the organization. Internal fragmentation can lead to behavioral
   escalation, but it can also eliminate the most hardline elements from a
   group, which facilitates organizational transformations from the top.
   The empirical discussion traces the complete demilitarization and
   renouncement of violence within the Egyptian Gama'a Islamiyah, and the
   more hesitant deprioritization of violence within the Indonesian Jama'a
   Islamiyah.},

Abstract = {Revealing an enduring tension between law and religion and between
   colonial and independence institutions of law and politics, the
   Caribbean functions as a site of contestations over and responses to
   religion, identity, and rights. Both the postcolonial condition in the
   Caribbean and the contestation over the political space have shaped and
   presented challenges for the Caribbean, many of which can be seen in,
   and compared to, other countries in the global South. In light of these
   challenges, this special issue examines the ways in which the
   interrelated forces of faith, colonialism and postcolonial institutions
   have affected Caribbean societies.},

Title = {Land tenure arrangements and rural-to-urban migration: evidence from
   implementation of China's rural land contracting law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {This paper studies how land tenure arrangements will shape China's rural
   land transfer market and labor allocation. Based on data from the
   Chinese Household Income Project (2002) and the China Family Panel
   Studies (2010 and 2012), we use fixed effect models and
   difference-in-differences method to investigate the effects of the
   implementation of Rural Land Contracting Law on villagers' behavioral
   patterns in land transfer and rural-to-urban migration. Our empirical
   evidence shows that the introduction of Rural Land Contracting Law led
   peasants to actively rent out their contracted land, significantly
   increasing their agricultural income, and thus reducing the
   rural-to-urban migration. These findings demonstrate the `push and pull'
   migration theory in the Chinese context, and have important policy
   implications for the ongoing reform of Chinese rural land property
   rights.},

Abstract = {Within this article, we explore how third-party knowledge of ongoing
   conflicts shapes the ability of mediators to successful end conflicts
   through negotiated settlements. Since the primary role of mediators is
   to share information, and combatants have incentives to misrepresent
   information, contextual knowledge about the conflict and actors is
   critical. We argue that experienced diplomats with greater knowledge of
   the civil war state, close knowledge of the combatants, and connections
   with civil society are less vulnerable and more effective in mediation
   efforts. We propose that third parties seeking a diplomatic solution to
   ongoing conflicts may be more successful when they maintain strong
   diplomatic knowledge of the disputants as well as knowledge of the
   processes by which previous mediation efforts have attempted to resolve
   the dispute. Using a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model on peace
   agreements from 1989 to 2005, we find strong support that diplomatic
   knowledge matters significantly.},

Abstract = {Suppose the present generation leaves future ones with a world depleted
   of all the natural resources required for many valuable human pursuits.
   Has the present generation acted unjustly? According to contemporary
   theories of liberal egalitarian intragenerational and intergenerational
   justice, the answer, it appears, is no. The explanation for this verdict
   lies in the liberal commitment to remaining neutral between different
   ways of life: many value-laden environmental sites and species are not
   an all-purpose means to any reasonable human end and so their existence
   is not directly relevant in an assessment of whether justice obtains.
   Against this view, I argue that a commitment to neutrality and its
   underlying justification - the idea that individuals should be equipped
   to live lives of their own design - in fact supports the opposite
   conclusion. If justice requires that citizens can pursue whatever way of
   life they do or might value, then it will also demand the continued
   existence of the natural resources necessary for those pursuits.},

Abstract = {To determine to what extent politicians publicly discuss environmental
   issues in line with public opinion and economic characteristics of their
   constituents, we conducted a computational text analysis of the
   115(th)House of Representatives' tweets about environmental issues. In
   polarized U.S. environmental politics, many Republicans attack the
   authority of scientists and regulators but some signal a desire for
   bipartisan policy compromises. Analyzing district characteristics and
   environmental communication on Twitter reveals that nominally
   pro-environment Republicans representing more moderate constituents fail
   to oppose their partisan colleagues, particularly during the Trump
   administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. At the same time,
   very few openly attacked climate science; instead, House Republicans
   primarily focused attention on fossil fuels, the Environmental
   Protection Agency and the right of the federal government to regulate
   economic activity. The `Waters of the United States' served as a
   rallying cry for opposition to environmental regulation in the
   115(th)House of Representatives.},

Abstract = {Extant scholarship on interstate war and conflict resolution
   predominantly utilizes formal models, case studies, and statistical
   models with wars as the unit of analysis to assess the impact of
   battlefield activity on war duration and termination. As such,
   longstanding views of war have not been tested systematically using
   intraconflict measures, and deeper studies of war dynamics have also
   been hampered. I address these gaps by creating and introducing the
   Interstate War Battle (IWB) dataset, which captures the outcomes and
   dates of 1,708 battles across 97 interstate wars since 1823. This
   article describes the sources used to create these data, provides
   definitions, and presents descriptive statistics for the basic battle
   data and several daily-level measures constructed from them. I then use
   the data to test the implications of two major theoretical perspectives
   on conflict termination: the informational view, which emphasizes
   convergence in beliefs through battlefield activity; and Zartman's
   ripeness theory, which highlights costly stalemates in fighting. I find
   suggestive evidence for informational views and little support for
   ripeness theory: new battlefield outcomes promote negotiated
   settlements, while battlefield stagnation undermines them. The IWB
   dataset has significant implications, highlights future research topics,
   and motivates a renewed research agenda on the empirical study of
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Adopting an ethical approach to education that focuses on the
   perspective of victims, this article analyzes some of the difficulties
   of acknowledging the victims of political violence in the Basque
   Country. It conceptualizes these difficulties as pathologies of
   recognition and argues that works of literary fiction have humanizing
   and educational value insofar as they reflect the victim's perspective
   and foster the reader's ethical education through narrative imagination.
   As a critical example, the article provides an analysis of four Basque
   literary works of fiction that respond to the pathologies of recognition
   as they narrate various acts of victimization. The transformative
   potential of working with literature that tells stories of victimization
   for politically violent conflicts in the Basque Country and elsewhere is
   highlighted.},

Abstract = {This article deals with some puzzling features in/of contemporary
   Russian collective memory. In terms of methodology, the article is based
   on (1) the idea of the commodification of collective memory and (2) the
   strong interconnections between memory and national identity. While
   analyzing popular, historical, and political narratives such as those
   concerning national celebrations, historical texts, and political
   declarations, I argue that the Ukrainian crisis produced a new type of
   historical consciousness in Russia, which is connected with the
   conservative populist tendency in Russian politics currently. As an
   element of the cultural ``industry,{''} collective memory is connected
   with an asymmetric exchange that appears in the process of mnemonic
   commodification. The surplus value of collective memory is caused by the
   fact that it is used in the process of popular mobilization. I conclude
   that to maintain the regime and to mobilize support, officials aim to
   rebuild Soviet images and promote an alternative to the Western model,
   and that they therefore seek to emphasize traditional values and
   retro-size Russian contemporaneity.},

Abstract = {Understanding the performance of collaborative governance regimes (CGRs)
   necessitates an understanding of how stakeholders and their interactions
   evolve over time. However, few studies assess the evolution of the
   structure or process dynamics of CGRs over time. This paper contributes
   to our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of CGRs. We apply a
   modified grounded theory approach to a dataset of collaboration case
   studies to develop empirically-based theory about how often CGRs persist
   over time, how different components of CGRs evolve over time, what
   conditions support or hinder this evolution, and how different
   developmental trajectories lead to differences in the outputs and
   outcomes achieved by these groups. We find that CGRs follow a variety of
   trajectories, from failing to initiate, to achieving their work in a
   relatively quick time, to sustaining their operations for decades, to
   incurring slow or rapid declines in health. Additionally, many
   characteristics of CGRs, including leadership, collaborative process,
   accountability, and outputs/outcomes, peak at the midpoint of the
   observed time, suggesting that at some point, even stable and healthy
   collaborations incur some decline in their robustness. As an exploratory
   study, this work highlights the need for a better accounting of how CGRs
   develop, sustain, evolve, and decline over time.},

Abstract = {Frontiers of national development and agricultural expansion constitute
   spaces of intense interaction, disputes and contestation. The Brazilian
   economy continues to largely rely on the opening of agribusiness
   frontiers in the west of country and, similar to what happened in the
   past, this is a phenomenon shaped by acute racism and discrimination
   against the Indigenous population. This article is focused on the
   emblematic experienced by the Guarani-Kaiowa on the border between
   Brazil and Paraguay. Their unique socio-spatial trajectory is analysed,
   making use of empirical results and regular visits to Indigenous
   communities. To understand this highly variegated geographical terrain,
   a new spatial typology is introduced. One of the key findings of the
   research is the latent agency by the Guarani-Kaiowa, which emerges from
   attachments to places, heritages and socio-ecological practices that led
   to an ability to take the initiative to advance their cause whenever and
   however the opportunities arise.},

   there are few concerns and researches at present focus on bargaining
   intensity between government and social actors. Therefore, the
   Credibility Thesis is introduced to the policy process in this paper,
   and the differences of credibility perceived by the public, grassroots
   government and intermediate government are supposed to reflect the
   bargaining intensity among them. Based on the adjustability of policy
   targets and credibility differences, policy implementation is divided
   into eight types to explain diverse situations more systemically and
   effectively during policy implementation. Besides, taking prohibition of
   open burning of crop straw policy (POBSP) as an example, this paper
   measures the changes of credibility at three points of time during
   policy implementation and analyzes the bargaining situation among
   farmers and multi-level governments. The case study proves the
   applicability of the theoretical framework of the policy implementation
   based on credibility thesis. It can show the feedback procedure and
   mechanism of policy implementation, and provide a new perspective for
   the policy analysis and improving policy performance.},

Abstract = {A healthy democracy needs citizens to make reflective political
   judgements. Sceptics argue that reflective opinions are either
   nonexistent or rare. Proponents of deliberative democracy suggest that
   democratic deliberation is capable of prompting reflective political
   reasoning among people. Yet, little is known about the mechanisms
   underlying this relationship. This article offers a bridge between
   psychology and political theory and proposes a theory of
   perspective-taking in deliberation. It argues that under the right
   conditions, deliberation induces more reflective judgements by eliciting
   the process of perspective-taking - actively imagining others'
   experiences, perspectives and feelings - in citizen deliberators. Two
   institutional features of deliberative forums are emphasized: the
   presence of a diversity of viewpoints and the interplay of fact-based
   rational argumentation and storytelling. I test the plausibility of this
   theory using a case study - the Irish Citizens' Assembly - thereby,
   relying on qualitative in-depth interview data and quantitative survey
   data. I further substantiate my findings with a laboratory experiment.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Politics and Current
   Demographic Challenges in Central and Eastern Europe,{''} guest-edited
   by Tsveta Petrova and Tomasz Inglot.
   During the past two decades, many European countries, including Germany,
   Italy, and Spain in the west, and Poland and Hungary in the east,
   encountered prolonged demographic crises. These challenges first became
   evident in the late 1990s as fertility rates declined rapidly, much
   below the level necessary to ensure a simple replacement of generations.
   Moreover, since the EU accession, mass labor migration from the new
   Member States to the more developed western European countries added yet
   another dimension to the growing population problems. This article
   attempts to explain variation in governmental policy responses to these
   developments between two countries, Poland and Hungary. Hungary, owing
   to its long-term tradition of relatively generous and extensive social
   programs directed to families, youth, and children, should be expected
   to handle its population emergency much better than Poland. Yet, the
   opposite has happened. In the last few years, Poland has proposed and
   implemented several innovative measures to address fertility and
   migration pressures while Hungary has remained committed to its
   traditional social policies in this domain. I will analyze and compare
   the two cases by examining a combination of historical factors related
   to the legacies of demographic emergencies defined in terms of national
   strength and survival, and by examining the politics of family policy,
   with a special focus on the creation of coalitions of governmental
   and/or nongovernmental actors that either facilitate or obstruct
   effective policy innovation.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies are often described as posing unique challenges for
   public regulators worldwide. Their fast-pace and technical nature are
   viewed as being incompatible with the relatively slow and territorially
   bounded public regulatory processes. In this paper, we argue that not
   all digital technologies pose the same challenges for public regulators.
   We more precisely maintain that the digital technologies' label can be
   quite misleading as it actually represents a wide variety of technical
   artifacts. Based on two dimensions, the level of centralization and
   (im)material nature, we provide a typology of digital technologies that
   importantly highlights how different technical artifacts affect
   differently local, national, regional and global distributions of power.
   While some empower transnational businesses, others can notably
   reinforce states' power. By emphasizing this, our typology contributes
   to ongoing discussions about the global regulation of a digital economy
   and helps us identify the various challenges that it might present for
   public regulators globally. At the same time, it allows us to reinforce
   previous claims that these are importantly, not all new and that they
   often require us to solve traditional cooperation problems.},

Abstract = {Since the crisis over Ukraine erupted, relations between Russia and the
   EU have been characterised by the coexistence of competition and
   cooperation. How can we explain this ambiguity? First, a distinction is
   made between the multi-actor structure of low politics versus polarised
   discursive positions in high politics. Construal-Level Theory is invoked
   to explain how low politics is characterised by concrete images, while
   high politics is characterised by abstract, ideologised images. Second,
   the article considers the interaction between both levels and argues
   that the contagion from more cooperative low level practices to the
   defrosting of EU-Russia relations is unlikely.},

Abstract = {The article furthers the debate on security in the Anthropocene by
   scrutinizing one crucial aspect of it - that is: the relation between
   knowledge, technology and security. For this, it takes the emerging
   debate in International Relations and Critical Security Studies to a
   space that it has so far neglected: the global ocean. Focusing on
   countermeasures against rising jellyfish blooms - from early-warning
   systems to autonomous killer robots - the article studies how digital
   technologies are increasingly being deployed to cope with anthropogenic
   environmental risks. Conceptually, the article develops the notion of
   the Anthropocene ocean. This concept is used to show how complex and
   entangled phenomena - such as jellyfish blooms - challenge existing
   regimes of security as well as underlying forms of knowledge production.
   The analysis shows how attempts to control and manage risks in the ocean
   space are replaced by experimental forms of governance that are enabled
   by digital technologies including big data, machine learning and sensors
   of different kinds. The final part of the article argues that such forms
   of technological experimentation and related knowledge practices are
   underwritten by a logic of geopolitics and war.},

   ways in which the exclusion (and marginalization) of such perspectives
   is achieved. This exclusionary discursive practice is then explained
   through interviews with the team behind the show and the norms and
   constraints that guide the production of the show. The analysis is based
   on Stuart Hall's critical paradigm and, confirming Hall's insights, it
   argues that the show is independent from the dominant political and
   economic forces in Slovakia, yet at the same time the show contributes
   to the functioning of the Slovak public broadcasting service as an
   ideological state apparatus that is biased in favor of the interests of
   economic elites.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have recently observed a `resurgence' of traditional
   political institutions on the constitutional level in Sub-Saharan
   Africa. Yet, the scope and causes of the resurgence remain unclear. We
   base our analysis on original data on the degree of constitutional
   integration of traditional institutions and on their constitutional
   resurgence since 1990 in 45 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. We test six
   theoretical explanations for constitutionalization: former colonial
   rule, democratization, state capacity, economic development, foreign aid
   and settlement patterns. First, we verify the broad resurgence of
   traditional political institutions on a constitutional level. Second,
   our analysis suggests that, particularly in former British colonies,
   traditional leaders were able to translate the arrangements of British
   colonial rule as well as the advantages of a country's deconcentrated
   settlement pattern into greater constitutional status. Third, settlement
   patterns proved important for traditional leaders to gain or increase
   constitutional status - leading to a constitutional resurgence of
   traditional institutions.},

Abstract = {Past research on the relationship between income inequality and turnout
   has produced mixed results, with some studies suggesting that income
   inequality leads to lower turnout while other studies find little or no
   significant effects. In this article, we investigate the extent to which
   these mixed results are due to the contingent nature of inequality on
   turnout, which depends upon the nature of the policy options that are
   presented to the electorate. We test these expectations on data from
   national elections in 30 established democracies from 1965 through 2017
   covering 300 elections. Regression analysis using country-level fixed
   effects reveals consistent evidence in favor of our hypotheses:
   Inequality tends to have a negative impact on turnout, especially in
   depolarized party systems, but as party system polarization increases
   the negative impact of inequality is mitigated.},

Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the effectiveness of political messages
   depends on people's motivations. Yet, studies of politically motivated
   reasoning typically only consider what partisans generally might want to
   believe and do not separately examine the different types of motives
   that likely underlie these wants. The present research explores the
   roles of distinct types of motives in politically motivated thinking and
   identifies the conditions under which motivated reasoners are persuaded
   by political messages. Results of an experiment with a large,
   representative sample of Republicans show that manipulations inducing
   motivations for either (1) forming accurate impressions, (2) affirming
   moral values, or (3) affirming group identity each increased beliefs in
   and intentions to combat human-induced climate change, but only when
   also paired with political messages that are congruent with the induced
   motivation. We also find no evidence of a backlash effect even when
   individuals are provided with clearly uncongenial information and a
   motivation to reject it. Overall, our findings make clear that
   understanding when and why motivated political reasoning occurs requires
   a more complete understanding of both which motivations might be active
   among a group of partisans and how these motivations resonate with the
   messaging they receive.},

Abstract = {When it comes to the status of democracy, the current times present a
   curious chasm: On the one hand, the depoliticization of contemporary
   discourses and institutions has led to both the diagnosis of a factual
   `post-democracy' and a normative legitimacy crisis of democracy; yet on
   the other, there has been a resurgence of normative democratic ideals
   and practical `democratic innovations' in the sphere of civil society.
   This article evaluates the potential of these innovations to engender a
   genuine renewal of democracy. I find that, despite their emancipatory
   underpinnings, most participatory and deliberative innovations fit a
   description of (mere) citizen activation - an elite-led engineering of
   citizen engagement that, beyond the control of citizens themselves, not
   only fails to lead to empowerment, but can even work to perpetuate
   existing structures. In recognition of the ambivalent nature of the
   post-democratic condition, I argue academics and democratic
   practitioners must accept a new, more responsive role in relation to
   citizens and the wider society.},

Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between transnational terrorism and the
   restrictiveness of immigration policies. We argue that transnational
   terrorism may create incentives for governments to implement more
   restrictive migration policies. First, more restrictive policies may
   make terrorism a more costly endeavor, discouraging future terrorist
   activity. Second, voters may hold the government accountable for the
   increased insecurity and economic instability terrorism produces; more
   restrictive migration policies may signal political resolve and meet
   public demand for security-providing policies, consequently reducing the
   government's chances of electoral defeat. We provide an empirical
   analysis of the effect of transnational terrorism on migration policy
   restrictiveness for a sample of 30 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010.
   We find that a greater exposure to transnational terrorism is associated
   with stricter migration controls, but not stricter migration regulations
   regarding eligibility criteria and conditions. This finding is robust to
   different model specifications, estimation methods, operationalizations
   of terrorism, and instrumental-variable approaches. It points to the
   securitization of immigration, providing partial support for the notion
   that transnational terrorism incentivizes migration policy change
   towards greater restrictiveness. However, the policy response appears to
   be surgical (affecting only migration controls) rather than sweeping
   (and thus not influencing broader migration regulations) for the
   countries in our sample.},

Abstract = {The article argues that policymakers often make use of historical
   narratives in order to underpin their foreign policy agenda. It duly
   explores how the structure of such a narrative is realized
   linguistically and illustrates this point by exploring a recent shift in
   Ukrainian foreign policy discourse. It is argued that in order to
   justify its pro-EU foreign policy agenda, the Ukrainian political
   leadership has promoted the understanding that Ukrainians have
   historical experiences that are similar to Europeans and different from
   Russians, and that this justifies Ukraine's aspirations to distance
   itself from Russia and become an EU member.},

Abstract = {This article argues that, at a tactical level, loyalist terrorism in the
   Irish border region between 1972 and 1974 worked. Cross-border attacks
   including bombings in Irish towns prompted the Irish government to
   reinforce security along the border-a long-standing loyalist demand. The
   loyalist campaign led to the IRA embarking on an effort to punish those
   who were believed to have passed information to loyalists, resulting in
   the killing of an Irish Protestant senator and widespread condemnation
   of the organization in the Republic of Ireland. However, short-term
   gains were outweighed by a growing perception among nationalists that
   the British state tolerated or even colluded in such attacks,
   undermining the British Army's campaign to gain trust (and information)
   within the Catholic population of Northern Ireland. The article also
   contends that middle-class loyalists played an important role in
   mobilizing and equipping loyalist paramilitary organizations. It
   concludes that the British Army showed an excessive tolerance of
   loyalists with political capital or ties to the security forces, despite
   evidence that such individuals were directly supporting the activities
   of loyalist paramilitaries.},

Abstract = {The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the
   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army (FARC-EP) faces
   several challenges concerning its implementation. This study explores
   the beliefs and attitudes of citizens from the Colombian Caribbean coast
   vis-a-vis the 2016 peace agreement as well as the first steps in its
   implementation in 2017 identifying barriers that are likely to undermine
   support for long-term peace. We detect a tendency to maintain beliefs
   and attitudes that hinder the de-escalation of the conflict and fuel
   mistrust, mostly linked to the weaponization of the peace process in a
   polarized political context.},

Abstract = {Memories of the past conflicts are a major part of Russian foreign
   policy discourse. Scholarly literature highlighted the widespread use of
   Second World War references in Russian discourse during the Ukraine
   crisis. However, the use of historical memory in the context of Russia's
   intervention in Syria remains underinvestigated. Applying securitisation
   theory, the paper analyses a set of political statements made by Russian
   pro-government and opposition politicians between 2015 and 2018. The
   analysis identifies several ways in which they integrate memory and
   security discourse. These include pro-Kremlin actors' justifications of
   the intervention through references to the War on Terror and Chechen
   Wars; the anti-systemic opposition's de-securitisation of the Syrian
   conflict by exposing manipulative uses of history; and the systemic
   opposition's counter-securitisation of the intervention itself as an
   existential threat to Russia through references to the Soviet-Afghan
   war. The paper concludes by discussing the relationship between
   historical memory and security discourse.},

Abstract = {What have been the consequences of NATO enlargement for European
   security? To the vindication of its critics, the consequences appear
   disastrous. Insecurity pervades Europe while NATO is in crisis with a
   Russia justifiably aggrieved by broken promises and the overreach of
   liberal hegemony. This insecurity is especially troubling because NATO's
   newer commitments are indefensible. In this essay, I evaluate these
   criticisms of NATO enlargement and advance three claims. First,
   intentionally or not, NATO enlargement has fulfilled a reasonable need
   to hedge against Russian resurgence. Critics of NATO enlargement
   themselves conceded that Russia could become revisionist once it
   reconstitutes itself. Second, NATO enlargement still allows for mutually
   beneficial cooperation with Russia. It has not been responsible for
   Russia's internal political development and aggressive foreign policy
   choices. Finally, NATO enlargement does not necessitate expensive
   deterrence measures to secure its most vulnerable members. NATO
   enlargement thus has hugely benefited European security.},

Abstract = {This article examines the narratives, imaginaries, and subjectivities
   that underpin the far-right, ethnic nationalist ``defense leagues{''}
   that have emerged in Australia (and across Europe) in the past decade.
   Referencing three, interrelated nationalist events in Australia-the
   Cronulla Riots, Cronulla Memorial Day, and the ``race-riot{''} that
   occurred in Melbourne on January 5, 2019-I argue that defense leagues
   resist conceptualization through existing theories of nationalism and
   community, including those articulated by Anderson, Hage, and Esposito.
   Drawing on Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, I argue that unlike other
   nationalists, defense nationalists are not primarily concerned with
   realizing their avowed political projects (such as fortifying national
   borders, halting immigration, and preserving so-called national values).
   Instead, they are focused on constructing and enjoying themselves as the
   privileged national subjects who get to do the nation's defending. As I
   elaborate, the enjoyment they derive from defending the nation-which is
   approximate to the Lacanian concept of jouissance-means that
   paradoxically, that which threatens the nation legitimizes and fortifies
   the nationalist, because the more the nation is threatened, the more the
   nationalist's perceived role within it is secured. Ultimately, I argue
   this jouissance salvages a symbolic life within the nation that is
   always-already dead.},

Abstract = {The Sunni `Warm of Syria did not respond to the 2011 revolution in a
   unified fashion. Whereas top scholars gave full support to initial
   protests, others aligned themselves with the regime. Quietism was the
   preferred choice of a third group. Taking the Fatih Institute as a case
   study, this paper presents the differing positions of the Faith scholars
   with their pronounced rationales. Adopting textual and contextual
   analysis, the paper examines these views on the basis of Islamic sources
   on one hand and the realistic situation of the Syrian prolonged crisis
   on the other hand. The paper concludes that the Syrian regime was able
   to exploit religious institutions to propagate its narrative of events.
   Also, co-opted scholars widely vary in their acquiescence and response
   to the regime's demand. More impotently, with the absence of the
   essentially geo-political, and social considerations, the prorevolution
   camp failed to consider the present vs. the expected harm, which
   resulted in massive bloodshed and major upheaval in the Syrian society
   as a whole.},

Abstract = {The presidency of Enrique Pena Nieto was supposed to mark a 180-degree
   turn with respect to the dominant issue of the previous government: the
   war on organized crime. To achieve this, a decision was made to focus on
   structural economic reforms, by expanding the model first implemented in
   the 1980s and that had continued undisturbed over four governments. This
   is despite the fact that over the past thirty years the performance of
   the Mexican economy, together with its socioeconomic impact, has been
   disappointing. This under-performance is all the more marked in light of
   the exceptional conditions in which the global economy developed between
   2000 and 2014, known as the commodities super cycle. This was
   characterized by accelerated growth in China that provided a huge
   stimulus for the demand and prices of raw materials, together with the
   expansion of financial resources from the United States, which led the
   majority of countries in Latin America to grow faster and, above all, to
   do so while reducing poverty and inequality. By contrast, Mexico failed
   to take advantage of the very favorable global economic conditions to
   improve the socioeconomic situation of its population.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the performance of Enrique Pena Nieto's government
   with regard to the fight against corruption. It focuses on understanding
   the origins of the National Anti-Corruption System (SNA), how it is
   structured, and identifying the challenges and possibilities of success
   in the future. Based on a review of the evidence, it proposes that with
   regard to corruption the performance of the Pena Nieto government was
   reactive, incomplete, and limited. The efforts made responded
   principally to the need to placate social discontent, while remaining
   under-resourced and lacking in an effective anti-corruption policy.
   Furthermore, there was no political will to consolidate and improve the
   emerging strategy, or a coalition to ensure its continuity. These
   defects explain why the SNA has failed to consolidate itself, to date,
   as a long-term anti-corruption strategy.},

Abstract = {Rebels often portray themselves as state-like to legitimize their rule,
   yet little is known about their on-the-ground relations with the
   administrators of state power-official bureaucrats. Drawing on internal
   armed group records from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this article
   argues that rebels' state-like image is more than a simple veneer:
   Bureaucrats actively sustain state institutions and recruit rebel
   support during war. It develops a theory of the sources of leverage that
   bureaucrats use to negotiate with rebels. These interactions entail dual
   struggles to sustain the structures and symbols of state power and to
   shape the distribution of control over these institutions during war. On
   first front, bureaucrats can use their official status to market the
   symbols of state legitimacy-official certificates, codes, and
   paperwork-to rebels. On a second, to recruit protection for
   administrative posts. Pre-existing routines of noncompliance, like
   parallel taxes and sabotaged information, can use bureaucratic
   discretion and opacity to limit rebels' takeover of state structures.
   This view from the ground demonstrates the real-time continuity of
   bureaucratic practice through daily paperwork and exchange during war.
   It contributes to research on rebel governance by illustrating new
   competitions for wartime statehood and illustrates the empirical
   practices of states seen as `juridical' or weak.},

Abstract = {Competitive grants are increasingly used to induce proactive
   collaborative action by a range of actors to reduce forest wildfire
   risks. Given the rigidity of past wildfire risk governance, it is
   important to assess the adaptability of competitive grants as a new
   governance approach. Adaptive governance theory is used as a lens to
   assess the adaptability of the Colorado Wildfire Risk Reduction Grant
   (WRRG) program, which awards funds to successful applicants to reduce
   fuel on non-federal lands at a community scale. Four best practices from
   the theory were applied: participation of and collaboration among
   diverse actors; co-production of knowledge and learning toward adaptive
   management; cross-scale interactions and fit between the scale of
   governance and the scale of the ecological problem; and the capacity for
   innovation and re-organization. Using data and information about the
   WRRG structure and processes, awarded grantees from the first five
   granting cycles from 2013 to 2016, our direct participation-observation
   as part of the Advisory Committee, and results from the WRRG
   effectiveness monitoring report, we examine the extent to which the WRRG
   program exhibited adaptive governance attributes. For each adaptive
   governance attribute, we found evidence of factors facilitating and
   frustrating adaptiveness of the WRRG program. We situate our findings
   within the broader context of using competitive grants as a forest
   wildfire risk governance approach and address additional directions for
   adaptive governance research.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, scholars have examined the role policy transfer
   has had on the development of environmental policies across the globe.
   The literature in this area has discussed everything from the movement
   of cap-and-trade policies to the movement of rain barrels. As the name
   `policy transfer' implies, studies tend to focus on the successful
   movement of a policy or program. Part of the reason for this focus is
   that studies tend to neglect the role power and time play in the
   transfer process. To begin addressing this, the concepts of power most
   commonly associated with the three faces of power debate and ideas of
   political time, policy time and `chronological' time (i.e. timing,
   tempo, time) can help explain a range of environmental transfers (or
   non-transfers) better than the existing literature.},

Abstract = {France's interventions in Mali and the wider Sahel appear to mark a new
   departure in French military policy in terms of the approach to
   multilateralism adopted, the regionalisation of the response, and the
   levels of violence deployed. Yet how `new' is this approach, when set
   against the historical backdrop of French military interventions in
   Africa? Should it be seen as a modified version - an adaptation - of the
   new type of multilateral engagement that emerged in the wake of the 1994
   Rwandan genocide? Using a historical institutionalist lens, employing
   the notions of critical junctures, `layering', and `drift', this article
   briefly sets out the unilateral approach that marked French military
   policy in Africa prior to 1994 before going on to analyse the
   multilateral approach and associated path-dependent practices that
   emerged after the Rwandan genocide. Drawing on elite interviews in
   Europe, the US and Africa, the article shows that, while France's
   engagement in the Sahel is characterised by an ostensibly novel
   multilateral approach, it does in fact combine new and old norms, ideas
   and practices.},

Abstract = {How should alliance patterns respond to changing relative power? If
   states ally against the greatest threat, they should switch alliances if
   a shift in relative power makes a new state more threatening than the
   previous adversary. For some states, a ``threat transition{''} will
   occur when the risk of a preventive war from the declining state falls
   below the risk of a revisionist war from the rising state, prompting a
   switch from the rising to the declining state. Such a threat transition
   may occur before, after or even in the absence of a power transition, in
   which the second-ranked state overtakes the most powerful state in the
   system. I present a model of alliance choice over time with changing
   relative power that develops the dynamic balance of threat perspective.
   I then discuss US-Chinese-Russian relations as an illustration of the
   model.},

Abstract = {A weasel word is a term used in academic or political discourse whose
   meaning is so imprecise or badly defined that it impedes the formulation
   of coherent thought on the subject to which it is applied, or leads to
   unsubstantiated conclusions. In this symposium we consider several key
   terms central to the study of postcommunist politics and discuss the
   extent to which they fall into this category. The terms discussed here
   include regime terminology, the notion of postcommunism, the geographic
   entity ``Eurasia,{''} socialism, populism, and neoliberalism. While the
   authors come to different conclusions about the extent to which these
   terms are weasel words, they also provide pointers for how to deploy
   terms in ways that are consistent with the underlying concept and thus
   aid in the cumulation of knowledge about the region.},

Abstract = {Research on jihadist online propaganda (JOP) tends to focus on the
   production, content, and dissemination of jihadist online messages.
   Correspondingly, the target of JOP-that is, the audience-has thus far
   attracted little scholarly attention. This article seeks to redress this
   neglect by focusing on how audiences respond to jihadist online
   messaging. It presents the findings of an online pilot survey testing
   audience responses to clips from English-language Islamic State of Iraq
   and Syria videos. The survey was beset at every stage by ethical, legal,
   and practical restrictions, and we discuss how these compromised our
   results and what this means for those attempting to do research in this
   highly sensitive area.},

Abstract = {Politicisation in the EU is mostly analysed as a domestic-level process
   constraining EU-level actors. Yet EU actors also engage in strategic
   politicisation management. This article theorises the conditions under
   which EU actors engage in either depoliticisation or politicisation
   strategies when they react to bottom-up pressures. It stipulates that
   politicisation management depends on the actors and issue context in
   question. Elected EU actors choose politicisation strategies, in
   particular if they represent challenger parties, deal with domestically
   salient and core state policies and are close to elections. By contrast,
   unelected EU actors prefer depoliticisation strategies except in the
   context of inter-institutional conflict. The politicisation of high-risk
   policies also produces depoliticisation. Recent empirical studies
   provide support to these conjectures and suggest that strategic
   politicisation management allows EU actors to maintain considerable room
   of manoeuvre.},

Abstract = {Since 2019, the Arctic Council claims to be ``the preeminent
   intergovernmental forum for the Arctic region{''}. This wording raises
   the question about the nature and the importance of the Arctic Council.
   We address these two aspects in order to assess the veracity of this
   claim, twenty-five years after the establishment of the Arctic Council.
   While it appears that the expression ``intergovernmental forum{''} no
   longer captures the complex nature of the Arctic Council, the Council
   does manage to position itself as a key player on Arctic issues.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-115},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Punctuated equilibrium theory seeks to explain policy volatility and
   stability in government attention. In previous research into the
   temporal dynamics of punctuations, scholars found that punctuations
   occur in clusters - a recent budgetary punctuation increases the
   likelihood of a subsequent punctuation. This article examines the
   direction, positive or negative, of budgetary punctuations over time.
   Are budgetary punctuations corrective, grouping positive and negative
   changes? Or, do budgetary punctuations occur in cumulative trends of
   positive or negative changes? These questions address the heart of the
   theoretical metaphor for punctuated equilibrium. In an analysis of over
   1,000 Texas school districts for nearly a 20-year-period, results
   support the notion of reactive patterns of budgetary punctuations -
   positive and negative budgetary punctuations pair up at a rate much
   higher than expected by chance. The findings demonstrate that even
   though it is likely to see consecutive positive and negative
   punctuations, they are not always fully corrective.},

Abstract = {This study explores youth accuracy judgments of disinformative and
   nondisinformative claims. Analyses are based on a nationally
   representative youth (16-20 years old) survey experiment conducted in
   the Czech Republic in 2017. When they were exposed to posts regarding
   refugee crisis, young people were asked to judge the accuracy of the
   statements accompanying the posts. Motivated reasoning of youth depended
   primarily on the alignment with the posts and the ideology of
   participants. Results of this research suggest that motivated reasoning
   works differently for liberals and conservatives. Perceived amount of
   media literacy training does not seem to affect directional motivation.
   General trust works as moderator of motivated reasoning and, in
   combination with ideology, appears to be important for understanding
   directional motivation when exposed to disinformation.},

Abstract = {CVE is a diverse policy space involving efforts to build cohesive
   communities, support young people who are vulnerable to radicalization,
   and deradicalize convicted terrorism offenders. Recently, the public
   health model of disease prevention has become an influential framework
   for understanding these diverse components. In this paper, I argue that
   crime prevention should be preferred as a conceptual framework for CVE.
   I offer a criminological framework encompassing situational prevention,
   developmental prevention, community crime prevention, third-party
   policing and procedural justice policing. I develop these concepts into
   an agenda for crime prevention research in CVE. I also briefly outline
   some of the lessons that the evidence base from criminology may provide
   when designing CVE programs and policy.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Though violence is very much prevalent in modern organizations,
   unfortunately, researchers and practitioners have given very little
   attention in creating an organizational culture based on nonviolence.
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between
   individual spirituality and non-violence work behaviour. It also
   investigates the mediating role of four constructs of psychological
   capital (hope, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy).
   Design/methodology/approach
   Collected data is subjected to rigorous reliability, validity and common
   method biasness tests. Further mediation is analyzed with the help of
   hierarchical regression, Sobel test and bootstrapping estimates.
   Findings
   The results show that all four dimensions of psychological capital
   partially mediate the relationship of individual spirituality and
   non-violent behaviour at the workplace. The practical and theoretical
   implications of the study are also discussed.
   Social implications
   The primary objective of the study is to foster conflict prevention in
   society rather than conflict resolution. With the help of the study, the
   authors understand the importance of spiritual intervention and its
   impact on the elevation of people's values, beliefs and attitudes. Major
   organisations such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have
   already started to develop spiritual interventions at their workplace.
   It is an excellent time to capitalize on India's rich spiritual
   tradition that honours unity in diversity. Besides, an organization's
   facilitation to connect to employee's actions with spiritual values can
   overcome cultural conditioning that triggers violence and help in making
   a more meaningful place to work. Thus, impacting the society from a
   macro perspective.
   Originality/value
   This is one of the pioneer studies that tried to unlock the
   ``black-box{''} of mechanism through which individual spirituality
   impacts non-violent work behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the political dynamics shaping policy agendas
   and prescriptions in international organisations (IOs). It elucidates
   the interactions of Brazil's state and non-state actors with
   international bureaucrats, and their role in framing the strategy and
   recommendations promoted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and
   Portuguese-speaking Community of Countries regarding the challenge of
   tackling food insecurity. The research builds on semi-structured
   interviews and a significant number of institutional documents, and
   combines constructivist international relations theory and sociological
   approaches to policy transfer/diffusion to explore the circulatory
   processes of policymaking. Aside from enhancing understanding of the
   micro-dynamics of framing and diffusion of policy ideas and
   prescriptions in IOs, the article provides information on the
   dissemination of policy solutions from the global south towards IOs and
   subsequently, to other developing countries.},

Title = {The Mediating Role of Information Search in the Relationship Between
   Prejudice and Voting Behavior},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evidence on the extent to which prejudice serves as a barrier to black
   and Latino candidates for office is mixed. Some research has found that
   black and Latino candidates are disadvantaged in terms of their chances
   of winning election and that they are evaluated differently by voters,
   while other findings suggest that this may not be the case. This article
   examines the effects of racial prejudice on candidate evaluation and
   voting behavior. It uses a unique experimental design to test for direct
   effects of prejudice on candidate evaluation and voting behavior, as
   well as indirect effects of prejudice on these variables via the
   information that subjects seek out. I find that subjects higher in
   symbolic racism are less likely to vote ``correctly{''} when their
   preferences most closely align with a black or Latino candidate and that
   they rate minority candidates more negatively than their white
   counterparts. I also find that subjects high in prejudice search for
   less information about minority candidates and that this less robust
   information search mediates the relationship between prejudice and
   candidate evaluation and vote measures. Results also suggest that
   increased information search may mitigate the effects of prejudice on
   correct voting.},

Abstract = {US policy toward the People's Republic of China (PRC) has come under
   increasing attack in Washington, as a growing chorus of analysts paints
   the PRC has a revisionist power seeking to undercut existing
   multilateral institutions. We observe, however, that China's approach to
   multilateralism varies across different issue areas, and we argue and
   show that China's approach differs depending on the strategic landscape
   of any given context. We conclude that it is thus a mistake to view
   China through a single lens as either a `revisionist' or a `status-quo'
   power.},

Title = {Populist Nationalism and the Challenges of Divided Nationhood: The
   Politics of Migration, Mobility, and Demography in Post-2010 Hungary},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {962-983},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article uses the case of post-2010 Hungary to investigate the ways
   in which the concomitant trends of mobility, migration, and demographic
   decline may intersect to both challenge and bolster the discourses and
   policies of nationalist, populist governments in Central and Eastern
   Europe today. Using an expanded conception of ``divided nationhood,{''}
   it explores the tensions and continuities in the Hungarian government's
   populist discourse of protecting the nation as it is projected onto
   different national populations: Hungarians within Hungary, Hungarian
   emigrants, and Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries. While
   fears of migration and population decline provide useful fuel for the
   particular brand of populist nationalism we see in places like Hungary,
   the ability of leaders to offer a coherent and effective narrative of
   protection for the nation becomes significantly more complex when there
   are multiple internal and external populations to protect. The article
   highlights the strategies that the FIDESZ government has employed in
   order to (1) mobilize antimigrant rhetoric while marginalizing Hungarian
   emigrants; (2) respond to demographic deficiencies while supporting a
   conservative, populist narrative; and (3) maintain its access to
   symbolic, political, and demographic resources within the Hungarian
   minority communities. These strategies include a discursive
   reconceptualization of migration as something that comes only from
   outside Europe, the use of social and economic policies to selectively
   privilege key segments of the nation and exclude others, and the
   creation of a regional Hungarian nation with Budapest at the center.},

Abstract = {What explains divergent levels of support for welfare spending in a
   non-Western authoritarian state? Can self-interest and ideology, two
   major theoretical frameworks from cross-national research, explain
   attitudinal patterns in China? Using data collected from an original
   survey in two provinces in 2017, we examined urban Chinese attitudes
   toward welfare spending. We focused on three social policy domains with
   distinctive characteristics: education, healthcare, and poverty
   alleviation. All domains received fairly high levels of support for
   increased spending from our sample. Our regression models suggest that
   self-interest and ideology are both associated with welfare attitudes in
   urban China, but self-interest variables operate in unexpected ways,
   reflecting the distinctive socio-economic and cultural context in which
   welfare attitudes are formed. This study concludes with broad policy
   implications for social policy reform in China.},

Abstract = {This essay begins with a celebration of the concept of hope. The essay
   then moves into examining the author's personal doubts in sustaining her
   own commitment to the idea of hope. The question is asked: how to
   maintain the attitude that hope is real against the disciplinary
   imperatives and vocabulary of security as inevitably about conflict? The
   essay uses the image of gas-masks taken from the World War I exhibition
   at the Australian War Memorial. Using this image the essay explores
   choices, both historical and contemporary, over the reality of the
   security we choose to speak about, and, in the words of Laura Shepherd,
   `commit' to. The image and essay work to reclaim hope, from personal
   doubt, as real.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {West Africa witnessed many violent rebel movements in the post-cold war
   era, some of which led to protracted conflicts in countries like Liberia
   and Sierra Leone. In the post-9/11 era, Muslim extremist movements have
   emerged. While the scholarship on the past ``conventional{''} rebel
   movements mostly understood them in their local socio-political
   contexts, Muslim extremist groups have been dominantly interpreted in
   the context of the global ``war on terrorism.{''} This is mainly due to
   the latter's unique use of a unique form of violence (terror), its
   religious narrative, and its external links to other groups in other
   countries. This article interrogates this different understanding of
   conventional and religious types of anti-state rebellion in West Africa
   through a comparative study of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia
   (1989-1997), and the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. After a
   synthesisation of four key questions, the article concludes that Muslim
   extremist groups in West Africa are not any different from past rebel
   movements. Muslim extremist groups, just like past movements, are much
   more rational in the local West African contexts than it is dominantly
   acknowledged in peace and security scholarship and practice.},

Abstract = {This article examines the legacies of radical and terrorist pasts in
   Jozef Pilsudski's ``moral dictatorship{''} in interwar Poland. Leading
   figures of Pilsudki's government had been involved in the fight for
   Polish independence already during the years of the Russian Revolution
   of 1905. They joined the radical fighting squads of the Polish Socialist
   Party and participated in acts of political and economic terror.
   Exploring in detail the terrorist past of these later statesmen this
   article argues that their terrorist backgrounds were reflected in and
   shaped the nature of Pilsudki's leadership.},

Pages = {61-68},
Abstract = {This chapter presents evidence from Latin America in relation to the
   core principles and values of the political settings of well-being in
   the region. First, the Latin American Buen Vivir approach to well-being
   is discussed, and links to other approaches to well-being (such as
   Aristotelian ethics and Communitarianism) are explored. Next, the
   constitutions of a selection of Latin American countries are examined,
   with the aim of identifying the central principles of political
   conceptions of well-being. Evidence from the World Values Survey
   provides another perspective on the mass priorities of different
   countries in this region. The Latin American philosophy of buen vivir is
   a conception of the good that sees human beings as one part of a complex
   system of life, and human well-being as co-extensive with the well-being
   of the entire system. The buen vivir philosophy is based on radically
   different assumptions to conceptions of the good found elsewhere. Social
   relationships, the Natural environment, and connection to a higher
   dimension of truth and spirituality are the cornerstone values of buen
   vivir. The World Values Survey shows that social relationships,
   particularly family relationships, are at the heart of well-being in the
   countries studied.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the relation between the 2008 European financial
   crisis and firms' cash holding policies from a precautionary motive
   perspective. After considering how the European financial crisis
   affected the cash holding policy across different period times, we focus
   on whether these variations come from changes in precautionary motives.
   We find a positive effect for the short crisis period and a negative
   effect for long crisis period for the full sample. We also find evidence
   that for financially constrained firms, the relation between cash
   volatility and cash holding is positive for short crisis period but
   turns negative for the long crisis period.},

Abstract = {The contribution of Daniel Guerin (1904-1988) to the `rehabilitation' of
   anarchism in the 1960s is well known, as is his commitment to
   anticolonialism and gay liberation. Based on biographical research on
   Guerin's early years examining the reasons for his `conversion' to
   revolutionary politics (given his social origins in the Parisian grande
   bourgeoisie), this chapter asks to what extent we can say that his
   political commitments from 1930 onwards were motivated or underlain by
   religious or spiritual ideas, or represented some kind of political or
   secular religion. Using unpublished archival sources as well as Guerin's
   autobiographical and fictional writings, I examine the various childhood
   influences on his ethical and spiritual ideas, especially his discovery
   as a teenager of Tolstoy and his close friendship during the 1920s with
   the novelist Francois Mauriac, as evidenced in their correspondence,
   which makes clear the spiritual crisis Guerin struggled through as he
   sought to reconcile his concern with sexual liberation, his evident
   fideistic tendencies, and the reactionary stance of the Catholic church.
   Moral outrage and guilt over his own privileges led him to seek
   redemption through a Gandhian `religion of service', putting himself at
   the service of the Revolution (with a capital R) in order to help the
   oppressed and exploited achieve liberation. Love ('fraternity', `mana')
   was central to his thinking and to his responses to others' suffering;
   for him it was constitutive of what it is to be human and therefore
   enabled self-realisation through `merging with the people'. This faith
   in Revolution is an aspect of what Gentile calls a `religion of
   humanity', and of what Aron referred to as a `secular religion' - a
   doctrine that promises ultimate salvation, but in this world.},

Abstract = {Informed by an understanding that the quest for autonomy can serve as a
   compass of Brazil's foreign policy, this paper undertakes an extensive
   interpretative analysis of the concept in relation to the
   agency/structure debate. Our aim is to use these theoretical tools to
   analyse Brazil's international action during the 21st century, paying
   special attention to Bolsonaro's administration. This article argues
   that we are witnessing a dual break in autonomy: an essentially
   structural break related to the underlying trends currently redesigning
   the international world as we know it, and another more agential break,
   resulting from president Bolsonaro's particular worldview.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This article uses the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method to
   examine the combinations of conditions that explain the length of World
   Trade Organization (WTO) disputes that invoke General Agreement on Trade
   and Tariffs' (GATT) General Exceptions (Article XX). Using the Brazil-EC
   controversy over retreaded tires as an example, the work underscores the
   importance of the mobilization of civil society organizations such as
   NGOs and think tanks in association with power asymmetry and/or veto
   players. The article contributes to understanding the causal complexity
   and empirical heterogeneity of ``exceptional{''} disputes (disputes in
   which a party invokes GATT's General Exceptions).},
