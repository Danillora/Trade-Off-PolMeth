Abstract = {Internal political efficacy (that is, beliefs about one's ability to
   process and participate effectively in politics) is known to be shaped
   by factors such as levels of interest in politics, trust in institutions
   and awareness of political developments and debates. In this article, we
   show that the task environment also has an impact on internal political
   efficacy, and that little research has been done on this issue. We draw
   on data from focus groups in Australia, where citizens were asked to
   make political judgements in contrasting task environments: state
   elections and the 2017 same-sex marriage plebiscite. We examine four
   features of task environments: framing choice; issue content; the nature
   of available cues; and whether the task environment stimulates cognitive
   effort. We conclude that concerns about the internal political efficacy
   of voters should be addressed by exploring how the task environment
   created for political choice might be made more amenable in order to
   improve the political judgement of citizens.},

Abstract = {It is often assumed that the market economy and the open society
   reinforce each other and have risen together. Even those who are more
   skeptical about their long-run compatibility will usually agree that the
   rise of the two was part of a process of modernization, starting in
   early modern England and unfolding in the modern West. This article
   builds on the latest historical research to reject this assumption. It
   shows that several market economies existed much earlier in history.
   These were all preceded by social movements generating a more open
   society. In each of these cases, the functioning of the market economy
   slowly eroded social and, next, political openness, and later shriveled
   itself again. This endogenous, cycle-like process, in which the
   interaction of the market economy and the open society developed from
   positive to negative, may also be seen in modern cases, including the
   present USA.},

Title = {Evolution of Japan's ``misplacement{''}: from Meiji Restoration to the
   post-Cold War},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 JUN 29},
Abstract = {This article argues that since the Meiji Restoration, the degree of
   Japan's misplacement has changed, depending on its structural power to
   shape the concept of the region, ``Asia{''}. The degree of a ``misplaced
   state{''} is thus not static, but elastic, and such a status is not a
   permanent attribute of the state. In fact, from the Meiji Restoration to
   the present, Japan experienced a number of national and international
   turning points. These historical traits can be categorized into three
   periods: from the Meiji Restoration to the Pacific War, post-World War
   II to the end of the Cold War, and post-Cold War to the present. In each
   period, Japan faced a different concept of ``Asia{''} and attempted to
   modify its identity and roles, and experienced hard misplacement in the
   pre-World War II period as well as soft misplacement in the Cold War
   period, before it experienced relative well-placement in the post-Cold
   War period to previous two periods.},

Abstract = {Trust is a key component of democratic decision-making and becomes even
   more salient in highly technical policy areas, where the public relies
   heavily on experts for decision making and on the information provided
   by federal agencies. Research to date has not examined whether the
   members of the public place different levels of trust in the various
   agencies that operate within the same policy subsystem, especially in a
   highly technical subsystem such as that of nuclear energy and waste
   management. This paper explores public trust in multiple agencies
   operating within the same subsystem, trust in each agency relative to
   aggregate trust across agencies that operate within the nuclear waste
   subsystem, and trust in alternative agencies that have been suggested as
   possible players in the decision-making process. We find that trust
   accorded to different federal agencies within the nuclear waste
   subsystem varies. The variation in trust is systematically associated
   with multiple factors, including basic trust in government, perceptions
   about the risks and benefits of nuclear energy/waste management, party
   identification, and education. These findings have significant
   implications for research on public trust in specific government
   agencies, alternative policy entities, and for policy makers who want to
   design robust and successful policies and programs in highly technical
   policy domains.},

Abstract = {This thesis analyzed the cross-section data of 630 non-financial listed
   enterprises and adopts a logit model to estimate the relationships
   between political relations and corporate environmental behavior. The
   paper also adopts an ordered logit method to estimate the marginal
   impact of political connections to enterprises' disclosure of
   information on environment and sustainable development. Through
   analysis, this thesis found that political connections lower the
   probability for enterprises to disclose information on environment and
   sustainable development. With the Level III scoring method, this article
   classified the performances of disclosing corporate environmental
   information into three levels. It is found that corporate political
   connections increase the probability for enterprises not to disclose any
   environmental information and lower the probability for enterprises to
   refer to GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.},

Abstract = {Previous research on the causes of domestic terrorism has tended to
   focus on domestic determinants. Although this approach can be helpful to
   understand many causes of terrorism, it implicitly disregards how the
   tactical choices made by similar nonstate actors elsewhere influence a
   group's decision to resort to terrorist tactics. This study argues that
   the adoption of terrorism among ethnic and ethnoreligious groups results
   from a process of conditional emulation. Groups are more likely to
   emulate the terrorist choice of others with whom they are connected by
   shared political grievances and spatial networks. The theory is tested
   on a new and original group-level data set of ethnic and ethnoreligious
   terrorism (1970 to 2009) using geospatial analysis and spatial
   econometric models. The results provide strong support for the
   hypothesized mechanism leading to the diffusion of terrorism and suggest
   that emulation-more than domestic and contextual factors-substantially
   influences dissidents' tactic choice.},

Abstract = {Examination of the indigenous issue under the Evo Morales government in
   the framework of class struggle points to the weakening of the labor
   movement with the implantation of neoliberal measures in the late 1980s
   and the rise of the indigenous movement. The constituent assembly
   restored the democratic illusions weakened by the upheavals of 2000 and
   2003. Its predominantly indigenous and peasant composition brought the
   agrarian question and the recognition of indigenous nationalities to the
   center of the debate. This experience did not and could not change the
   class nature of the state. The maintenance and defense of large private
   capitalist property is incompatible with a practice of national
   sovereignty and self-determination of indigenous nationalities. Um exame
   a questao indigena sob o governo Evo Morales nos marcos da luta de
   classes aponta o enfraquecimento do movimento operario com a implantacao
   de medidas neoliberais nos fins dos anos 1980 e a ascensao o movimento
   indigena. A constituinte recompos as ilusoes democraticas enfraquecidas
   com os levantes de 2000 e 2003. A composicao predominantemente indigena
   e camponesa da assembleia constituinte e a presenca das suas
   organizacoes no processo traziam para o centro do debate a solucao da
   questao agraria e do reconhecimento das nacionalidades indigenas. Esta
   experiencia nao modificou e nem poderia modificar a natureza de classe
   do Estado. A manutencao e defesa da grande propriedade privada
   capitalista sao incompativeis com uma pratica de soberania nacional e
   autodeterminacao das nacionalidades indigenas.},

Abstract = {Through the lens of modernization theories, the process of European
   integration can be perceived as Poland's second modernization, following
   the systemic transformation in the nineties. In this article, we analyze
   the divergent perceptions of the European Union, and attitudes toward
   European integration, as they coexist within contemporary Polish
   society. We introduce the notion of European integration as a triple
   modernization, encompassing economic, institutional, and cultural
   changes. Using a mixed methods approach based on qualitative and
   quantitative data from the European Values Study 2017, we demonstrate
   that Poles generally accept the peripheral status of Poland in the
   economic context and expect financial support from the core of the EU.
   Simultaneously, within the cultural context, there exists a marginal but
   salient attitude that is based on opposition toward cultural pressures
   and on a claim to an active role in the shaping of the European
   axiological agenda. Distinguishing the three aspects of this general
   process of European integration allows for the identification of the
   source of tensions that are described in literature as cross-European
   populist tendencies to question the very idea of European integration in
   member societies of the EU.},

Abstract = {This article applies a dialogical analysis to the change processes
   involved in moving from engagement with to disengagement from an armed
   militant group, as well as from radicalization to deradicalization. The
   findings underline the interplay between different push and pull factors
   at individual, organizational, and societal levels that played a role in
   the already mentioned processes in three periods of time-engagement
   with, life within, and disengagement from an armed organization. The
   dialogical framework conceptualizes the development trajectory as
   relationships between a variety of positions of the self (I-positions),
   which generate different personal meanings involved in processes of
   disengagement and deradicalization.},

Abstract = {This article explores why citizens favor protection despite the economic
   case for free trade. It argues that due to a lack of training and in an
   environment of stable prices, many individuals are not aware of the
   consumption benefits. Even when they are aware, citizens tend to
   discount these benefits due to media coverage of the employment costs
   and loss aversion. The article presents survey evidence from an American
   sample, showing that a belief in lost jobs is more strongly associated
   with trade preferences than a belief in lower prices. Given that the
   former pushes citizens toward less favorable trade attitudes, it also
   presents evidence from a priming experiment, testing if attitudes can be
   moved in a more favorable direction with positive information. Factual
   information about the consumer benefits has no effect, but information
   about the employment effects shifts attitudes positively. In the present
   environment, it thus appears more effective to prime pro-trade attitudes
   by appealing to jobs than to prices.},

Abstract = {Political parties play an important role in offering voters some choices
   about European Union (EU) politics. The literature on party positions on
   European integration rely largely, from a methodological point of view,
   on coding of manifestos and expert surveys. This paper opts for a
   different approach to the study of party positions on European
   integration based on the analysis of metaphors used by parties in their
   discourse about the future form of European integration. Although
   analysis of metaphors has been providing an increasingly popular tool
   for examining international politics since the early 1990s, its
   application to studies of European integration and the EU has been much
   scarcer. On the basis of key conceptual metaphors used in discourses on
   the future of the EU that we identified from the relevant literature as
   well as the corpus itself, we analyse Czech parties' Euromanifestos
   issued between 2004 and 2014. The analysis is subsequently projected
   onto party positions on European integration and Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship has demonstrated that shaming by human rights
   organizations produces economic consequences. For example, human rights
   shaming by international organizations negatively affects foreign direct
   investment (FDI), decreases exports, and redirects foreign aid received.
   The relationship between shaming and sovereign credit, however, has yet
   to be studied. States greatly rely on their ability to access cheap
   international credit, as evidenced by the fact that newly issued
   sovereign debt outpaced new foreign investment by almost \$3 trillion in
   2017. Understanding the relationship between human rights-related
   advocacy efforts and a state's access to this valuable source of capital
   is critical for recognizing the effects naming and shaming can have on
   creditors. We therefore ask: Does naming and shaming by human rights
   organizations have a negative impact on the target state's sovereign
   credit rating? We find that increased naming and shaming leads to a
   decrease in a state's sovereign credit rating.},

   insight on our new digital reality. The papers in this Special Issue
   showcase both the methodological pluralism that flourishes in

   place digital media in a wider theoretical context, sharpen our
   understanding of the Internet's worst features, and show the way forward
   to a better design for digital public engagement. Whether online or

Abstract = {This paper integrates some of Anthony F. C. Wallace's most important
   ideas about culture change with some of Melanie Klein's best-known work
   on psychologically primitive (or early) mental states. The purpose of
   the paper is twofold. First, viewing what Wallace termed `revitalization
   movements' through a Kleinian lens reveals that such movements are often
   far less adaptive and therapeutic than Wallace's work generally
   indicates.(1) 1 A. F. C. Wallace, `Revitalization Movements', American
   Anthropologist, 58: 2 (1956). Second, and more importantly, viewing
   these movements from a Kleinian perspective highlights the parallels
   between them and contemporary religious movements frequently described
   as `fundamentalist,' especially Christian, Islamic, and Jewish
   movements.(2) 2 R. T. Antoun, Understanding Fundamentalism: Christian,
   Islamic, and Jewish Movements, 2nd ed. (Lanham: Rowan \& Littlefield
   Publishing Group, Inc., 2008). Also C. B. Strozier, D. M. Terman \& J.
   Jones, The Fundamentalist Mindset (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
   2010). In the course of developing these arguments, the paper suggests
   that although the works of Wallace and Klein now appear dated, scholars
   interested in understanding new movements motivated by a felt need to
   purify and revitalize what some perceive as a corrupted culture might
   profit from revisiting and synthesizing these works.},

Abstract = {Journalists covering environmental issues around the globe are at
   heightened risk of murder, arrest, assault, threats, self-exile,
   lawsuits, and harassment because environmental controversies often
   involve influential business and economic interests, political power
   battles, criminal activities, and corruption, plus politically,
   culturally, and economically sensitive issues concerning Indigenous
   rights to land and natural resources. This study uses in-depth
   interviews with journalists and other experts to explore such
   situations, including the psychological effects on these journalists'
   sense of mission and professional practices. Interviewees generally did
   not seek therapy or counseling after their adverse experiences. Those
   experiences led some journalists to change their careers but
   strengthened the professional commitment that other journalists feel.},

Abstract = {Amidst calls for more scrutiny of the failure of infrastructure
   public-private partnerships (PPPs), uncertainty about how we can measure
   failure remains, and little systematic evidence illuminates its
   likelihood. Our mixed-methods design explores the notion of failure and
   identifies the conditions under which it happens. The first phase of our
   research employs documentary analysis and semistructured expert
   interviews, and identifies project cancellation as capturing the most
   severe occurrences of failure. A second phase statistically analyzes a
   unique World Bank data set capturing the provisions of over 4,000
   infrastructure PPPs launched between 1990 and 2015 in 89 countries. We
   find robust evidence supporting the theoretical claim that PPPs are less
   likely to be canceled in countries with more veto points among their
   political institutions to restrain politicians from intervening in
   policy implementation. Cancellation is a rare, but valid indicator of
   failure, and the importance of veto players clarifies how political risk
   operates in this context.},

Abstract = {The PKK's gender policy, which includes maintaining a fighting force
   that is 40\% female and the promotion of women's liberation as a key
   component of its political platform, makes the PKK an outlier among both
   Kurdish nationalist groups and leftist armed movements in the Middle
   East. Based on interviews with members of the PKK's allied civilian
   political movement and former PKK combatants, this paper argues that
   rather than being a function of the PKK's ethnic or ideological
   identities, this policy emerged as a result of a confluence of four
   other factors: the PKK's leftist ideology, the preferences of its
   leadership, and the need to recruit selectively all served as permissive
   factors. Ultimately, however, it was the greater participation of
   Kurdish women as a result of Turkish state violence in the Kurdish
   southeast in the 1980s that ultimately changed the PKK from within.},

Abstract = {The civil conflict in Colombia has gained attention in part for the
   inclusion of women in rebel forces and peace negotiations between the
   government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
   Scholarship has often explained the FARC's decision to mobilize women as
   both an ideological and tactical move, designed to increase the ranks of
   the organization and signal commitment to leftist principles. In this
   paper, I argue that the incorporation of women into Colombia's civil war
   is better understood by viewing the country's various leftist armed
   movements (including the ELN, EPL, and M-19) through a comparative
   framework. By applying the theoretical concept of outbidding, I argue
   that the mobilization and expansion of women's roles in Colombian armed
   groups was in fact an intersubjective process, driven by competition
   among leftist movements existing in a crowded marketplace. In contrast
   to alternative explanations that focus on mobilization as an
   elite-driven process, I argue that the outbidding dynamic exposes agency
   among women recruited to these groups and demonstrates the potential for
   women to create strategic openings in times of conflict.},

Abstract = {This article responds to Acharya's call to integrate deep area studies
   knowledge and methods into a global IR by presenting the findings of an
   empirical enquiry into the concept of civilization in Turkish Islamist
   thought. It delves into primary and secondary sources, in English and
   Turkish and in particular into the works of a number of emblematic
   Islamist thinkers in Republican (post-1923) Turkey, to show that their
   approach to `Islamic civilization' is defined through nineteenth
   century, modern concepts, shared with so-called Western thinkers and
   contexts. The conclusions of the study constitute the basis for a
   critique of the culturalist perspective in IR which treats cultural and
   civilizational differences as foundational or even immutable. The
   article posits, instead, that a truly global IR can only be developed if
   it is underpinned by the concepts of global modernity and global history
   (as proposed by Buzan and Lawson, among other IR theorists and
   historians), across an imagined `East' and `West'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of business, through the World Gold
   Council, in the evolution of the Conflict-free Gold Standard (CFGS).
   Using document analysis of meeting minutes, augmented by interviews with
   key participants, it is demonstrated that through the use of structural
   and discursive power, mining firms were able to socialise other actors
   (governments and NGOs) into accepting a business-friendly standard.
   During the consultation process, the standard was weakened sufficiently
   as to allow business to continue to pursue opportunities in conflict
   zones. It is argued that the CFGS does little to address the issue of
   mine site conflict, but instead serves as a mechanism to reassure gold
   investors and consumers. The paper concludes that the Conflict-free Gold
   Standard, like many private governance initiatives, is unlikely to
   address the issue it purports to. And, that, firms' contribution to
   global governance should be cautiously viewed in this light.},

Abstract = {Democracies do not take up arms against each other. Although this axiom
   has attained the status of a mantra in the field of international
   relations, this statement is much more complex than it appears, in part
   because it is highly contingent on the definitions and
   operationalizations of both democracy and conflict. This article
   revisits democratic peace theory, combining both institutional
   constraints and similarity-based arguments. Interactions between the
   democratic level of the dyad (the average democratic level of its
   members) and its democratic spread (difference between the democratic
   scores of its members) create a dyadic triangle that encompasses all
   possible combinations of cases, revisiting which dyads are more prone to
   conflict. The findings partially confirm and partially refute both the
   institutional constraints and the similarity-based arguments, leading to
   a nuanced alternative theory: the Interactive Model of Democratic Peace.
   Akin to democratic peace theory, our evidence shows that the higher a
   dyad's level of democracy is, the lower the probability of fatal
   militarized interstate disputes between that pair of states. However,
   contrary to democratic peace theory, we find that dissimilar-regime
   dyads can still be peaceful as long as they have a high mean of
   democracy. Following the theory of regime similarity, we consider the
   democratic spread of each dyad, but we find that being similar is not a
   sufficient condition for peace between the members of a dyad. From the
   empirical evidence, the article derives three heuristic zones of
   conflict, filling much of the gray area that has been left unexplained
   by previous models.},

Abstract = {While ex-combatant reintegration is vital to successful transitions from
   war to peace, some former fighters turn to crime following
   demobilization. Such criminality undermines the consolidation of
   political order. Leading theories of crime participation emphasize the
   role of both individual economic opportunities and factors related to
   social ties. Yet, we still know little about the social logic of
   ex-combatant criminality and how social and economic factors relate as
   drivers of crime participation. This article presents a theory of how
   wartime social ties - namely, vertical ties to former commanders and
   horizontal ties to ex-combatant peers - influence ex-combatant crime on
   their own and via their relationship to economic opportunity costs. We
   use the theory to derive predictions in the context of Colombia, and
   then test them with a combination of administrative data and
   high-quality original survey data. We find that both vertical and
   horizontal wartime ties are powerful drivers of ex-combatant
   criminality. Our evidence indicates that wartime ties mitigate the risks
   of criminal behavior by facilitating the transmission of criminal
   capabilities and pro-crime social norms. We do not find that economic
   conditions moderate the effect of wartime times nor do we find any
   indication that economic opportunity costs, on their own, predict
   criminality. These findings underscore the importance of wartime ties -
   both vertical and horizontal - to understanding post-conflict
   transitions and designing reintegration interventions.},

Abstract = {This paper contends that despite it functioning as a catalyst, the ICC
   ``Africa problem{''} did not start with the arrest warrant against
   al-Bashir. To fully comprehend the current legitimacy crisis we must
   understand the nature of the negotiation process that led to the
   adoption of the Rome Statute and its enduring impact. In particular, we
   must acknowledge the uneven ability of states to formulate and signify
   their preferences on the basis of their identity and interests during
   the negotiation process. Drawing from Wiener's theory of contestation,
   the paper contends that the absence of meaningful engagement with issues
   germane to some ICC stakeholders before and during the Rome Conference
   facilitated the adoption of the Rome Statute, but also plausibly created
   difficulties for the Court in the long run. Specifically, it postponed
   unavoidable conflict over contentious issues and undermined the
   likelihood that specific stakeholders would develop a sense of ownership
   over the Statute.},

Abstract = {Why does Europe - or anyone for that matter - want to increase its
   power? To get more resources? Increase its security? Enhance its global
   prestige? Protect itself from unforeseeable risks that could completely
   change the status quo? All of the above? The US seeks to preserve its
   power and insulate itself from risks by supporting a strong and open
   economy, by maintaining an overpowering military capability, by
   promoting cutting-edge technology and by underwriting a democratic
   society that can self-renew by remaining open to immigrants
   (notwithstanding the policies of the current administration). China has
   been using its exponential economic growth and single party control of
   power to oversee an expansion in its military and technological power,
   simultaneously mobilizing a vast resource of labor by means of a
   population transfer from the countryside to cities on a scale that is
   larger than the world has ever seen.},

   sustainable transition},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {435-456},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The concept of a `just transition' positions justice concerns of
   workers, front-line communities, and other marginalized groups at the
   center of sustainability efforts. However, related scholarship has
   largely neglected conflicts that arise between sustainability and
   justice goals. A framework is developed to identify three main tensions
   that planners and activists may encounter in efforts to advance a just
   transition. First, the `sustainability-inclusivity' tension involves
   conflicts between rapid and bold policy action in time-sensitive
   contexts and inclusive governance processes. Second, the
   `sustainability-recognition' tension involves conflicts between
   sustainability performance and recognition of diverse value systems and
   rights. Third, the `sustainability-equity' tension involves conflicts
   between achieving sustainability performance and equitable distribution
   of benefits and burdens. Identifying and intentionally responding to
   such tensions is crucial to advance a just transition in the context of
   growing domestic and international inequality, the erosion of worker
   rights, and a warming climate.},

   between business and governmental authorities in the regulatory process
   of an emerging business model: sharing economy. Focusing on bike sharing
   system, the study also investigates the conflict-handling strategy of
   bike sharing companies and government regulation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An evolutionary game model is introduced to illustrate the interactive
   conflict between bike sharing companies and government regulation,
   combined with system dynamics (SD) to simulate the evolutionary
   conflict-handling strategies between the two players.
   Findings
   The dynamic strategies of the two players are observed, and under five
   conditions the conflict outcomes are evolutionary stable states.
   Simulations show that each party sacrifices part of its interest and
   adjust its strategy according to that of the other, indicating the
   conflict-handling strategy as a compromising mode. Furthermore, the
   strategies of bike sharing companies are sensitive to additional
   operation and maintenance costs for producing low-quality bicycles and
   costs of positive regulation, which provides theoretical guidance for
   regulatory authorities.
   Originality/value
   The station-less bike sharing come up in China recently, and it is an
   important research field of entrepreneurship. Owing to the uniqueness
   and novelty of the phenomenon, conflicts and challenges exist during the
   regulation process. Thus, the study practically contributes to the
   conflict-handling strategies of businesses and government under the
   context of sharing economy. Methodologically, as a novel issue with less
   available data to carry out empirical research, this study combines
   evolutionary game theory with SD to shed light on the complex
   interactions between businesses and government. The research method can
   be applied to other entrepreneurial studies.},

Abstract = {The use of specialised prison units (SPUs) as a means of countering
   violent extremism and radicalisation is growing in popularity in many
   jurisdictions. Yet, little is known about their ability to prevent
   radicalisation in the long term, limit the spread of violent extremism,
   or promote de-radicalisation and disengagement. This paper begins to
   explore these issues by reflecting on the over 40 years of experience
   that Northern Ireland (NI) has had in this area. It is argued that the
   international community tends to have an incomplete understanding of: a)
   why SPUs were created and installed in NI; b) how their regime,
   conditions, and underlying rationale changed over time; and c) the
   long-term consequences that SPUs have had on the spread of violent
   extremism, de-radicalisation, and disengagement. This paper seeks to
   make an original contribution to this literature by highlighting the
   role psychological, situational, social, and political factors played in
   shaping the effectiveness of SPUs in NI. By providing a more in-depth
   analysis of why SPUs in NI entrenched extremism rather than promoted
   disengagement or de-radicalisation, other jurisdictions will be
   encouraged to reflect on how these factors may affect the success of
   their own SPUs in countering violent extremism.},

   shows that social movements can also use strategic ignorance to support
   their environmental claims and that mastering the pace of the
   controversy and the policy debates enabled actors to better support
   their policy claims. The French case illustrates those two arguments
   while the Quebec case provides a more tradition account of
   State/Industry's utilization of knowledge production to delay decision
   and divert opposition.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we address the ambivalence in European immigrant
   integration discourses toward the political participation of immigrants.
   We show how this ambivalence manifests in what we call a `participation
   paradox', which is constituted by two apparently conflicting, but
   potentially mutually reinforcing characteristics of the discourse. The
   first emphasizes the need for immigrants to be active in order to attain
   a well-integrated society and well-functioning democratic polity; the
   second is a call for the protection of liberal democratic institutions
   from the alleged `illiberal threats' that migrants pose to society.
   Immigrant participation is thus both demanded and feared. Using
   illustrations from Denmark, we show two different ways in which this
   paradox plays out in practice: i) the fear of participation results in
   debates around the general desirability of immigrant participation; and
   ii) the perceived threat of `undesired participation' reinforces the
   demand for immigrants to be `good' citizens by participating in a
   `civic' way. In these cases, the content of immigrant participation is
   discursively restricted. We end the paper by exploring the consequences
   of the paradox in terms of the democratic position of immigrants.},

Abstract = {Globally, environmental overexploitation and degradation constitute both
   threats to human development and sources of tension and conflicts. In
   Nigeria, the degradation of the Niger Delta environment by oil
   production has exacerbated long-standing grievances among communities
   competing for scarce resources. This article seeks to examine the
   theoretical and existential explanations for the mobilisation by groups
   from Nigeria's oil-producing communities to pursue armed struggle in
   engaging with the Nigerian state and multinational oil companies. Using
   10 focus groups with 85 participants, the author tests the argument that
   violent conflicts in the Niger Delta are related to the negative
   pressures placed on the environment and communities by pollution of land
   and water resources by oil production. These pressures expose the
   population of the area to poverty, hunger, malnutrition, anxiety,
   distrust and violence. The ensuing widening inequalities have spawned
   simmering grievances, a survivalist culture and a politics of ethnic
   mobilisation.},

Abstract = {Much research following Kaufman's classic study Are Government
   Organizations Immortal? has investigated the claim that government
   agencies enjoy great security and long life. Less attention has been
   paid to Kaufman's thesis that government agencies facing a termination
   threat have strong incentives to react. In a study of the on-going
   Norwegian local government amalgamation reform, we demonstrate that this
   type of government agency reacts by hoarding (i.e., a last-minute flurry
   of spending) when faced with a termination threat. This finding shows
   that agencies facing termination threats are active players in the
   termination game. We discuss implications for research on agency
   termination and design implications for reformers of the public sector.},

Title = {The Political Viability of Carbon Pricing: Policy Design and Framing in
   British Columbia and California},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {140-173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The adoption of climate policies with visible, substantial costs for
   households is uncommon because of expected political backlash, but
   British Columbia's carbon tax and California's cap-and-trade program
   imposed such costs and still survived vigorous opposition. To explain
   these outcomes, this article tests hypotheses concerning policy design,
   framing, energy prices, and elections. It conducts universalizing and
   variation-finding comparisons across three subcases in the two
   jurisdictions and uses primary sources to carry out process tracing
   involving mechanisms of public opinion and elite position-taking. The
   article finds strong support for the timing of independent energy price
   changes, exogenous causes of election results, reducing the visibility
   of carbon pricing, and using public-benefit justifications, as well as
   some support for making concessions to voters. By contrast, the effects
   of the use of revenue, industry exemptions/compensations, and making
   polluters pay are not uniform, because the effects of revenue use depend
   on how it is embedded in coalition building efforts and a middle path
   between exempting or compensating industry and burdening it appears to
   be more effective than pursuing just one or the other approach.},

Abstract = {This paper claims that although Nepal-China relation, at present, is
   more government to government, Nepal-China ties are not free from the
   influence of the people-to-people (P2P) relations. The paper argues
   whether P2P relations have helped to strengthen the diplomatic,
   political and economic relations between Nepal and China, or not. In
   addition, the paper also discusses whether P2P relations have been
   enhanced by China-led Belt and Road Initiatives, as Nepal is also a
   member of BRI, and in addition, P2P is one of the pillars of BRI. Also,
   the write-up describes the significant roles that diaspora,
   connectivity, religion, myths and histories have played to shape the P2P
   relations between Nepal and China. The paper concludes by saying that
   P2P relation between Nepal and China is itself driven by the interest of
   the two states, unlike the P2P that Nepal has with India, which often
   influences the interests of the two states.},

Title = {France's military operations in Africa: Between institutional pragmatism
   and agnosticism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {534-559},

Abstract = {This article examines France's institutional preferences in the context
   of its military operations in Africa. It argues that, if France had its
   multilateral moment in the 1990s and 2000s, it has since become
   institutionally agnostic. Institutional agnosticism means that France no
   longer has strong institutional preferences when running military
   operations; instead, it has over the last six or seven years opted for
   various frameworks based on a pragmatic analysis of what institutions -
   the UN, the EU, the G5 Sahel or regional organisations - bring. France
   is opportunistic as it wants to keep open all options while retaining
   the right to run unilateral missions. The first part presents the
   evolution of French military operations over time and how they have
   become increasingly multilateral after the end of the Cold War. The
   second part aims to unpack why France has embraced multilateralism,
   identifying three main issues: multilateralism as burden-sharing,
   multilateralism as legitimacy provider, and the African continent as a
   theatre for the operationalisation of the EU's Common Security and
   Defence Policy. In the third part, the article looks at why France has
   become institutionally agnostic and why it continues to run national
   operations as a consequence of institutional agnosticism.},

Abstract = {While much focus has remained on the concept of cyberwar, what we have
   been observing in actual cyber behaviour are campaigns comprised of
   linked cyber operations, with the specific objective of achieving
   strategic outcomes without the need of armed attack. These campaigns are
   not simply transitory clever tactics, but strategic in intent. This
   article examines strategic cyber competition and reveals how the
   adoption of a different construct can pivot both explanation and policy
   prescription. Strategy must be unshackled from the presumption that it
   deals only with the realm of coercion, militarised crisis, and war in
   cyberspace.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, China has increasingly resorted to top-down, ``blunt
   force{''} solutions to environmental problems; officials forcibly
   shutter or destroy factories to reduce pollution, at immense cost to
   local growth and employment. Why would a high capacity state like China
   resort to such a costly method of pollution control? I argue that blunt
   force enforcement is targeted at overcoming principal-agent problems in
   the bureaucracy. When institutions are too weak to hold bureaucrats
   accountable, political leaders increase oversight by drastically
   reducing the number of steps and resources required to produce a
   regulatory outcome-resulting in blunt force measures. I illustrate this
   logic through case studies from China's multiyear war on pollution.
   Using original data on blunt force measures, I then show how localities
   with lower bureaucratic compliance face greater blunt force pollution
   enforcement. These findings reveal that when bureaucratic accountability
   is weak, states pay a very high cost for cleaner air.},

Abstract = {We update past work on the democratic deficit, defined as incongruence
   between majority public preference and public policy in the American
   states. We reconsider public opinion and state policy on seven issues
   related to immigration and health questions. Using original data from
   the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey as well as new data
   on state policy and other predictors, we show that these seven issues
   have distinct qualities from Lax and Phillips's larger basket of 39
   policy questions in different issue areas. From 2008 to 2014, the
   democratic deficit on these issues diminished somewhat in the presence
   of a heightened level of issue salience.},

Abstract = {How does the passage of time contribute to the establishment of civilian
   control of the State? We argue that civilian dominance of politics is
   achieved once civilianized institutions are adopted and sufficient time
   has passed to permit: (1) the development of a shared norm of civilian
   control within the military and (2) learning among military elites that
   fosters a belief that civilian rule is robust to military challenges. As
   a result, civilian control is self-reinforcing. We evaluate these claims
   by developing and validating a latent variable model of self-reinforcing
   institutional dynamics. We generate estimates of civilian control for
   all countries, 1945-2010, and find strong evidence that civilian control
   self-reinforces, but incrementally and over the course of several
   decades.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {7},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {The Euro-crisis, the subsequent bailout efforts and
   `institution-building' have triggered intense contestation. How these
   measures have changed the dynamics of integration, but also their
   democratic implications remain uncertain. This article examines the
   responses taken by the EU and its member state governments, the
   financial mechanisms, EFSM, EFSF, and ESM in particular. Their
   institutional character and how they conform to or diverge from previous
   institutional development in the EU are assessed. Building upon that, we
   address their connection with the democratic dilemma of the EU. European
   integration has long relied on balancing between intergovernmentalism
   and the supranational `Community method'. A growing preponderance of
   intergovernmentalism in the delicate policy area of fiscal and economic
   governance could be understood as a protection to member state autonomy.
   However, such developments can exacerbate multiple asymmetries and have
   problematic implications for democratic legitimacy, not just at EU
   level, but also for the member states themselves.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of how the EU exercises power in
   international politics and, in particular, whether or not there is
   anything distinctive about the ways in which it does so. Taking a
   relational approach to power, where the focus is on practical knowledge
   and perceptions of self and other, the paper departs from the assumption
   that such a question has to be evaluated in specific settings.
   Extrapolating from the EU's attempt to influence outcomes in Tunisia and
   Morocco following the Arab Spring, this paper proposes that the power of
   ambiguity captures some of the distinctiveness of the EU as a global
   actor. The paper highlights the ambiguity of what the EU is in the eyes
   of others, which opens up avenues for exercising power that others lack,
   not necessarily in accordance with a well-defined agenda, but understood
   as the production of effects in delimited settings.},

   Incorporation},

Abstract = {Concentrated immigrant settlement of US suburbs is transforming how many
   newcomers become politically incorporated. While the scholarship
   traditionally assumed political incorporation takes place after social
   or cultural incorporation, novel political agents-or ethnopolitical
   entrepreneurs-have arisen from within immigrant communities and inverted
   this assumption. In these dynamic `ethnoburbs', ethnopolitical
   entrepreneurs play an increasingly important role in constructing,
   organizing, and mobilizing internally diverse first generation,
   co-ethnic constituents. And they do so before their prospective
   constituents have become socially or culturally incorporated. But the
   existing scholarship on ethnopolitical entrepreneurs is very limited.
   Because entrepreneurs' approaches to political incorporation vary based
   upon their individual experiences and backgrounds, this article seeks to
   broaden the framework through two case studies of Armenian
   ethnopolitical entrepreneurs in Glendale, California-Rafi Manoukian and
   Ardashes (Ardy) Kassakhian. While they manifest considerable overlap in
   terms of their career trajectories and incorporation strategies, these
   entrepreneurs' individual experiences-particularly as a first and
   second-generation immigrant, respectively-have influenced the ways in
   which they incorporate newcomers and run campaigns.},

Abstract = {In the present context of intensifying competition between the major
   trading economies and potentially game-changing technological
   developments, the European Union is generally seen as the weaker party.
   Lacking the `hard power' derived from military capabilities, it has laid
   claim to a `soft power' of normative influence externally, yet even that
   is only partially utilised. Nor has Europe been able to exercise the
   power to coerce - `sharp power' - commensurate with its economic weight
   as a trading bloc equivalent in size and reach to the US or China, its
   most prominent global competitors. How can Europe strengthen its
   position, and in what fields? Through a scenario exercise, we develop
   eight policy proposals aimed at countering Europe ` s vulnerabilities
   and enabling it to assert its sharp and soft power more effectively.
   Specifically, we consider the feasibility, means and scope for their
   realisation. Together, they provide a transformative agenda for the EU's
   position in the world.},

Abstract = {Moral dilemmas amid war on terrorism include repeated harsh moral
   choices, which often pose threats to one's moral image. Given that
   people strive to view themselves as moral, how do they cope with such
   morally compromising decisions? We suggest and test two strategies to
   cope with morally threatening decision-making under in-group moral
   responsibility amid war on terrorism: (a) trivialization of the moral
   dilemma and (b) resentment toward the target. Four experimental studies
   measured (study 1) and manipulated (studies 2-4) these hypothesized
   mechanisms, presenting a similar collateral damage dilemma to Israeli
   Jews in the context of the 2014 Gaza conflict (studies 1 and 2) and to
   Americans in the context of the US campaign against Islamic State of
   Iraq and Syria (ISIS) (studies 3 and 4). Results demonstrate that both
   trivialization and resentment facilitate harsh moral choices under
   conditions of moral accountability. Studying the mechanism underlying
   moral decision-making in conflicts is key to understanding moral injury
   and the process of moral repair.},

Title = {Does Partisan Bias Modulate Neural Processing of Political Information?
   An Analysis of the Neural Correlates of Corruption and Positive Messages},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-164},

Abstract = {Daily worldwide newspapers print articles exposing government
   corruption. Yet these messages do not lead to a loss of votes for the
   corrupt parties. Sympathizers' partisan bias, which respectively
   minimizes and maximizes corruption and positive messages of their own
   parties respectively, is widely considered the main cause of the loss of
   effectiveness of political communications. Despite the well-established
   existence of such bias when processing political information, little is
   known as to its psychological origin. Through the use of neuroscience
   (fMRI), this study explores the underlying brain mechanisms of negative
   (corruption) and positive political messages related to a conservative
   and a socialist Spanish political party, as well as the differences
   between their sympathizers. The findings reveal that negative (vs.
   positive) political messages exert the greatest neuroimaging impact on
   the electorate, as shown in aversive, risk, and disappointment-related
   brain regions. Interestingly, we show that there exists a main partisan
   bias against opposite parties (and not a positive bias toward one's own
   party) that stems from a higher risk, ambiguity, and disbelief provoked
   by both positive and negative information about rival parties.
   Furthermore, this bias was more pronounced among conservative
   supporters. The current findings provide valuable insights for political
   parties to improve their communication campaigns.},

Abstract = {For many individuals living in poor societies, migration is the best
   hope for improving their life prospect. However, global migration today
   is highly selective and stratified. Affluent states often enjoy great
   discretion to cherry pick their immigration, favouring those with
   particular skills and qualifications. In this article, I argue that this
   practice of selective immigration is morally permissible only when a set
   of demanding conditions are met. I also argue that their right to
   exclude potential immigrants is constrained by the background
   distributive injustice in the global context.},

Abstract = {This article explores affect, colonial privilege, and the cultural
   politics of national commemoration in Aotearoa New Zealand. Based on
   focus-group interviews around two major national days, we examine means
   through which feelings and emotions are deployed in ways that enable the
   reproduction of social advantage. Situating affect within patterns of
   relationship, four interrelated affective-discursive practices are
   explored. In relation to Waitangi Day, agents tend to work under the
   rubric of anger and confusion. For Anzac Day, being grateful and moved
   shapes the interaction, although participants often indicate preferences
   towards ``having a day off.{''} Given the colonial context in which
   these practices circulate, analysis observes the associated freedom and
   ease by which affective-discursive privilege is (re)produced. Often
   incongruent and rarely challenged, privilege allows associated actors to
   do what they want, when they want, however they want. This affective
   climate authorizes the ongoing reproduction of, and justification for,
   membership to a higher-status ethnic group of which unearned
   opportunities and entitlements remain its everyday, expected currency.},

Abstract = {The 2015 refugee crisis has held the attention of Romanian news media as
   well, as one of the most challenging issues for the European Union in
   the last decade, even though Romania is not situated on the main routes
   on which refugees arrive. Our research focuses on the variation of
   issue-specific news frames in time, according to media type, and by the
   countries covered, also addressing the locally salient issue of
   religion. Articles from the websites of the top-ranked six Romanian news
   outlets were analyzed, including three quality papers and three tabloids
   (N=6,183), from 1 April 2015 to 30 September 2017. Using a
   computer-assisted, clusters-based frame analysis, we identify six
   primary, mutually exclusive and six secondary, nonexclusive frames:
   European crisis, context/victimization, relocation/distribution,
   international conflict, and social problem, national costs, religious
   issues, US immigration policy, humanitarian/international. The
   variations in their salience follow the general European tendency toward
   securitization. At the same time, the emphasis on the issue as a
   European crisis indicates a tendency characteristic of Central and
   Eastern European media coverage. Co-occurrence patterns of frames and
   specific countries also indicate that the salience of some globally
   recurrent frames varies by countries covered.},

Abstract = {The principal objective of the liberal economic tradition is to
   encourage mutually advantageous actions between individuals, and the
   best means by which to do this, according to those who follow this
   tradition, is a demand-led competitive market. This article summaries
   the propositions of the liberal economic tradition and concludes that
   while its components ought to be tolerated over private decision-making
   in order to protect individual autonomy, the demand-led competitive
   market provides incentives for egoistic actions that may harm groups,
   and by extension, the individuals within those groups. As such, it is
   argued that it is not sensible to introduce or maintain a demand-led
   competitive market in public sector services because it may undermine
   the pursuit of broadly agreed-upon collective goals in these sectors.
   The article finishes with a discussion of some alternative public sector
   policy mechanisms that may better serve the aim of crowding in
   cooperative actions and behaviours.},

Title = {Refining domestic politics theories of IPE: A societal approach to
   governmental preferences},

Abstract = {Domestic politics theories of international political economy and the
   recent disruptions in international cooperation and trade apparently
   induced by domestic discontent have shown the crucial role domestic
   forces play in influencing governmental preferences. This article
   contributes to this theoretical school, first, by assessing seminal
   works on the ideational, material, and institutional dimensions of
   domestic politics, and second, by conceptualising the `societal
   approach' to fill a major gap in domestic politics theorising. The
   societal approach asks under which conditions value-based societal
   ideas, domestic institutions, and material interests matter in shaping
   governmental preferences. When do ideas prevail over interests and vice
   versa? How do they interact with each other and with domestic
   institutions? The societal approach includes all three domestic
   variables as potential driving forces for governmental preferences and
   conceives them both as individual and as interacting forces. Most
   importantly, it complements domestic politics theories by proposing
   hypotheses on the conditions for the influence of each variable on
   governmental preferences. The article brings together previously
   conceived parts of the societal approach and considerably expands it.},

Abstract = {Research pays little attention to the diverse roles individuals hold
   within terrorism. This limits our understanding of the varied
   experiences of the terrorist and their implications. This study examines
   how a terrorist's role(s) influence the likelihood of and reasons for
   disengagement. Using data from autobiographies and in-person interviews
   with former terrorists, we find that role conflict and role strain
   increase the probability of disengagement. We show those in certain
   roles, especially leadership and violent roles, incur greater sunk costs
   and possess fewer alternatives making exit less likely. Finally, certain
   roles are associated with the experience of different push/pull factors
   for disengagement.},

Abstract = {Notions of network and polycentric governance highlight the possibility
   of innovation and adaptability in service delivery. At the same time, it
   has been argued that austerity and financial restrictions create intense
   pressures for public sector reform as public sector organizations look
   to new ways to deliver services. Hence the argument from governments in
   advanced democracies was that austerity would drive innovation. This
   article argues, through an analysis of the issue of policing and mental
   health in the UK, that network governance and polycentrism can be a
   significant constraint on reform when policy is delivered through
   multiple overlapping agencies, but with a lack of overarching authority.
   In the case of policing and mental health, introducing new governance
   arrangements is complex, much more so in a context of austerity.
   Resistance within organizations can oppose to novel forms of governance,
   and the new demands created by expenditure cuts further stress service
   delivery.},

Title = {Policy design, non-design, and anti-design: the regulation of
   e-cigarettes in Indonesia},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-243},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {In this article, we propose a typology of policy design and non-design,
   with special attention to a category of policy making which we term,
   ``anti-design{''}. We argue that contrary to the established literature,
   the opposite of design is not politics, but rather, a disconnect between
   problems, interventions, and outcomes. This disconnect can be caused by
   political forces but also by non-political factors such as incompetence,
   corruption, or global economic trends. We use an attempt by the
   government of Indonesia to regulate e-cigarettes to illustrate a
   scenario in which design activities are virtually absent. Making the
   distinction between design and the various forms of non-design is an
   important step in understanding the conditions that enable or impede
   rational mechanisms in the policy process.},

Abstract = {This article studies the production of economic domination after the end
   of the Ivorian armed conflict. It investigates the interaction between
   post-conflict development policies, people's expectations and fears
   unleashed by the end of war, and the capacity of local actors to
   establish external alliances. The inquiry focuses on a region located at
   the margins of the conflict, but at the core of post-war development
   schemes. In this warless land, policies implemented in the name of peace
   provide resources for dominant actors seeking to consolidate their
   position, thus reinforcing the social structures of agrarian capitalism
   that had been challenged during the war.},

   Study of the Belt and Road Narrative's Effects on Foreign Policy
   Formulation in the Netherlands},

Abstract = {This article investigates China's use of strategic narratives to
   facilitate its geopolitical return, through a critical case study of the
   Belt and Road narrative's effects on foreign policy formulation in the
   Netherlands. Departing from postmodern critiques of the traditional
   Western approach to soft power and Chinese elites' conceptualization of
   the Belt and Road as a means to contest the West's discursive hegemony,
   it initially proposes a theoretical framework meant to identify
   co-optive processes resulting from the narrative's reception. It
   subsequently tests this framework, which combines the strategic
   narrative strand of constructivist soft power theory with Gallarotti's
   concept of `bargaining spaces' to structure the analysis, on the the
   Netherlands' in the context of its recent revision of its China policy.
   By connecting elements of the narrative with co-optive processes found
   to occur within three subnational cohorts (business, media ecology, and
   foreign policy establishment), it highlights that Western countries may
   be more susceptible to non-coercive Chinese influence than is
   conventionally thought. In terms of a theoretical contribution, the
   article demonstrates that a decentred and outcome-oriented approach to
   narratives like the Belt and Road may enhance understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying China's ability to use rhetorical strategy to tilt
   political battlefields to its favor.},

Abstract = {The external dimensions of energy security are subject to distinctive
   forms of contestation within the European Union (EU). Contestation
   related to the external dimensions of energy strategy is significant,
   but bounded. EU institutions and member states have contained
   contestation in at least some areas of external energy strategy, through
   both de-politicization dynamics and new mechanisms of horizontal
   coordination. The article demonstrates and explains such bounded
   contestation in three areas of EU international policies: security of
   supply, climate security and wider security challenges. It explains the
   different logics that underpin the management of divergence, and relates
   these to analytical debates over EU foreign and security policy. The
   article stresses the importance of understanding how contestation over
   energy policy is nested within a broader set of geopolitical
   imperatives.},

   Germany},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Compared to the topic of radicalization, deradicalization was long
   treated as secondary in research, at least until recently. This article
   outlines the most important findings from theory and practice in three
   steps by: (1) discuss ing and reviewing existing classifications and
   typologies, (2) suggesting a conceptualization of the term ``
   deradicalization{''} while considering discourses about the roles of
   ideology, identity and risk, and, based on this, (3) providing an
   overview of the empirical case of practical work in Germany. It turns
   out that central actors from practice, academia, (security) authorities
   and politics not only use different definitions, but there is also
   little agreement on what deradicalization (practically) means. The
   German case shows that the landscape of deradicalization, differentiated
   into four fields of action, is highly diverse. However, the existing
   hybrid model of state and civic competences as well as the variety of
   approaches and actors should - with proper accentuation - be seen as an
   opportunity.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Number = {1},
Pages = {31-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hedge fund activism has been identified in the USA as a driver of
   enduring corporate governance change and market perception. We
   investigate this claim in an empirical study to see whether activism
   produced similar results in Japan in four representative areas:
   management effectiveness, managerial decisions, labour management and
   market perception. Experience from the USA would predict positive
   changes at Japanese target companies in these four areas. However,
   analysis of financial data shows that no enduring changes were apparent
   in the first three areas, and that market perception was consistently
   unfavourable. Our findings demonstrate that the same pressures need not
   produce the same results in different markets. Moreover, while the
   effects of the global financial crisis should not be ignored, we
   conclude that the country-level differences in corporate governance
   identified in the varieties of capitalism literature are robust, at
   least in the short term.},

Abstract = {What explains variation in individual preferences for foreign economic
   engagement? Although a large and growing literature addresses that
   question, little research examines how partner countries affect public
   opinion on policies such as trade, foreign aid, and investment. We
   construct a new theory arguing that political side-taking by outside
   powers shapes individuals' support for engaging economically with those
   countries. We test the theory using original surveys in the United
   States and Tunisia. In both cases, the potential partner country's
   side-taking in the partisan politics of the respondents' country
   dramatically shapes support for foreign economic relations. As the rise
   of new aid donors, investors, and trade partners creates new choices in
   economic partners, our theory and findings are critical to understanding
   mass preferences about open economic engagement.},

Abstract = {The text will focus on several Middle East conflict areas where
   Christian activities and violence have been present in the modern

   Christian violence - from the aggressive-dominant violence seeking to
   maintain political status quo, through nationalist-liberation movements,
   to purely defensive violence.},

Abstract = {Following decolonization, France sought to maintain close relations with
   its ancient African sub-Saharan colonies through economic, cultural and
   military cooperation agreements. Thanks to those agreements and to its
   military presence in Africa, France could impose itself as the
   ``protector{''} of the new states in the frame of the Cold War. In order
   to implement this policy, France couldn't rely on the support of its
   European partners. However, the criticism of French African policy,
   especially after the Rwanda genocide in 1994, forced French leaders to
   mobilize the tools of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in
   order to legitimize French action in Africa. Although, this
   ``Europeanization{''} of French African policy lead to the civil and
   military deployment of the European Union in the African continent, it
   was not enough to erase both French interests in Africa and its
   divergences with its European partners.},

Abstract = {We analyse the implications for international banks of two contemporary
   megatrends: corporate sustainability (CS) and digitalization. The
   digital environment and the availability of massive data from customers
   generate asymmetric information for banks to the detriment of customers,
   who experience individual vulnerabilities such as privacy rights. This
   can hinder the positive influence of digitalization in banks'
   performance, with relevant managerial and political implications. In
   this context, the reputation generated by CS strategies can constitute a
   credence factor that reduces customers' fears of opportunistic behavior
   and information asymmetries. We test and find support for our hypothesis
   over a panel data of large international banks from developed countries.
   Our findings shed light on the mutual reinforcement of CS and
   digitalization strategies in enhancing banks' market performance and
   efficiency.},

Title = {Rude bosses versus rude subordinates How we respond to them depends on
   our cultural background},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-199},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Workplace incivility has detrimental effects on targets of such
   behaviors and can lead to further conflict. This research aims to
   examine whether cultural differences in people's approach to social
   respect and status may influence their responses to incivility displayed
   by superiors and subordinates.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Three studies (n = 1043) examined how people from honor cultures
   (southern states of the USA; Latin America) and dignity cultures
   (northern states of the USA) would perceive and respond to uncivil
   superiors relative to uncivil subordinates. Studies 1 and 2 used
   scenarios; in Study 3, employed participants recalled their own
   incivility experiences.
   Findings
   Participants from honor cultures were more likely to perceive the
   mistreatment negatively if it came from a superior than a subordinate
   (all studies) and more likely to indicate that they would retaliate
   against an uncivil superior than an uncivil subordinate (Studies 1 and
   3). Moreover, for participants from honor cultures (but not from dignity
   cultures), anger mediated the relation between the appraisal of
   incivility and retaliation only when the offender was a superior (all
   studies).
   Research limitations/implications - This research relied on scenarios
   and people's recollections, focusing on a limited range of responses to
   incivility. Future research should conduct laboratory experiments and
   examine additional responses. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that
   being mistreated by a superior or a subordinate has different meanings
   and consequences for people from diverse cultures, which can have
   implications for cross-cultural work interactions.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the author's knowledge, this research is the first to
   compare people's emotional and behavioral responses to uncivil superiors
   with their responses to uncivil subordinates in honor cultures.},

Abstract = {In seeking to protect its economic interests and its control of oil
   resources in Iran, Britain planned to overthrow Iranian Prime Minister
   Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh in a military coup d'etat following his decision
   to nationalize the Iranian oil industry in 1951. However, the British
   initially faced strong opposition to this plan from the United States
   under the Truman administration, which preferred a more diplomatic
   approach to the crisis and did not see British interests as being in
   line with its own. Facing this opposition and after unsuccessful
   attempts to oust the Iranian leader through economic pressure and
   propaganda campaigns, the British skillfully leveraged American fear of
   communism to secure Washington, under the Eisenhower administration, as
   a partner to lead a joint U.S.-UK mission to overthrow Mossadegh. This
   chapter explores the reasons behind the shift in American policy
   regarding this issue, saying it was the Brits' successful use of covert,
   circuitous tactics, to achieve their intended outcomes, and not solely a
   result of ideological differences between the two U.S.
   administrations.(1)},

Abstract = {How do international observers decide whether to criticize or condone
   electoral fraud in a country? We argue that this decision depends on the
   identity of the victims of electoral fraud. A monitoring organization is
   more likely to overlook fraud committed against groups that are deemed
   dangerous by its sponsor. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that in
   the post-Cold War era election monitors are more tolerant of fraud
   against Islamic challengers, especially when Islamic movements are
   perceived as a threat to political stability. In support of our
   hypothesis, we find that outside monitors are more likely to endorse an
   election in countries with an Islamic opposition party and an ongoing
   Islamist terrorist campaign. Furthermore, we find that the effect is
   driven by Western monitoring organizations and becomes stronger after
   the September 11 attacks. Our findings provide a simple yet powerful
   insight: the calculus of outside observers depends not only on who they
   wish to see in power, but also who they want to keep from power.},

Abstract = {The fiscal soundness of local governments has been of great interest to
   both scholars and practitioners. This study explored how special grants
   and non-tax revenue affected the financial stability of Korean local
   governments in the five-year period between 2009 and 2013. Panel
   regression found that special grants reduced fiscal soundness, which was
   measured as the debt ratio and financial independence of the local
   governments in this study. In addition, as the non-tax revenue in
   absolute terms increased, financial independence initially decreased
   before rising again at a certain point in time. We also classified local
   governments into three groups (low, medium, high) in terms of their debt
   ratios and financial independence. Special grants and non-tax revenue
   had a significant yet differential influence on the fiscal soundness of
   local governments depending on the level of financial independence,
   while general grants did not have statistically significant effects on
   local governments with either low debt ratio or low financial
   independence.},

Title = {The Canary That Fell Silent. Finland's Gestalt Shift on Chinese
   Investments},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-67},
Abstract = {For a mixture of historical, economic and security policy reasons
   Finland can be regarded as a least likely case with regard to
   apprehensiveness over Chinese investments. Within the EU, Finland has
   had the highest relative trade dependence on China. Since 2016, Finland
   is also one of the EU member states that have attracted the most Chinese
   investment in absolute terms. Finland, which is not a NATO member, has
   unproblematic relations with China and an open economy that up until a
   few years ago welcomed Chinese investments. The country also has an
   unusually long unbroken tradition of domestic legislation regarding
   foreign investments, which since 1992 can be characterised as liberal.
   However, during the last two years, there has been a drastic change in
   views on Chinese investments, both among the policy elite and in the
   public debate. This change can be regarded as a veritable gestalt shift.
   As a corollary, a need for a better overview of Chinese investments has
   been identified. Information exchange and coordination between various
   governmental departments has been improved in several ways.
   Simultaneously, cooperation and information exchange between relevant
   Nordic authorities regarding relevant legislation and praxis has also
   deepened. Although the 2009 Stoltenberg recommendations did not
   encompass cooperation on foreign investments, this can be seen as a
   natural leg in intensified Nordic security cooperation.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, there has been an upsurge in conflicts of autochthony
   in several parts of the world. Autochthony invokes a sense of a politics
   of belonging and an attachment to the land. In Nigeria, the phenomenon
   raises questions of citizenship and can reinforce exclusionary practices
   which in turn provoke widespread violence between different Nigerian
   populations. Infrastructure provision in a communal conflict environment
   is a critical element of autochthony struggle, which has yet to be fully
   explored. Relying on archival sources, focus group discussions,
   interviews and observation, this article interrogates how the
   interactions between autochthony and space stimulates communal conflicts
   and affect infrastructure provision in Jos, Nigeria. The article focuses
   on how the `Black September' incident in 2001 and its aftermath in Jos
   has defined citizenship. It argues that the politics of belonging is
   embedded in infrastructure provision, and understanding this
   relationship is crucial to understanding and addressing the conflicts in
   Jos and beyond.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-92},
Abstract = {The debate in Norway regarding security concerns related to Chinese
   investments has seen a notable change in character over a short period
   of time. From a situation where there was little discernible debate at
   all, and where negative coverage of Chinese investment flows were mainly
   concerned with working environment issues, Chinese capital flows to
   Norway have now also become part of the debate on national security. Two
   particularities make the case of Norway especially interesting with
   regards to the broader Nordic debates over the issues discussed in this
   Fokus section. The Norwegian economy has been particularly well placed
   to benefit from the extraordinary Chinese economic growth, but Norway
   has also been in a particularly problematic political position towards
   China over the last decade. The contrast between these two factors has
   been a structuring trait of the Norwegian China debate. Nevertheless,
   the Norwegian public debate on China has been relatively positive over a
   long period of time. This has been given impetus by the positive
   experiences reported from the Norwegian enterprises that have been the
   target of Chinese acquisitions. However, lately, the public debate has
   increasingly come to regard the issue also through a political and
   security-related lens. This changing character is not due to specific
   events concerning Chinese activities in Norway, as much as being a
   reflection of broader regional and global trends. The question of
   Huawei's role in the coming construction of the 5G network has been a
   particularly important driver in this regard, as well as conductive link
   to the international change in opinion.},

Abstract = {Outcomes-based commissioning has been gaining ground for several years
   now. Criticism of outcomes-based commissioning usually concerns
   measuring. However, valid and reliable outcome measures are difficult to
   find. This study is a case study of the procurement made in the years of
   2013 and 2014 in the city of Tampere, Finland. Data were collected in
   2015 from the tendering documents and by interviewing 5 civil servants
   and 8 service providers who all took part in the procurement, and in
   2016 from a workshop. Measuring outcomes can be cumbersome, especially
   when verifying a connection between services and outcomes. However,
   using surrogates for wellbeing alongside conventional quality and
   achievement indicators can allow practitioners to establish whether the
   values held by the public are embedded in the public value created by a
   new service model. The paper suggests a new framework for use in
   tracking the migration of values into value.},

Abstract = {Access to college is critical for social mobility in China. Using a
   detailed college admission database that includes essentially all
   four-year public universities from 2005 to 2013, we demonstrate that
   Chinese universities preallocate more admission seats to provinces that
   happen to fall under the leadership of their alumni. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that the identified admission favoritism constitutes a
   political exchange between public universities and their powerful alumni
   in the sense that (a) universities and the connected provinces tend to
   sign formal partnership agreements; and (b) university leaders who sign
   formal partnership agreements receive indirect personal gains in terms
   of career advancement in the party-state bureaucracy. Our article
   provides causal evidence that social connections facilitate powerful
   government insiders' collusion and capture of public resources in a weak
   institutional environment.},

Abstract = {Although IPE and GPP overlap conceptionally and empirically, there is a
   case for keeping GPP and IPE analytically distinct. To simplify: GPP
   tells us why we need international regimes for energy, while IPE tells
   us why we only have incomplete ones. Although many scholars draw on both
   sets of literatures, the two approaches to the study of energy market,
   regulation and politics entail asking different types of questions based
   on distinct theories and assumptions. The central propositions in this
   article are that i) in a rapidly changing world of energy scholars from
   both camps need to be aware of and open to insights from the other
   school; ii) that the distinction between market-focused liberal scholars
   on one hand and security-oriented or realist scholars on the other is
   increasingly important; and iii) that although IPE and GPP scholars can
   fruitfully accommodate insights from each others literature, the two
   approaches to the study of energy policy are best valued by their own
   analytical contribution - even as we grapple with new, cross-cutting
   issues such as the geopolitics and geo-economics of global energy
   transitions.},

Abstract = {We use a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design to explore whether
   and how bounded subadditivity, and the resulting certainty effect, may
   lead public and private employees to prioritize their activities in ways
   that are suboptimal for their organizations. In a randomized controlled
   trial, private sector workers were more likely to join a project to
   which they were able to provide a small contribution that would turn the
   probability of success into certainty rather than an alternative project
   in which their participation would make success twice as likely but not
   certain. This behaviour, which is consistent with the principle of
   bounded subadditivity, was not observed among public workers in our
   sample, who did not show any preference for either project. A
   qualitative inquiry suggests that the observed difference in
   susceptibility to bounded subadditivity between public and private
   employees resonates with public service motivation, self-determination
   theory and identity economics.},

Abstract = {The indigenous community of Acteal in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico,
   has been subject to both direct and structural violence in the form of
   the massacre that took place there in 1997 and the impunity that has
   persisted ever since. In response to the violence, the community has
   constructed political, social, and cultural alternatives through the
   movement known as the Las Abejas of Acteal Civil Society Organization.
   Its reconstruction of the social fabric has included participation in
   assembies, volunteer work for the collective, exchange of experiences,
   food production for subsistence, a solidarity economy, and the
   systematization and sharing of experiences.

Abstract = {EU-China relations continue to be limited by a disagreement over values.
   As the only bilateral channel dedicated to promoting an EU value, the
   EU-China Human Rights Dialogue (HRD), reflects the principal forum for
   this normative conflict. Observing poor outcomes, scholars typically
   maintain that the dialogue's weakness is symptomatic of the EU
   prioritising its material interests with China. This paper seeks a more
   nuanced explanation for these shortcomings, exploring the neglected
   micro-level processes of the HRD. This encompasses the role and impact
   of EU diplomats, their Chinese interlocutors and EU institutional
   structures. The micro-level also offers novel theoretical insights into
   how the EU's normative power practically manifests in such a challenging
   arena. Through a discourse anaysis of elite interviews, capturing the
   small group of EU diplomats operationalising the HRD, this paper finds
   that while the dialogue is significantly weakened by China's systematic
   obstruction, the EU plays a key role in facilitating this, with
   ineffective diplomatic approaches and insufficient political backing by
   member states.},

Title = {Is stress good for negotiation outcomes? The moderating effect of social
   value orientation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-421},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Negotiations are often conducted under stress. Previous studies show
   that stress can help or hurt negotiation outcomes. This study suggests
   that individual differences explain these effects, and the purpose of
   this study is to examine the effect of social value orientation (SVO)
   and stress on negotiation outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Two experimental studies and a pilot investigate the influence of stress
   and SVO (prosocial vs proself) on negotiation offers and outcomes. The
   authors' studies are grounded on social interdependence theory and
   arousal literatures to explain the effects of stress on negotiation.
   Findings
   Stress has a positive influence on integrative offers (S1) and joint
   outcomes (S2). SVO moderates the effect of stress on joint negotiation
   outcomes (S2), such that, under stress, prosocials fare better than
   proselfs.
   Research limitations/implications
   Managers negotiating under stress should pay attention to their own as
   well as the others' SVOs. Managers could also build their negotiation
   teams considering this individual difference and favor the presence of
   prosocials in stressful negotiations.
   Practical implications
   The findings have practical implications for managers who are under
   stress on a daily basis.
   Social implications
   This research contributes to managers that need to understand how to
   reach integrative agreements under stress. This is especially important
   when negotiators are representatives of employees or companies, as the
   outcomes can affect many individuals.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study examining
   the relationship between stress, SVO and negotiation offers and
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether female political empowerment is conducive to
   civil peace, drawing on global data on female political empowerment over
   a 200-year period, from the Varieties of Democracy database. We augment
   previous research by expanding the temporal scope, looking at a novel
   inventory of female political empowerment measures, attending to
   reverse-causality and omitted variable issues, and separating between
   relevant causal mechanisms. We find a strong link between female
   political empowerment and civil peace, which is particularly pronounced
   in the twentieth century. We find evidence that this relationship is
   driven both by women's political participation-particularly the
   bottom-up political participation of women, e.g., in civil society-and
   the culture that conduces it. This is the strongest evidence to date
   that there is a robust link between female political empowerment and
   civil peace, stemming from both institutional and cultural mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Although there is growing recognition that women's participation is
   critical for the durability of peaceful conflict transition, grounded
   research examining the political scale of women's participation has not
   been common. Where feminist researchers have tackled this topic, they
   have generally reproduced binary representations of political space,
   sometimes strongly critical of local spaces as restrictive of women,
   sometimes strongly critical of a hegemonic liberal international. In
   this article, I address the issue of women's participation in conflict
   transition governance from another more ethnographic angle, drawing from
   fieldwork conducted in the Solomon Islands, a Pacific Islands country
   destabilised by conflict in the late 1990s and early 2000s. I apply
   theories of political scale to consider where and how women are
   politically active in the conflict transition environment, how that
   political activity is constituted relative to other political scales and
   where and how women seek to make their political ambitions understood.
   The `emplacement' lens I develop offers a critical vantage point for
   analysis of the ways women constitute political identities and the
   agendas they might meaningfully progress, at scales ranging from the
   small worlds of the household and the community to the broader scale of
   national politics.},

Abstract = {Governments are increasingly facilitating the roll-out of so-called
   ``smart meters{''}, a technology for measuring energy consumption that
   are able to transmit and receive data using a form of electronic
   communication. However, implementation has been slow or even stalled. To
   identify some of the causes for this, the policy coordination
   perspective serves as a lens to unravel the different elements involved
   in smart meter implementation. The research adds the demand and supply
   dimension to account for market dynamics and public engagement
   challenges in the process. A case study of the UK finds that government
   efforts are challenged by the timely and coherent coordination of
   diverse stakeholders and regulatory measures.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the association of Hegel with political realism.
   Many approaches rely predominantly on the Philosophy of Right's third
   part (the State) and on the Phenomenology of Spirit's `master-slave'
   dialectic, classifying Hegel as a political realist who praises the
   state, glorifies war and dismisses international law. However, this
   oversimplifies Hegel's thought and misinterprets his methodology. The
   thesis of this paper is that these misperceptions can be avoided once:
   (i) Hegel's corpus is considered coherently; (ii) the context of his
   philosophical thought is taken into account; and (iii) his insights
   cease to be applied in a descriptive or prescriptive way. Hegel's
   contribution will be revisited by way of treating the Phenomenology of
   Spirit as the point of departure to comprehend the Philosophy of Right.
   Approaching the Philosophy of Right through the Phenomenology's emphasis
   on the forms of consciousness, spirit (Geist) and ethical life
   (Sittlichkeit), reveals the intellectual wealth of Hegel's methodology
   while exposing the methodological flaws of realism.},

Title = {Surveillance, Security, and Liberal Democracy in the Post-COVID World},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Abstract = {To what extent has the COVID-19 outbreak, and the augmented use of
   health surveillance technology that has resulted from it, altered
   international conceptions of civil liberties, privacy, and democracy?
   This article examines how global patterns of liberal democracy have been
   and could be affected by the pandemic. In China, the outbreak has
   strengthened a pre-existing techno-authoritarian project aimed at
   prevention and control of threats to both public health and public
   order. Certain features of the international system such as China's
   major power status, its global economic role, and its leadership in
   international organizations suggest that China's model of illiberal
   pandemic response could diffuse worldwide. Other factors, however-such
   as the incomparability of China's political system to many other
   countries in the contemporary international system-suggest more limited
   diffusion potential. To date, the pandemic has largely augmented
   existing trends, meaning that autocracies have been likely to respond in
   ways that infringe upon citizen rights, and weak democracies have
   exhibited some risk of democratic erosion and pandemic-associated
   autocratization. In these cases, however, factors other than
   surveillance have been central to processes of democratic decay.
   Conversely, a large number of consolidated democracies have employed
   surveillance, but have managed to navigate the initial stages of crisis
   without significantly compromising democratic standards. In these cases,
   surveillance technology has been fenced in by democratic institutions
   and rule of law, and norms, institutions, and public opinion have worked
   together to facilitate pandemic responses that are (on balance)
   proportional, limited in time and scope, and subject to democratic
   oversight. This suggests that international relations may need to
   separate the pandemic's effects on democracy from its effects on
   liberalism, and that care must be taken to identify the precise
   mechanisms that link pandemic response to various components of liberal
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Calls for a more ``global{''} international relations (IR) based on
   theories grounded in world rather than Western histories have
   highlighted the Eurocentrism of history within the discipline. Global IR
   literature, however, neglects the role of tempocentrism in fostering
   that Eurocentrism. Tempocentric IR portrays the past as an extrapolation
   of the (Eurocentric) present, suggesting an inevitability and normality
   to Western dominance of international relations and obscuring
   non-Western significance. It also deprives IR theory-building of a
   broader pool of examples to inform existing theories. This article
   locates those centrisms in the textbooks of the discipline, while
   drawing on interdisciplinary research to reveal the disproportionate
   influence of the first years of higher education on students' future
   worldviews. It is here that students are exposed to a historical grand
   narrative that establishes the boundaries of their inquiries and
   outlines what is, and what is not, significant. For a more ``global{''}
   IR, therefore, it is suggested that textbook historical narratives
   require reconstructing in two ways. First, textbook history should be
   presented through connections and relations rather than substances.
   Second, historical chapters should reveal the multiple layers of time,
   including the deeper past, that have been instrumental in constituting
   the international relations of today.},

Abstract = {Public opinion can often become a key challenge to international
   cooperation efforts. In their attempt to garner support for their
   position, stakeholders fight for the hearts and minds of the public
   based on arguments about the consequences of different policy options.
   But to what extent do individuals' preferences change when exposed to
   such information? And how does this depend on the information being
   congruent or contradictory to pre-existing preferences? We address these
   questions in the context of the negotiations on the potentially largest
   regional trade agreement in history: the Transatlantic Trade and
   Investment Partnership (TTIP). Based on a
   two-waves-panel-survey-experiment fielded in Germany and the United
   States, we examine how individuals' prior opinion influences the way
   they process new information. We argue that individuals' existing priors
   about how they generally think about economic openness interact with new
   information to inform their opinion about the specific policy proposal
   at hand. Our experimental results show that while prior opinion
   constrains opinion updating to some degree, overall, citizens update
   their existing beliefs in line with new information. This updating
   process can even result in respondents changing their opinion, although
   only in one direction: namely to turn from a TTIP supporter to a TTIP
   opponent.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The main contribution of this article is a rethinking of the peace
   concept, geared towards the creation of a framework for the analysis of
   agonistic peace. The literature on agonistic peace has thus far been
   elaborate in terms of theoretical sophistication. However, the dearth of
   empirical research on the concept is quite remarkable. This study takes
   that lacuna as a starting point for the grounding of the agonistic peace
   concept in empirical research and the creation of an analytical tool
   which can be utilised in the analyses of peace processes in disparate
   contexts such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel-Palestine and Northern
   Ireland. The literature on agonistic peace envisions peace as the
   creation of a political space where former relations of enmity are
   reframed into being legitimate adversaries. This article forwards an
   understanding of two fundamental building blocks for understanding
   agonistic peace-institutional inclusion and identity change, the two
   theoretical strands which have rarely been interconnected in peace
   research. Through a cross-fertilisation of these fields, an analytical
   framework suited for the analyses of peace processes and their
   aftermaths in terms of agonistic peace is carved out. As such, this
   study serves as a stepping-stone in furthering empirical as well as
   conceptual understandings of the viability of peace processes over time.},

Abstract = {This article explores a recent tendency in the official Chinese
   discourse on nationalism-the government more actively employs Chinese
   achievements in science and technology to boost national pride and
   regime legitimacy. This ``techno-turn{''} focuses on China's
   construction of megaprojects, its active role in international
   techno-economic business, and its development of cutting-edge scientific
   research and technologies. This transition in the official discourse on
   nationalism contains several rationales along material, policy, and
   ideological dimensions, and uses sophisticated propaganda tactics. It
   also faces constraints and challenges-some derived from conflicts with
   reality, and others derived from internal logical imbalances. The turn
   marks a new stage in the development of contemporary Chinese
   nationalism, in which official nationalism absorbs elements from popular
   nationalism. This ideological transition may influence both Chinese
   domestic and international politics-it may lead to China's more
   confident engagement in international affairs, but may also generate
   uncertainties in relations between China and the West.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world often struggle to collect tax revenues,
   thus undermining their ability to build functioning states, deliver
   basic public goods, and improve human development. This problem is
   especially acute in the Global South. Within the broader context of
   representative democracy, many local governments increasingly adopt
   participatory institutions in the hope that they will improve government
   responsiveness, service delivery, and their electoral opportunities. We
   address gaps in knowledge on participatory institutions and tax
   collection by asking two critical questions: to what extent (if any) do
   these reforms improve local governance? And how would we know? We draw
   from an original database on Brazilian Municipalities that includes
   fiscal, political, and state capacity variables. We find that municipal
   governments that adopt participatory institutions generate higher tax
   revenues than comparable governments without these institutions. This
   article thus provides a novel, thorough assessment of how new
   participatory institutions affect governance and revenue-generation.},

Abstract = {While ethno-national demography has featured significantly in political
   and scholarly debates about Northern Ireland, little attention has been
   paid to the politics of the Northern Ireland census itself. This article
   addresses this gap by exploring census politics since the 1998 Good
   Friday Agreement. It demonstrates that the border poll provision of the
   Good Friday Agreement and Brexit have increased the political salience
   of census results, with the 2021 census now being anticipated by many as
   a potential referendum trigger. Against this background, I argue that
   new census questions - on religious background and national identity -
   have had significant consequences for debates about the constitutional
   future. Introduced in order to satisfy requirements stemming partly from
   equalities legislation, an unintended consequence of the religious
   background question has been to reinforce `two communities' narratives
   in constitutional debates, whereas the national identity question has
   served to problematise assumptions about relationships between identity
   and constitutional preferences.},

Title = {How to head count ethnic minorities: validity of census surveys versus
   other identification strategies},

Abstract = {Censuses ask individuals to identify their own ethnicity. Minorities,
   however, may be reluctant to self-identify; and thus, censuses may
   underreport minority populations, raising concerns about measurement
   validity. We identify and measure the extent of this concern by matching
   census data on Romas in Romania against a nationwide survey of 2800
   municipality experts (SocioRoMap). While not perfect, we find
   considerable overlap between the two strategies. In the cases where the
   two measures do not match, the density of community networks is the
   driver for likelihood of non-congruence - but demographics factors and
   socioeconomic conditions account for the level, i.e. the magnitude of
   difference between the two estimation strategies. Given the systemic
   discrimination of Romas, these results are cautiously reassuring. As
   most countries head into a census-collecting year, this paper offers an
   empirical strategy for assessing the validity of self-identified
   numbers. If governments are concerned about measurement, random samples
   of expert assessments can help validate. Alternatively, policymakers can
   focus where miscounts are most likely: urban, ethnically diverse, and
   poor localities.},

Abstract = {Multi-level governance has provoked debates over the last quarter
   century as the thinking of Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks has progressed.
   That thinking has been both innovative and eclectic, forming a number of
   intellectual `story arcs' that part ways, develop and mature, then
   recombine with renewed force. We take Hooghe and Marks' Multi-Level
   Governance and European Integration as a pivotal moment in the
   development of that thinking. We then trace the `story arcs' of
   multi-level governance by pinpointing three questions. Does multi-level
   governance `travel' as a viable analytical framework much beyond
   cohesion policy? Does multi-level governance give analytical purchase
   beyond the European Union? And is multi-level governance merely a
   descriptive framework or does it embed or give rise to theory? We
   conclude by shortly summarising the contributions to this Breakthrough
   Political Science Symposium.},

Abstract = {Why would individuals engage in or support contentious politics? This
   question is challenging to answer with observational data where causal
   factors are correlated and difficult to measure. Using a survey-embedded
   experiment, we focus on three situational factors: grievances, risk, and
   identity. We also explore how individual differences in sociopolitical
   orientations-social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing
   authoritarianism (RWA)-impact action. Grievances influence engagement in
   and support for protests. Risk influences engagement in protest, but not
   support for it. Regardless of condition, SDO and RWA help explain why
   some people engage in protest while others do not, particularly within
   the same context.},

Abstract = {The majority of studies on international conflict escalation use a
   variety of measures of hostility including the use of force,
   reciprocity, and the number of fatalities. The use of different
   measures, however, leads to different empirical results and creates
   difficulties when testing existing theories of interstate conflict.
   Furthermore, hostility measures currently used in the conflict
   literature are ill suited to the task of identifying consistent
   predictors of international conflict escalation. This article presents a
   new dyadic latent measure of interstate hostility, created using a
   Bayesian item-response theory model and conflict data from the
   Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) and Phoenix political event
   datasets. This model (1) provides a more granular, conceptually precise,
   and validated measure of hostility, which incorporates the uncertainty
   inherent in the latent variable; and (2) solves the problem of temporal
   variation in event data using a varying-intercept structure and
   human-coded data as a benchmark against which biases in machine-coded
   data are corrected. In addition, this measurement model allows for the
   systematic evaluation of how existing measures relate to the construct
   of hostility. The presented model will therefore enhance the ability of
   researchers to understand factors affecting conflict dynamics, including
   escalation and de-escalation processes.},

Abstract = {Previous research consistently finds a relatively weak relationship
   between environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior, as
   environmentally concerned individuals often fail to act
   pro-environmentally, both in the private and public spheres. While the
   strength of the concern-behavior relationship varies considerably across
   countries, existing research has yet to provide a complete account of
   these cross-national differences. In this study, we add to previous
   cross-national research on the concern-behavior relationship by focusing
   on the quality of government. Using multilevel analysis and data from
   the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), we demonstrate that
   people who are environmentally concerned are more likely to act
   pro-environmentally (in the public sphere), in countries where
   government institutions are fair, effective and impartial. We also find
   that people are generally more likely to engage in pro-environmental
   behavior in both the private and public sphere in countries where the
   quality of government is high.},

Abstract = {The Kurdistan in Iraq (KRI) is a constitutionally recognized autonomous
   region that aspires to become an internationally recognized state. In
   the literature on nation-building and state formation, the role of
   academia in developing a political economy and governance structures is
   emphasized. Thus, this research examines the performance of academic
   institutions in the autonomous region of KRI regarding their advisory
   and application roles in the structure of governance and the political
   economy over a ten-year period (2007-2016). Employing a range of
   variables and other measures, a survey is conducted and other
   information gained from two state university faculties and people
   employed at a government ministry and in the parliament. Overall, the
   results are found to be poor for the faculties but better for the
   ministry and parliament.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the debate among optimists,
   pessimists, and centrists about whether the world economic order is
   undergoing a fundamental change. While optimists foresee the
   continuation of economic globalization after the pandemic, pessimists
   expect localization instead of globalization, given the pandemic's
   structural negative consequence on the world economy. By contrast, the
   centrists anticipate a ``U-shaped{''} recovery, where Covid-19 will not
   kill globalization but slow it down. The three existing perspectives on
   Covid-19's impact on the economic globalization are not without merit,
   but they do not take sufficient temporal distance from the ongoing
   issue. This article suggests employing the historical perspective to
   expand the time frame by examining the rise and fall of economic
   globalization before and after the 2008 global financial crisis. The
   authors argue that economic globalization has been in transition since
   the 2008 financial crisis, and one important but not exclusive factor to
   explain this change is the evolving US-China economic relationship, from
   symbiotic towards increasingly competitive. The economic restructuring
   in US and China has begun after both countries weathered the 2008 crisis
   and gained momentum since the outbreak of trade war and Covid-19. The
   article investigates this trend by distinguishing different types of
   production activities, and the empirical results confirm that
   localization and regionalization have been filling the vacuum of
   economic globalization in retreat in the last decade.},

Abstract = {Previous research on the ongoing armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine has
   largely provided structural explanations for the outbreak of violence in
   Donbas. In contrast to previous studies, this article takes an
   interpretive approach and investigates how the Ukrainian political
   leadership makes sense of the events in Donbas by drawing an analogy
   between the Donbas War and World War II. Such an approach sheds light on
   the Ukrainian ruling elites' standpoint on the Donbas conflict and
   contributes to the scholarly literature on conflict resolution in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Is the internet at risk of fragmentation? Whereas the literature has
   examined this question with a focus on domestic policies, communication
   standards, and internet governance institutions, we analyze
   fragmentation and alternative outcomes in transnational engineering
   networks. These networks constitute the social foundations of the
   unified or `global' internet. Our contributions include: (1) broadening
   the debate beyond fragmentation-related network outcomes to include
   political structuring and organizational concentration; and (2) new
   evidence from an important engineering network around the Internet
   Engineering Task Force comprising thousands of participants and over
   four decades. Our analyses reveal fast and continuous network growth as
   well as clear signs of growing concentration of the network around a few
   major companies. A key implication is that, at the level of engineering
   networks, concerns about internet fragmentation might be unfounded and
   might distract from more salient developments such as organizational
   concentration.},

Abstract = {Understanding how coalitions battle to advance or slow down regulatory
   efforts to address climate change is critical to assess the likelihood
   that regulatory approaches can succeed in curbing the emission of
   greenhouse gases. This requires a thorough examination of how coalitions
   form and are structured. We focus our analysis on the Obama
   administration's ``Climate Action Plan,{''} aimed to tackle greenhouse
   gas emissions from the operation of oil and gas facilities,
   transportation, and electricity generation. We focus on coalitional
   behavior when actors litigate either in favor or against each of these
   rules and reconstruct the comprehensive network of stakeholder relations
   across court cases by recreating the network of cosigners of documents
   submitted during the litigation process. We identify two main coalitions
   of pro- and anti-regulation actors and assess their coalitional
   strategies. We use descriptive statistics, baseline models, and
   community detection algorithms to explore participation patterns related
   to level of participation, cross-regulation activity, clustering, and
   homophily based subcoalitions.},

Abstract = {Covid-19 is the latest blow to the ailing liberal international order,
   which has faced a series of challenges in the postwar era. This article
   traces the global spread of the virus scaled to population and case
   fatality rates of different countries. Using inferential statistics, I
   find that liberal democracies have higher case fatality rates than other
   regime types and offer some plausible explanations for why.
   Systemically, I show how the spread of the virus complicates the
   implementation of policies consistent with liberal international order,
   potentially destroying the order in which liberal democracies
   participate. Given the paucity of the data as well as cross-country
   reporting differences in a still evolving crisis, these findings provide
   a first social scientific cut over the first half year of the pandemic
   rather than a final assessment of its consequences.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze UK global health policy in the light of the
   2014 Ebola epidemic. Specifically, we focus on the UK government's
   intervention in the epidemic, reflections on the UK's response in
   parliamentary committees and government-sponsored forums, and subsequent
   UK global health policy changes. Post-Ebola, we argue, UK global health
   policy turned into a pursuit of global health emergency-preparedness
   through development. This, we further suggest, resulted from what we
   identify as the specific structure of the UK's emergency-preparedness
   configuration that creates a `spill-over' between the immediate event
   (of emergency) and future preparedness. This configuration transmits
   problems between different temporalities - allowing immediate, urgent
   problems to become problems of future uncertainty (and future
   uncertainties to be enacted as urgent problems). In activating
   emergency-preparedness, furthermore, self-scrutiny is triggered -
   prompting the UK to assume responsibility for problems identified as
   threats regardless of their point of origin, thus internalizing external
   problems.},

Abstract = {Communes are the main units of local government in Poland. The
   Constitution of 1997 guarantees them self-governing and independence,
   both in terms of their own public tasks and tasks commissioned by
   central authorities. Self-governance and independence of communes are
   not absolute. The activities of the commune self-government are subject
   to supervision from the point of view of legality, and the supervisory
   bodies are government administration bodies and regional chambers of
   auditors. This study aims at detailed reconstructing the Polish model of
   constitutional supervision over the activities of communes and its
   evaluation from the theoretical teleological and functional
   perspectives. The analysis led to the conclusion that the adopted
   criterion of supervision is sufficiently defined to prevent too much
   freedom of interference in the activities of communes, allows for proper
   protection of the interests of the entire country and its citizens.
   Thus, the Polish normative model meets the theoretical assumptions.},

Abstract = {Studies suggest that individuals are less likely to process information
   they can easily look up. Instead of committing information to memory,
   they rely on the Internet to store information for them-a phenomenon
   known as ``offloading.{''} We examine the effects of offloading on
   political knowledge and voting behavior. Using data from a 10-wave panel
   experiment designed to study information processing in two distinct
   information environments, we demonstrate that people whose environment
   is conducive to offloading learnmoreduring an election campaign than
   individuals whose information environment is not conducive to
   offloading, even though they look at less information during the
   campaign. Individuals in the offloading condition also make better vote
   choices despite examining less information. These results suggest that
   offloading reduces cognitive load, thereby freeing up processing space
   in working memory, which can increase learning of information
   thatisaccessed, and improve decision-making.},

Abstract = {Recent works on `uneven and combined development' (UCD) have focused on
   its contributions to the study of political economy and geopolitics, but
   they have yet to systematically address the cultural dimension of social
   change - the socially shared ideas by which people understand and act
   upon the world. The present article addresses this lacuna by applying
   the premises of UCD to the nineteenth-century emergence of
   Occidentalism: the idea of `the West' as the dominant site of culture,
   civilisation and modernity. Against the problems of methodological
   internalism and Eurocentrism, I argue that the categories
   ofunevennessandcombined developmentprovide critical entry points for an
   examination of the international construction of `Western' identities
   and discourses during the late-nineteenth century imperial era.
   Specifically, I advance a theory ofgeocultural feedbackwhich locates the
   constituting terms of those identities and discourses in a specific
   conjuncture of global unevenness: how the experience of `relative
   backwardness' in late-industrialising societies translated into
   self-consciously `Westernising' projects of catch-up development which
   destabilised prevailing conceptions of white European supremacy. In both
   the British and American empires, this historical dynamic produced a
   distinct pattern of cultural transformation: a reactive discourse of
   civilisational closure centred on the defence of `the West.'},

Abstract = {Evidence indicates that populist attitudes matter for voting decisions,
   but findings are still inconclusive about whether this happens
   regardless of individuals' positioning on more traditional dimensions of
   electoral competition. This article focuses on the probability of voting
   for populist parties in Spain, a country where only left-wing populist
   parties existed in 2015-2016. Therefore, not all populist individuals,
   who were spread across the left-right axis, had a natural voting option
   that combined their populist and left-right preferences. Although this
   situation could make it more likely that stronger populist attitudes
   increase likelihood of voting populist regardless of preferences on
   other political dimensions, the results of this analysis show otherwise.
   Stronger populist attitudes significantly increase the likelihood of
   voting for left-wing populist parties only among individuals located in
   the left side of the ideological axis. The effect seems largely
   influenced by preferences related to economic redistribution.},

Abstract = {Is structural transformation happening in Africa, and can African states
   count on the neoliberal flying geese paradigm for industrialisation?
   Using recent data from World Bank and United Nations Conference of Trade
   and Development reports, this briefing suggests not. The post-2008
   crisis `end of labour-cost arbitrage opportunities' have nullified
   Africa's attractiveness in global labour-intensive manufacturing. This
   is a position that negates the generally optimistic narrative recently
   espoused by theJournal of African Economies(vol. 27) on Africa's
   industrialisation and China's putative catalytic role in it.},

Title = {Opting out of Socialism: For-Profit Mobility from Communist Poland},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1136-1160},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article presents the history of for-profit mobility from communist
   Poland, that is, transnational labor migrations and the movement of
   cross-border petty traders. On the basis of primary research in archives
   and new scholarship on the history of communist Poland, it presents the
   scale and dynamics of cross-border movements since the partial opening
   of the borders in the mid-1950s to the final erosion of the communist
   regime in 1989. It analyzes the main factors and patterns of the
   expansion of mobility in both its legal and irregular streams, including
   the relevant policies of the Polish government and the governments of
   migrants' destination countries, the mechanisms of the gray and black
   markets, especially of hard currencies, and the development and
   diffusion of social practices of migration. It argues that for-profit
   mobility was a large part of the second economy as well as a form of
   disengagement from the communist state and its first economy, a way of
   selective opting out of socialism. Analyzing the relations between its
   expansion and the evolution of the communist regime, the article claims
   that for-profit mobility produced un-communist social spaces and was an
   important factor eroding the regime's legitimacy and control over its
   subjects, thus paving the way to the post-1989 stage of Poland's
   transformation.},

Abstract = {The rights-based approach (RBA) to development is now accepted practice
   among experts in the United Nations (UN) development machinery, as well
   as key bilateral aid agencies and many nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs). That development should be informed by rights represents a new
   human rights norm in world affairs, and the machinery around it forms a
   regime. However, RBA remains contested, and implementation has been
   stuttering and incomplete. This article examines the forces working
   against, and for, the implementation of RBA. It argues, in particular,
   that although RBA is a norm well institutionalized as a regime, it is
   not nearly as accepted by states themselves, and thus remains only
   imperfectly implemented. This, in turn, shows us how various factors
   affecting norm acceptance-state interests, transnational NGOs, and
   multilateral actors, among others-interact in norm evolution. The gap
   between a strong regime and a weak norm helps give insight into the
   future of RBA: It seems robust due to its institutionalization, but it
   is much more tenuous than it appears. This can also have implications in
   other similar situations, such as responsibility to protect or climate
   change, in which strong regimes belie the weakness of the underlying
   norm.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses a largely overlooked actor in China's foreign
   relations, the International Department of the Communist Party of China
   (ID-CPC). Using publicly available documentation, we systematically
   analyze the patterns of the CPC's external relations since the early
   2000s. Building on an intense travel diplomacy, the ID-CPC maintains a
   widely stretched network to political elites across the globe. The
   ID-CPC's engagement is not new; but since Xi Jinping took office, the
   CPC has bolstered its efforts to reach out to other parties. We find
   that party relations not only serve as an additional channel to advance
   China's foreign policy interests. Since President Xi has come to power,
   party relations also emerged as a key instrument to promote China's
   vision for reforming the global order. Moreover, China increasingly uses
   the party channel as a vehicle of authoritarian learning by sharing
   experiences of its economic modernization and authoritarian one-party
   regime. The cross-regional analysis of the CPC's engagement with other
   parties helps us to better understand the role of the CPC in Chinese
   foreign policy-making, pointing to a new research agenda at the
   intersection of China's foreign relations, authoritarian diffusion, and
   transnational relations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {411-429},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Slogans (fixed or authoritative formulations, (sic)(sic)) are ritually
   repeated elements in Chinese politics, appearing in strategic documents
   and main speeches. Building on new institutionalism in Political
   Science, this paper systematically introduces and conceptualizes the
   phenomenon of slogans. While slogans have been approached from the
   perspective of linguistics or (political or cultural) history and have
   often been dealt with partially or implicitly, the paper addresses a gap
   in studying slogans from the point of view of Political Science. I argue
   that they are an integral part of China's political system, playing a
   role of a crucial organizational feature, whose significance goes far
   beyond a mere behavioural regularity, replicating a centuries-long
   Chinese tradition of officially orchestrated language to support a
   ruling regime. The paper specifically focuses on leadership (grand)
   slogans as the most comprehensive kind of slogans and their role in the
   post-Dengian period. Leadership slogans are relevant for and contribute
   to: 1) propaganda, 2) ideological innovations, 3) policy and strategic
   direction, 4) structuring politics, and 5) upholding a unity of the
   Communist Party of China.},

Abstract = {This article explores which metaphors relevant political parties in
   Slovakia use when they speak about the EU's ``finalite politique{''} by
   focusing on an analysis of their electoral manifestos prepared for the
   European Parliament elections in the period 2004-19. Based on the
   conceptual metaphor theory and a mixture of quantitative and qualitative
   methods of metaphor analysis combining insights from European studies
   and cognitive linguistics, the analysis subsequently aims to estimate
   the positions of selected parties on the EU's finality. I show that
   while there are differences between the parties in their preferred
   ``finalites politiques,{''} there is a certain mainstream party
   agreement on the issue.},

Abstract = {Cooperation in international organizations (IOs) is sustained by the
   socialization of state agents and their internalization of the
   organizations' norms and identity. This article builds on a structured
   comparison of the scope conditions for socialization among permanent
   representatives in two organs of the European Union and the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization-the Political and Security Committee (PSC)
   and the North Atlantic Council (NAC). In this study, we present some
   unexpected findings: First, the NAC is experiencing greater
   internalization (stronger socialization) than the PSC, normally held as
   a critical case of international socialization. Second, unambiguous
   norms favour socialization to a larger degree than ambiguous norms,
   refuting a widely held assumption about the pro-internalization effect
   of diffuse norms. Given that member states seem to grant their
   representatives larger ``room for manoeuvre{''} when the norms of the IO
   have material stakes, the socialization effect of an IO's norms is
   dependent on the perceived utility of the organization's mission.},

Abstract = {Upon taking office as President of the European Commission in 2014,
   Jean-Claude Juncker initiated a series of reforms to the internal
   workings of the EU executive. Existing research suggests that these have
   been successful in increasing political steering, creating a Commission
   which focuses on fewer fields, controls the policy activism of its
   officials and produces less legislative output. However, much of this
   research focuses on the Commission as a whole. This article addresses a
   gap in the literature by exploring how the Juncker reforms have impacted
   upon the policy-making structures and internal dynamics within two
   contrasting policy sectors - energy and health. It finds that the
   reforms have been successful in prioritising selected policy initiatives
   and increasing top-down steering of the Commission but that, whilst this
   has led to centralised coordination and reduced conflict in energy
   policy, it has served to curb purposeful opportunism and legislative
   activity in health policy.},

   policy putting them in the larger context of international trade. Each
   of them generates innovative theoretical and empirical insights into the
   politics of EU trade policy. Taken together, they represent the
   diversity and depth of EU trade policy scholarship in recent years which
   has achieved significant conceptual and methodological maturity and can
   help us understand some of the most critical trends in international
   trade pertaining to the EU, especially when productively combined with
   international and comparative political economy approaches. The article
   also contemplates on some questions stemming from these works suggesting
   new directions for the students of EU trade.},

Abstract = {We measure the economic risk of COVID-19 at a geo-spatially detailed
   resolution. In addition to data about the current prevalence of
   confirmed cases, we use data from 2014-2018 and a conceptual disaster
   risk model to compute measures for exposure, vulnerability, and
   resilience of the local economy to the shock of the epidemic. Using a
   battery of proxies for these four concepts, we calculate the hazard, the
   principal components of exposure and vulnerability to it, and of the
   economy's resilience (i.e. its ability of the recover rapidly from the
   shock). We find that the economic risk of this pandemic is particularly
   high in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.
   These results are consistent when comparing an ad hoc equal weighting
   algorithm for the four components of the index, an algorithm that
   assumes equal hazard for all countries, and one based on estimated
   weights using previous aggregated disability-adjusted life years losses
   associated with communicable diseases.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {185-199},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article argues that rhetorical analysis is a method particularly
   well-suited for the study of political disputes and introduces
   commonplaces as a tool to conduct such analysis. Commonplaces function
   as key reference points that produce and organise social meaning; they
   can thus help to clarify the terms of the dispute and illuminate how
   these are linked to broader debates within the political community.
   Commonplaces call into attention sedimented views and point to
   alternative norms of action pursued by agents of change and therefore to
   entry points for recontestation. The article substantiates this claim
   through a case study that maps arguments for climate action in party
   manifestos in the 2019 General Election in the United Kingdom. A
   rhetorical analysis of the material highlights the emergence of a number
   of insurgent commonplaces that seek to disturb the dominance of
   `economic growth' as principle that informs climate action. Commonplaces
   can provide a more nuanced understanding of public debates, help to
   identify sedimented ideological views, and illuminate openings for
   recontestation and the pursuit of alternative socio-ecological
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {Collaborative governance processes seek to engage diverse policy actors
   in the development and implementation of consensus-oriented policy and
   management actions. Whether this is achieved, however, largely depends
   on the degree to which actors with different beliefs coordinate their
   actions to achieve common policy goals-a behavior known as
   cross-coalition coordination. Drawing on the Advocacy Coalition
   Framework and collaborative governance literatures, this study analyzes
   cross-coalition coordination in three collaborative environmental
   governance processes that seek to manage water in the Colorado River
   Basin. Through comparative analysis, it highlights the complex
   relationship among the institutional design of a collaborative
   governance process, how and why actors choose to engage in
   cross-coalition coordination, and the consequent policy outputs they
   produce. The findings advance policy scholars' nascent understanding of
   cross-coalition coordination and its potential to affect policymaking
   dynamics.},

Title = {The fault in Japan's stars: Shinzo Abe, North Korea, and the quest for a
   new Japanese constitution},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {In the wake of North Korea's progressive missile testing that set even
   the usually stoic Japanese people into a panic mode, Japan has found
   itself at the mercy of its former enemies. In an ironic twist of fate,
   Tokyo's security outlooks seem to have become hostage to the strategic
   calculations of its fiercest nemesis in the past. This paper asks
   whether Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's desire for constitutional change is
   precipitated mainly by the resurgence of Japanese nationalist sentiments
   as what many of his critics claim, or if there are genuinely rational
   justifications for revising the country's 72-year old Constitution. And
   if so, why has it been so elusive for many Japanese leaders? Using
   neoclassical realism theory, I analyze the structural contexts and
   domestic intervening variables that simultaneously drive and prevent the
   realization of constitutional change in Japan. I argue that state
   leaders like Abe and those who have come before him have always been
   prone to acquiring flawed and inaccurate perceptions of the systemic
   stimuli; susceptible to making irrational and unsound decisions; and
   ineffective at mobilizing the national resources demanded by their
   preferred policies and strategies. Thus, despite having rational
   justifications, the quest for constitutional change has remained elusive
   for many Japanese leaders. Success will require Abe to carefully
   harmonize domestic and international expectations; prudently balance
   Japan's benign security intentions and hawkish military strategies; and
   shift away from his pragmatic-ambivalent style of domestic politics.},

Abstract = {Contributing to burgeoning studies of populism, this article
   conceptualises and contextualises Trump's language as `Jacksonian
   populism'. We explore how this style of populist discourse influenced
   political debates before and after Trump's election. Ours is the first
   article to analyse opposition and media responses to Trump's
   construction of `real America' as that of a Jacksonian, White, and male
   working class. To do so, the article analyses 1165 texts, from the
   government, opposition, newspapers, television coverage, and social
   media. In addition to locating Trump's reification of a mythologised
   White working class within a broader Jacksonian tradition, we find that
   the Democratic opposition and mainstream media initially reproduced this
   construction, furthering Trump's cause. Even where discursive challenges
   were subsequently developed, they often served to reproduce a distinct -
   and hitherto unspoken for - White (male) working-class America. In
   short, early resistance actively reinforced Trump's discursive hegemony,
   which centred on reclaiming the primacy of working, White America in the
   national identity.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the impact of structural adjustment
   programmes, widely known as the `neoliberal model', on the resilience of
   authoritarianism during Ben Ali's regime in Tunisia, to uncover the
   possible outcomes of the embedded neoliberal and the authoritarian
   blending. To do this, it engages with two sets of broad questions. How
   did the Ben Ali regime continue to maintain the regime's tight grip on
   power in Tunisia during a `neoliberal' transformation which in theory
   aims at reducing state influence? What does the Tunisian example tell us
   about the nature of embedded neoliberalism and its links with
   authoritarianism in general? The article answers these questions through
   the analysis of the novel social policy institutions of economic
   restructuring that took place during the Ben Ali era, namely the
   National Solidarity Fund, the Tunisian Solidarity Bank and the National
   Employment Fund. It concludes that these new tools under `neoliberal'
   transformation increased state intervention in both politics and the
   economy, and reproduced the societal dependence on the state. Such form
   of neoliberalism has helped to sustain authoritarianism, but at the same
   time led to its demise when the social contract in which selective
   social benefits were provided in exchange for political loyalty failed.},

Abstract = {This article applies the ideas of the core executive and court politics
   to Danish coalition and minority governments. It asks two questions. Do
   these ideas travel beyond their Westminster origins? What are the
   dilemmas confronting the Danish executive and its court politics? The
   analysis is based on documentary sources and 22 elite interviews with
   cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries. It identifies a duopoly of
   Prime Minister and Minister of Finance as a distinctive variety of court
   politics. It identifies the key dilemmas confronted by the Danish
   executive; namely trust, political support and politicization. It
   concludes that court politics provides unique insights into the workings
   of Danish government. The article is a contribution to the comparative
   analysis of the court politics of governing elites. It shows that the
   focus on court politics is not only useful for majoritarian Westminster
   systems but also for the analysis of consensual parliamentary
   democracies.},

Abstract = {The civil conflict literature often relies on state capacity having
   significant impacts on the risk of, and duration of, civil war and other
   civil conflicts. Many characteristics of civil conflict are often
   similar to terrorism, especially domestic terrorism, and are also
   considered when discussing the predictors of terror. However, what is
   not considered in either area of the literature is alternative
   characteristics of state capacity, namely, the degree of fragmentation
   in the policymaking branches, and its ability to enforce and carry out
   the laws that are implemented. This paper examines these effects,
   expanding the interpretation of state capacity to include these
   aforementioned concepts, and testing them simultaneously with the extant
   interpretation of capacity. Results show that when including these
   additional characteristics of capacity, previously accepted predictors
   are no longer relevant in predicting terrorism.},

Abstract = {This research argues that an imagined artifact, the IS coins, serves as
   a transhistorical artifact, condensing the larger ideology of the
   violent extremist organization of legitimacy and sovereignty. This paper
   conducts a qualitative content analysis on all references to IS Coin
   withinDabiq,al-Naba,Rumiyahand all the official videos publicized in the
   above magazines from April 2014 to September 2018. The power of one
   artifact, in this case, coin, embodies the whole ideology of ISIS and
   transports the ideology from the past to the present to the future and
   the artifact belongs to daily life, amplifies its power.},

Abstract = {From 2003 to 2011, the US-based non-profit contractor, Research Triangle
   Institute, was awarded \$500 million to establish local government
   institutions. The effort to construct 1,000 councils was one of the
   largest funded projects in USAID history. In this paper, I show that
   contrary to the official statements made by USAID and occupation
   authorities, the Local Governance Project, a conventional international
   peacebuilding project, was integral to the security priorities of the
   occupation. I argue that these dynamics cannot be analysed in isolation
   of US imperial interests to create a client state in Iraq. Controlling
   the means of violence, particularly forms of power as manifested in
   local structures, was a central component of the US occupation to shape
   Iraq's political trajectory. This paper explores the workings of
   imperial power by analysing the establishment of the District Advisory
   Council in Sadr City - a district containing over half of Baghdad's
   population.},

Abstract = {Mozambique's 2019 elections resulted in a landslide victory for the
   incumbent Frelimo party, but they were also characterized by
   unprecedented levels of election related violence and other
   irregularities. The briefing demonstrates that polarization, which has
   been a common feature of Mozambican politics since independence, has
   become more pernicious at least since 2013. As is the case in other
   countries, pernicious polarization is contributing to rising
   authoritarianism in Mozambique. The briefing traces the roots of
   pernicious polarization, its shifting dynamics over the last several
   years, and its impact on the exercise of democratic rights in
   Mozambique's recent elections.},

Abstract = {This article maintains that in order to develop constitutional faith in
   the region, there must be both a firm constitutional identity and trust
   in the state's capacity to deliver important public goods. The limited
   growth of both constitutional identity and trust in the state has
   therefore inhibited the development of constitutional faith in the
   Caribbean. The Independence movements in the region were typified by
   European retention, thereby inhibiting a Caribbean constitutional
   identity. Further, the apparent inability of state organs in some
   countries to furnish security and justice undermines faith in the
   constitution and its institutions. This article proposes a creolised
   approach to both constitutional development and state engagement with
   citizens as a means of fostering greater faith in the constitution.},

Abstract = {Although regional integration processes are mainly shaped around trade,
   economic and security objectives, health does come into the picture as
   it has an interface with each of those domains. Yet, reviews of
   relationships between regional integration and global and public health
   have so far been confined to specific organizations, geographic areas
   and thematic issues. This article, in contrast, attempts a comprehensive
   cross-cutting analysis of such relationships on a world-wide basis. The
   article demonstrates and systematizes mechanisms by which regional
   integration organizations address various aspects of health services and
   population health. It also explores how such mechanisms, and regional
   integration processes in general, contribute to international health
   cooperation and global health. The article argues that the
   multidisciplinary landscape of regional integration amplifies
   opportunities for the multisectoral dimension of - and cross-sectoral
   coherence for - public health policy to manifest and function. The
   author also argues that the health dimension of regional integration
   processes may serve an important component of the rapidly expanding
   space of governance for global health.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Family, Gender and
   (dis)Abled Bodies after 1953{''}, guest-edited by Maike Lehmann and
   Alexandra Oberlander.
   Research on the history of masculinities and fatherhood during state
   socialism in East Central Europe is still rare. Therefore, scholars in
   the field of women's and gender studies sometimes reproduce the idea of
   men in that region as stable characters across the period of socialist
   rule. In particular, they insist that ``official,{''} that is,
   state-sanctioned, representations of masculinity did not change. Yet, as
   I show, there is evidence that socialist authors, journalists, and even
   the politburos of the regions' communist parties did reflect on what
   they perceived as the need to change the conceptions of men and fathers.
   They advocated men's greater participation in housework and child care.
   In this article, I examine this ``struggle for a socialist
   fatherhood{''} in the GDR, focusing mainly on the discussions and
   suggestions of sociologists, educationalists, psychologists, and
   sexologists active in the study of childhood and adolescence, sex
   education, or marriage and family. From the 1960s on, experts from these
   fields as well as communist politicians targeted increasingly men to
   implement equality in marriage and parenting. In the 1970s and 1980s,
   their suggestions became more and more concrete. These suggestions as
   well as the theoretical discussions demonstrate the enduring belief in
   the socialist society's ability to overcome traditional gender
   stereotypes. Even in the late 1980s, they were future directed and
   contained a utopian element.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Family, Gender and
   (dis)Abled Bodies after 1953{''}, guest-edited by Maike Lehmann and
   Alexandra Oberlander. In this article, I examine the academic discourses
   and socio-educational practices in post-war socialist Czechoslovakia
   concerning children who were considered ``behaviorally difficult,{''}
   and I analyze those discourses and practices as elements of biopolitics
   and governmentality. I concentrate on the diagnostic conceptualizations
   introduced into the psycho-medical discourse of the 1950s and 1960s by
   what was called ``defectology.{''} Czechoslovak defectologists, who
   composed their approaches from Soviet, Czech, and other academic
   sources, explained children's difficult behavior in terms of
   ``defectivity,{''} that is, a disturbed relationship between the
   individual and his or her social environment. The educational aims of
   defectology and the communist regime converged in the ideal of the
   ``embodiment of socialism,{''} according to which the difficult child
   should be taught to be a conforming, able-minded, and productive
   citizen. The preferred treatment for reaching this goal was reeducation
   in the expanding network of residential institutions. However,
   defectology had no solution to the increasing number of children
   diagnosed as difficult or deviant. Moreover, other disciplines, like
   psychology, pediatrics, and pedagogy, criticized its conceptual
   inadequacy, which reoriented the discourse and governmentality toward
   prevention. I also show how gender and ethnicity abetted the diagnosis
   and affected the treatment of behavioral difficulties, for
   defectologists and other practitioners considered ``sexually
   deprived{''} girls and ``Gypsy children{''} as the ``embodiment of
   deviance.{''}},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between
   personal sense of power (PSP) and compliance as a function of the
   interaction between negative emotion intensity and emotion regulation
   tactics.
   Design/methodology/approach
   First, hypotheses linking PSP to different emotional reactions and to
   different levels of compliance with two types of conflict management
   styles were formulated. Subsequently, data were collected in three waves
   with a five-week interval between them to test the hypotheses.
   Findings
   Results based on principle component analysis and confirmatory factor
   analysis indicated that workers with high PSP reported lower
   internalized negative emotions (negative emotions directed to the self)
   in the workplace and were less inclined to comply with harsh tactics, in
   comparison to workers with low PSP. The importance of emotional
   components (suppression and negative emotions in the workplace) was
   underscored by the moderated mediation model: internalized negative
   emotions mediated the association between PSP and compliance with harsh
   tactics as a function of level of suppression such that the link between
   negative affect and compliance was negative only under high suppression,
   but not under low suppression.
   Research limitations/implications
   The findings point to the deleterious influence of high emotional
   suppression of negative emotions on study behaviors, especially for
   employees with a low sense of power. Because the data were collected
   from a single source, which could raise concerns about common method
   variance and social desirability bias, future study should examine
   other-reports.
   Practical implications
   Recruitment and training of employees and managers should aim to create
   an open and safe organizational environment that encourages emotional
   expression and lessens emotional suppression.
   Social implications
   The findings can help develop empowering interventional programs to
   coach employees to use suppression in an adaptive manner.
   Originality/value
   The current study sheds new light on the relationships between PSP and
   compliance from the emotion regulation perspective.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Family, Gender and
   (dis)Abled Bodies after 1953{''}, guest-edited by Maike Lehmann and
   Alexandra Oberlander.
   While the ideal of the New Socialist Wo/Man was never fully realized and
   seems to have been abandoned across the Eastern Bloc after 1953, the
   question still arises what role individuals were to play within the
   socialist system. As dichotomous conceptualizations of state and society
   are being repeatedly criticized in recent years, we propose to look at
   how the role of the individual was imagined by different actors in
   Eastern European countries and how the ideals inherent in these
   imaginations were (to be) embodied. One possible avenue would be to
   explore the role of official language for subjectivization processes as
   they have been discussed during the last twenty years in Soviet studies.
   We, however, want to turn the attention towards the body and its role in
   shaping the individual in a cluster dealing with the impact family,
   gender, and dis/ability (were meant to) have on the formation of an
   individual body and its place within broader society. This is to explore
   some of the ways in which anybody could become somebody in socialist
   Eastern Europe and might help to shift the attention from dichotomous
   conceptualizations of political dogma and social practice towards an
   exploration of socialism as a diverse, yet specific cultural system.},

   in un-led processes on Developments in the Field of icts in the Context
   of International Security. The purpose of this article is therefore to
   analyse -and provide insights on- the place of international law in the
   context of the ungge and oewg, and to explain how international law is
   being instrumentalized in the present discussions. Firstly, it will
   explain the context in which these two processes were established and
   their respective mandates. Secondly, it will discuss the ambiguity -or
   even confusion- about the role of norms and international law in the
   regulation of cyberspace and the geopolitical motivations behind it.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the dynamics of trade negotiations over over-the-top
   (OTT) video streaming services (VSS) in the multilateral trading system.
   Specifically, it compares specific commitments made under the General
   Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and offers submitted to the Doha
   Round negotiations by the European Union and the United States, and
   examines the two countries' recent domestic media regulatory reforms in
   order to delineate major negotiation issues for OTT VSS. The findings of
   the analysis suggest that the EU continues to take an `all-or-nothing'
   negotiating strategy while the US takes a `salami-slice' strategy on OTT
   VSS to pursue the utmost trade liberalization in the sector. The case
   study of OTT VSS highlights fundamental issues central to the ongoing
   services trade negotiations in the digital era. It may provide
   policymakers with significant implications regarding digital trade
   policy.},

Abstract = {What drives gradual change in authoritarian regimes? This paper argues
   the institutional turn in comparative authoritarianism benefits from
   more robust engagement with theories of endogenous change that give
   greater weight to the role of cognition, ideas, and agency. While
   structural accounts of elite bargaining at critical junctures are key to
   understanding authoritarian change they are indeterminate with respect
   to long-term outcomes. Empirically, this article addresses unexplained
   puzzles, such as the emergence of a relatively professional print media
   in the otherwise controlled environment of the Chinese press. This
   analysis thus highlights political factionalism, principle-agent
   problems, and horizontal selection of policy ideas as important
   additional mechanisms of institutional change in authoritarian systems.},

Abstract = {Within the study of intrastate armed conflicts, many scholars rely on a
   bargaining model when explaining why some civil wars are intractable.
   Primarily, scholars posit that commitment problems represent a key
   barrier to settling conflicts through negotiations. Yet, some civil wars
   are more easily resolved than others. If commitment problems are a
   universal feature of civil wars, what explains why commitment problems
   are more salient in some conflicts as compared to others? We argue that
   ideological differences between combatants enhance commitment problems
   in civil wars. Assuming that ideology is used by combatants to generate
   support, concessions that violate the ideological goals of each side may
   alienate supporters. With extreme ideological polarization, concessions
   may be viewed as relative as opposed to absolute, making it difficult
   for either side to credibly commit to offer concessions. To test these
   claims, we quantitatively examine the duration and outcome of all
   intrastate conflicts from 1975 to 2011.},

Abstract = {This article defines a concept of relative trust-the gap between trust
   in different levels of government in a federalist system-and examines
   whether it influences public attitudes about which level of government
   holds authority in specific policy domains. While scholars have explored
   how trust in government affects political systems from a national
   perspective, little is known about how trust influences multitiered
   government systems in which public trust levels differ for national
   versus subnational governments. This article finds that greater relative
   trust in the state versus national level of government is associated
   with support for devolution in several policy areas where governing
   authority is shared: unemployment, health care, environmental policy,
   and food safety regulation. The implication is that relative trust
   shapes public preferences about policy centralization or
   decentralization and provides an individual-level mechanism through
   which windows of opportunity open for changes in the allocation of
   policy authority.},

Abstract = {Agencification has been pursued globally under the promise of increasing
   public administration performance. In spite of ample theoretical
   arguments, the empirical evidence on the causal link between
   agencification and performance remains scarce and methodologically
   contested. We contribute to this debate by empirically testing the
   impacts of agencification across Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom
   on value-for-money, competitiveness, and timeliness during the period
   2006-2016. We use unique administrative datasets, enabling objective and
   granular measurements of reforms and their effects, employing
   quasi-experimental methods. Findings suggest heterogeneous effects both
   across countries and outcomes. On average, value-for-money improves by
   2.8\% or 1.7 billion EUR over a decade, while outputs and processes
   change only marginally. Recently agencified organizations barely improve
   their performance, while older agencies achieve substantial
   improvements. The three countries' heterogeneous administrative contexts
   play a critical role as mediating factors, with the biggest changes
   occurring in higher new public management take-up countries.},

Abstract = {NATO's enlargement into Central and Eastern Europe after the Cold War is
   the subject of significant debate in academic and policy circles. With
   few exceptions, however, this debate focuses on single issues, such as
   whether enlargement led to the decline of the West's relations with
   Russia. In this framing document, we look to expand the debate. We do so
   by sequentially reviewing the process by which NATO enlarged, outlining
   the array of issue areas within which to assess the consequences of NATO
   enlargement, and highlighting the particular importance of
   counterfactual analysis to any judgment of enlargement's legacy.
   Building on a May 2019 workshop at Boston University, we also summarize
   the results of several articles that collectively evaluate the
   consequence of expansion for the USA, Russia, non-US NATO members, and
   the organization itself. Finally, we conclude by outlining elements of a
   broader research program on the aftereffects of NATO enlargement.},

Abstract = {Investment in an ``education with an edge{''} in the form of costly
   extracurriculars is a growing phenomenon in urban post-socialist
   Romania. To a certain extent, this is a typical strategy of middle-class
   reproduction, more intensely pursued in contexts where middle-class
   reproduction is imagined as uncertain. However, in a post-socialist
   context, a sense of fragility permeates both the experience of the
   present and imaginings of the future. Despite its political idealisation
   and programmatic support, Romania's middle class remains of modest
   dimensions and is extending itself to live a ``good enough life.{''}
   Parents' realisation that their children might experience even more
   difficulties than themselves prompt them to use their economic capital
   to acquire as many and varied cultural and social resources as possible.
   An ethnographic investigation of this experience from both the parents'
   and children's perspectives throws light on the ongoing processes of
   class formation under post-socialist conditions of possibility.},

Abstract = {Can deliberate political instability, including terrorism and/or
   political violence, have an effect on changing formal political
   institutions? This paper offers two major contributions toward answering
   this question, one focused on data and one focused on methodology. In
   the first instance, this paper introduces a brand-new dataset of monthly
   political instability in Russia from 1788 to 1914; Czarist Russia was a
   country plagued by informal instability and political violence
   throughout the nineteenth century, and which saw waves of reform and
   reaction. As such, it makes an excellent test case for examining the
   relationship between informal political instability and formal political
   change. Secondly, in order to trace the evolution of Russia's political
   institutions in the presence of various forms of instability, I utilize
   non-traditional estimation in the form of Poisson, IV-Poisson-GMM, and
   logistic regressions to account for the slow-moving nature of political
   regime change. The results of these estimations show that some forms of
   instability did indeed ``work{''} in forcing a modicum of
   liberalization. On the other hand, large-scale unrest or external
   conflict had no correlation with political regime change and actually
   appeared to be counterproductive.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to understand the conditions in which
   subordinates, after making a mistake, are more likely to engage in
   feedback avoidance behaviour (FAB), a set of behaviours that could
   ultimately jeopardise patient safety in a health care context.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study used a sample of 183 independent leader-subordinate dyads in
   the health care service sector. For this study, a multiple mediator
   model in which three types of conflict (task conflict, relationship
   conflict and process conflict) were tested and acted as mediating
   mechanisms that transmitted the effects of perceived dissimilarity to
   FAB.
   Findings
   The results supported the mediating role of two of the three forms of
   conflict and highlighted the consequences of dissimilarity between
   supervisors and subordinates in the healthcare setting.
   Research limitations/implications - One of the noteworthy limitations of
   this study was that this study used cross-sectional time-lagged data.
   Future research should use a more rigorous longitudinal approach such as
   a cross-lagged design (Whitman et al., 2012) to explore the dynamic
   nature of dyadic relationships over time. Practical implications - An
   important implication of our study results suggests that health care
   leadership development training should provide opportunities to increase
   awareness of the tendency of leaders to treat subordinates perceived as
   dissimilar more negatively.
   Originality/value
   These results contribute to our understanding of the interpersonal
   processes between subordinates and their supervisors, which could have a
   significant impact on organisational outcomes in the health care
   setting.},

Abstract = {The all-round and multilevel responses to the epidemic, with
   professional medical institutions, the governments and the public as the
   main agents of response and the media as the bridge of communication,
   are key to developing the public health emergency management system with
   regard to emerging infectious diseases and diseases with unknown
   etiology in the information age. This study creates an analysis
   framework concerning the five dimensions of information-the epidemic
   itself and the medical, governmental, public and media responses-and
   analyzes the evolution, interaction and trends of five dimensions using
   big data within the period of observation For the four dimensions other
   than the media response, the level of information related to the
   epidemic and the medical response is relatively high, while the level of
   response by medical institutions and the governments are similar, and
   both are higher than the public response. The media coverage of the
   epidemic remains at a high level of information. In relation to such
   diseases, the government should take the role of big data analytics
   seriously, lead a multi-agent social collaboration network, and further
   strengthen the `One Planning Plus Three Systems' framework related to
   emergency management in China.},

Abstract = {In China, sub-provincial governments are responsible for managing public
   health emergencies. In the context of coordinating multiple
   stakeholders, the role of the local government can be defined as
   `meta-governance'. It shall provide rules to facilitate collective
   action and co-produce quality public services. However, the case of
   Wuhan suggests that some local governments still rely on the traditional
   administrative system, which hampers them in terms of issuing a
   sufficient response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Three measures can be
   taken to facilitate a public governance mechanism in public health
   emergency management. First, local governments can use the ICTs to
   create a more transparent information mechanism. The free flow of
   information could alert all stakeholders to potential emergencies, while
   the open government data form the base for cross-border collaboration.
   Second, a more comprehensive Public Health Emergency Preparedness is
   constructive for local governments in making quality and immediate
   decisions. This preparedness shall clearly define the responsibility of
   the involved agencies based on a careful evaluation of their
   qualification and capability. Third, the local government shall note
   that good governance requires more than an executive capacity based on
   command-and-control. It is necessary to develop the ability to work with
   stakeholders outside the bureaucratic system.},

Abstract = {Do fake news and what some have labeled our post-truth predicament
   represent a new and deadly challenge to the epistemic presuppositions of
   the public sphere? While many commentators have invoked Hannah Arendt to
   help answer this question, I argue that Arendt is the wrong place to
   look. Instead, I suggest that, on one hand, deliberative democracy and
   Jurgen Habermas' idea of democracy as truth-tracking offer a more
   helpful framework for assessing and combating the threat of fake news
   and, on the other hand, Bernard Williams' virtues of accuracy identify
   the citizen virtues necessary to counteract fake news. The virtues of
   accuracy, I contend, can be facilitated and encouraged through
   structural and regulatory features in the public sphere. We are indeed
   seeing a recalibration and significant push back on fake news due to
   both structural changes and ordinary citizens becoming more
   epistemically responsible consumers of digital information.},

Abstract = {At the start of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the ECB's sui generis
   nature as one of the most independent central banks of an entity lacking
   political union evoked concerns that it would be both too constrained
   (limited mandate) and enjoy too much discretion (limited ex-post
   accountability) in comparison to central banks like the US Federal
   Reserve. Were these concerns justified? Using a principal-agent
   framework, this contribution contrasts the ECB with the Federal Reserve
   in their reactions to the global financial crisis and how the available
   accountability mechanisms were used. Early concerns that the ECB would
   pursue only price stability at the expense of other economic objectives
   were exaggerated, though criticism about its accountability proved
   prescient.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This themed issue entitledSocial Investment in the Knowledge-Based
   Economyaims to investigate desirable policy packages of social
   investment for the knowledge-based economy, the interactions between
   policy and economic inequality, and political and institutional
   configurations that shape policies. This introduction to our themed
   issue situates the contribution of the volume in the literature,
   summarizes the main findings and their implications, and identifies core
   issues for a future research agenda. We trace the development of the
   social investment approach over time and across regions, and we explain
   its logic and the accumulated evidence supporting its importance. We
   then link our contributions squarely to the transition to the knowledge
   economy and the concern with innovation, growth, and inequality. We
   summarize the policy lessons emerging from the individual articles which
   emphasize specifically the need to treat social investment as
   complementary to social protection. We also summarize the insights into
   the politics of generating support coalitions for the introduction of
   effective social investment policies, emphasizing the leadership role of
   political parties in shaping both public preferences and legislation.
   Finally, we outline some key unanswered questions, among them questions
   regarding the obstacles to major progress in social investment so far
   and the impact of immigration and party system fragmentation on future
   progress.},

Abstract = {Why do some people go abroad to engage in other people's wars? Some
   studies attempt to discern why individuals choose to fight in distant
   lands (Malet, 2013) or seek to count how many do so (Hegghammer, 2013).
   The term foreign fighter has been used nearly exclusively in recent
   research to describe transnational fighters who join with Islamist
   organizations, or more generally for individuals fighting with
   resistance groups against a state. However, little research has been
   done on the many transnational fighters who travel to fight against
   resistance groups or against Islamist organizations. Our paper examines
   these transnational militants who battle against the Islamic State,
   focusing on Americans who engage in such activities, often referred to
   as volunteers. Through a review of open-source media, we created a
   dataset of these individuals, recording demographic data such as each
   individual's military experience and stated purpose for becoming a
   transnational fighter. We show descriptive analyses on these data, and
   then compare these findings against current scholarship on Islamist
   transnational fighters. We argue that American volunteers and foreign
   terrorist fighters are phenomena with difference in degree, but not in
   kind.},

Abstract = {While during the first decade the common currency helped stabilise the
   Italian economy by overcoming political constraints that blocked debt
   reduction, during its second decade the euro has rather served to
   destabilise the country politically and economically. The combination of
   a single currency and a single market in financial services turned into
   an engine of massive macroeconomic imbalances that came to a head in a
   typical sudden stop in the years following 2009. While Italy had steered
   clear of the financial imbalances of the southern periphery during the
   first decade of EMU, its debt legacy problem, despite continuous primary
   surpluses, made it a target for financial contagion during the second.
   The EU's recipe of austerity and structural reform exacerbated the
   problem thus reversing the long-term trend of falling debt to GDP ratios
   and handing an electoral victory to populist Euro-sceptics by a public
   that increasingly came to see the EU as a threat to prosperity and
   social inclusion.},

Abstract = {This contribution looks at asymmetries in terms of French and German
   influence on EMU's governance reforms during the two decades since the
   start of EMU in 1999. Drawing on the literature dealing with the sources
   of power and influence in EU decision-making, this contribution
   investigates key moments of the evolution and reform of EMU - the
   establishment and reform of fiscal rules, the creation of fiscal
   instruments and institutions of risk mutualizing including risk sharing
   pillars of the Bank Union. It makes a contribution to the literature by
   providing an account of the asymmetry of German and French influence and
   power in EMU governance reforms and, most importantly, their variations
   over time. Furthermore, it contributes to our understanding of the
   lasting nature of asymmetry in EMU.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of women in local civil society
   peacebuilding organisations in Bukavu, South Kivu in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo's. Situating the study in post-liberal
   peacebuilding theory it examines the questions of whom has an agency to
   articulate local knowledge and needs in local peacebuilding processes
   and how. The paper concludes that while local civil society
   peacebuilding organisations present women with opportunities to
   participate in peacebuilding processes at the grassroots level, that
   these organisations do not have the capacity to challenge entrenched
   power and gender norms.},

Title = {It Depends on What You Share: The Elusive Cost Savings from Service
   Sharing},

Abstract = {Intermunicipal cooperation is the most prevalent alternative service
   delivery method for US local governments. While aspirations for
   budgetary savings are one motivating factor, increased service quality
   and regional coordination are also important goals. We use an original
   2013 survey of local governments in New York State to assess the level
   of service sharing and outcomes. We match our survey with 20 years
   (1996-2016) of service-level costs data to explore the relationships
   between sharing and costs across 12 common local government services. We
   contribute to the literature by providing the first multivariate
   assessment of the effect of cooperation on costs in the United States,
   and we contribute theoretical insights on the objectives and type of
   cooperation to explain differences in the effects of cooperation on
   costs across a variety of services. Our multivariate time series
   regressions find that service sharing leads to cost reductions in solid
   waste management, roads and highways, police, library, and sewer
   services; no difference in costs for economic development,
   ambulance/EMS, fire, water, and youth recreation; and higher costs in
   elder services, and planning and zoning. These differences are explained
   by whether services have characteristics such as asset specificity and
   the ability to achieve economies of scale on the one hand, or if sharing
   leads to greater administrative intensity or promotes other objectives
   such as quality and regional coordination outcomes on the other hand. We
   also analyze the effect of sharing on service costs over time, and find
   solid waste, roads and highways, police, and library are the only
   services where costs show a continued downward trend. These results show
   the limited role for economies of scale, even in asset specific
   services. Because cost savings are elusive, public sector reformers
   should be careful not to assume cost savings from sharing. The
   theoretical foundations for service sharing extend beyond economies of
   scale and transaction costs. Scholars should give more attention to
   organizational form and the broader goals of sharing.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen mass adoption of social media by ministries of
   foreign affairs (MFAs). However, diplomats are still searching for ways
   to evaluate their online activity and assess the impact of online
   activities on offline diplomacy. This article argues that the centrality
   of a diplomatic institution to a Twitter network of its peer can be used
   to evaluate both online and offline diplomacy. Central actors on Twitter
   can set diplomats' offline agenda, influence how diplomats view issues
   being debated in diplomatic forums, gather information relevant to the
   policy formulation process and become information brokers between
   nations. Moreover, through a two-year analysis of the Twitter networks
   of MFA and UN missions we demonstrate that diplomatic institutions can
   perform an act of upward social media mobility by which they become more
   central to Twitter networks. We also show that hard power resources such
   as the relative wealth of nations and their population size does not
   guarantee online centrality. Thus, diplomatic institutions may suffer
   from downward social media mobility in which they become less
   influential online. Finally, we identify a set of digital tactics and
   strategies that enable MFAs and embassies to become more central to
   Twitter networks of their peers.},

Abstract = {Citizens' adherence to deliberative civic values fulfils a vital
   function in deliberative democratic systems. We propose a way to measure
   the prevalence and variations of such values as a first step to better
   understanding how this works. Based on survey data, we demonstrate that,
   in Sweden, adherence to the values of reasoning and listening is
   stronger than adherence to the strategic rhetorical, non-deliberative
   values. This may have important implications for our understanding of
   how deliberation and democracy work in this particular context. There
   are also, however, important individual-level variations of adherence to
   deliberative civic values related to age, education, gender and Swedish
   background. Taken together, this opens up for a new research agenda
   where comparative analyses of deliberative civic values and how it
   relates to political behaviour are particularly encouraged.},

Abstract = {As administrations increasingly rely on interorganizational networks to
   organize public service provision, this article inspects the role
   resourcing plays in the way managers working in networks cope in the
   face of extreme events. Using comparative analyses of fieldwork in the
   context of two emergency service networks in two major cities in Germany
   and the US, we introduce the concept of resource transposition. This
   concept holds the potential to explain why and how networks might
   perform well in situations that drain its central participants'
   resources. We highlight the relevance of four practices: resource
   (re)production; resource administration through integration; resource
   administration through centralization; resource support. We derive a set
   of propositions underlining the usefulness of the concept of resource
   transposition.},

Abstract = {We present the case of the outbreak and containment of COVID-19 in its
   early stage and analyze the causes for conservative judgment of the
   disease control experts who are blamed for delayed action and inadequate
   response by the government. We find that the disease control experts
   have a clear tendency and preference to make conservative judgment about
   the epidemic risk of a low probability and high impact new disease. This
   conservative preference may have been a major factor in the judging and
   communicating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic. The experts' perception of
   the epidemic risk is affected by their habitual thinking facing a low
   probability event with uncertain progression. Their conservative
   preference is augmented by political concerns due to the high social and
   political impact of the event and the potential political consequence of
   a false judgment. Balancing personal payoffs of decision options, the
   experts' rational choice would lean towards a conservative decision. We
   propose a three-factor decision model that integrates habitual thinking,
   political concerns and rational choice to explain the experts'
   conservative judgment, and corroborate the model with evidences from the
   case. We conclude the paper with policy implications for improving
   experts' role in public health emergency response.},

Abstract = {Focusing on Italy in the years of the `migration crisis' between 2013
   and 2017, this article explores how migration, crime groups and the
   domestic politics of migration control became entangled in times of
   crisis. Departing from previous theoretical discussions, it builds a
   framework that combines crime groups' actions with domestic political
   processes in host countries and explores how the crime-migration nexus
   shaped - and was shaped by - Italian migration policymaking. The article
   contends that in the context of crisis the nexus took on new forms and
   that Italian migration politics and policies served to foster rather
   than counter the phenomenon, in a continuous interplay between criminal
   practices and policy choices.},

Abstract = {What explains support for violence against the state? The surge in
   survey-based studies in (former) conflict areas has improved our
   understanding of the determinants of armed conflict. Yet, the potential
   interaction between grievances and political opportunity structure has
   received little attention in microlevel studies. Integrating common
   arguments from the civil war literature with the political behavior
   tradition, this article argues that perceived political efficacy, a
   central component of the political opportunity structure, moderates the
   association between individual and group grievance and people's support
   for political violence. It represents a first individual-level test of
   the argument that perceived political opportunity structure and
   grievances combine to explain internal armed conflict. Using original
   survey data from Guatemala, Nepal, and Northern Ireland (2016), we find
   robust empirical evidence that support for violence increases with
   perceived grievance and decreases with political efficacy; and some
   evidence of an interaction between the two.},

Abstract = {Animals play an important part in the lives of the indigenous people of
   the Arctic. The various international instruments regulating hunting,
   fishing and herding activities have therefore early instituted
   derogatory regimes for them. Initially granted as a ``privilege{''} by
   the states, they were perceived in terms of law as soon as they were
   enshrined in the context of the rights of the indigenous peoples. Above
   all, they have been founded on rights we can qualify as ``vital{''},
   both from an individual (subsistence) point of view and a collective
   (culture, identity, way of live) one. Difficulties remain despite this
   grounding. First, the question arises about the identification of the
   beneficiaries of these derogatory regimes. These regimes should
   furthermore be conciliated with the preservation of other rights and
   interests, especially those relating to the growing preoccupation for
   the wellbeing and the sensibility of animals.},

Abstract = {I investigate the relationship between perception of public institutions
   and tax compliance using a large tax compliance laboratory experiment
   conducted in Italy and the United States. In the first test, I conduct a
   simple tax compliance game to uncover that given the exact same
   decisions, contributions to the public good do not differ between Italy
   and the United States. Second, I ask participants to pay taxes to their
   national government, pension fund and fire department. In these rounds,
   behaviours diverge with Italian participants complying significantly
   less than Americans. Theoretically, I provide evidence demonstrating
   that how individuals perceive their institutions is a crucial component
   of the tax compliance decision. Methodologically, I provide a unique
   experiment, which can help us to better explain crosscountry variation
   in tax compliance, by asking subjects to make country-specific tax
   decisions.},

Abstract = {One of the thornier areas of negotiation in the Comprehensive Economic
   and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU)
   was the issue of public procurement in the Canadian market. For the EU,
   the right to bid on government contracts was a critical component of
   engaging the two markets. For Canada, the idea of opening up public
   procurement to the European market provoked public protest. This paper
   uses public procurement as a platform to develop the realist perspective
   on the EU's economic competitiveness, both within CETA and within the
   WTO. Both the process and outcome of negotiations within CETA illustrate
   the role of the EU as a deliberately dominant power in the realm of
   international trade liberalisation. This contribution to power-based
   theories of international relations is significant for the EU's own role
   in future trade negotiations, and its position in shaping precedents for
   the norms of international trade.},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized among state leaders and diplomats that personal
   relations play an important role in international politics. Recent work
   at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and sociology has
   highlighted the critical importance of face-to-face interactions in
   generating intention understanding and building trust. Yet, a key
   question remains as to why some leaders are able to `hit it off,'
   generating a positive social bond, while other interactions `fall flat,'
   or worse, are mired in negativity. To answer, we turn to micro-sociology
   - the study of everyday human interactions at the smallest scales - an
   approach that has theorized this question in other domains. Drawing
   directly from US sociologist Randall Collins, and related empirical
   studies on the determinants of social bonding, we develop a model of
   diplomatic social bonding that privileges interaction elements rather
   than the dispositional characteristics of the actors involved or the
   material environment in which the interaction takes place. We conclude
   with a discussion of how the study of interpersonal dyadic bonding
   interaction may move forward.},

Title = {Contesting Frames and (De)Securitizing Schemas: Bridging the Copenhagen
   School's Framework and Framing Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-166},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article bridges the Copenhagen school's (CS) framework and framing
   theory. Framing theory focuses on how a text frames its topic and is
   often applied to media sources. This is important because the media
   often is our sole source of learning about events and issues in the
   world. This article argues that bridging the CS framework and framing
   theory allow us to understand how the media conveys these issues and
   with what consequences. Through the bridging, the article makes two
   contributions to the existing debates on securitization. First, it
   introduces the concept of a (de)securitizing schema as an innovative way
   to analyze the media as a (de)securitizing actor. Second, the article
   uses the concept of a (de)securitizing schema to understand how
   contesting frames exist in the media. Empirically, the article analyzes
   two Danish case studies surrounding the migration movements on the
   European Union's southern border by undertaking a discourse analysis of
   four Danish newspapers. This empirical analysis shows how the media can
   be a securitizing actor, capable of employing multiple contesting
   frames-sometimes within a single news item. In addition, the Danish case
   illustrates how securitizing and desecuritizing frames evolve over time
   and from one case study to the next. The article concludes by reflecting
   on what the concept of securitizing schemas and contesting frames may
   imply for securitization studies and other case studies.},

Abstract = {This article adds to the emergent body of constitutional-theoretical
   research on populist government. It argues that constitutional analysis
   has specific importance in explaining the hostility to global legal
   norms that characterizes many populist or neo-nationalist polities.
   However, it argues that more classical perspectives in constitutional
   theory have not provided adequate explanations for this phenomenon. This
   is because constitutionalism itself misunderstands the sociological
   foundations of constitutional democracy and it promotes normative models
   of democracy, based in theories of popular sovereignty and constituent
   power, which create a legitimational space in which populism can
   flourish. In contrast, this article sets out a historical-sociological
   account of national democracy, explaining how democracy has been formed
   through processes of global norm construction. As a result, the basic
   subjects imputed to democracy by both constitutionalism and populism
   only became real on global normative foundations. In advancing these
   claims, this article presents a global-sociological critique of
   populism, explaining that populism evolves where the realities of
   democratic formation enter conflict with the norms of constitutional
   theory. In so doing, it offers a sociological theory of constitutional
   democracy that might help to avert democratic self-subversion.},

Abstract = {This article studies the role of a public regulator in managing the
   performance of healthcare professionals. It combines a networked
   governance perspective with responsive regulation theory to show the
   mechanisms that have added to significant changes in medical cost
   management in the Netherlands. In a five-year period, hospital practices
   transitioned from cosmetic compliance with performance regulation and
   strategic upcoding to institutionalized compliance more in line with
   regulatory goals. The article demonstrates how policy changes
   transformed incentive structures, introduced new forms of
   accountability, and added actors to the network with technocratic
   disciplining tasks. The networked character of performance regulation
   offered opportunities for a responsive, non-coercive regulatory strategy
   that engaged various actors in a regulatory conversation about strategic
   coding. Responsive regulation can reduce strategic responses to
   performance regulation and manage the gap between administrative and
   clinical logics. The case study contributes to our understanding of the
   effectiveness of responsive, non-punitive regulation in networked
   settings.},

Abstract = {Exposure to a single report about terrorism in the mass media can
   trigger a range of emotional and political reactions. The consequences
   of exposure to several terrorism reports in row, however, are a matter
   of controversy. We examine the effects of prolonged terrorism coverage
   using an experimental design that combines self-report measures of
   emotions and political attitudes with instantaneous biometric data on
   emotions. Consistent with research on nonassociational learning, we find
   that exposure to multiple videos habituates people to depictions of
   terrorism: the longer people watch terrorism coverage, the less intense
   their reactions are to the images of terrorism they see. Some images and
   videos, however, contribute to this result more than others. This
   suggests that the ultimate effects of terrorism coverage depend on the
   interplay between the quantity and quality of reporting, not the
   quantity alone.},

Abstract = {The European Central Bank (ECB) emerged from the sovereign debt crisis
   as one of the most powerful supranational institutions. Against this
   background, this article explains how and why the ECB became empowered
   during the euro area crisis. Building on the delegation, governor's
   dilemma, and epistemic community approaches, we argue that the ECB
   ability to play a strong role in this empowerment process and to
   convince member states to entrust it with more competences was the
   outcome of a combination of three factors: limited cohesiveness within
   the collective principal (Eurogroup); a fiduciary relationship
   characterized by broad discretion and independence on the trustee side
   (ECB); and strong specialization with the ECB acting as epistemic
   entrepreneur. We illustrate our argument with two cases: the Trichet
   letters exemplify an autonomous emergency empowerment and the
   introduction of the single supervisory mechanism demonstrates ECB
   influence on institutional design decisions in negotiating processes.},

Title = {The Juridification of the UK's Counter Terrorism Prevent Policy},

Abstract = {The U.K. policy of ``Prevent{''} aims to stop people becoming involved
   in, or supporting, terrorism. In common with many CVE policies
   worldwide, Prevent has remained controversial in its conception,
   delivery, and impact. A formal review is now underway, so it is
   opportune to ask, ``Whither Prevent?{''} This paper will examine briefly
   the justifications for Prevent, but the main thesis is that the
   juridification of Prevent is a beneficial trend in the U.K.
   Juridification is depicted as: the legislative production of ever more
   extensive and elaborate instruments; the expansion of judicial
   oversight; and the administrative (bureaucratic) application of soft law
   standards. Juridification is here invoked in order to enhance the
   legitimacy of the policy of Prevent through explicit improvements in its
   modes of operation and through offering modes of challenge where the
   principles of constitutionalism are contravened. If Prevent can be
   improved in these ways, then its application can be refined to address
   more effectively and efficiently the threat of terrorist attacks,
   especially given that the originators or observers of these threats are
   invited under the Prevent policy to cooperate by consent in the
   enterprise of counter terrorism.},

Abstract = {This article examines to what extent regulatory import (RI), a common,
   but understudied mode of governance in regime complexes, was a separate
   factor of the global financial crisis in 2008. RI describes a specific
   mode of governance that occurs when regulators explicitly incorporate
   functionally important governance from an external forum to their own
   regulations, thus making their own performance dependent on external
   agency. While RI is associated with benefits, such as specialisation, it
   could cause unintended consequences. The one-sided dependence on
   external authority could result in the import of non-complementary
   governance or regulatory failures and undermine the regulator's
   performance. We illustrate our argument with the Basel Committee on
   Banking Supervision that imported governance authority from the
   International Accounting Standards Board and credit rating agencies. The
   paper finds two negative consequences of RI for the Basel Committee's
   regulatory performance in the 2008 financial crisis. First,
   uncoordinated changes of accounting rules increased pro-cyclical effects
   that exacerbated the banking crisis. Second, import of credit risk
   measurement from credit rating agencies led to misjudgement of risk
   exposure.},

Abstract = {This article analyses three distinct child welfare data systems in
   England. We focus on child welfare as a contested area in public
   services where data systems are being used to inform decision-making and
   transforming governance. We advance the use of ``data assemblage{''} as
   an analytical framework to detail how key political and economic factors
   influence the development of these data systems. We provide an
   empirically grounded demonstration of why child welfare data systems
   must not be considered neutral decision aid tools. We identify how
   systems of thought, ownership structures, policy agendas, organizational
   practices, and legal frameworks influence these data systems. We find
   similarities in the move toward greater sharing of sensitive data, but
   differences in attitudes toward public-private partnerships, rights and
   uses of prediction. There is a worrying lack of information available
   about the impacts of these systems on those who are subject to them -
   particularly in relation to predictive data systems. We argue for policy
   debates to go beyond technical fixes and privacy concerns to engage with
   fundamental questions about the power dynamics and rights issues linked
   to the expansion of data sharing in this sector as well as whether
   predictive data systems should be used at all.},

Abstract = {Since the comparative turn in European integration research, analyses of
   the legislative process of the EU have taken inspiration from research
   on national political systems. While the consequences of the formal
   monopoly of initiative of the Commission are much analysed, it is only
   recently that the role of the Court in EU legislation has been further
   appreciated. In the literature, it is disputed how far case law
   constrains the EU legislator. The analysis of the 2016 proposal for a
   revision of the 1996 Posted Workers Directive allows us to uncover the
   mechanisms by which the European judiciary shapes and constrains
   agenda-setting based on the constitutionalization of EU law. In this
   highly political case, being hailed as a major breakthrough, we ask
   whether political majorities or case law constraints had the upper hand.},

Abstract = {The compatibility of Islam with the international human rights norms has
   been a continuous topic of debate. Diversity in Islam inevitably leaves
   all arguments inconclusive. This article compares the text of the
   Qur'an, which is the highest authority in Islam, with the International
   Bill of Rights (IBR) by focusing on economic rights and justice. The
   Qur'an and the IBR seek an egalitarian economic system that sets
   restrictions on the use of property. This article draws attention to the
   Qur'anic verses' emancipatory promise, which is also embedded in the
   IBR, but is often undermined by the privileged of both Muslim-majority
   and in other states.},

Abstract = {For decades, critical mass theory shaped expectations about the ways
   female politicians would behave in office. Newer studies, however, have
   challenged the theory's premise that ``token{''} women will avoid
   championing women's interests while women serving in more gender-diverse
   bodies will work together to advance them. In fact, many in the
   discipline now believe it is time to leave the idea of critical mass
   behind. These new studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of
   the link between women's descriptive and substantive representation. But
   the move away from critical mass leaves unresolved the question of how
   female legislators will adapt their policy priorities based on changes
   in the size of the female delegation. I seek to answer this question and
   hypothesize that the more women who serve in Congress, the less
   attention each female member of Congress will give to women's issues,
   and the more diverse the female agenda will become. This diversification
   should not, however, result in lower overall levels of attention to
   women's issues. Because responsibility for substantive representation is
   shared, with each woman continuing to contribute as the delegation
   grows, the women's agenda can diversify while attention to women's
   issues actually increases. An analysis of bill sponsorship data spanning
   60 years provides support for my theory. I show that when the size of
   the female delegation grows, women increase both the breadth and depth
   of their collective legislative agenda-simultaneously offering increased
   substantive representation and representation across a wider range of
   topics.},

Abstract = {How and when issues are elevated onto the political agenda is a
   perennial question in the study of public policy. This article considers
   how moral panics contribute to punctuated equilibrium in public policy
   by drawing together broader societal anxieties or fears and thereby
   precipitating or accelerating changes in the dominant set of issue
   frames. In so doing they create opportunities for policy entrepreneurs
   to disrupt the existing policy consensus. In a test of this theory, we
   assess the factors behind the rise of crime on the policy agenda in
   Britain between 1960 and 2010. We adopt an integrative mixed-methods
   approach, drawing upon a combination of qualitative and quantitative
   data. This enables us to analyze the rise of crime as a policy problem,
   the breakdown of the political-institutional consensus on crime, the
   moral panic that followed the murder of the toddler James Bulger in
   1993, the emergence of new issue frames around crime and social/moral
   decay more broadly, and how-in combination-these contributed to an
   escalation of political rhetoric and action on crime, led by policy
   entrepreneurs in the Labour and Conservative parties.},

Title = {Sino-Russian cooperation against liberal hegemony},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {809-833},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sino-Russian security and economic cooperation has broadened and
   deepened in nonlinear but progressive fashion since the late 1990s.
   Contra realism, it is not simply American material power that drives
   this increasing cooperation; US power has at best remained constant.
   Instead, two conditions combine to deepen Sino-Russian cooperation.
   First, enduring liberal hegemony, or a combination of material power,
   prestige, and the ability to set and enforce rules, makes America
   threatening, under broad conditions, to any authoritarian regime's
   domestic power and foreign influence. Hegemony is an interaction of
   material power and ideas; each augments the other. Second is the steady
   20-year movement of Russia's regime under Vladimir Putin away from
   liberal democracy. These two conditions make cooperation on either side
   of the liberal-nonliberal ideological divide increasingly easier than
   cooperation across it. Several types of qualitative evidence support
   these claims, including: (1) private and public statements from both
   Beijing and Moscow on the liberal-democratic threat; (2) specific
   deepening of bilateral cooperation after the Ukrainian revolution of
   2014; (3) efforts by Moscow and Beijing to counter liberal hegemony's
   spread in their regions; (4) the tendency for anti-liberal elites in
   neighboring states to cooperate more with China or Russia. I address
   realist counter-arguments skeptical of any systematic causal role for
   ideology. Insofar as America tires of its role as liberal hegemon, or
   the ``China Model{''} becomes so prestigious as to threaten the Putin
   regime, the impetus to Sino-Russian cooperation identified here will
   fade.},

Abstract = {While many studies provide insights into the causes of wartime civilian
   victimization, we know little about how the targeting of particular
   segments of the civilian population affects the onset and escalation of
   armed conflict. Previous research on conflict onset has been largely
   limited to structural variables, both theoretically and empirically.
   Moving beyond these static approaches, this article assesses how the
   state-led targeting of specific ethnic groups affects the likelihood of
   ethnic conflict onset and the evolution of conflicts once they break
   out. Relying on a new data set with global coverage that captures the
   ethnic identity of civilian victims of targeted violence, we find
   evidence that the state-led civilian victimization of particular ethnic
   groups increases the likelihood that the latter become involved in
   ethnic civil war. We also find tentative, yet more nuanced, evidence
   that ethnic targeting by state forces affects the escalation of ongoing
   conflicts.},

Abstract = {In July 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that
   new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) fall within the scope of the
   restrictive provisions on genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
   Previously, various actors had lobbied in order to influence the
   European Union's (EU's) regulatory decision on NPBTs. This study
   examines the venue choices taken by Cibus, a biotech company that
   promoted NPBT deregulation. It shows that the firm bypassed the EU level
   and that it lobbied competent authorities (CAs) in certain member states
   to gain support for the deregulation of NPBTs. Cibus chose the CAs
   because their institutional ``closedness{''} reduced the risk of the
   debate over the deregulation of NPBTs becoming public. However, the CA's
   specific competences and their influence on EU decision making were of
   likewise importance. The firm lobbied CAs based in Finland, Germany,
   Ireland, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Two factors appear to
   have influenced Cibus' choices for these countries: high-level political
   support for agribiotech and the high relevance of biotech sectors. In
   contrast, public support for GMOs turned out to have hardly any
   influence, and virtually no association could be observed for the
   agricultural application of biotechnology in the past nor for the
   weakness of domestic anti-GMO lobby groups. Finally, the in-depth study
   on Germany affirms that ``closedness{''} was important for Cibus'
   choices and reveals that technical information served as a
   venue-internal factor that influenced the firm's choices.},

Abstract = {The launch of the `Energy Union' in 2014, represented a major step to
   deepen EU cooperation in energy and climate policies. Yet, in energy,
   member states have remained particularly jealous of their sovereignty,
   limiting the pace and scope of integration. EU energy policy appears to
   fit the specifications of `new intergovernmentalism' (NI). Member states
   have been keen on reinforcing cooperation but have refrained from
   delegating further authority to supranational institutions, preferring
   to maintain a high level of control within the Council and European
   Council. However, focusing on the Energy Union Governance Regulation
   adopted in 2018, we argue that the sector does not fit neatly within
   this NI account. Although governments remain central to the process,
   they operate within a hybrid institutional framework combining
   supranational and intergovernmental elements, in which formal and
   informal authority distribution is unstable and contested. We suggest
   this form of governance is better described as `embedded
   intergovernmentalism'.},

Abstract = {This paper applies the concept of ``communities of practice{''} to
   al-Muhajiroun ({''}the Emigrants{''}), an outlawed activist network that
   seeks to create an Islamic caliphate in Britain and the West through
   activism and proselytizing. Responding to recent studies on terrorism
   learning and adaptation, the author argues that focusing exclusively on
   the outputs of learning is unsatisfactory. Instead scholars should
   analyze learning as a process and unpack the causal mechanisms behind
   it. To support his within-case analysis, the author draws on extensive
   field work, including interviews and ethnographic observation. Newcomers
   to al-Muhajiroun learn the community's norms and practices through
   repeated interactions with more experienced activists. These
   interactions take place in study circles and through companionship.
   Activists also learn by doing, preaching the Emigrants' Salafi-Islamist
   ideology at da'wah stalls and protesting against the West's ``war on
   Islam{''} at demonstrations. The more they do, the better they become at
   performing the network's high-risk activism, and the more deeply
   committed they become to its community of practice. However, far from
   allowing activists to adapt seamlessly to all challenges, the Emigrants'
   insular and dogmatic community of practice creates its own problems,
   hindering its ability to innovate, expand, and thrive in an increasingly
   hostile environment.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to demonstrate the potentiality of electoral
   politics and suggests that an ethnographic exploration of the ways in
   which different caste groups engage with elections is useful for
   understanding the violent and manipulative side of electoral processes
   in rural western Uttar Pradesh. Drawing on extensive ethnographic
   fieldwork in village, this article shows the role of alcohol, money and
   manipulative strategies in local elections. Elections are also closely
   linked with regional and wider politics. Regional and local histories of
   caste and factional conflict and intra-and inter-party competition are
   both causes and effects of electoral violence and manipulations.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-99},

Abstract = {This article examines the logic of civilian targeting in the
   Turkish-Kurdish civil war. It analyzes two instances of PKK violence:
   against pro-state Village Guards' families in the 1980s and
   school-teachers in the 1990s. Against original data, we evaluate the
   extent to which the dominant conceptual tools available in civil war
   literature help us make sense of these instances and argue that there is
   a need to go beyond the established selective/indiscriminate distinction
   if we want to capture the logic of PKK's targeting. Consequently, we
   build on and specify further recent conceptual developments in the field
   and show that both cases are better understood as instances of
   collective targeting. We further show, however, that the collective
   nature of each differs in relevant ways: while the killing of the
   families of Village Guards constitutes an instance of collective
   targeting in the sense of ``extended group association,{''} in the case
   of school teachers there are indications of a secondary spatially
   differentiated selection criteria accompanying the collective logic. Our
   analysis emphasizes the field's need for stronger conceptual foundations
   underpinning our theories of violence against civilians, as well as the
   limitations of understandings rooted in an ``ontological
   individualism{''} when applied without careful consideration to
   non-Western societies.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the media representation of political leaders in
   Croatia, the newest Member State of the European Union, with an aim to
   capture the ways in which political leaders have been portrayed in the
   media in periods characterised with varying degrees of illiberalism. A
   longitudinal content analysis of three daily newspapers from 1990 to
   2018 reveals that in spite of the fact that media freedom decreased in
   the last decade, and the society became more authoritarian, there is
   little evidence to suggest that the press is increasingly demonstrating
   illiberal tendencies in the era of illiberal drift.},

Abstract = {This essay will consider the impact of anarchist ideology on the design
   and reception of sculptor Jacob Epstein's famous Tomb of Oscar Wilde,
   which became the center of a public scandal when it was censored by the
   French state following its installation at Pere Lachaise cemetery in
   September 1912. Having charted the influence of the anarchists Emma
   Goldman's and Piotr Kropotkin's views on Oscar Wilde and sexual
   liberation on both the youthful Epstein and Wilde's executor and former
   lover Robert Ross, I will then analyze Ross' and Epstein's collaboration
   in designing the Tomb following its commissioning in December 1908, and
   their successful attempt to rally support among the anarchist community
   in Paris and London when the monument was officially censored in 1912.
   The latter campaign was led by a group of anarchist individualists, who
   drew on the thought of Max Stirner and Henri Bergson to associate
   Wilde's aestheticism and Epstein's `orientalist' design and virile
   iconography for the Tomb with a -celebration of sexual difference
   grounded in Stirner's notion of `egoism' and Bergson's concept of
   `intuition' and joie de vivre. By reconsidering the Tomb of Oscar Wilde
   in light of Wilde's own anarchist allegiances and the confluence of
   anarchist networks from New York City, to Paris to London, I will
   underscore the cosmopolitan nature of the anarchist movement and its
   pioneering role in the defense of homosexuality in the early twentieth
   century.},

Pages = {17-39},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to address three important but under-researched
   questions in the trust and negotiation literature: What do negotiators
   do to determine the trustworthiness of a potential business partner?
   What trust criteria motivate their search and help them interpret the
   information their search reveals? Whether there are systematic cultural
   differences in search and criteria, and if different, why?
   Design/methodology/approach This study used qualitative methodology. The
   data are from interviews with 82 managers from 33 different national
   cultures in four regions of the world identified by cultural levels of
   trust in negotiation and tightness-looseness. Interviews focused on how
   negotiators determined the trustworthiness of potential business
   partners in intracultural negotiations. Findings Analyses revealed four
   search activities negotiators use to gather information about a
   potential business partner: due diligence, brokerage, good will building
   and testing; and five criteria for determining the trustworthiness of a
   new business partner: respect, mutual values, competence, openness and
   professionalism. Quotes illustrate how these search activities and
   criteria manifest in different cultures.
   Originality/value This study provides an in-depth understanding of
   cultural similarities and differences in the process of trust
   development in negotiating new business relationships.},

Abstract = {How important is the enforcement of political rights in new democracies?
   The authors use the enfranchisement of the emancipated slaves following
   the American Civil War to study this question. Critical to their
   strategy, black suffrage was externally enforced by the United States
   Army in ten Southern states during Reconstruction. The authors employ a
   triple-difference model to estimate the joint effect of enfranchisement
   and its enforcement on taxation. They find that counties with greater
   black-population shares that were occupied by the military levied higher
   taxes compared to similar nonoccupied counties. These counties later
   experienced a comparatively greater decline in taxation after the troops
   were withdrawn. The authors also demonstrate that in occupied counties,
   black politicians were more likely to be elected and political murders
   by white supremacist groups occurred less frequently. The findings
   provide evidence on the key role of federal troops in limiting elite
   capture by force during this period.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the evolution of the staff composition of the
   European Commission from 1980 to 2013 using the theory of representative
   bureaucracy. The article first demonstrates how the Commission
   formulates guidelines which aim at offering fair levels of
   representation to each member state. However, comparing recruitment
   targets and actual staffing figures reveals very heterogeneous staff
   levels. Some member states enjoy unexpectedly high levels of
   representation whereas others present very low levels. The latter are
   particularly intriguing and open the door to the formulation of a
   ``rejection hypothesis.{''}This hypothesis challenges one of the
   foundations of the theory of representative bureaucracy and leads us to
   suggest that the theory be enhanced in order to take into account its
   context of implementation in terms of consolidated or contested
   statehood, which in turn may explain the phenomena of rejected offers of
   bureaucratic representation.},

Title = {Public-Private Partnership for achieving sustainable development goals:
   a case study of Khulna, Bangladesh},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {283-298},
Abstract = {Purpose - Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is a common practice in both
   the public and private sectors. PPP has been an important instrument to
   achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level.
   However, the role of PPP at the subnational level is often scarcely
   studied. Using Khulna city of Bangladesh as a case, this paper aims to
   assess the role of PPP projects in the attainment of SDGs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in the Central
   Business District (CBD) of Khulna, on a total of 4.6 kilometers
   stretches of road medians in the CBD where landscaping was done through
   the PPP approach. Besides the collection of secondary data from official
   records, primary data were collected through site visits, field surveys
   and interviews of PPP project partners.
   Findings - The result shows that 89 percent of the respondents (road
   users) were pleased with the landscaping done on the road medians.
   Similarly, about 86 percent of the respondents felt more comfortable and
   safer to use the roads. Well-maintained road medians allow road-crossing
   at a regular interval which reduces the chance of an accident. The
   private parties have installed promotional billboards on the road
   medians and saved BDT 10.82 million a year. The public authority saves
   the maintenance budget amounting to BDT 23 million a year. The project
   achieves a triple-win situation. Despite some limitations, this PPP
   project has taken Khulna a step forward to achieve SDGs.
   Originality/value - The findings have policy implications as the PPP
   project has enhanced the resilience of Khulna by addressing the relevant
   SDGs.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the century, the consensus among scholars was that the
   International Monetary Fund's (IMF) policy preferences, which centered
   on deflation via austerity, privatization, and deregulation, were
   indicative of its neoliberal bias. However, a subsequent wave of
   literature has challenged this view by suggesting that the IMF has
   demonstrated flexibility. While these accounts arrive at their
   conclusion via different analytical and empirical focuses, this article
   posits that the flexibility or breath of ideas found within the
   discourse itself is key to gauging policy biases (previous study).
   Herein, this article contributes to the question of whether the IMF can
   be considered a ``flexible{''} institution via its analysis on Argentina
   (1989-2006; 2016-2017). Extending a previous study's methods, this one
   provides a ``discursive content analysis,{''} on the IMF-Argentine
   Article IV consultations. Ultimately, the findings show that policy
   discourse remained neoliberal throughout.},

Abstract = {Policy design is a type of policy formulation activity centred on
   knowledge application in the creation of policy alternatives. Expected
   to attain public sector goals and government ambitions in an effective
   fashion, it can be undertaken many different ways. The current
   literature on policy design features an ongoing debate between adherents
   of traditional approaches to the subject in the policy sciences and
   those importing into policymaking the insights of design practices in
   other fields such as industrial engineering and product development:
   `design-thinking'. Issues examined in more traditional approaches to
   policy design are very wide-ranging and address a wide variety of
   formulation modalities and their strengths and weaknesses. Efforts to
   promote `design-thinking' in the public policy realm, on the other hand,
   focus on policy innovation and rarely deal with issues such as the
   barriers to implementation, political feasibility or the constraints
   under which decision-making takes place. This article discusses these
   differences and argues adherents of design-thinking need to expand their
   reach and consider not only the circumstances facilitating the
   generation of novel ideas but also the lessons of more traditional
   approaches concerning the political and other challenges faced in policy
   formulation and implementation.},

Abstract = {The EU strives to harmonize banking regulation, while its member states
   continue to insist on a degree of differentiation to accommodate
   national specifics. A new data set of national options and discretions
   (O\&Ds) embedded in EU banking legislation facilitates systematic
   analysis of member states' policy preferences across multiple policy
   cycles. Its results suggest that states' O\&D choices are related to
   their respective variety of banking capitalism. Coordinated and liberal
   market economies choose O\&Ds to protect distinct subsets of regulatory
   parameters delaying full harmonization. Dependent market economies on
   the Eastern periphery use O\&Ds to prevent the outflow of capital from
   foreign-owned subsidiaries under their jurisdiction. These deep
   institutional roots suggest that many O\&Ds will be carried over to the
   upcoming generation of EU banking legislation, despite the increased
   harmonization pressures in the banking union.},

Abstract = {Cooperation across maritime boundaries have increasingly come into focus
   as Arctic states attempt to tackle a growing gap between aspirations and
   capabilities in their respective northern waters. Multilateral
   cooperation has been touted as a tool to manage an increasingly
   challenging situation in northern waters. As the most blatant example of
   this, an Arctic Coast Guard Forum was officially established in 2015
   after years of deliberation on its potential role. This chapter
   explicitly examines the notion of pan-Arctic cooperation on coast guard
   issues, discussing its potential and limitations. Finally, it relates
   these trends to general literature on international cooperation and its
   relevance for understanding contemporary cooperation at sea between
   states.},

   Challenges for World Order},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-489},
Abstract = {A principal theme of international relations scholarship following the
   Cold War was the apparent erosion of state sovereignty caused by
   globalization's integrative effects and the proliferation of
   international institutions and networks. In recent years, however,
   scholars have noted a reverse trend: the reassertion of traditional, or
   Westphalian, state sovereignty. By contrast, I highlight another recent
   trend that has gone largely overlooked: the reaffirmation of older
   ``extralegal{''} and ``organic{''} versions of sovereignty by three of
   the world's most powerful states-Russia, China, and the United States.
   After tracing the genealogy of these older concepts, I consider how and
   why they have gained prominence in the official discourse of all three
   countries. I also explore the implications of this shift, which not only
   illustrates the importance of ``norm retrieval{''} in international
   affairs, but also raises questions about the foundations of
   international order. Contrary to Westphalian sovereignty, which
   emphasizes the legal equality of states and the principle of
   noninterference in domestic affairs, the extralegal and organic versions
   offer few constraints on state action. If anything, they appear to
   license powerful states to dominate others.},

Abstract = {Abraham Judah Heyn (1880-1957) was an orthodox rabbi of prestigious
   hasidic (habad) lineage, who served several communities throughout
   Europe and Palestine/Israel. Responding to the intensification of
   antisemitic brutality in Eastern Europe around the turn of the twentieth
   century, he promoted a hermeneutic of resistance, interpreting Jewish
   tradition as the foil of the state and of state-sanctioned violence -
   indeed, all violence. In this essay, three central themes developed in
   his writings - hitherto almost entirely neglected - are examined in
   detail. One, the notion that the essence of Judaism consists in a
   conviction as to the absolute sanctity of human life. Two, the
   implications this has for an anarcho-pacifist vision for human society
   reminiscent of Tolstoy's but articulated in a distinctively Jewish
   manner. Three, the nature of a true and morally sound revolution as
   determined by the essence of Judaism and the sort of community that,
   according to Heyn, it is designed to promote. More broadly, this essay
   aims to intervene in contemporary theo-politics by recovering for
   (orthodox) Jewish tradition an anti-authoritarian, anti-militarist, and
   universalist ethos, and by inserting Judaism and Jewish thought - in
   distinction from Jewish people - into the revolutionary tradition that
   has largely ignored them.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes technocracy as a distinct rationality and shows how
   this rationality continues to inform the adoption and restructuring of
   new governance arrangements within the public sector. The recalibration
   of governance arrangements according to a technocratic rationality
   offers a way for governments to retain control amidst increasing
   decentralization and local self-governance. This is empirically
   illustrated through an analysis of recent changes in the governance of
   the Danish employment services. The analysis shows how recent changes in
   economic incentives, procedural regulations, and the performance
   monitoring of municipal job centers - officially adopted to increase
   local self-governance and autonomy - have been reshaped to accommodate
   the Ministry of Employment's strategy of evidence-based policymaking.
   The article argues that this technocratic reshaping of governance
   arrangements increases central government control, while - at the same
   time - running the risk of ignoring the democratic aspects of public
   sector governance.},

Abstract = {I argue environmental disasters are an inevitable outcome of the
   underdevelopment of Western philosophy. Human induced environmental
   disasters are unfortunate, an unintended consequence of focusing on
   economic maximization in a culture without comprehensive, clearly
   accepted, and operationalized frameworks for environmental and
   intergenerational justice. However, they are of no surprise to
   Indigenous Peoples relegated to margins of political influence.
   Grounding this claim, I examine the New Zealand High Court case
   Greenpeace and Te Whanau-a-Apanui vs the Minister for Energy. Case
   documents afford comparisons between the complex philosophic, legal, and
   cultural framework of Maori, that protect human and nonhuman from
   human-induced environmental disaster, and the dominant Anglo framings. I
   observe a philosophical deficit underpinning the legal and political
   system of Aotearoa that impedes environmental intergenerational justice.
   These philosophic foundations, intentionally or not, promote
   environmental disaster and - nationally and internationally - claim a
   dominant position over Indigenous systems.},

Abstract = {A wealth of literature argues that domestic institutions can sometimes
   restrain government repression. In this article, we highlight an
   institution tasked specifically with protecting and promoting human
   rights: the National Human Rights Institution (NHRI). Although common
   international standards exist, NHRIs exhibit substantial variation in
   their organization, the rights that they protect, the activities they
   permit, and the manner in which they appoint their members. Scholarship
   to date has conceptualized and measured NHRIs dichotomously; an NHRI
   either exists or it does not. We present data that highlights NHRI
   heterogeneity collected via content analysis of NHRI annual reports,
   NHRI websites, national constitutions, government legislation, and other
   sources. Using these data, we show NHRIs that can publish their findings
   and NHRIs that can punish offenders are each associated with less state
   torture. These data will allow future researchers to better explore
   important questions regarding NHRI origins, design, processes, and
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The following paper consists of interviews with former members of
   Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab), recruited in Kenya
   between 2008 and 2017. Their stories shed light on al-Shabaab's
   compartmentalized network of recruiters in Kenya. These individuals are
   tasked with recruiting disadvantaged youth from Kenya, in order to
   supply al-Shabaab's camps in Somalia with a steady stream of expendable
   soldiers. The similarities between interviews emphasizes al-Shabaab's
   role as human traffickers, highlights the under researched connection
   between al-Shabaab and the illicit drug trade, and reiterates the fact
   that government corruption is a significant hinderance to future
   counter-terrorism efforts.},

Abstract = {Analysing Arab public opinion on the international community's response
   to the Syrian crisis, we expand existing scholarship by injecting a
   non-Western perspective into the oftentimes Western-centric debates on
   intervention. We demonstrate that publics in two prominent Arab Spring
   countries were quite willing to embrace intervention in Syria in order
   to depose Bashar al-Assad. More specifically, our analysis reveals that
   both interests and values shape support for different types of
   international intervention in Syria. In the context of the distinction
   between policy-driven and culture-driven anti-Americanisms, we show that
   Egyptian and Tunisian evaluations of US foreign policy behaviour and, to
   lesser extent, US culture correlate with support for Western-led
   intervention in Syria.},

Abstract = {Deliberative systems theorists have for some time emphasised the
   distributed nature of deliberative values; they therefore do not focus
   exclusively on `deliberation' but on all sorts of communication that
   advance deliberative democratic values, including everyday political
   talk in informal settings. However, such talk has been impossible to
   capture inductively at scale. This article discusses an electronic
   approach, Structural Topic Modelling, and applies it to a recent case:
   the Scottish independence debate of 2012-2014. The case provides the
   first empirical test of the claim that a deliberative system can capture
   the full `pool of perspectives' on an issue, and shows that citizens can
   hold each other to deliberative standards even in mass, online
   discussion. It also shows that, in deliberative terms, the major
   cleavage in the `indyref' debate was not so much between Yes and No, but
   between formal and informal venues.},

Abstract = {Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been a surfeit of commentary
   arguing that 2020 will have transformative effects on world politics.
   This paper asks whether, decades from now, the pandemic will be viewed
   as an inflection point. Critical junctures occur when an event triggers
   a discontinuous shift in key variables or forces a rapid acceleration of
   preexisting trends. Pandemics have undeniably had this effect in the far
   past. A welter of economic and medical developments, however, have
   strongly muted the geopolitical impact of pandemics in recent centuries.
   A review of how the novel coronavirus has affected the distribution of
   power and interest in its first six months suggests that COVID-19 will
   not have transformative effects on world politics. Absent a profound ex
   post shift in hegemonic ideas, 2020 is unlikely to be an inflection
   point.},

   Lessons from Israel},

Abstract = {This article seeks to enhance the understanding of ontological
   counter-securitization and the constitution of securitized subjects in
   the context of asymmetrical power relations. It builds on the available
   critique of the conceptualization of counter-securitization and the
   differentiation between physical and ontological securitization in order
   to facilitate a better understanding of the identity formation of
   securitized subjects as resistance. It argues that whereas the current
   literature deals with the differentiation between physical and
   ontological dimensions of securitization and recently with the meaning
   of counter-securitization, nonetheless the treatment of the later as a
   resistance is limited. It remains in the realm of the physical
   dimensions of securitization, rendering ontological ones unaddressed.
   The article argues that ontological counter-securitization emerges as an
   analytical category when the mismatch between the physical and
   ontological securitization policies is utilized as a structural
   opportunity for resisting asymmetrical power relations. The article
   exemplifies its theoretical arguments through exploring the complicated
   securitization policies of Israel toward its Palestinian citizens and
   the resistance of the latter to such policies. It argues that despite
   the fact that the Israeli physical and ontological securitization of its
   Palestinian citizens have not matched, they have been constructed as
   complementary and therefore have not been morally justifiable. This lack
   of moral justifiability has had repercussions on the legitimacy of the
   securitization policy, leading to the rise of the securitized subject as
   a securitizing agency that is able to practice counter-securitization.
   Since the power relations between the state and its Palestinian citizens
   has been asymmetrical, the latter limited their counter-securitization
   to the ontological dimension, manifested through politicizing their
   indigenous identity. The conceptualization of politicizing indigeneity
   as an ontological counter-securitization strategy of resistance has not
   been addressed in the available literature on securitization theory.
   Thus, exploring its analytical merits is a central goal of this article.},

Abstract = {The English school of international relations is in large parts focused
   on the study of historical change; at the same time, however, it is
   remarkably unclear on how to understand change in between the idealist
   belief in progress and the realist eternal cycles of recurrence. This
   article seeks to avoid this dead end by questioning the school's
   understanding of change as a commonsensical concept. It is argued that
   change would be better understood as composed of three facets: one
   ontological (what is change?), one explanatory (what causes change?),
   and one normative (is change desirable?). This metatheoretical
   reconceptualization of change permits cross-checking the three facets
   against each other for internal coherence, but most importantly, it
   makes visible the underlying assumptions used to study change, so that
   ideas of history, causes, and normative ideals can be openly
   scrutinized, questioned, and defended rather than treated as
   self-evident. The resulting suggestion of an internally
   metatheoretically coherent understanding of change in international
   society signifies a muchneeded addition to the English school tool-kit.
   It brings a promise of a significant metatheoretical overhaul of the
   theory, which, if taken up, will open up new horizons for the school. In
   addition, it opens up similar metatheoretical inquiries into other
   international relations theories' views of change.},

Abstract = {The idea that sustainability requires changing individuals' routines and
   choices has for decades been regarded as tantamount to the
   depoliticization of environmentalism. But the 21(st) century has seen a
   shift toward considering `everyday material practices' as driving a new
   wave in environmental politics. Claims about the radical potential of
   material practices have led some scholars down new theoretical paths and
   reaffirmed old critiques for others. Viewing this development through an
   ecofeminist lens uncovers problematic oversights. Starting from the
   position that ecofeminist theory has never not been grounded in
   materiality, I offer two arguments. First, it is wrong to accept claims
   of newness in an `everyday turn' that ignore the past and overlook their
   specificity. Second, if this turn represents a new scholarly agenda,
   then old ecofeminist insights about the politics of everyday living
   should be incorporated. Both my arguments call for reflection on the
   politics of publishing in environmental politics.},

Abstract = {This project examined conspiracy theory use across three types of
   groups: radical violent extremists (RVE), nonviolent extremists, and
   moderates. Using the theory of significance quest, or the desire for
   one's life to have meaning, the current project determined whether RVE
   groups were more likely to use conspiracy theories and promote loss of
   significance in violent passages than the other groups. Using text
   analysis software, researchers coded passages from six groups-two from
   each level of extremism-for conspiratorial and/or violent content. RVE
   groups were significantly more likely than the other groups to use
   conspiracy theories and promote violence. This pattern held for groups
   focused on radical Islamic fundamentalism as well as white supremacy
   groups. The pattern was more complex for loss of significance: in
   violent passages, Neo-Nazis were significantly more likely than ISIS and
   Al-Qaida to promote loss of significance. Implications of the findings
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper probes the attempt to use power analysis to link three
   domains: ontology, explanation, and the strategy of political actors. It
   shows how Katzenstein and Seybert develop an open social ontology that
   serves as the backdrop for explanations that need to be causal but
   indeterminate, and a cautious political practice. It exposes tensions in
   two important links. First, the open ontology becomes retranslated as an
   explanatory cause. Second, the call for being cautious because of
   `unknown unknowns' may just as well invite strategies of doubling down
   in control power.},

Abstract = {The concept of ``advocacy coalitions{''} is the bedrock of the Advocacy
   Coalition Framework (ACF), one of the most established and successful
   approaches for understanding policy processes across the globe. This
   article revisits and sharpens the conceptual definition of advocacy
   coalitions. We summarize the lessons from its theoretical emphases under
   the ACF and specify its five attributes (policy actors, shared beliefs,
   coordination, resources, and stability). Through this specification, we
   identify the ideal coalition type and several coalition subtypes. We
   then clarify and make a distinction between how we think about
   coalitions as a concept and how we approach coalitions empirically. This
   article sharpens the lens for describing and explaining coalitions
   toward better observations, theorizing, and measurements. It ends with
   next steps for further deepening and broadening knowledge about advocacy
   coalitions.},

Abstract = {The call for citizen participation is a prominent theme in academic,
   public, and political discussions. Taking the S Village transformation
   project in Guangzhou City as a case study, this article examines how
   urban planners, as experts, contributed to improving citizen
   participation in local community planning. The planners constructed
   forums for expert-citizen interaction in which they provided residents
   with professional knowledge, performed multiple roles as both experts
   and communicators, and promoted capacity building; citizens were largely
   mobilized to perform active participation in this transformation
   project. The findings show that planners reframed the transformation
   plan based on villagers' community identity towards the village history,
   which played an important role in reaching a mutual agreement regarding
   community development. The article echoes the argument that such
   professional groups have, as planners, emerged as mediators linking the
   government and citizens in Chinese community governance and discovers
   their role as an engine for promoting villagers' innovation and
   self-development capacity. However, the study reveals that experts' role
   in supporting citizens' participation is restricted due to such factors
   as a lack of institutional support and high operating costs. More
   research needs to be done to explore how experts could better facilitate
   civic participation in different contexts.},

Abstract = {Land reform in South Africa aims, among other things, to build `the
   economy by generating large-scale employment, increasing rural incomes
   and eliminating overcrowding' (ANC 1994). While there is `near-consensus
   that land reform has been unsuccessful' (Aliber and Cousins 2013),
   various factors have been raised as contributing to land reform's
   failure to meet its goals. Among the factors negatively affecting
   livelihoods and income generation is the government's enforcement of an
   agribusiness model promoting large-scale production for (export)
   markets. This article uses a case study to illustrate how the
   implementation of large-scale, and sometimes capital-intensive,
   production negatively affects the livelihoods of the beneficiaries. It
   challenges the perspectives that associate success, or even the
   viability, of land reform projects with the agribusiness model by
   demonstrating how difficult it is for the beneficiaries to sustain
   production autonomously.},

Abstract = {How does the presence of multiple combatants affect rebel groups'
   ideological and demand positioning? Although violent forms of
   inter-group conflict have been widely studied in the civil war
   literature, rebel groups' strategic use of ideology and demands has
   received scarce scholarly attention. We argue that the pressure of
   competition forces rebel groups to differentiate themselves
   ideologically and demand-wise from their rivals to maximize their
   chances of survival and success. Rebel groups strive to set themselves
   apart by offering unique products to their supporters and recruits.
   Thus, we contend that rebel groups are more likely to modify their
   ideologies and demands from the government in the face of competition
   from rival groups. We test this theory using novel data collected from
   rebel group manifestos and public statements. Our findings suggest that
   groups are more likely to shift their ideology and modify their demands
   as the number of rival groups increases.},

Abstract = {Addressing sources and drivers of precarity among marginalized migrant
   populations in urban spaces is central to making cities inclusive, safe,
   resilient and sustainable for all. Yet dominant policy discourses
   continue to frame migrants as problematic causes of insecurity and tend
   to exclude them from policy processes. Deliberative democratic theory
   suggests that inclusive processes have the potential to create
   innovative solutions for resilient cities. This study elicits and
   reports on self-identified sources of precarity and insecurity as
   experienced by new low-income migrant populations. It combines visual
   ethnography and deliberative democracy tools in an action research
   process that facilitated dialogue between migrant populations, urban
   planners and policy stakeholders. The objective is to elicit policy
   opportunities and constraints for changing dominant discourses, with a
   view to enhance marginalized lives and to implement sustainable urban
   infrastructure in Chattogram, the second largest city of Bangladesh. The
   results show options for addressing precarity, developed through
   facilitating migrants and planners to engage with each other's
   perspectives. Priorities include focusing on insecure tenure, exposure
   to environmental hazards, and representation in planning processes.
   Integrating the perspectives and lived experiences of migrant urban
   populations into policy processes potentially leads to more effective,
   sustainable and legitimate solutions.},

Abstract = {Although fundamentalist Sunni Muslims have committed more than 85\% of
   all suicide attacks, empirical research has yet to examine how internal
   sectarian conflicts in the Islamic world have fueled the most dangerous
   form of political violence. We contend that fundamentalist Sunni Muslims
   employ suicide attacks as a political tool in sectarian violence and
   this targeting dynamic marks a central facet of the phenomenon today. We
   conduct a large-nanalysis, evaluating an original dataset of 6,224
   suicide attacks during the period of 1980 through 2016. A series of
   logistic regression analyses at the incidence level shows that,ceteris
   paribus, sectarian violence between Sunni Muslims and non-Sunni Muslims
   emerges as a substantive, significant, and positive predictor of suicide
   attacks. Indeed, the context of sectarian conflict predicts the use of
   suicide attacks to a much greater degree than the contexts of militant
   outbidding or foreign occupation. We also present five case examples,
   illustrating the use of suicide attacks in sectarian conflicts in
   Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Our overall results
   indicate that only a reduction in sectarian violence, and especially
   conflicts involving fundamentalist Sunni Muslims, can prevent the
   continuing spread of the suicide-attack phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Voting is key to political integration of immigrant-background
   minorities, but what determines their voting preferences remains
   unclear. Moreover, dual-citizen minorities can vote differently in their
   country of residence and origin. Using a representative survey of
   Turkish-Muslim minorities in two cities in Belgium (N = 447,M\_age =
   36.3), we asked whether left-right ideology or religious identity
   predicted their voting in their country of residence and origin, besides
   typical predictors of right-wing voting (i.e., efficacy, deprivation,
   and authoritarianism). Authoritarianism, low political efficacy, and
   high deprivation predicted voting for right-wing parties in Turkey,
   whereas the latter two, surprisingly, predicted voting for the left in
   Belgium. Latent class analyses of their religious practices
   distinguished ``moderate{''} versus ``strict{''} Muslims. While
   ``strict{''} Muslims voted for right-wing parties in Turkey, ideology
   did not predict their voting. Conversely, in Belgium, while Muslim
   identity did not predict their voting, ideology did. Analyzing their
   combined effects, ``moderate{''} Muslims voted based on their
   ideology-right-leaning voting for the right, whereas ``strict{''}
   Muslims voted according to their interests as a disadvantaged minority
   in Belgium-thus voting for the left-or as a devout Muslim in Turkey-thus
   voting for the right. Our results elucidate processes underlying the
   voting behaviors of European-Muslim minorities.},

Abstract = {The centralization process in Hungary affects the local governments too.
   From 2010, they face weakening of their competencies and taking away of
   their task and with it, restrictions of their rights in some aspects.
   This paper aims to explore one aspect of the restriction, the changing
   of ownership of their task-bound assets with legislative means. To show
   the process, two cases of such restriction will be examined, both
   affecting the capital of Hungary, Budapest and both being symbolic
   project for the Government and the municipalities too.},

Abstract = {The state often struggles to meet citizens' demands but confronts strong
   public pressure to do so. What does the state do when public
   expectations exceed its actual governing capacity? This article shows
   that the state can respond by engaging in performative governance-the
   theatrical deployment of language, symbols, and gestures to foster an
   impression of good governance among citizens. Performative governance
   should be distinguished from other types of state behavior, such as
   inertia, paternalism, and the substantive satisfaction of citizens'
   demands. The author illustrates this concept in the realm of
   environmental governance in China. Given the severity of China's
   environmental pollution, the resulting public outcry, and the logistical
   and political challenges involved in solving the problem, how can the
   state redeem itself? Ethnographic evidence from participant observation
   at a municipal environmental protection bureau reveals that when
   bureaucrats are confronted with the dual burdens of low state capacity
   and high public scrutiny, they engage in performative governance to
   assuage citizens' complaints. This study draws attention to the double
   meaning of ``performance{''} in political contexts, and the essential
   distinction between the substantive and the theatrical.},

Abstract = {The harmful and inequitable implications of men's actions have always
   been a central focus of the United Nation's Women, Peace and Security
   agenda. Despite this, until recently, there have been few programmes in
   the agenda which attempt to directly work with men. The past five years
   have seen a rapid growth of programming that explicitly targets men and
   even calls for a `Men, Peace and Security' agenda. This article analyses
   how these programmes understand their work. Drawing on expert interviews
   and documentary analysis it argues that current programming reflects two
   fundamentally different approaches, engaging or changing men. While
   these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, they reflect
   different understandings of what and `Men, Peace and Security' agenda
   should prioritise. In exploring the tension between these two approaches
   the article concludes that without greater coherence and clarity the MPS
   agenda risks being ineffective or even producing harmful outcomes.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the advanced political economies, this article critically
   reviews the recent scholarship on the evolution of top incomes over the
   past few decades. The existing literature shows that the determination
   of top incomes is complex, multifaceted and bound up with factors
   associated with both politics and economics. Technological change and
   globalization are vital sources of change in contemporary capitalism,
   but the continued diversity in top income shares across the advanced
   capitalist world suggests that these forces alone cannot account for the
   empirical patterns. Instead, there is compelling evidence that power and
   politics, including government policy, trade union and left party
   strength, institutions and financialization, all play a pivotal role in
   regulating distributive outcomes. It is argued that future research will
   require a plurality of methodological approaches in order to clarify the
   complex causal process that drives top-end income concentration.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {918-944},

Abstract = {How will American relative decline impact security cooperation between
   Russia and China? The conventional wisdom holds that the Sino-Russian
   ``strategic partnership{''} is largely a ``marriage of convenience{''}
   held together only by shared antipathy toward the US-led international
   order. From a traditional balance of power perspective, given their lack
   of a shared vision for global and regional order, we should expect
   Sino-Russian cooperation to deteriorate as US relative power recedes. I
   suggest, to the contrary, that Sino-Russian cooperation could remain
   quite durable throughout a prolonged period of American decline and
   retrenchment. I apply theories of bureaucratic and legislative
   ``logrolling{''} to demonstrate how China and Russia each have
   incentives to support one another's revisionist actions in their
   respective home regions. An underlying asymmetry of regional
   importance-China's prioritization of East Asia, and Russia's
   prioritization of Europe-enables this logrolling dynamic. Thus, I argue
   that while there are few shared interests between them, Russia and China
   could well maintain a limited but highly consequential cooperative
   relationship over the medium to long term. As such, the Sino-Russian
   threat to US-led order comes not from a coordinated balancing effort,
   but from reciprocal support of one another's region-specific revisionist
   actions.},

Abstract = {A central focus of China's grand strategy has been to reassure other
   states that its rise is non-threatening. Yet a large theoretical
   literature indicates that rising states' reassurance signals should not
   be credible. Rising powers with hostile intentions have a strong
   incentive to misrepresent by behaving cooperatively, in order to avoid a
   balancing response from other states. This paper presents a model of
   reassurance under shifting power in the shadow of a third-party threat.
   The results of the model suggest two ways in which the United States, by
   posing a threat to Russia, has facilitated China's credible reassurance
   of Russia. First, the presence of the US has reduced China's incentive
   to misrepresent any hostile intentions toward Russia it might
   hypothetically hold, making China's cooperative actions toward Russia
   more credible signals of its long-term intentions. Second, the US places
   enduring constraints over China's behavior, which incentivizes China's
   continued cooperation with Russia. These results help account for both
   Russia's increasingly optimistic beliefs about China's intentions and
   increasing China-Russia cooperation in the post-Cold War era, which
   realist balance of power and threat mechanisms cannot.},

Abstract = {Are populists really more emotional than mainstream parties? The alleged
   link between populism and emotional communication has barely been
   subject to systematic empirical scrutiny. I use literature on populist
   communication and appraisal theory to generate expectations about which
   political parties use which emotional appeals. I test these claims by
   applying a novel emotional dictionary to a large set of text data
   including more than 700,000 press releases and tweets from three
   European countries. As expected, I find that populist parties use
   significantly more negative emotional appeals (anger, fear, disgust,
   sadness) and less positive emotional appeals (joy, enthusiasm, pride,
   hope) than mainstream parties. Furthermore, I find that political actors
   adapt the usage of emotional appeals to different purposes depending on
   the communication medium and the politicians' status level. This study
   entails important implications for the research on emotional appeals in
   politics and populist communication.},

Abstract = {Scholars have written much about what national parliaments can, should
   and actually do in European Union (EU) governance. What they have
   largely disregarded so far is the actors' perspective. Which roles do
   national members of parliament (MPs)themselvesview as a priority and how
   do they assess their performance? Which factors may structure observed
   variation? From a strategic perspective on legislative behavior, the
   article conceptualizes five roles for national MPs in EU
   politics:Scrutinizers, Subsidiarity Watchdogs, Networkers,
   CommunicatorsandTransposers. It draws on plenary debates on the
   Constitutional Treaty, the Lisbon Treaty and the Eurozone crisis as well
   as data from 66 interviews with MPs from Austria, Germany, Ireland and
   the United Kingdom. There is a clear focus on scrutiny in EU affairs and
   communication to citizens. Ideological conviction and debate topics
   structure patterns in emphasis and assessment of these roles, while
   government-opposition dynamics and parliamentary strength only partially
   do.},

Abstract = {Purpose Antecedents and influences of workplace incivility have recently
   been studied in many areas of research but there is still a lack of
   consideration for the impact of culture. Theoretical considerations for
   the present research are based on the cultural dimensions of power
   distance and tightness/looseness because the collective levels of power
   distance are similar between Korea and Spain, but the collective levels
   of tightness/looseness are different between the two countries. The
   purpose of this paper is to examine whether individuals' occupational
   position affects their normative reactions to incivility differently.
   Design/methodology/approach Participant (victim)'s (those who react to
   uncivil behaviors) social power (low vs high) and perpetrator's (those
   who exhibit uncivil behaviors) social power (low vs high) were
   experimentally manipulated; all participants were randomly assigned to
   one of four perpetrator x victim conditions in relation to hierarchical
   positions (Ntot= 467). Findings The results suggest that the level of
   social and personal acceptability was greater either among Koreans than
   Spanish at a collective level or among people who endorsed higher power
   distance and tightness values. All in all, the findings highlight
   cultural influences on the importance of social hierarchy as a factor
   that can impact the people's normative reactions to incivility.
   Originality/value The findings broaden our understanding of the
   psychology of employees in relation to incivility, by simultaneously
   considering the influences of culture (power distance and
   tightness/looseness) and social power.},

Abstract = {Antifeminist mobilisation is growing in the United Nations. It is led by
   a coalition of certain post-Soviet, Catholic, and Islamic states; the
   United States; the Vatican; conservative nongovernmental organisations,
   occasionally joined by the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, the
   League of Arab States, the UN Africa Group, and the G77. Uniting them is
   the aim of restoring the `natural family' and opposing `gender
   ideology'. The group has become increasingly strategic, and its impact
   can already be seen in a number of UN fora, including the Security
   Council. By surveying feminist notions of backlash and comparing them to
   Alter and Zurn's definition of `backlash politics', the article gauges
   whether the group's activities can be characterised as such politics.
   The conclusion is that they can, suggesting that we are looking at a
   group with the potential to alter not only the global course of women's
   rights but also how politics is done within the UN.},

Abstract = {The increasing conditionality of access to social protection on
   claimants' proven willingness to seek and accept work has been one of
   the major dimensions of welfare state transformation of recent decades.
   Our understanding of the political determinants behind this trend,
   however, remains insufficient. This article assesses the
   state-of-the-art of political research on benefit work conditionality;
   points out a series of gaps and inconsistencies in existing research;
   and formulates an agenda for renewed and intensified research on the
   politics of work conditionality reforms, highlighting also how this
   research would contribute to important debates in welfare state research
   and political economy more generally.},

Abstract = {This issue brings together contributions from researchers from three
   disciplines : anthropology, political science and information and
   communication science. They extend reflections on the anthropology of
   humanitarian aid, the rhetorical registers used, the proliferation of
   actors and the political and diplomatic issues at stake. Rather than a
   paradigm shift, all the contributions offer an updated approach to the
   issues, challenges and changes in the practices of humanitarian actors.
   The perspective developed starts from a diachronic approach to better
   situate the influence of current socio-economic and political contexts
   on the humanitarian phenomenon. Through a multidisciplinary and
   complementary vision which takes the form of a wide variety of
   approaches, materials and methodologies, the four analyses focus
   specifically on the crises and issues linked to the discourses, dynamics
   of actors and fields of humanitarian aid. They examine four main
   dimensions of the humanitarian aid phenomenon : info-communicational
   dynamics, the relationship between humanitarianism and politics,
   encounters with beneficiaries and issues related to the coordination of
   policies and actions in the field.},

Abstract = {The bases of the political divisions in Macedonia are hard to explain
   solely through the traditional theoretical approach based on social
   structures and values. We include the perceptions of the communist past
   together with the social structures and values; and use survey data to
   run a multinomial logistic regression with undecided voters as the base
   category. Results show that perceptions of communism have the strongest
   influence on political divisions. Diverging perceptions of communism
   combine with attitudes toward religious values and shape a cultural
   left-right dimension. On the other hand, there is an absence of a
   left-right distinction in economic policies. The finding could be a
   useful explanation for political divisions in other post-communist
   countries, where there is an absence of distinction in economic
   policies.},

Abstract = {Culture is increasingly used as an explanatory variable for tax evasion.
   So far, we know, however, little about the mechanisms that link culture
   and tax behavior. This paper is a historical-sociological study of how
   religion influences tax behavior. The contribution focuses on the
   Italian case, among Western-European countries one with the highest
   evasion rates. It argues that the willingness of Italians to pay their
   taxes still suffers today from the Church-state conflict of the 19th
   century. To the Vatican, territorial integration of the Italian state
   posed an existential threat, both at the political (loss of territory)
   and at the spiritual level (diffusion of liberalism). The paper shows
   how Catholic socio-economic thinkers developed ideas about just taxation
   in response to Italian reunification that were directed against the
   Italian state and used by the Vatican to delegitimize it. The paper
   shows that it is not only rational decisions about the possibility to
   get audited or low public service provision that drives tax evasion.
   Instead Italian tax evasion is legitimized through a historically grown
   mistrust toward the state.},

Abstract = {Infrastructure public-private partnerships (PPPs) eschew traditional
   public management to provide distributive goods worldwide. Yet, in
   Colombia, the context of our study, both the promise of and voters'
   experience with PPPs hinder incumbent parties in elections when theories
   of distributive politics expect otherwise. We argue that negative
   experiences with PPPs introduce a sociotropic turn in individual voting:
   bad experience crowds out the possibility that promising a new project
   will improve a voter's own welfare. Studying what are, to our knowledge,
   all 109 Colombian PPP projects between 1998 and 2014, and over 8,700
   individual survey responses, our evidence shows that vote intention for
   the incumbent executive or his party decreases as experience with more
   PPPs in respondents' districts increases. Our analysis and results
   introduce an important agenda for research into the political
   significance of these legacies of new public management.},

Abstract = {While the literature generally acknowledges that target groups affect
   policy implementation, we argue that a more detailed investigation of
   the mechanisms and factors associated with such effect is necessary.
   Drawing on the Ambiguity-Conflict Model, we explore how target groups'
   perceived policy ambiguity and conflict relate to the implementation of
   Corporate Employee Pension (CEP) policies in China. Empirically, we
   utilize a unique sample of all firms listed on China's A-stock market
   from 2008 to 2014 and hypothesize that target groups' perceived policy
   ambiguity and conflict negatively associate with the implementation
   outcomes of the CEP policies in China. Our results confirm such a
   relationship and suggest that the implementation outcomes, from most
   favorable to least favorable, follow the order: Administrative
   Implementation, Political Implementation or Experimental Implementation,
   and Symbolic Implementation. Such results are robust to both state-owned
   and non-state-owned enterprises. Our research offers implications for
   both scholars and practitioners of pension policies in China.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research has documented political inequality along
   class lines at different stages of the representation process. This
   article contributes to our understanding of unequal responsiveness and
   its causes with an in-depth study of Germany that investigates the link
   between preferences and policymakers' decisions. Using an original
   dataset covering 746 survey questions on specific reform proposals from
   1980 to 2013, we provide the first study of a European democracy that
   investigates whether responsiveness patterns vary between economic and
   cultural policies or different governing coalitions. We show that
   decisions are skewed towards upper occupational and educational groups,
   irrespective of policy type or government composition. These results
   advance the discussion of potential mechanisms for unequal
   responsiveness. As privileged groups are overrepresented in parliament,
   our findings support the argument that the social bias in the make-up of
   parliaments matters for substantive representation.},

Abstract = {Based on the case of Brazil, this article looks deep into the state
   apparatus and analyzes the organic relationship between state
   commitments to human rights and the work of bureaucrats who are
   motivated by human rights values and ideas. Brazil had a consolidated
   history of engagement with the international human rights regime until
   Jair Bolsonaro was elected President. That history was marked by a
   foreign policy that was active in international human rights
   norm-making, as well as by domestic institutions and policies that
   sought to promote rights at home. An engaged state made room for the
   work of human rights bureaucrats in the federal government, including
   diplomats, officials at the Ministry of Human Rights, and beyond. Since
   the election of Bolsonaro, however, the Brazilian state has reversed and
   revised its foreign and domestic policies. As a result, bureaucrats who
   were dedicated to human rights work are now faced with persecution,
   having to oblige to the new foreign policy in the case of diplomats, or
   having to find somewhere else to work or something else to do, in the
   case of non-diplomats.},

Abstract = {Government impartiality is considered a core feature of quality of
   government, and one that leads to favorable macro-level outcomes. We
   have limited knowledge, however, of how impartiality affects citizens'
   perceptions of public service quality. In particular, we do not know how
   the impacts of impartiality differ across citizens from different
   socioeconomic backgrounds. Understanding this relationship is important
   because citizens are the main beneficiaries of public services and are
   directly affected by administrative impartiality. Using the European
   Quality of Government Index data for 56,925 citizens in 174 European
   regions, the results of multilevel analysis show that impartiality alone
   does not lead to an increase in perceived public service quality.
   However, government impartiality leads to decreased public service
   quality for vulnerable citizens. The findings are robust across regions
   and countries even after controlling for individual, regional, and
   country-level factors. These results suggest that citizens do not
   benefit equally from government impartiality.},

Abstract = {The radical right is disproportionately supported by men, yet there is
   little research on masculinity's role in creating this discrepancy. This
   article breaks new ground in using masculinity as an analytical
   construct to explain the gender gap in one of the UK's most significant
   radical right organisations: the English Defence League. Drawing on
   original qualitative data and interviews with past and present English
   Defence League activists, this article argues that English Defence
   League beliefs and practices were distinctly masculine. In promoting an
   ideology that subordinated Muslim men and women, and in providing a
   forum for displaying and enacting manhood, the English Defence League
   facilitated the supply of masculinity and therefore attracted far more
   men than women. The approach used in this article shows how theoretical
   analyses of masculinity can be incorporated within political science and
   offers a powerful new lens through which to understand radical right
   parties and movements.},

   Attitudes-Behaviors Corrective (ABC) Model of Violent Extremism, in
   which he contrasts our framework with his own two pyramids model
   (developed with Sophia Moskalenko). In particular, we focus on further
   distinguishing between the ``core{''} and ``optional extra{''} elements
   of our ABC model, elaborating on how our interpretation deals with
   individuals who seemingly become involved in violence in the interests
   of the group, ``unpacking{''} the concept of ideology through our ABC
   lens, and providing recommendations on how to measure attitudes and
   behaviors in a context specific manner.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do increasing food prices lead to urban unrest?
   Existing literature suggests a positive correlation between food prices
   and social unrest. Meanwhile, there is a large variation in the
   consequences of increasing food prices, indicating that this phenomenon
   has a heterogeneous effect across different contexts. The theoretical
   focus on grievances in the existing literature appears to be
   insufficient for explaining the variations in outcome. This study asks
   whether specific features in the domestic institutional setting can
   explain why food-price induced grievances sometimes lead to unrest and
   at other times do not. Specifically, the article argues that the
   manifestation of unrest when food prices increase is moderated by the
   degree to which the state represses societal organizations. Civil and
   political society have the potential to channel collective dissent
   around food-related grievances, as these organizations provide existing
   mobilization structures that people can draw on to engage in collective
   action. Further, they can translate an individual-level grievance into a
   group phenomenon by politicizing the cost of food through the
   formulation of grievance frames. If the state represses existing
   societal organizations that can help aggrieved individuals engage in
   collective action to voice discontent - or introduces barriers to
   initial mobilization - this will likely reduce the possibility of unrest
   when food prices go up. Using institutional data from the Varieties of
   Democracy (V-Dem) project combined with the Social Conflict Analysis
   Database (SCAD), the findings suggest that repression of societal
   organizations decreases the likelihood of unrest when food prices rise.},

Abstract = {A frequent argument of Eurosceptics is that the EU acts as an
   imperialist power towards its own member states. This argument has
   recently gained traction both in Hungary, where Prime Minister Orban
   complains of the EU's moral and political imperialism, and also in the
   UK, where arguments that the EU intends to reduce post-Brexit UK to a
   `vassal state' have motivated Eurosceptics to support a no-deal
   withdrawal. There remains an important paradox in the charge of European
   imperialism, however, because the EU is widely thought to lack much
   international power, at least in comparison to China and the United
   States. This essay explores the paradox of a political formation that is
   both vulnerable to the charge of being an imperialist, while no less
   vulnerable to being itself the victim of imperialism (or
   `vassalisation').},

Abstract = {This article analyses how non-state actors (NSAs) and foreign states
   contribute to the (de)politicisation of EU foreign policy. It shows that
   the link between crises and politicisation in EU foreign policy is
   mediated by the frames and the strategies that NSAs employ when lobbying
   the EU. By pointing to inconsistencies between EU actions and its
   claimed identity, they challenge the EU's foundational narrative,
   creating ontological crises which can potentially become politicised.
   When actors employ a legal/technical frame and an inside strategy, the
   crisis tends to be depoliticised. In contrast, politicisation occurs
   when a political/emotional frame is combined with noisy politics that
   targets the public at large. Based on documentary analysis and
   interviews with EU officials and NSAs, this argument is discussed with
   reference to EU foreign policy vis-a-vis the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict, a key issue on the EU's foreign policy agenda.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze how the Korean government has been effective
   in taming COVID-19 without forced interruptions (i.e. lockdowns) of
   citizens' daily lives. Extending the theory of organizational learning,
   we propose the quadruple-loop learning model, through which we examine
   how a government can find solutions to a wicked policy problem like
   COVID-19. The quadruple-loop learning model is applied to explain how
   the Korean government could effectively tame COVID-19 in the initial
   stage through its agile as well as adaptive approach based on effective
   interactions of backstage (time, target, and context) and frontstage of
   policy processes mainly focusing on the initial stage until the highest
   alert level was announced. Based on the Korean case, this study also
   examines critical factors to effective learning organizations such as
   leadership, information and transparency, as well as citizen
   participation and governance.},

Abstract = {Years of research on performance management has generally concluded that
   performance information is seldom used purposefully by public managers
   and that it does not improve performance as intended. More recently,
   both theoretical and empirical work have begun to focus on situations in
   which performance management may facilitate internal organizational
   learning. In this study, we focus on one key component in performance
   management systems, namely generation of performance information. Based
   on a Bayesian learning model, we argue that generation of performance
   information at the individual level may create performance improvements
   because both users and frontline workers may learn where to prioritize
   their efforts.To test the isolated effect of this key component of any
   performance management system, we use as-good-as-random variation in
   exposure of students to testing because of a technical breakdown in an
   IT system. We identify the effect of testing on student learning
   measured two years after the breakdown. Results show positive and
   statistically significant effects of about 0.1 standard deviations,
   which is comparable to much more expensive interventions, and effects
   tend to persist after four years. We find larger effects for students
   with low socioeconomic status but also that schools with many students
   from this group are more reluctant to measure their performance.
   Implications and limitations in terms of increasing the level of student
   testing are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article examines Mexico-U.S. negotiations over labor rights in
   Mexico in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement
   and a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Strong U.S. pressures
   caused Mexico to adopt a constitutional reform that significantly
   strengthened the legal basis for democratic worker rights. Not only did
   these changes affect an area of core state sovereignty and a pillar of
   Mexican political economy, but they also constituted the only known
   instance of Mexico adopting a constitutional reform in response to an
   explicit external demand. In the interdependent but asymmetrical
   relationship between Mexico and the United States, what factors-power
   asymmetries between the two countries, the decision-making context,
   and/or Mexican government officials' negotiating strategies and
   political goals-explain the character and outcome of these interactions?
   The conclusion highlights the implications of this crucial case for
   future bilateral relations. Keywords: Mexico-U.S. relations;
   asymmetrical complex},

Abstract = {The functioning of markets is premised on the creation of collaborative
   relationships and networks. Food markets in Zimbabwe are evolving in
   response to state interventions that aim to restructure the marketplace
   and the flow of produce. This article explores Mbare Musika, the oldest
   and largest marketplace in Harare supplying the city with fresh fruit
   and vegetables. We analyse Mbare Musika from the perspective of the
   interactions among farmers and retailers, vendors, transporters,
   intermediaries, officials, and customers, in creating and sustaining a
   specific enduring market. We use actor narratives to understand the
   ordering and (re)ordering of people and produce in the context of
   informalization, shifting polycentric relationships, and market
   infrastructure to sustain livelihoods anchored on the circulation of
   large volumes of diverse fresh produce. Themarket is overtly economic in
   outlook but, intrinsically, it is a social arena where discourses are
   continuously reconstructed, reproduced, and expressed through daily
   interactions. We situateMbare Musika in past and present sociopolitical
   processes of transformation in Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {A push for evidence-based approaches to the study of politics, dubbed
   the `credibility revolution', has resulted in a proliferation of
   experiments and randomized control trials (RCTs) in Africa. The current
   emphasis on the strength of the experimental method has vast
   ramifications for our understanding of political phenomena and
   real-world realities faced by local populations. Yet, very little work
   focuses on the practical challenges that may arise if and when
   researchers and students decide to use this method. Drawing from a
   variety of research experiences across the continent, this research note
   documents the implementation challenges that are often faced but rarely
   discussed, particularly regarding maintaining control of the treatments
   in experiments. To overcome these challenges, the research note makes
   suggestions on how best to engage local populations to improve
   experiments. Instead of treating Africa like a laboratory, this approach
   humanizes the subjects whose real-world political experiences will
   continue, even after the intervention is finished and the researcher
   returns home. In collaborating with local populations, we can strive to
   conductmore ethical projects that include the participants in the
   conception, design, and dissemination processes, strengthening not only
   our contribution to the discipline but to politics in Africa in general.},

Abstract = {International relations (IR) has witnessed an emerging interest in
   neuroscience, particularly for its relevance to a now widespread
   scholarship on emotions. Contributing to this scholarship, this paper
   draws on the subfields of affective neuroscience and neuropsychology,
   which remain largely unexplored in IR. Firstly, the paper draws on
   affective neuroscience in illuminating affect's defining role in
   consciousness and omnipresence in social behavior, challenging the
   continuing elision of emotions in mainstream approaches. Secondly, it
   applies theories of depth neuropsychology, which suggest a neural
   predisposition originating in the brain's higher cortical regions to
   attenuate emotional arousal and limit affective consciousness. This
   predisposition works to preserve individuals' self-coherence, countering
   implicit assumptions about rationality and motivation within IR theory.
   Thirdly, it outlines three key implications for IR theory. It argues
   that affective neuroscience and neuropsychology offer a route toward
   deep theorizing of ontologies and motivations. It also leads to a
   reassessment of the social regulation of emotions, particularly as
   observed in institutions, including the state. It also suggests a
   productive engagement with constructivist and poststructuralist
   approaches by addressing the agency of the body in social relations. The
   paper concludes by sketching the potential for a therapeutically-attuned
   approach to IR.},

Abstract = {Jihadist propaganda videos depicting training camps and combat scenes
   have steadily increased in variety and quality over the years. A small
   number of these videos attempt to mimic Special Operation Forces (SOF)'s
   tactics and skills. This subset of jihadist propaganda might go beyond a
   mere attempt to show prowess and reveal actual operational capabilities.
   This article analyzes three exemplary jihadist propaganda videos
   depicting claimed SOF capabilities through expert reviews with active
   service SOF personnel to assess the actual tactical quality of the
   content shown. It also discusses the potential reasons for those groups
   to mimic SOF and implications for counterterrorism.},

Abstract = {During the center-left Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers' Party-PT)
   governments of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2002-2010) and Dilma Rousseff
   (2011-2016), the Brazilian Landless Movement took advantage of
   particular governmental changes-increased access to education, improved
   small-farmer support programs, and expanded agrarian reform development
   policies-to strengthen its leadership and organization. Instead of
   expanding, the movement turned inward to address internal weaknesses. It
   benefited from the PT's ambiguous position with respect to the politics
   of agrarian reform. Since each administration dedicated considerable
   resources to public policies that the movement favored, neither
   government engaged in significant land redistribution. Durante los
   gobiernos de Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2002-2010) y Dilma Rousseff
   (2011-2016), ambos pertenecientes al centro-izquierdista Partido dos
   Trabalhadores (PT), el Movimiento Brasileno Sin Tierra aprovecho cambios
   gubernamentales particulares, como mejores programas de apoyo a los
   pequenos agricultores, mejor acceso a la educacion y politicas ampliadas
   para el desarrollo de reformas agrarias, para fortalecer su liderazgo y
   organizacion. En lugar de expandirse, el movimiento se torno hacia si
   mismo para abordar debilidades internas. Se beneficio de la posicion
   ambigua del PT con respecto a las politicas de reforma agraria. Y dado
   que ambas administraciones dedicaron considerables recursos a politicas
   publicas favorecidas por el movimiento, ninguno se aboco a supervisar
   una redistribucion significativa de la tierra.},

Title = {Compliance without coercion: Effects of reporting on international labor
   rights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {While a dominant position in research on compliance holds that
   enforcement is necessary for states to abide by their international
   commitments, many international organizations (IOs) do not have recourse
   to such coercive means. This article offers the first systematic
   analysis of one prominent alternative to material coercion: compliance
   reporting by IOs. It develops an argument for why reporting by IOs
   should lead states to correct non-compliant behavior, and when those
   effects should be particularly strong. It tests this argument in the
   context of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which offers a
   unique setting for evaluating the impact of reporting in the absence of
   coercion. The principal findings are threefold. First, reporting has
   significant and durable effects on state respect for labor rights.
   Second, reporting affects compliance both immediately and when repeated
   over longer periods of time. Third, reporting has stronger effects on
   improvements in labor rights when target states are democratic and
   resourceful, and have a stronger presence of labor NGOs. By contrast, it
   does not matter to reporting's effect whether states are highly
   economically dependent on the outside world or whether reporting is
   coupled with active shaming of non-compliant states. Taken together, our
   results suggest that existing research has not fully appreciated the
   potential of monitoring systems based on reporting to generate
   compliance with international rules. While hard enforcement may still be
   important, especially in areas where incentives to renege are strong,
   the findings of this article suggest that it is not the exclusive path
   to compliance.},

Abstract = {We maintain that political institutions' policy objectives are best met
   under conditions when they are unified, and also when their
   administrative leadership is effective. We apply this argument to the
   understanding of how unified Democratic and Republican governments in
   the American states have influenced the incomes of affluent citizens. We
   find that affluent income gains occur under unified Republican state
   governments when compensation to executive agency heads is sufficiently
   high. These income gains are notable relative to both divided and
   unified partisan control of state governments. The evidence highlights
   the asymmetric role that bureaucratic leadership plays in attaining
   policy outcomes consistent with political institutions' policy
   preferences, while underscoring the limits of electoral institutions to
   shape policy outcomes of their own accord. Efforts to lower the capacity
   of the administrative leadership constrain unified political
   institutions from converting their policy objectives into policy
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The assumption of social responsibility for all citizens is a hallmark
   of the welfare state, reflecting a notion of universalism. But in
   developing countries, old-age pensions only cover small sections of the
   population, mainly through contributory social insurance. However, over
   the last 25 years, old-age pension coverage across the global South has
   expanded unexpectedly, mostly accounted for by the adoption and reform
   of non-contributory, or `social', pensions. In this way, developing
   countries have come closer to universal coverage, but not through social
   insurance as in Western and Northern Europe. The rise of social pensions
   was an unlikely event, since well into the 1990s the idea of `just
   giving money to the poor' had been rejected by all major actors in the
   development community. The standard explanatory model of Northern
   welfare state research would not have predicted the rise either. Using
   event history analysis (1967-2011), we find that key variables from the
   Northern standard explanatory model also operate in development
   contexts, but that three drivers peculiar to developing countries have
   to be added. The paper draws on a new data base, constructed by the
   authors, which covers all social pensions in all low- and middle-income
   countries.},

Abstract = {How does the salience of environmental issues influence climate policy
   adoption in the American states? This article considers how two aspects
   of public salience, issue problem status and issue attention, work with
   environmental interest group membership to influence climate policy
   adoption in the American states. We contribute to the theoretical
   development of issue salience and offer alternative measures that
   capture differences in salience across subnational units. We find
   evidence that states where climate change is perceived to be a problem,
   and where attention to environmental issues is high, are more likely to
   adopt relevant policies. Furthermore, states with Republican majorities
   in either legislative chamber are less likely to adopt climate policies.
   Our findings have implications for the impact of salience on the policy
   process.},

Title = {How candidate characteristics matter: Candidate profiles, political
   sophistication, and vote choice},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-155},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Our study examines the influence of various candidate characteristics
   (sociodemographic profile, competence and experience, issue positions,
   and party affiliation) on voters' preference for a candidate, and
   investigates the impact of voters' levels of political sophistication on
   their likelihood of considering various candidate characteristics voters
   when deciding whom to support. Using data from the 2015 Finnish National
   Election Study, this study is situated within the complex Finnish open
   list system with many candidates at display and mandatory preference
   voting. We find that voters mostly argue to make their choice based on
   candidate characteristics with direct politically relevant information
   such as candidate party affiliation and issue positions. Candidate
   sociodemographic profile has relatively little stated impact. Overall,
   voters with higher levels of political sophistication tend to be more
   likely to consider a broad range of candidate characteristics. When
   investigating the relative impact of each candidate characteristic (that
   is, their impact relative to the other candidate characteristics) on
   voting behaviour, political sophistication increases the likelihood of
   saying to rely on candidate characteristics that are more demanding in
   terms of information processing such as competence and experience, and
   issue positions. Our analyses also show how different measures of

Abstract = {The extant literature on clientelism has tended to focus on large
   parties. This article asks what happens to small parties that operate in
   an electoral system dominated by large clientelistic parties. Our case
   study is the Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL). During the last two
   decades, it has become the second-largest party in Romania. This is
   unusual because the liberals in post-communist countries are politically
   weak. The main base of liberal support is typically urban middle
   classes. By contrast, PNL's electoral base is in the economically
   underdeveloped rural world. Using electoral statistics, economic
   datasets, and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that PNL's success
   was due to pork-barrel spending and the development of clientelistic
   networks in which local mayors play a key role. PNL was able to grow by
   following the example of the dominant parties and creating networks of
   loyal mayors. In turn, this opens perspectives for research about
   clientelism in small communities, as well as comparative studies based
   on small parties.},

Abstract = {Extensive research on ``environmental federalism{''} investigates the
   effects of shared state-federal implementation on policy outcomes under
   the landmark American environmental laws of the 1970s. But these laws
   originally made no mention of American Indian tribal lands, and
   subsequent research on environmental federalism has given them little
   attention. Since 1987, tribes have been eligible to assume
   implementation primacy under federal environmental law, similar to
   states. We analyze Clean Water Act (CWA) enforcement under American
   Indian tribal primacy compared with tribal facilities regulated directly
   by the U.S. government. To date, 62 tribal governments have been
   approved for implementation primacy under the CWA. The number and
   diversity of tribes operating regulated facilities provides uncommon
   leverage on key questions about environmental federalism. Do tribes that
   secure primacy enforce environmental rules more rigorously? Or does
   primacy allow tribes to shirk regulations in a race-to-the-bottom?
   Analysis of CWA enforcement across 474 tribal wastewater facilities
   finds that, on average, enforcement increases significantly under tribal
   primacy. Our findings offer insights about environmental federalism,
   with important implications for environmental justice.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between contemporary
   revolutionary agency, domestic reforms and liberal peacebuilding in the
   aftermath of the Arab Uprisings. In particular, it focuses on the
   tensions between the liberal peace's orthodox and emancipatory strands
   by asking: Does liberal peacebuilding support or hinder revolutionary
   emancipation in the Arab region? The article aims to close a gap in PCS
   scholarship by delivering insights into contemporary revolutionary
   processes (here called `everyday state formation'). After elaborating
   the disjunctures between revolutionary agency and liberal peacebuilding
   interventions in the spheres of statebuilding, development and
   democratisation, many peacebuilding interventions appear as
   counterrevolutionary practices.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The article investigates how justifications used by politicians to
   explain their positions on policies of regional integration shape public
   opinion about these policies. I argue that support for a policy position
   increases when politicians tailor their justifications to the
   expectations of their audience, and I suggest that this happens even
   when party cues offer a less effortful way of forming opinions. I test
   my theoretical expectations in laboratory experiments with diverse
   samples, which manipulate party cues and justifications for a policy of
   European integration. I find that citizens use justifications and cues
   to form opinions. The relative importance of the two factors depends on
   individual dispositions and political context. In a non-competitive
   context (study 1), politically invested citizens use cues, while
   uninvested citizens use justifications. In a competitive context (study
   2), the opinions of politically invested citizens are shaped by both
   factors, while the opinions of uninvested citizens become erratic.},

   Evidence from a survey experiment in Slovakia},

Abstract = {In divided societies and new democracies, clientelism (in the form of
   pork barrel) and ethno-politics appear to go hand in hand. It is
   apparent that politicians are incentivized to compete for support within
   their own ethnic groups, but does an ethnic link between voters and
   decision-makers influence how voters perceive and evaluate pork barrel
   practices? To address this question, we conducted a survey experiment (n
   = 1200) in ethnically heterogeneous Slovakia. The aim was to examine
   whether pork barrel politics implemented by a Slovak decision-maker and
   a Hungarian decision-maker are evaluated differently by Slovaks and
   Hungarians. The findings suggest that when individuals and
   decision-makers share the same ethnicity, individuals tend to maintain
   an equally positive level of trust and willingness to vote for the
   responsible decision-maker, even when the decision-maker implements a
   policy decision that does not benefit them. Nonetheless, shared
   ethnicity does not prevent individuals from being critical of the
   implemented policy decision itself.},

Abstract = {Thirty years after 1989 Europe is once again divided, despite 15 years
   of integration within the European Union. In contrast to the West's
   liberal conception of internationally constrained democracy rooted in
   the protection of individual human rights, Central Europe has developed
   an illiberal version centred on the popular sovereignty of the nation. I
   argue that these divergent understandings of democracy and the
   nation-state are rooted in collective memory. Whereas the West's
   historical imaginary is based on the traumas of Nazism associated with
   1945, Central Europe's is dominated by the legacy of communism
   symbolically signified by 1989. These differing understandings of past
   teach strikingly different lessons for the present: one focused on the
   dangers of nationalism, the other on protecting national
   self-determination from external interference. The future of the EU
   depends on its ability create a broader historical narrative that can
   incorporate both the lessons of 1945 and 1989.},

Abstract = {Despite its consociationalism and clientelism, in 2018 civil society
   groups hoped to gain a real foothold in Lebanon's parliament in light of
   recent social mobilization, local election results, and the introduction
   of proportional electoral rules. Contributing to the literature on
   power-sharing, this paper analyzes why civil society groups were so
   hopeful and why they only won a single seat. While confessional parties
   shaped electoral rules to their advantage and deployed their powers of
   clientelism, there are signs of the same deeply rooted informal norms
   and practices that promote status quo elections in other consociational
   cases despite broad public disaffection with governance.},

Abstract = {What factors influence the likelihood that a state will adopt a policy?
   Previous scholarship has examined economic, societal, and political
   factors, but has paid little attention to the value of the policy
   entrepreneur. Exploring the literature, I argue that the role of a
   policy entrepreneur is vital to policy innovation and eventual diffusion
   while accounting for other known factors. Performing Event History
   Analysis, I investigate the factors which led 30 states from 2011 to
   2017 to adopt Erin's Law, a child abuse policy. The findings suggest
   that the states in which Erin Merryn, the policy entrepreneur, visited
   had a greater likelihood of adopting Erin's Law over states which were
   not visited. This discovery not only demonstrates the value of the
   policy entrepreneur but encourages further investigation of the policy
   entrepreneur within the diffusion process.},

Abstract = {Against a backdrop of increased levels of marketization of welfare
   services in OECD countries, this article aims to shed light on the
   separate effects of private ownership and competition for the market on

   case, we leverage unique panel data of ownership and competition against
   a set of indicators, pertaining to the structure, process, and outcome
   dimensions of care quality. The main finding of our analyses is that
   competition for the market does surprisingly little for quality: private
   entrepreneurs perform neither better nor worse under stiff competition
   and the quality of care is approximately the same in those nursing homes
   that are exposed to the market as in those that are not.},

Abstract = {This article examines the early NATO discourse to illuminate ideas about
   a future war with the Soviet Bloc. World War Two provided an important
   cognitive script for conceptualizing a Third World War, with the impact
   of the nuclear `revolution' being less dominant than generally believed.
   I argue that officials were unable to devise a script in which the
   Soviet Union could conquer Western Europe and then defeat the United
   States. Although this inability to achieve ``final victory{''} was
   believed enough to deter Moscow from aggression, the need to reassure
   European Allies led NATO to adopt the ``forward strategy{''}.},

Abstract = {The 2016 migrant quota referendum and the preceding anti-migrant and
   anti-EU campaign in Hungary led to a milestone in manipulating public
   fear of societal change by new East-Central European populism. This
   article maps and analyzes sentiments toward the referendum in
   Hungarian-language online media, using software-supported sentiment
   analysis of mentions of the quota referendum published online between 1
   September and 31 October 2016. Results show a preponderance of negative
   sentiments over positive ones in both pro-government and independent
   media and the dominance of independent media in the coverage of the
   event. Coverage of the referendum received more weight in pro-government
   media compared to their lesser online presence, but this was fueled by
   astroturfed online discussion communities and content disseminated from
   at least one Russian state propaganda source.},

Abstract = {Governments develop policies that set strategic directions on matters of
   national significance, referred to in this paper as strategic policies.
   Australia's Commonwealth Government develops and influences national
   environmental and sustainability policies despite having limited
   constitutional powers in the management of natural resources. The
   Commonwealth Government has, over the past three decades, developed
   strategic policies aimed at sustainably managing forests, water, soils
   and agricultural lands. The design and implementation arrangements of
   environmental policies that have endured is not well studied, and this
   paper addresses this knowledge gap in the context of a federal system.
   The National Forest Policy Statement, the National Water Initiative and
   the Natural Heritage Trust have endured centre-left Labor and
   centre-right Coalition Governments, and serve as case studies. These
   policies have required structural adjustments to industries to varying
   degrees to limit impacts on the environment, leading to contestations
   about policy objectives. The policy cycle serves as the primary
   heuristic for analysis and the research finds that policy objectives are
   constrained by the Commonwealth Government's limited constitutional
   powers on environmental matters. Its participation in strategic policies
   is driven through notions of resolving a crisis and the policies endure
   in a phase of indifference to the original policy objectives.},

   reform and public discourse, 1990-2016???PALABRAS CLAVE},

Abstract = {This article explores the newspaper discourse surrounding a paradigm
   shift in social policy. The case at hand, Germany, is a prime example of
   a welfare state that was particularly resistant to reform. Hence, the
   rapid paradigm shift in German family policy since the late 1990s is
   puzzling. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by drawing on the
   insight that public discourse is crucial for policy change. Politicians
   have to promote reforms prior to their implementation. The main channel
   for communication with the wider public is the mass media. I use
   newspaper coverage from 1990 to 2016 to analyze whether the media is
   responsive to reform initiatives. I use topic modeling, an innovative
   method from the computational social sciences (CSS), to identify
   dominant themes and shifts over time in a large corpus of newspaper
   articles (N = 1,459). The analysis shows that public discourse was
   responsive to the parliamentary debate. The article also clarifies the
   role of critical events and identifies discursive strategies.

   Resumen Este articulo explora el discurso periodistico en torno a un
   cambio de paradigma en la politica social. El caso en cuestion,
   Alemania, es un excelente ejemplo de un estado de bienestar que fue
   particularmente resistente a la reforma. Por lo tanto, el rapido cambio
   de paradigma en la politica familiar alemana desde finales de la decada
   de 1990 es desconcertante. Este estudio busca resolver este enigma
   basandose en la idea de que el discurso publico es crucial para el
   cambio de politicas. Los politicos tienen que promover reformas antes de
   su implementacion. El principal canal de comunicacion con el publico en
   general son los medios de comunicacion. Utilizo la cobertura
   periodistica de 1990 a 2016 para analizar si los medios responden a las
   iniciativas de reforma. Utilizo el modelado de temas, un metodo
   innovador de las ciencias sociales computacionales (CSS), para
   identificar temas dominantes y cambios a lo largo del tiempo en un gran
   corpus de articulos periodisticos (N = 1,459). El analisis muestra que
   el discurso publico respondia al debate parlamentario. El articulo
   tambien aclara el papel de los eventos criticos e identifica estrategias
   discursivas.},

Abstract = {Did NATO expansion foster democratic development in Eastern Europe? Past
   scholarship offers conflicting answers to this question. We seek to
   bring clarity by focusing on the 2004 NATO expansion to include the
   three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as
   Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. We leverage the fact that we
   now as many years of data since NATO entry as we have between the
   collapse of the Soviet Union and the 2004 NATO expansion. We also use
   newly available and highly refined data on regime type. We show that
   NATO membership and anticipation thereof had little to no influence on
   democratic development in Eastern Europe. However, anticipation of
   European Union membership appears to have bolstered democratic
   development. Although the results cannot fully rule out NATO playing a
   secondary role, they make clear that NATO membership was not a necessary
   condition for democratic survival in Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {How does food access affect the mobilization of collective violence? The
   upsurge in rioting in 2008 drew broad attention to the relationship of
   food and conflict, as scholars and policymakers sought to understand the
   mobilization and variation of rioting events. Studies have shown a
   robust relationship between conflict and food prices, noting an increase
   in incidents of violent conflict during times of high global prices.
   This study furthers the theory on the role of food access in riot
   mobilization, investigating the mechanisms by which changes in food
   access translate into collective violence. Using detailed, first-hand
   accounts of rioting in 2007 and 2008, this study investigates the
   motives and grievances of the community members where riots occurred and
   the relationship of those grievances to food access, while contrasting
   these accounts to communities that did not engage in rioting. In the
   cases presented, a change in food access motivated protest and violence
   involving existing grievances rather than explicitly addressing food
   access. In this way, food changed the meaning and severity of existing
   grievances. The cases studied add to our understanding of concurrent
   upsurges in food riots by outlining the ways that food access interacts
   with local contexts to initiate violent conflict, stressing the presence
   of existing actors who use decreased food access to mobilize resources
   to address existing grievances. While media accounts highlighted food
   access as the primary concern of food rioters, this study argues that
   many `food riots' were not, in fact, directly motivated by food access.
   Rather, changes to food access can aid in mobilizing protests around a
   range of grievances, some unrelated to food access. Efforts to address
   the causes of food-related instability will be unsuccessful if they
   focus solely on food access without addressing the primary motivating
   grievance and understanding how food access relates to that grievance.},

Abstract = {Given Puerto Rico's colonial exclusion from Latin American and Caribbean
   regionalism and its ruling parties' disregard for stimulating an
   industrial base of small and medium-sized local enterprises rather than
   U.S. multinational corporations, Puerto Rico needs to construct new
   pathways to inclusive socioeconomic development. One approach is
   articulating strategic and industrial policies to stimulate these
   enterprises from below by promoting value chains focused on exports or
   export potential. A proposed systematization draws on the experience
   gained in a project carried out under an agreement between the
   University of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico's Trade and Export Company to
   generate strategic export plans and map value chains for small and
   medium-sized enterprises.
   Dada la exclusion colonial de Puerto Rico del regionalismo
   latinoamericano y caribeno y el desprecio de sus partidos gobernantes
   por estimular una base industrial de pequenas y medianas empresas
   locales en lugar de corporaciones multinacionales estadounidenses,
   Puerto Rico necesita construir nuevas vias hacia el desarrollo
   socioeconomico inclusivo. Un enfoque es articular politicas estrategicas
   e industriales para estimular a estas empresas desde abajo mediante la
   promocion de cadenas de valor centradas en las exportaciones o el
   potencial de exportacion. La sistematizacion propuesta se basa en la
   experiencia adquirida en un proyecto llevado a cabo en virtud de un
   acuerdo entre la Universidad de Puerto Rico y la Compania de Comercio y
   Exportacion de Puerto Rico para generar planes estrategicos de
   exportacion y mapear cadenas de valor para pequenas y medianas empresas.},

Abstract = {Japan experienced a surge in renewable power plant construction since
   adopting the Feed-in Tariff policy in 2012. But why did some
   municipalities choose to adopt more renewables than others? Do technical
   resources explain the difference, or might socioeconomics, social
   capital, and local policy also serve as motivations, resources, or
   obstacles? Using zero-inflated negative binomial and Conway Maxwell
   Poisson regression, the effects of technical and social variables on
   renewables siting for all municipalities in Japan are modeled, and
   compared with survey results from a sample of 56. Municipalities with
   high unemployment and cheap land are especially likely to host solar,
   wind, and biomass and have greater energy system redundancy. Those with
   stronger bonding social ties are more likely to host wind, contrary to
   predictions, and cities that invested early in reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions are more likely to deploy solar.},

Abstract = {Policy outcomes in parliamentary systems can be affected by the
   characteristics of those appointed to executive positions. Research into
   the survival of ministerial appointments emphasise institutional
   factors, personal, and professional characteristics. There is, however,
   less attention paid to how the specific features of a portfolio affect
   ministerial survival. I address this gap by examining Australian
   Attorneys-General, to highlight how the duration of ministerial
   appointments depends on the features of the position. I find that a
   specific understanding of a portfolio can affect ministerial survival
   and that the survival of Australian Attorneys-General is shaped by the
   specifics of the portfolio.},

Abstract = {Many Sub-Saharan African countries are unable to generate sufficient tax
   revenues for public purposes. While it is widely accepted that
   governments' ability to tax is shaped by politics, the precise
   mechanisms through which this relationship takes place in practice
   remain elusive. Based on a historical analysis of four major tax reforms
   in Ghana from the 1850s to the late 1990s, this article captures the
   various ways in which taxpayers negotiate with the state in an attempt
   to limit the extent of taxation, especially in cases where state
   reciprocity falls short of what people expect. Our evidence suggests
   that, far from being a recent development, effective taxation in Ghana
   has long depended on the ability of the state to convince taxpayers that
   tax revenues will be used for the public benefit. A history of
   misappropriation of tax revenues, overt corruption, and profligacy
   diminished taxpayers' support for governments' tax efforts. More
   generally, the article points to the importance of understanding how tax
   bargaining works in practice and people's perceptions of their
   governments over the long term to overcome resistance to tax reforms.},

Abstract = {Nongovernmental organizations are important in policy processes, but
   most studies supporting this argument are conducted in democracies. This
   article, therefore, focuses on China's environmental policy to discuss
   how environmental NGOs (eNGOs) conduct policy advocacy in authoritarian
   contexts. Based on interviews with eNGOs and scholars in China, I
   provide a typology to describe policy advocacy channels based on their
   formality and consistency and explain how channels are selected based on
   the political resources of eNGOs. This article reveals how policy
   advocacy is affected by one of the prominent features of authoritarian
   states-a monopoly of political power-and indicates that many tactics
   identified in current literature can be explained by the political
   resource endowments of NGOs. Additionally, this article also provides
   insights on the potential changes of the advocacy channels when the
   political control is tightened in the Xi era and how eNGOs cope with the
   new political situation.},

Abstract = {In order to examine the legacy of insecurity and violence left by
   Enrique Pena Nieto's term in office in the context of multiple crisis,
   this paper begins with the relationship between democratization and
   security in the context of the political transition, together with the
   recent history of the country. Analysis of the profile of victims of
   criminal violence not only allows us to identify its discriminatory
   nature, but to reach into its underlying logic. In addition to
   identifying drugs trafficking and organized crime as drivers of this
   violence, the study also examines its effects on the Mexican state. The
   final section of the text looks at the humanitarian tragedy that emerged
   from this legacy together with its domestic and international
   repercussions, before evaluating the various consequences for Mexico.},

Abstract = {Scholars of public opinion and foreign policy recognize that the general
   public is poorly informed about international affairs, but they disagree
   about whether and how this fact affects the policies that it will
   support. Some argue that the lack of information has little effect, at
   least in the aggregate, while others hold that political information
   mediates attention to elite cues. We investigate a third line of
   argument in which political information has a direct effect on the
   policy options individuals support. Low levels of political information
   give rise to a pattern of complacency toward likely international
   threats in times of relative peace and a contrasting tendency to support
   violent and aggressive policy options during war or acute crises. We
   test this argument using survey data from two relevant historical
   settings: the American entry into World War II and the response to the
   9/11 terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {In the difficult process of ending civil wars, granting amnesty during
   conflict is seen as a useful option, with an underpinning assumption
   that trading justice for peace is effective. However, is the case? This
   article tries to bring some clarity to when and how amnesty given during
   conflict has an impact. Amnesty should have different effects on diverse
   conflict endings: negotiated settlement, rebel victory, government
   victory, or conflict reduction. The article also disaggregates amnesties
   to test direct impacts as an incentive or through reducing the
   commitment problem, and indirect effects that give military advantage to
   the government. Using a cross-national data set of amnesties in dyadic
   conflicts from 1975 to 2011, the research finds that amnesty's strongest
   effect is, surprisingly, not as an incentive but rather to reduce
   commitment problems. It can lead to negotiated settlements but also to
   government military advantage. The results have implications for
   negotiations and conflict resolution.},

Abstract = {International research collaboration (IRC) is associated with both
   positive and negative effects on the performance of research in emerging
   economies. While some authors claim that North-South collaborations
   improve scientific quality and visibility for Southern countries, others
   claim that it may entail the reorientation of research to comply with
   Northern agendas. South-South collaborations are thought to increase the
   focus on local affairs, therefore leading to a relatively small number
   of scientific international publications appearing in ``high quality{''}
   journals. Research on the impact of IRC beyond publications in
   international journals has been neglected despite the importance of
   other products in knowledge creation. This research uses a broad range
   of scientific outputs to empirically assess such assumptions and explore
   the outcomes of IRC in Colombia. Results from multivariate regressions
   and nonparametric analyses show that, contrary to common assumptions,
   Colombian research teams collaborating with partners from the global
   South report higher scientific production, while those collaborating
   with Northern countries seem to contribute to local knowledge the most.},

Abstract = {This article answers the question how the situation of incorporation of
   Central Pomerania, formerly a German region, into Poland in 1945
   affected the formation of its commemorative landscape. The author
   discusses how it had affected the erection of new monuments after 1945,
   and if the example of German Great War memorials, erected here after
   1918, had an influence on new Polish commemorative practices. A
   ``competition of memories{''} is used here as the analytical tool. It is
   understood as a phenomenon that occurs in areas where two cultures are
   superimposed on one another, so primary commemorations are copied,
   employing the structures of the existing memorials, to produce secondary
   commemorations. Through the analysis of the archival and fieldwork
   materials, the author examines the social practices of memory. The case
   studies are memorials recycled for commemorations connected to the
   Pomeranian Line and mythology of ``recovery,{''} legitimising the
   incorporation of Central Pomerania into Poland.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the role of resources in LGBT activism in Russia.
   Russian LGBT activism emerged and developed after the fall of the Soviet
   Union with activists engaging in various activities such as organisation
   of cultural festivals, publication of press, litigation, and
   organisation of street events. However, the state's pressure and
   negative public attitudes that intensified in the country in recent
   years make the work of LGBT activists increasingly complicated. The
   paper analyses Russian LGBT activism through a prism of social movement
   theories to examine resources available to Russian LGBT activists.},

Abstract = {Leaders matter in international politics. One of the main tools for
   assessing at-a-distance psychological characteristics of political
   leaders is Leadership Trait Analysis. To facilitate empirical studies, a
   Leadership Trait Analysis coding scheme for automated text analysis was
   developed to replace hand-coding. However, the coding scheme has been
   available only for English-language texts. To broaden research
   opportunities, this article presents a novel Leadership Trait Analysis
   coding scheme for the German language. This coding scheme allows
   engaging in empirical analysis based on original German language
   sources, thereby shedding new or different light on German foreign
   policy. At the same time, it contributes to moving automated content
   analysis beyond the English language more generally.},

Abstract = {Social egalitarians have charged distributive egalitarianism with
   abandoning the victims of option luck, disrespecting victims of brute
   luck and misunderstanding the aim of egalitarian justice. Social
   egalitarians have tended to favour a conception of equality that is
   concerned with ending oppression and expressing equal respect for
   everyone. In this article, I argue that what has so far been missing
   from this debate is the fundamental connection that exists between
   distributive egalitarianism and a conception of exploitation. Once this
   connection is understood, we can see that social egalitarians are unfair
   in their criticisms. Importantly, the connection to exploitation reveals
   that social egalitarianism and distributive egalitarianism are not rival
   positions. When it comes to exploitation, the two positions are able to
   coordinate and identify two core wrong-making features that form part of
   an exploitative interaction.},

Abstract = {The negotiations that precede the adoption of EU interinstitutional
   agreements present relevant opportunities for political entrepreneurs to
   politicise the interinstitutional dialogue. This study asks when and how
   does the European Commission politicise the negotiations of EU
   interinstitutional agreements? Building on a classic model explaining
   the politicisation of EU at domestic level, the study argues that the
   Commission has incentives to politicise negotiations when these revolve
   around substantive agreements that propose relevant change, when it
   anticipates autonomy or power losses and opposition on behalf of
   negotiations counterparts. Politicisation is used as a tool for
   re-legitimisation with a view to strengthening the power to shape
   negotiation outcomes. Stakeholder consultations and issue framing are
   instruments used to deploy classic politicisation strategies of
   expanding publicity, the universe of actors and controversy. The study
   shows how the Commission politicised the negotiations of two most recent
   agreements on a mandatory Transparency Register and Better Law-making.},

Abstract = {Today, pressing security problems result from fragile statehood, and
   thus state-building has become a core responsibility of the
   international community. Ideally, such an intervention provides a
   short-cut to consolidated statehood; however, de facto, it has often
   failed. Countless studies have analyzed mechanisms accounting for the
   success or failure of state-building, but no clear picture has yet
   emerged. Strikingly, the debate widely disregards the historical records
   of state formation, even though these interventions aim for similar
   results. Bringing a classical state formation perspective back in, this
   paper bridges the state-building/state formation divide in research and
   asks the question: how do successful processes of state formation
   develop and what do they tell us about state-building operations? I
   analyze two cases of successful endogenous state formation in a
   non-Western post-conflict context. Scholarly work explaining the
   development of statehood distinguishes two broad groups of arguments:
   bellicose and cooperative theories. I demonstrate that state formation
   in Eritrea resulted from imperatives of warfare, while the state in
   Somaliland is owed to an elite coalition. I argue that there is little
   scope to steer and advance such state formation trajectories by liberal
   interventionist state-building. The logic of these operations conflicts
   with the internal dynamics of the two pathways. However, less intrusive
   intervention might facilitate domestic coalitions.},

Abstract = {How can we understand consistent public support and trust of the
   military even in climates of high rates of public awareness about
   military sexual violence? This article examines how the phenomenon of
   military sexual violence is mediated to the public through a media
   content and discourse analysis of newspaper reportage about military
   sexual violence in Australia. The analysis covers an almost thirty-year
   period (1989-2016) during which several ``sex scandals,{''} some of
   international import, broke out. We analyze several frames used to
   depict the issue and conclude that military sex scandals, like other
   illicit military behaviors, tend to be publicly framed either as (1) a
   rarity that is atypical of the institution ({''}bad apples{''}) or (2)
   inevitable and so typical of the institution as to be unremarkable. The
   article then seeks to demonstrate that these seemingly disparate frames
   are not contradictory, but rather unify into a singular narrative. The
   narrative cohering these disparate frames is that military sexual
   violence is a phenomenon that cannot be prevented or addressed and is
   therefore unproblematic for the institution.},

   public management that may be caused by the technological developments
   that characterize this exponential era (ICT, big data, AI, robotics and
   their applications). The work focuses on emerging countries and their
   relative weakness to mitigate the negative impacts of these changes and
   to take advantage of innovation, presenting several ideas and
   recommendations on how to promote awareness and start a systematic
   reflection on the subject. The paper examines: 1) the social and
   economic impacts of technological innovations that characterize the
   current exponential era; 2) the deepening of disparities between the
   advanced countries leading these changes and the emergent countries that
   show little concern about their impact; and 3) the ethical and cultural
   considerations that must be solved as a result of technological
   developments.},

Title = {Positive Peace, Paradox, and Contested Liberalisms},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {122-139},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This essay revisits Johan Galtung's early articulation of the concept of
   ``positive peace{''} in order to re-surface its fundamental radicalism,
   together with some of its inherent tensions, paradoxes, and politics. It
   then explores the linkages and contested relationship between the
   concept of positive peace and the prevailing peacebuilding paradigm of
   our day: liberal peacebuilding. I argue that our understanding of
   debates about both positive peace and liberal peacebuilding can be
   clarified when viewed through the lens of contested liberalisms and
   conflicting liberal values. Such debates often appear to reflect more of
   a political and ideological debate within the larger liberal tradition
   itself and between competing liberal values than some kind of choice
   between liberal, illiberal, or ``postliberal{''} peacebuilding.
   Advancing peace theory and praxis at this stage would benefit from an
   increasing willingness to more openly confront some of these choices and
   a greater degree of transparency about our liberal commitments,
   including in the hard, ``real world{''} cases where tensions seem
   irreconcilable.},

Abstract = {Ideology is a central construct in political psychology. Even so, the
   field's strong claims about an ideological public rarely engage evidence
   of enormous individual differences: a minority with real ideological
   coherence and weak to nonexistent political belief organization for
   everyone else. Here, I bridge disciplinary gaps by showing the limits of
   mass political ideology with several popular measures and
   components-self-identification, core political values (egalitarian and
   traditionalism's resistance to change), and policy indices-in
   representative U.S. surveys across four decades (Ns similar to 13 k-37
   k), plus panel data testing stability. Results show polar, coherent,
   stable, and potent ideological orientations only among the most
   knowledgeable 20-30\% of citizens. That heterogeneity means full-sample
   tests overstate ideology for most people but understate it for
   knowledgeable citizens. Whether through top-down opinion leadership or
   bottom-up ideological reasoning, organized political belief systems
   require political attention and understanding to form. Finally, I show
   that convenience samples make trouble for ideology generalizations. I
   conclude by proposing analytic best practices to help avoid overclaiming
   ideology in the public. Taken together, what first looks like strong and
   broad ideology is actually ideological innocence for most and meaningful
   ideology for a few.},

Abstract = {In an era where digital data is becoming an increasingly important
   element in the production of knowledge, wealth, and power, it takes
   radical solutions to ensure that digital data is not used to merely
   increase power and profits for the privileged. As the contributions to
   this Special Issue show, it also takes new regulatory approaches,
   institutions, and research fields to ensure that the political economy
   of digital data contributes to justice and wellbeing of people and
   societies. Rather than merely analysing the shortcomings of the current
   situation, we need visions and instruments to build new institutions:
   institutions in and through which human expertise, experience, and
   interaction are seen as equally important as high-tech precision; where
   new norms and policy instruments ensure that the benefits of data use
   accrue for society at large, and in particular for the marginalised and
   vulnerable; and where the datafication of the bodies, lives, and
   practices of people who have no realistic chance to opt out is
   recognised and condemned for what it is: robotic brutality (Mick
   Chisnall).},

Abstract = {The literature on economic statecraft has long focused on the
   effectiveness of foreign aid and trade as tools of inducement. However,
   existing scholarship largely neglects the role played by government
   procurement. By choosing to purchase goods or hire labor in foreign
   states, governments can provide economic benefits for strategic ends.
   The United States in particular leverages its defense procurement as a
   foreign policy tool. We introduce a new data set of US government
   procurement using information on all contracts executed overseas from
   2000 to 2015. We develop a typology of how states use procurement to
   achieve foreign policy goals-power projection, counterinsurgency, and
   development-and provide descriptive statistics to explore variation in
   spending across countries and over time. We illustrate the power of the
   contract data by using it to code US military access in Africa, assess
   the relationship between spending and economic growth, and test whether
   economic inducements can buy influence.},

Abstract = {The Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25), launched by former Greek
   Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, seeks to construct a transnational
   left political project to `democratise Europe'. Its construction of a
   European `people' against an international elite raises questions about
   the potentials of populism beyond the nation-state. Building on a
   discourse-theoretical distinction between populism and nationalism, the
   article asks whether DiEM25 is a truly transnational populist movement.
   Through an analysis of the movement's manifestoes, speeches, press
   releases and published interviews with DiEM25 leaders, the article shows
   how DiEM25 constructs a `European people' in opposition to an
   international `elite', how DiEM25 oscillates between speaking for
   national `peoples' and a transnational `people', and how it negotiates
   its populism, nationalism and transnationalism. The article contributes
   to the theorisation of populism beyond the usually assumed nation-state
   level and shines a light on the potentials and limitations of
   transnational populism as an as-yet understudied political development.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the growing literature regarding humor in
   international politics, focusing on satirical and comedic narratives in
   the recruitment videos of the British and Swedish armed forces. Although
   these official recruitment videos - published on each militaries'
   respective YouTube channel - are, perhaps surprisingly, often funny and
   entertaining, there is little research on the roles, functions and
   employment of humour by actors involved in international affairs. We
   argue that the methodological apparatus provided by narrative analysis
   can provide valuable insight, and is a helpful tool for analyzing
   humourous audio-visual content. We show that the use of humour by the
   armed forces functions both to camouflage and to insulate,
   simultaneously obscuring and supporting a process of militarization of
   everyday life whilst making criticism of the videos' political messages
   more difficult.},

Abstract = {Grievance is a prominent feature of mobilization for radical political
   change. Existing scholarship, however, does not pay sufficient attention
   to the temporal texture of grievance narratives. Temporally ``flat{''}
   narratives of grievance are ill equipped to provide either the cognitive
   or emotional stimulus for major political reorientation. In response to
   this issue, the article develops the concept of collective exhaustion
   master frames. These are frames that narrate the aggrieved community's
   arrival to a threshold of collective impatience. Such narratives have
   two functions-to legitimize radical departures from prevailing political
   habits (a cognitive task) and to stimulate collective impatience with
   the political status quo (an emotional management task). In addition to
   developing the concept of exhaustion frames, the article demonstrates
   its empirical relevance by outlining five distinctive framing episodes,
   starting with the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The conclusion
   outlines the future directions for the study of collective impatience
   and points to the range of implications for political psychology and
   adjacent disciplines.},

Title = {New Institutionalist Leadership - how the new European Council-dominated
   crisis governance paradoxically strengthened the role of EU institutions},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact that the rise of a new, European
   Council-dominated Union has had for role of EU institutions in the most
   important issues of the past decade. Building on rational
   institutionalist theories of leadership, we first develop a New
   Institutionalist Leadership model that helps us understand the political
   leadership tasks performed by the European Council and the instrumental
   leadership tasks that are informally delegated to EU institutions, who
   then deliver them in the `the machine room' where broad political
   guidelines are translated into actual binding reforms. The article then
   traces the empirical evolution of New Institutionalist Leadership in two
   parallel processes: dealing with concrete reforms such as the Fiscal
   Compact, and in managing the longer-term reform agenda in what became
   termed the Leaders' Agenda. Our findings point to the need for EU
   scholars to pay closer attention to what is going on beneath the
   headline-dominating activities of the European Council.},

Title = {Participation, ambition and compliance: can the Paris Agreement solve
   the effectiveness trilemma?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {761-780},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {An effective climate agreement should simultaneously foster broad
   participation, high ambition, and sufficient compliance: this is the
   `effectiveness trilemma'. While the Paris Agreement has been acclaimed
   for spurring universal participation, its mitigation mechanism - an
   unenforced bottom-up framework of voluntary pledges - has been
   criticized for lacking ambition and incentivizing free riding. Does the
   Paris Agreement come with effectiveness trade-offs? How ambitious is the
   Agreement, and how likely is it that countries will comply with it?
   Using an effectiveness formula to assess ambition, I find that the Paris
   Agreement constitutes an important improvement compared to
   business-as-usual. Further, based on evidence from interviews with 21
   climate negotiators and observers, the compliance prospects of the
   Agreement are evaluated as moderately positive. I conclude that the
   Agreement has the potential to overcome the effectiveness trilemma, and
   outline policy measures for achieving that objective.},

Title = {From neurotic citizen to hysteric security expert: a Lacanian reading of
   the perpetual demand for US cyber defence},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-58},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Within the emerging body of critical security research on expertise,
   most contributions have focused on reconstructing the risk governance
   regime that the expert professionals embody, including the anxious,
   neurotic subject that expert security practices reproduce. Through
   French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan's Hysteric Discourse, the article
   advances the study of the neurotic subject to include the security
   policy expert. By introducing and applying a `hysteric reading strategy'
   to the processes through which US cyber defence experts identify as
   policy experts, the article suggests that the constantly changing
   demands for policy change produced by these experts suggest a desire not
   simply for new policies that promise cyber defence but for desire
   itself. From this, the article argues that these experts occupy a social
   position in which desire is perpetually sliding from one object to the
   next, always placing cyber defence out of reach, and hence, reproducing
   `cyber' as an insecurity in the present. The article sees this dynamic
   play out both in the evolving cache of policy recommendations on cyber
   deterrence produced by the cyber policy experts, and in the revolving
   doors between government and this expert community.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of emotion ability to illuminate the
   process whereby institutional meetings become an arena for testing,
   evoking, and regulating emotions that are deemed necessary to meet
   institutional goals. It focuses on the relationships and practices that
   are collaboratively constructed by welfare workers and clients when they
   interact within the context of institutional meetings. Based on an
   interactional analysis of a multi-party meeting, this article
   demonstrates the ways in which clients' ability to read, interpret, and
   follow specific feeling rules becomes the focal point of attention.
   Using video recordings, we illustrate that this process is highly
   collaborative, and it involves both language and body. The ability to
   act in accordance with the expected and required `right feelings'
   emergent in the institutional encounter is, thus, a result of highly
   interactive processes. We discuss the concept of emotion ability as a
   concrete micro-level mechanism through, which practices of affective
   citizenship are realized in the context of institutional interactions.},

Abstract = {Well-being happens, or doesn't happen, in a social-political setting.
   This chapter identifies the main principles and priorities of political
   settings of well-being in Europe. After a discussion of the dominant
   political theories found in this region, the central principles of the
   European Union Constitutional Treaty and Convention on Human Rights are
   identified. Next, an examination of a selection of country
   constitutions, along with ``Beyond GDP{''} national well-being
   initiatives, demonstrates the core values of political conceptions of
   the good across Northern, Southern, Western and Central-Eastern Europe.
   Finally, evidence from the World Values Survey reveals the mass
   priorities of a selection of countries across these different regions.
   The features of European political conceptions of the good can be
   described as broadly liberal, with a particular emphasis on the social
   conditions of well-being.},

Abstract = {Brazil has long strived for greater status and a stronger role in
   international politics, but its actual standing depends on the
   recognition it gets from outside. This paper analyses the perceptions of
   the status of Brazil from the perspective of the UK. It contributes both
   to the study of status in IR (by using a qualitative method with focus
   on perceptions and inter-subjectivity) and to the study of the status of
   Brazil (by analysing external perceptions about its standing in the
   global hierarchy). Based on interviews with British diplomats who served
   in Brazil, it shows that the UK believes the country misperceives its
   own place in the world and appears to remain ``on the fence{''} in
   global affairs.},

Abstract = {Do peacekeepers protect civilians in civil conflict? Securing civilian
   safety is a key objective of contemporary peacekeeping missions, yet
   whether these efforts actually make a difference on the ground is widely
   debated in large part because of intractable endogeneity concerns and
   selection bias. To overcome these issues, we use an instrumental
   variables design, leveraging exogenous variation in the rotation of
   African members of the United Nations Security Council and looking at
   its effects on African civil wars. We show that states that wield more
   power send more peacekeepers to their preferred locations, and that
   these peacekeepers in turn help to protect civilians. We thus
   demonstrate the robustness of many existing results to a plausible
   identification strategy and present a method that can also be applied to
   other diverse settings in international relations.},

Abstract = {This chapter will examine the June 1967 Six-Day War, which, in imparting
   a damaging blow to ``Arab pride,{''} was one of the delayed causes, but
   still the key cause, of the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. Thus, the
   latter war can be seen as a rebound result of the earlier war. After the
   vast number of casualties in the War of Attrition and several failed
   peace initiatives, which worked as positive feedback that increased
   Egypt's humiliation instead of decreasing it, Sadat sent his troops to
   storm the 1967 ceasefire lines with Israel in hope of achieving
   self-respect. The launching of the October 1973 Yom Kippur War was
   therefore an example of a rebound result, from an Israeli
   perspective.(1)},
