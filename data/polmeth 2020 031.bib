Abstract = {The U.S. electric power sector has experienced a substantial shift of
   the generation mix since the turn of the century, moving from heavy
   reliance on coal-powered generation to one drawing more from natural gas
   and, more recently, renewables. This transition has been forged by a mix
   of macroeconomic factors (recession and recovery); technological
   breakthroughs (horizontal drilling coupled with hydraulic fracturing;
   improvements in natural gas plant efficiency); clean energy policies at
   federal, state, and local levels of government; and private sector
   demands for carbon-free energy sources. These factors have combined to
   reduce carbon emissions from electric power generation substantially
   this century. In this article we examine the extent of this transition,
   its causes, as well as the distinct American institutional factors
   steering it, including energy and environmental federalism, electoral
   politics, and the political economy of clean energy policy enactment and
   resistance.},

Abstract = {Refugee camps and reception and identification centres (RICs) have long
   been imagined as `the best' or `most suitable' places for displaced
   people by states and border management authorities. In contrast,
   informal housing often provided by activist groups, is frequently framed
   as a part of the urban `badlands'. Drawing on research carried out
   between 2015 and 2019 in key spaces in Greece and Serbia along the
   so-called `Balkan Route', this article engages with the concept of the
   `badlands' as a lens through which to consider the different types of
   housing made available for refugees in key urban centres. Following
   Dikec (2007), Neely and Samura (2011), and Shabazz (2015), we examine
   how sites of refugee accommodation are imagined through the lenses of
   place, space and race and how this shapes policy responses. We ask: what
   are the main divergences and variations between formal refugee housing
   and informal sites? Why, given the poor conditions of most refugee
   camps, are they still viewed as the `best' solution to housing? What
   role do policy decisions play in `othering' spaces, places, groups and
   individuals? We examine the spatial effects of multiple policy levels
   and interventions (EU, national, local, grassroots) on refugee
   accommodation.},

Abstract = {While peacekeeping's effects on receiving states have been studied at
   length, its effects on sending states have only begun to be explored.
   This article examines the effects of contributing peacekeepers abroad on
   democracy at home. Recent qualitative research has divergent findings:
   some find peacekeeping contributes to democratization among sending
   states, while others find peacekeeping entrenches illiberal or
   autocratic rule. To adjudicate, we build on recent quantitative work
   focused specifically on the incidence of coups. We ask whether sending
   peacekeepers abroad increases the risk of military intervention in
   politics at home. Drawing on selectorate theory, we expect the effect of
   peacekeeping on coup risk to vary by regime type. Peacekeeping brings
   with it new resources which can be distributed as private goods. In
   autocracies, often developing states where UN peacekeeping remuneration
   exceeds per-soldier costs, deployment produces a windfall for
   militaries. Emboldened by new resources, which can be distributed as
   private goods among the selectorate, and fearing the loss of them in the
   future, they may act to depose the incumbent regime. In contrast,
   peacekeeping will have little effect in developed democracies, which
   have high per-troop costs, comparatively large selectorates, and low
   ex-ante coup risk. Anocracies, which typically have growing
   selectorates, and may face distinctive international pressures to
   democratize, will likely experience reduced coup risk. We test these
   claims with data covering peacekeeping deployments, regime type, and
   coup risk since the end of the Cold War. Our findings confirm our
   theoretical expectations. These findings have implications both for how
   we understand the impact of participation in peacekeeping - particularly
   among those countries that contribute troops disproportionately in the
   post-Cold War era - and for the potential international determinants of
   domestic autocracy.},

Title = {Undermining a Rival Party's Issue Competence through Negative
   Campaigning: Experimental Evidence from the USA, Denmark, and Australia},

Abstract = {Much party communication encourages voters to lower issue-related
   evaluations of rival parties. Yet, studies of such influence are rare.
   Drawing on research on political parties' negative campaigning, this
   article starts to fill this gap. We triangulate evidence from four
   survey experiments across six issues in Denmark, the US, and Australia,
   and show that a party's negative campaigning decreases voters'
   evaluations of the target party's issue-handling competence (i.e. issue
   ownership), but does not backlash on voters' evaluations of the sponsor.
   Such attack on the target party does not have to be tied to a negative
   policy development like the crime rate to undermine the target party's
   competence evaluations. At the same time, a negative policy development
   only undermines a party's evaluations when it is accompanied by a rival
   party's negative campaigning attack. The implications for party
   competition and the mass-elite linkage are important.},

Abstract = {How do rising powers execute normative resistance to shape international
   order? Contrary to the existing literature, I argue that rising powers
   are productive agents of normative change and international
   order-making, through the use of rhetorical adaptation to contest
   pre-existing orders. Rhetorical adaptation is a strategy and set of
   tactics that simultaneously modifies norm content, while reducing
   critiques of obstructionism. To make this argument, this article traces
   China's efforts as a `norm shaper' regarding the responsibility to
   protect through the inception, institutionalization and implementation
   of the norm in the landmark 2011 Libya intervention. China layers
   traditional sovereignty norms under the responsibility to protect,
   focusing and narrowing the emerging norm by fortifying the primacy of
   the state. While I show how China resists co-option into an evolving
   ontological order that challenges traditional sovereignty, the article
   also addresses the unforeseen consequences of China's normative efforts
   that `backfired' to permit the use of the responsibility to protect to
   justify Libyan regime change. More broadly, this article speaks to
   rising powers as agents crafting international order, and the process of
   normative resistance that occurs throughout the norm life cycle. I draw
   from publicly available documents and semi-structured interviews with
   Chinese foreign policy and United Nations elites.},

Abstract = {That the news media should operate as an impartial and responsible
   ``fourth estate{''} in a democracy is a pervasive ideal, but there are
   serious obstacles - economic, organizational and political - to its
   achievement in practice. These obstacles, we argue, may be lower when an
   outlet reports on politics in another country, which is strategically
   allied to its own. And, for this reason, the quality of news coverage of
   that country's politics may be higher in the reporting by foreign media
   outlets than in the reporting by domestic outlets. This article outlines
   the theory behind this conjecture and then examines it empirically
   through a content analysis of media representations of Donald Trump's
   rise in two non-American outlets,The AustralianandThe Guardian. Their
   coverage, our analysis suggests, approximated fourth-estate ideals more
   closely than did the domestic coverage of Trump's rise.},

Abstract = {Tensions between the United States and Iran/Hezbollah have been on the
   rise since 2018 when the U.S. administration withdrew from the 2015
   nuclear deal. These tensions spiked in January 2020 when U.S. strikes
   killed Qassem Soleimani the leader of Iran's IRGC-Quds Force.
   Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that in recent years, Iran and
   Hezbollah have sought to create a sleeper network in the U.S. and
   Western Europe, which could be activated to launch attacks as part of a
   retaliatory attack. This paper assesses Iran and Hezbollah
   pre-operational modus operandi in the West derived from court documents
   and open source reporting of recent arrest of Hezbollah and Iranian
   agents in the US and abroad. It sheds lights on the recruitment,
   training, and placement of these agents and the intricacies of their
   past operations. While it is impossible to predict when, where or how
   Iran/Hezbollah might retaliate as retribution for Soleimani's killing,
   this article argues that there is growing number of indicators and
   warning signs for a possible attack in the U.S. or against U.S.
   interests abroad.},

Abstract = {The geophysical phenomena of climate change impact on the existing
   organization of energy economies and their attendant politics in
   multiple ways-at times magnifying and at other times dampening pressures
   on contemporary energy systems. Climate change has been increasingly
   viewed as a `threat multiplier'. However, the geophysical phenomena of
   climate change are socially and politically mediated by actors with
   uneven power, capacity and divergent interests in order to support
   either incumbent or alternative energy pathways. While climate change
   intensifies and magnifies existing tensions and contradictions in global
   energy politics around the simultaneous pursuit of growth, security and
   sustainability, it does not do so in any straightforward or unmediated
   way. Instead, it gives rise to new concerns in relation to the
   imperatives of de-carbonization and increasing the resilience of energy
   systems. Understanding the impact of climate change on energy systems
   requires taking seriously the necessary role of energy within the global
   political economy and the relationship between fossil fuels and
   capitalism. It must be analysed both directly through climate change's
   impacts, and indirectly through the uses of political narratives about
   climate change to sometimes unsettle, and sometimes reinforce,
   particular energy pathways.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the demographics, criminality, and network relations
   of forty-one deceased Swedish foreign fighters. Our results show that
   most of the deceased Swedish foreign fighters were on average just under
   26 years old when they died. Concerning network relations, nineteen out
   of the forty-one foreign fighters had at least one relationship
   (next-of-kin or friend) with another deceased foreign fighter. Two
   thirds were previously suspected of at least one crime. Based on our
   results, we argue that more attention needs to be given to tertiary and
   secondary prevention directed toward foreign fighter hubs.},

Abstract = {Digital cameras are everywhere and play important roles in security and
   political scenes, yet they remain overlooked in security and IR research
   where debates on technology and visuality remain separated, often giving
   the mistaken impression that the digital images that populate
   scholarship are primarily visual. In this paper, I understand the
   digital camera as an inscription device that produces digital images,
   for which the digital qualities are as important as the visual. Through
   producing standardised digital `factlets', digital cameras become
   engines of ontological change that reconfigure political scenes,
   incorporating new actors and logics, and reconfiguring the ones already
   present. Digital cameras acquire security agency through our remarkable
   trust in digital cameras' ability to capture reality as it is and store
   it in standardised files. The epistemic authority is not absolute, I
   show, but functions as a competence that can be exchanged, shared, and
   reconfigured. Digital cameras are promiscuous, forming hybrids with,
   e.g. images, digital media platforms, image appropriators, and camera
   operators. This relationality makes it hard to pin down exactly where
   the agency of digital cameras begins and ends. Viewed as an inscription
   device, the central faculty of the networked digital camera is that it
   inscribes the `reality' of a political scene into fragmented but
   standardised video-bites and snapshots, little security `factlets'
   preconfigured for effectively populating digital networks and databases.},

Abstract = {Loss of biological diversity continues at alarming rates, despite
   valiant UN efforts aided by the international community. The 2010 Target
   for biodiversity has been missed. The Aichi Targets, adopted in 2010,
   may also not be met by their timeline of 2020. The Convention on
   Biological Diversity (CBD) and its partners are now preparing a
   post-2020 global framework for biodiversity, to be adopted in October
   2020, at its 15th Conference of the Parties. The initiative presented
   here is meant to provoke further thought on how to accelerate efforts
   toward stopping biodiversity loss. Ten proposals are briefly introduced
   and discussed, with emphasis on three priority fast track initiatives:
   (1) the creation of as extensive as possible a worldwide protected area
   network; (2) a complete halt to deforestation and the restoration of
   forest ecosystems; and (3) a massive reduction in or (ideally) a halt to
   further environmental pollution. Following a discussion of approaches at
   national, regional and global levels, the proposals are related to a
   generic scenario comprising the biodiversity-related institutional
   landscape and its governance systems and trends in biodiversity and its
   global distribution resulting from the interplay between human impacts,
   conservation efforts and uncertainties about the future course of
   evolution.},

Abstract = {Drawing on data from in-depth interviews with participants in the
   Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, this article argues that the notion of
   human dignity is critical to mass mobilisation at different phases of
   anti-government protests. At the start of mass protests, the affirmation
   of human dignity can serve as a powerful motivation for protest
   participation. With the growing number of protesters, the notion of
   human dignity provides a key criterion for the construction of
   collective identity of protesters and their opponents. Furthermore,
   dignity might be viewed as a guiding principle for a common vision of an
   ideal society.},

Abstract = {The euro crisis has shaken up the euro zone. It pushed the boundaries of
   political conflict, it triggered the most intensive period of
   decision-making so far and ultimately led to a set of institutional
   reforms, which define new domains of euro zone decision-making, such as
   in the case of financial assistance, and assign new roles to different
   political actors. At last, the crisis became the focal point of
   scholarly debate and new research activity, some of which has been
   finalised only more recently. This warrants new debate. In this debate
   section a group of scholars from political science and legal studies,
   who have contributed to the study of euro crisis decisionmaking and euro
   zone development in the context of recent collaborative research
   projects, discuss who leads the euro zone. Most importantly, they debate
   what we can learn from crisis decision-making and euro zone politics in
   recent years more broadly for the question of who leads the euro zone
   today and who may determine its future policy decisions and
   institutional reform trajectory.},

Abstract = {How did the Cold War impact the occurrence and severity of genocide and
   politicide? The Cold War is known to have impacted a number of conflict
   dynamics, yet its influence on genocide and politicide, the most severe
   forms of state-driven anti-civilian violence, remains unexplored. This
   article argues that genocide and politicide have followed a number of
   worldwide trends, like increased democracy and the decreased frequency
   of intrastate conflict, which have had dampening effects on genocide and
   politicide. Probit and ordered probit analyses reveal that genocide and
   politicide occurrence was more frequent during the Cold War, but that
   the effect of the Cold War on severity depends on model specification;
   using 1992 as the first year of the post-Cold War era, genocides and
   politicides are more severe after the end of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the root causes of terrorism by assessing
   the effect of food security on domestic terrorism among developing
   countries. Food security is a fundamental physiological need and
   captures a core well-being outcome. We argue that food insecurity
   creates grievances among citizens and increases demand among them for
   action against the government. Terrorist organisations provide the
   opportunity for citizens to channel their grievances against the
   government by resolving collective action problems and mobilising
   citizens. We demonstrate the link between food insecurity and domestic
   terrorism through quantitative analyses on a sample of 70 developing
   countries from 1980 to 2011. Our findings demonstrate the deleterious
   effects of food insecurity on peace in the developing world.},

Abstract = {The EU Commission regularly consults with external actors when preparing
   policy proposals. This paper investigates possible bias in the voices
   the Commission listens to across all policy areas and consultation
   instruments. We map the full range of consultation instruments used by
   the Commission and analyse variation in group representation across
   types of consultations and policy areas. Our analysis draws on a dataset
   of more than 350 major Commission proposals between 2011 and 2016. We
   find that the Commission has established a consultation regime with the
   widespread use of standard consultation instruments, including open
   online consultations, stakeholder conferences and consultation in closed
   fora. The range of consulted actors depends on both consultation
   instruments and policy types. Open online-consultations are most
   inclusive. Our findings indicate that the Commission may be able to
   counteract the influence of business by selecting the most appropriate
   format for consultation.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov, COVID) in Wuhan,
   China, in December 2019 quickly escalated into a global health
   emergency. This study seeks to investigate the attitudinal and
   behavioral patterns of university students in Wuhan, the epicenter.
   Conducted in late January 2020, an online survey collected data from
   more than 8000 students of four elite national universities located in
   Wuhan. The students sampled included both Wuhan natives and non-locals
   who returned home in the early stages of the outbreak. The study notes
   widespread psychological stress among students but positive behavioral
   compliance with personal hygiene practices. Official announcements were
   the chief source of information for the respondents, who also
   demonstrated high demand for transparency of information disclosure.
   Some aggressive anti-epidemic measures infringing citizens' legitimate
   rights were found at the local level. The respondents offered varying
   evaluations of the performance of central government, local governments,
   civil society, and the health system in this public health crisis. The
   article concludes with policy implications and caveats.},

Abstract = {Two prominent relational egalitarians, Elizabeth Anderson and Niko
   Kolodny, object to giving people in a democratic community differential
   voting weights on the grounds that doing so would lead to unequal
   relations between them. Their claim is that deviating from a
   ``one-person, one-vote{''} scheme is incompatible with realizing
   relational egalitarian justice. In this article, I argue that they are
   wrong. I do so by showing that people can relate as moral, epistemic,
   social, and empirical equals in a scheme with differential voting
   weights. I end the article by showing that from the perspective of
   relational egalitarianism, it is sometimes true that differential voting
   weights are more just than equal voting weights.},

Abstract = {During the long nineteenth century, Poland was divided among the
   Russian, Habsburg, and Prussian empires. The partition produced regional
   diversity in political culture and in institutional and economic
   development. We examine how the cultural legacies of the empires have
   influenced the propensity of Poles to cast a ballot in parliamentary
   elections since 1989. Polish National Election Study individual-level
   data are used to assess whether higher levels of electoral turnout in
   Galicia are indeed a legacy of the Habsburg rule. Our results confirm
   that, even after controlling for socio-demographic factors, there is a
   positive, substantive, and significant effect on turnout of living in
   the ex-Habsburg part of Poland. This effect can be explained by the
   frequency of religious service attendance and by ideology. Inhabitants
   of Galicia not only attend religious services more frequently and are
   more conservative than their counterparts in the rest of Poland, but
   also the more frequently they attend church and the closer to the
   radical right they place themselves, the more mobilized they are to
   vote. The impact of the legacies of the empires on political behavior in
   Poland seems persistent.},

Abstract = {There is much literature on the Europeanization of social movements, yet
   work tends not to theorize the influence of Economic and Monetary Union
   (EMU) upon social movements. I examine the extent to which EU-imposed
   austerity in Southern Europe inspired European protests among German,
   Spanish and French trade unions. On the basis of an analytic framework
   which distinguishes between (i) Europeanization and (ii) continuing
   attachment to national institutions, I contend that degrees of
   Europeanization are contingent upon position within EMU. Unions in weak
   positions have incentives to undertake Europeanization, as in the case
   of Spain, whilst unions within strong positions have less incentive to
   undertake Europeanization, as in the case of Germany.},

Abstract = {Deliberative exercises may reinvigorate civic life by building citizens'
   capacity to engage in other types of civic activities. This study
   examines members of a citizens' panel (n=56) who participated in a 6-day
   deliberative event on climate change and energy transition in Edmonton,
   Alberta (Canada), in 2012. We compared panellists' civic engagement,
   political interest, and political knowledge with those of the general
   population using a concurrent random digit dialling survey conducted
   2.5years after the event (n=405). Panellists are more likely to talk
   about politics, and volunteer in the community compared to their
   counterparts in the larger population. Examining three points in time,
   we reveal a trajectory of increasing political knowledge and civic
   engagement. Finally, we examine the mechanisms that mobilize panellists
   into greater civic engagement. This study illustrates how deliberative
   events could strengthen engagement in civic and political life,
   depending on the degree to which deliberation was perceived to have
   occurred.},

Abstract = {This contribution asks whether and why the newly political environment
   of EU law-making impacts on the European Commission's choice (not) to
   announce the withdrawal of legislative proposals. We argue that the
   Commission uses `responsive withdrawal' in response to bottom-up
   pressure, so as to signal self-restraint or policy-determination to
   different audiences. Bottom-up pressures are driven by (1) the national
   contestation of `Europe'; (2) visible controversy about optimal (crisis)
   governance; and (3) the domestic salience of EU legislation. Our
   hypotheses are tested on a new dataset of all codecision files
   concluded, withdrawn, rejected or ongoing between 2006 and 2018. We show
   that the Commission reacts to bottom-up pressure by either politicising
   or depoliticising the EU's legislative agenda: `withdrawal
   announcements' are more likely when Euroscepticism is high and when
   legislation touches core state powers, but less likely when legislation
   is domestically salient. We also demonstrate the continued importance of
   cyclical and technical reasons. Our analysis complements extant
   explanations of withdrawal as the upshot of functional factors or of
   uncertainty, and contributes to the nascent debate about whether, why
   and how supranational actors respond when the systems in which they
   operate - and the policies they produce - come under attack.},

Abstract = {Both academicians and practitioners have advocated for increased fiscal
   transparency in government as a means of promoting budget discipline,
   improving functioning of the public sector, fostering greater
   accountability, and fighting the global menace of corruption. Despite
   worldwide calls for greater disclosure, empirical analyses of whether
   and how fiscal transparency actually affects governance outcomes are
   still limited. This study draws on public choice and principal-agent
   theories to demonstrate how public disclosure of budgetary information
   helps deter government corruption. The data from 95 countries over the
   period 2006-14 provide evidence that more fiscally transparent countries
   are perceived as less corrupt. We also find that fiscal transparency
   matters most at the final stages of the budget process when information
   disclosure reflects actual government spending. Data also confirm that a
   Citizens Budget can serve as a strong anti-corruption tool.},

Title = {Features of foreign policy birds: Israeli prime ministers as hawks and

Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},

Pages = {107-126},

Abstract = {Scholars and policymakers have long used the shorthand of hawks and
   doves to characterize leader personalities that correspond to a
   particular political inclination, whereby hawks are considered
   right-wing and more aggressive in foreign policy, and doves are
   left-wing and more peaceful. This article posits that a sound discussion
   of who hawks and doves in foreign policy are requires an engagement with
   research on political leadership. It promises a less superficial
   understanding of the dichotomy of hawks and doves, and uses leadership
   trait analysis to explore hawkish and dovish leaders' qualities. The
   article profiles Israel's prime ministers since the end of the Cold War,
   where in a high security environment, these words are most often used to
   describe its domestic and foreign matters and its cooperative and
   conflictual actions. This article's findings encourage an unpacking of
   these commonly used shorthand labels with political leadership
   approaches. They are also useful to highlight, most notably, the
   significance of complexity and distrust in understanding hawkish and
   dovish leaders. Hawks think simpler and are more doubtful of others than
   doves, this article finds. Future research, the article suggests, will
   benefit from looking deeper than simple, dichotomous use of this
   analogy, and exploring ways to operationalize individual-level
   measurements of hawks and doves in foreign policy.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-82},

Abstract = {Normativity matters in international politics, but IR scholarship will
   benefit from de-reifying `norms' as units into a relational,
   configurational alternative. The alternative I propose here is the
   `normative configuration': an arrangement of ongoing, interacting
   practices establishing action-specific regulation, value-orientation,
   and avenues of contestation. This responds to recent constructivist
   scholarship, particularly from relational sociology and practice theory,
   that implies the need for ontological and analytical alternatives to
   `norms' as central concepts responsible for establishing rules,
   institutions, and values in social life. I offer a way of
   conceptualizing and analyzing normativity consistent with these
   alternative approaches. Namely, I have brought together a pragmatist
   theory of action with the social theories of a number of key relational
   social theorists and philosophers, oriented around a reading of what
   norms-talk actually does for social enquiry. I then outline a three
   stage process - de-reification, attributing agency, and tracing
   transactions - that allows scholars to study transformations in
   normative configurations. Finally, I discuss what this contributes to
   the recent turns toward practices and relations, as the latest direction
   in constructivist scholarship within the discipline.},

Title = {The Study of Leaders in Nuclear Proliferation and How to Reinvigorate It},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {For both nuclear proliferation and nuclear weapons restraint, the
   individual characteristics of political leaders-their beliefs,
   experiences, and identities-frequently play an important role. And yet,
   theories of proliferation have so far paid insufficient attention to the
   influence of leaders, focusing instead on international and domestic
   structures that allegedly determine states' nuclear choices. This
   article makes two contributions. First, by showing that important cases
   of both nuclear weapons pursuit and nuclear reversal cannot be fully
   understood when neglecting the role of the involved leaders, the article
   makes a systematic case for an increased analytical emphasis on
   political leaders in theories of proliferation. Second, the article
   offers practical advice for scholars seeking to develop proliferation
   theories that take leader characteristics into account. Specifically, it
   shows how scholars can preempt endogeneity concerns. Moreover, the
   article details how changing the dependent variable-from state behavior
   to leader attitude-could help scholars overcome the aggregation problem
   in the study of proliferation dynamics.},

Abstract = {How much do Italian interest groups undertake their advocacy/lobbying
   activities at the EU level? How often have groups gained access to
   different EU level institutions? This paper presents an original
   conceptualisation for the concept of `interest group Europeanisation',
   which takes into account both the percentage of EU lobbying and access
   to EU institutions, and assesses the role of national centrality (i.e.
   access to national institutional venues and self-perceived influence in
   national policy-making) in determining whether there is more or less
   interest group Europeanisation. Original data from a national survey
   conducted on around 500 Italian interest groups are provided. Groups
   that are at the core of the national interest system are less likely to
   undertake a large part of their lobbying activities at the EU level, but
   more likely to gain EU access.},

Abstract = {Why do some political radicals-people who believe in using violence for
   political ends and who may sympathize with local violent groups-not
   themselves perform violent acts or join violent organizations? This
   article finds that prior research on terrorism, insurgency, civil war,
   and ethnic conflict seems to do a poor job of predicting who upon
   adopting radical political views will actually engage in violence. In
   fact, there is a great deal of contingency involved in the choice of
   whether or not to become violent. Employing path dependence, the article
   treats the radicalizing moment as a ``critical juncture,{''} filled with
   contingency, but after which actions become more predictable: during
   this small window of time, radicalized individuals might happen to
   choose a profession and/or join an organization that is nonviolent, but
   subsequently become institutionalized as nonviolent actors. The article
   therefore offers an explanation for how individuals with radical beliefs
   can be institutionalized as either violent or nonviolent. The study's
   findings are based on a content analysis of interviews with 129
   nonviolent activists, most of whom exhibited radical beliefs at the time
   of the interview, and former violent actors, in 12 countries
   experiencing violent internal conflict.},

Abstract = {Europe has experienced both marked growth in public support for far
   right parties and growth in public Euro-skepticism. While far right
   parties have become associated with particularly strident negative
   orientations towards the European Union (EU), there is considerable
   variation in the extent of their antipathy, and, in the extent to which
   they emphasize the EU. Here we examine the conditions under which far
   right parties can successfully leverage the EU issue to win votes.
   Specifically, we argue that the extent of societal polarization on the
   EU constitutes an important intermediating condition. Our findings
   indicate that individuals are more likely to vote far right when these
   parties contest the EU, but only if they do so in a context of societal
   polarization on the issue.},

Abstract = {This article offers a review of the literature on Jordanian jihadism.
   While excellent work has been done, particularly on the phenomenon's
   history and ideologues such as Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, several topics
   remain unexplored. The main explanation for the literature's
   shortcomings is that it has been too inward-looking. I argue that this
   insularity has led to three problems: first, the literature sometimes
   recycles observations already made; second, it fails to show how Jordan
   presents specificities in terms of jihadism; and third and most
   importantly, it misses insights from the literature on political
   violence about radicalization and terrorist attack activity. As a
   result, it fails to address key questions about Jordanian jihadism, such
   as why, when, and how terrorist attacks happen.},

Abstract = {As political competition is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional in
   Europe, voters often face the challenge of choosing which issues matter
   most to them. The European integration issue presents a particular
   difficulty for voters, since it is not closely aligned to the left-right
   dimension. We test the impact of the EU issue in the first parliamentary
   election following the UK's divisive Brexit referendum. We argue that
   while the EU issue was salient to voters, EU issue voting was inhibited
   by the indistinct and ambiguous positions adopted by the two major
   parties. To examine this, we combine an analysis of British Election
   Study data from the 2017 General Election with a conjoint experiment
   that allows us to present voters with a range of choices on both
   dimensions. Our findings show that the EU dimension has the potential to
   become a cross-cutting dimension that rivals the left-right dimension in
   British electoral politics, but this crucially depends on party
   competition.},

Abstract = {Based on an analysis of around 500 texts from security-affiliated
   Russian academic journals and one newspaper over a ten-year period, this
   article details how conspiratorial ideas are spread, tolerated and
   legitimised within military institutions and official think tanks in
   Russia. Particular conspiracy theories systematically underpin a broader
   conspiratorial worldview, which in its basic orientation is anti-Western
   and illiberal, and which reinforces a perception of Russia as being
   under threat. As such, this phenomenon serves to justify and rationalise
   both Russian foreign policy conduct, as well as the targeted repression
   of various domestic groups as necessary for security reasons. We discuss
   whether the prevalence of conspiratorial ideas merely reflects an
   established worldview popular in certain circles or if it influences
   actual policy and outline some policy implications for the
   interpretation of Russian foreign policy conduct. The prevalence of
   conspiracy theories in renowned publications is a concern in itself
   since it hampers a genuine understanding of international affairs.},

Abstract = {Past research on problem definition and public policy primarily focuses
   on the macro-system level. In this study, we propose a micro model of
   problem definition and policy choice at the individual level. We argue
   that while individual citizens' problem definitions and policy
   preferences are rooted in and filtered through their predisposition
   characteristics (such as socioeconomic status, political orientation,
   and informational base), their policy choices also strongly depend on
   how they define public issues, particularly how they perceive the image
   of an issue at hand and how they associate the issue with other public
   issues. Our empirical analyses, based on data from a national public
   survey on energy and power plant issues, support the key propositions
   derived from our theoretical model. Key contributions to and
   implications for policy studies are discussed in conclusion.},

Abstract = {We test two sets of alternative hypotheses about the demographic
   composition of the U.S. armed forces. We analyse individual-level data
   of two national representative samples covering the period 1979-2008. We
   find that, in contrast to the accepted wisdom, the U.S. military no
   longer primarily recruits individuals from the most disadvantaged
   socio-economic backgrounds. Technological, tactical, operational and
   doctrinal changes have led to a change in the demand for personnel. As a
   result, on different metrics such as family income and family wealth as
   well as cognitive abilities, military personnel are on average like the
   average American citizen or slightly better.},

Abstract = {The world trading system has been remarkably successful in many respects
   but is now under great strain. The causes are deep-seated and require a
   strategic response. The future of the system depends critically on
   reinvigorating the WTO and policy change in the largest trading nations.
   Important measures are required to sustain the multilateral trading
   system, and urgent action is needed to avoid a scenario where the system
   fragments. The worst scenarios will disrupt global trade and see a world
   which splinters into large trading blocs (most likely centered on China,
   the European Union and the United States) and where trade relations are
   based to a large extent on relative power instead of rules. In such a
   world the smallest players - especially those whose trade is least
   covered by bilateral or regional agreements - will be at the greatest
   disadvantage. All countries will incur enormous costs only to try and
   reinvent a system that is already in place today under the WTO.},

Title = {More Royalist Than the King? Immigration Policy Attitudes Among
   Naturalized Citizens},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {607-625},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Social psychological research has analyzed immigration attitudes mostly
   from the perspective of natives without an immigrant background.
   Nevertheless, an increasing number of migrants obtain national
   citizenship and take a stance towards immigration policies. By studying
   immigration policy attitudes reported by naturalized citizens, this
   article develops a dual-pathway model of immigrant political
   incorporation featuring pathways of either absorption or transformation.
   Based on a unique sample of immigrants who just accomplished the
   naturalization procedure (N = 566), we investigate participants'
   preferences for permissive or restrictive immigration policies as a
   function of their naturalization motives and expectations about how
   immigrants should acculturate in the receiving society (i.e.,
   acculturation orientations). Our findings provide evidence for both
   processes of political absorption and transformation. On the one hand,
   belongingness motives underlying naturalization were connected to
   orientations towards host culture adoption, which in turn predicted
   support for restrictive immigration policies. On the other hand,
   instrumental motives were connected to orientations towards heritage
   culture maintenance, which in turn predicted support for permissive
   immigration policies. To conclude, we discuss the social psychological
   dynamics involved in the transition from national outsiders to national
   insiders and highlight the effects of naturalization on power relations
   between national majority and immigrant minority groups.},

Abstract = {To what extent does sexual violence influence rebel group fragmentation?
   A substantial body of research explores wartime rape as a
   cohesion-building mechanism following forced recruitment. However, the
   relationship between sexual violence and broader organizational
   structural integrity has not been systematically tested. Our study on
   the effects of sexual violence on rebel group fragmentation provides
   this test. We argue that sexual violence increases cohesion at the
   battalion level but increases the risk of fragmentation of the broader
   organization because lieutenants are more likely to split from
   organizations if they are confident that their subordinate battalions
   are cohesive and will follow them. We test this argument on a global
   sample of 105 rebel organizations active between 1989 and 2014. The
   results provide robust support for the argument showing sexual violence
   increases the probability of fragmentation by a factor of six. This
   presents a crucial contribution to our understanding of sexual violence
   and rebel group fragmentation.},

Abstract = {Some of the increasingly evident contradictions between spatial planning
   and social policy in Mexico City are apparent in the way land use
   regulation folds into and articulates with exclusion and marginality. In
   downtown areas, regulatory approvals and various planning measures have
   facilitated the escalation of land and housing prices and more
   exclusionary forms of urban development. At the periphery, land use
   regulation now conditions access to urban services, property titles, and
   even some social programs for settlement areas designated as
   ``informal.{''} Comparing the state's role in planning at these distinct
   sites uncovers a pattern of selective and uneven spatial regulation in
   different socioeconomic territories of the city, characterized by
   ``fast-track{''} development approvals in downtown areas and
   ``slow-track{''} regularization of settlements in peripheral areas. The
   analysis suggests how this pattern of uneven spatial regulation
   contributes to (re)producing urban space in ways that call into question
   the local government's stated support for the ``right to the city.{''}
   Las geografias desiguales de la regulacion espacial ponen de manifiesto
   algunas de las contradicciones cada vez mas evidentes entre la
   planificacion espacial y la politica social en la Ciudad de Mexico. En
   las areas del centro, las aprobaciones regulatorias y varias medidas de
   planificacion han facilitado el aumento de los precios de la tierra y la
   vivienda y formas mas excluyentes de desarrollo urbano. En la periferia,
   la regulacion del uso de la tierra ahora condiciona el acceso a
   servicios urbanos, titulos de propiedad e incluso algunos programas
   sociales para areas de asentamiento designadas como ``informales.{''}
   Comparar el papel del estado en la planificacion en estos sitios
   distintos revela un patron de regulacion espacial selectiva y desigual
   en diferentes territorios socioeconomicos de la ciudad, caracterizados
   por aprobaciones ``fast-track{''} de desarrollo en areas del centro y
   regularizacion ``slow-track{''} de asentamientos en areas perifericas.
   El analisis se centra en como la regulacion del uso de la tierra se
   enreda y articula con la exclusion y la marginalidad y como la
   regulacion espacial desigual contribuye a (re) producir espacio urbano
   de manera que cuestione el apoyo declarado del gobierno local por ``el
   derecho a la ciudad.{''}},

Abstract = {There is as yet little consensus in the literature as to the underlying
   drivers of electoral violence. This article identifies a key mechanism
   explaining the use of electoral intimidation, a form of violence, in
   democratizing regimes. Within this context, we argue that the use of
   electoral intimidation against the opposition is most likely to be
   observed when a country moving to democracy has not yet experienced an
   electoral turnover. Building on previous theoretical and empirical
   findings, we provide evidence supporting the idea that alternation in
   power serves as an effective tool to decrease the tensions between
   electoral winners and losers. Furthermore, we show that alternation in
   power is conditional on the performance of electoral management bodies.
   Based on a sample of 331 elections in 53 countries that have inaugurated
   multiparty competition since 1989, we find strong and robust support for
   our theoretical claims. Firstly, we show how alternation in power is
   determined by the degree of autonomy the electoral management body
   adopted as part of the political opening process. Secondly, we provide
   evidence that electoral turnover depresses the use of electoral violence
   after controlling for relevant variables and correcting for selection
   issues.},

Abstract = {While urban policy makers and social scientists both aim to successfully
   address societies' most pressing problems, their interactions are
   frequently strained or even counter-productive. A case study describing
   a collaborative research project on Cost Benefit Analysis shows that
   shifting from a representational perspective on knowledge transfer
   towards a performative understanding of problem structuring highlights
   how differences between research and policymaking can be made conducive
   to learning instead of frustrating it. To this end knowledge development
   is analysed in terms of Translations in institutionally embedded
   knowledge practices. This approach supplements the two-community
   approach by opening up collaborative practices where problem structuring
   and group formation coevolve. Depending on circumstance and design, such
   practices can both reproduce or transform real-world urban problems.
   Furthering academic understanding of these practices can strengthen the
   capacity of cities and universities to successfully address unstructured
   problems.},

   limits to transformation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {29},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {The neoliberal nature of the environmental state prevents a
   transformation to long-term sustainability. Taking the case of Britain,
   I scrutinise the rhetorical invention of the environmental state by
   identifying and analysing the commonplaces that informed political
   arguments for environmental policymaking between 1997-2015. The analysis
   shows that the rhetoric of the British environmental state is grounded
   on neoliberal commonplaces, which entails an understanding of
   environmental problems and solutions that precludes actual
   transformation. Ultimately, neoliberalism functions as a glass ceiling
   to radical environmental transformation; a transformative rhetoric
   informed by commonplaces different to those of neoliberalism is
   paramount to the institution of a counter-hegemonic ecological paradigm.},

Abstract = {Deliberative systems theory suggests that a democratic society works
   well when citizens' experiences and views, as expressed in various forms
   and sites of communication, are connected and taken up by other citizens
   as well as policy-makers. Pluralism, which is not always easily
   reconciled with high-quality deliberation in every instance, is seen as
   instrumental to the realization of democratic values and sound
   decision-making. This perspective raises new methodological challenges,
   such as (1) identifying sites of communication that serve important
   functions in a deliberative system, (2) connecting different sites and
   (3) assessing their impact. Recent scholarship has found that these
   challenges can be fruitfully met by applying interpretive methodology,
   which, like deliberative systems theory, aims to understand social
   interactions on their own terms, and not by measuring their
   correspondence to theoretical ideal-types. However, for theory
   development, as well as to help improve actual deliberative systems,
   researchers also need to make generalizable inferences. This paper
   develops a relational approach that combines interpretive methods with
   structural theory, which allows researchers to assess and explain the
   deficiencies, as well as the opportunities, that citizens experience.
   The principles of relational analysis are illustrated by research on
   citizen deliberation about urban riots.},

Abstract = {Serbia is a transition country that has experienced strong negative
   spillover effects from the global financial crisis and the subsequent
   eurozone debt crisis. At the same time, it is a candidate for accession
   to the European Union. Success in local economic development is likely
   to affect prospects for economic recovery and a successful EU
   integration process and the paper analyses the contribution of fiscal
   decentralisation to successful local economic development. The analysis
   is based upon a cross-section time-series regression model that reveals
   a positive impact of local public expenditure on economic development.
   Expenditure on education has a particularly strong effect on local
   economic development, as does investment per capita from both public and
   private sources. The conclusion of the paper is that local economic
   development has been enhanced by the fiscal decentralisation that has
   taken place in Serbia.},

Abstract = {Radicalization and violent extremism are pressing problems across the
   world. After initially addressing problems in defining radicalization
   and extremism, this article sketches a new social-developmental model
   based on a systematic integration of theories and empirical findings. We
   propose a three-step model of radicalization starting with ontogenetic
   social-developmental processes during the most dynamic period for social
   development, from early childhood to late adolescence. These processes
   include the interaction of societal, social, and individual risk and
   protective factors. In adverse cases this interplay encourages the
   establishment of proximal radicalization processes between early
   adolescence and middle adulthood. We assume that four interrelated bt
   distinct social-developmental processes are central conditions for
   radicalization and extremism: identity problems, prejudice, political or
   religious ideologies, and antisocial attitudes and behavior. These
   proximal processes are triggered by actual societal, social, or
   individual conflicts (such as economic crisis, victimization) and marked
   by continuous intergroup processes. The more intense the proximal
   processes, the greater the likelihood of extremist attitudes and
   behavior. The article closes by discussing implications for early
   prevention and an outlook for further research.},

   Welfare Service: A Preliminary Assessment},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},

Abstract = {Decisions taken by the Norwegian child welfare services have in the past
   decade, in some cases, created strong international reactions. In the
   spring of 2016, over 8,000 people in eleven countries demonstrated in
   connection with a case involving a Norwegian-Romanian family. This
   article examines three issues that have presented significant diplomatic
   challenges to Norway (India 2011, Russia 2014 and Romania 2016). The
   article looks at why the cases triggered such strong reactions and
   explains how the Norwegian authorities handled these cases. It also
   outlines the relevant Norwegian legislation and judicial procedures in
   the field. The paper finds that the three controversial cases assessed
   linked with other strong driving forces or national political issues in
   the country in question. In the material we present, there is also
   evidence of learning and improvement in the way the Norwegian Ministry
   of Foreign Affairs handled these challenges, and there also seems to
   have been improvement in the way the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
   collaborated with other parts of the civil service. At the same time,
   the article questions why a key tool in dealing with these types of
   cases (The 1996 Hague Convention) was ratified so late in Norway.},

Abstract = {In the study of African Politics, the analysis of political ideologies
   as a normative engine of political action seems to have receded in
   favour of a treatment of ideology as the support of actors in their
   pursuit of material interests. Rwanda is not an exception. The ideology
   of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has been predominantly
   analysed as a self-serving strategy geared towards the reinforcement of
   the party's power. Such treatment of ideology prevents a full
   understanding of the RPF. This article argues that ideology should also
   be conceptualized as a matrix that can reshape material incentives and
   through which the RPF's interests have emerged. To do so, the article
   analyses new sources of material, the songs of mobilization from RPF
   members and supporters composed before the Front took power during the
   genocide, to systematically delineate the RPF's early ideology. The
   analysis centres on four main themes-Rwandan national unity, the RPF's
   depiction of itself, its depiction of its enemy, and its relationship
   with the international community-and traces their influence on RPF
   interests in the post-genocide era. It reveals the surprisingly
   long-lasting power of ideas despite fast-changing material
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {Why do repressive states create human rights institutions that cost them
   money and political capital but fail to silence international criticism?
   The academic literature assumes that states engaging in disingenuous
   human rights behavior are hoping to persuade (or deceive) liberal
   Western states and international advocates. But if human rights
   promoters in the West are the target audience for the creation of these
   half measures institutions, the strategy appears puzzlingly
   miscalculated. It reveals that the repressive state is sensitive to
   international opinion, and often results in increased pressure. The
   author argues that states engaging in human rights half measures are
   playing to a different, previously overlooked audience: swing states
   that can act as veto points on multilateral efforts to enforce human
   rights. The article illustrates these dynamics with a case study of Sri
   Lanka's response to international pressure for postwar justice. The
   author shows that although the creation of a series of weak
   investigative commissions was prompted by pressure from Western
   governments and ngos, it was not an attempt to satisfy or hoodwink these
   actors. Instead, it was part of a coalition-blocking strategy to
   convince fellow developing states on the UN Human Rights Council to
   oppose the creation of an international inquiry and to give them the
   political cover to do so.},

Title = {Safeguarding Norwegian Rights around Svalbard: Russian Perceptions and
   Reactions},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-192},
Abstract = {Svalbard and the maritime zone around the Arctic Archipelago are central
   to the bilateral relationship between Norway and Russia, both in terms
   of economic and security concerns. Since 1977, a dispute between the
   countries has concerned Norway's right to assert sovereignty in these
   waters. What are Russian perceptions of Norwegian sovereignty
   enforcement in the Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)? How have perceptions
   and reactions evolved since the turn of the millennium? What changes -
   if any - do we see in connection with the deterioration in the bilateral
   relationship after 2014? And what does this mean for the danger of a
   possible conflict in this area? In summary, we find that 2014 does not
   appear to be a watershed with respect to the relationship between Norway
   and Russia in the FPZ around Svalbard. The change came when Russian
   central authorities after the Elektron-case in 2005 switched from
   protest to dialogue. Since then, a relatively conciliatory line has been
   emphasized regarding this dispute. The exception is a short period after
   the arrest of the Russian trawler Sapfir-2 following the 2010
   Norway-Russia Delimitation Agreement, when large parts of the fishing
   industry and other regional actors in the Russian north were in harness
   and demanded action. After 2011, incidents in the FPZ have been handled
   without further escalation, although this is by no means a state of
   nature, but a situation underpinned by a number of specific factors that
   could be subject to change.},

Abstract = {An examination of anarchist educational initiatives may provide a fresh
   look into anarchism's intense and, at the same time, problematic
   relation to the avant-gardes. This chapter analyzes key concepts of a
   libertarian education - harmony, creation and social milieu - to
   confront them with anarchist political militancy on the one hand and the
   avant-gardes on the other. One of the central questions of the anarchist
   and avant-garde movements, namely how to integrate education and art
   into the life praxis, may be answered by either the attempt to liberate
   the creative potential of manual and physical labor, or the
   revolutionary negation mediated - in the case of the avantgardes - via
   an artistic gesture. Although the majority of anarchist activists
   rejected the idea of a ``revolution carried out by artists and steered
   by novelists and poets{''} (Proudhon), some libertarian educators
   considered art as the sphere of unconstrained creation. Their position
   towards art was influenced by their differing opinions regarding the
   purposes of education which was supposed either to liberate the child's
   individual will, or to provide a universal, shareable cognition of the
   world.
   Amongst all the libertarian schools, the Ferrer Center in New York was
   exceptional insofar as it brought together `rebels and artists' who
   managed to create a place that became both a unique anarchist
   educational enterprise and a seminal avant-garde milieu. The examination
   of journals published at the school (The Modern School, Looking Forward,
   The Stelton Appendix) will further the understanding of the specific
   relation between an avant-garde, libertarian education and anarchist
   militancy, as well as to trace the evolution of this outstanding
   vanguard milieu.},

Abstract = {Requests from different categories of users for information on
   sustainability have manifested the need to disclose non-financial
   information. The objective of this document is to analyze the level of
   disclosure of sustainability information from local governments of the
   Pacific Alliance countries, performing content analysis of the entities'
   websites in the year 2018. Results show that local governments of the
   Pacific Alliance are interested in disclosing sustainability-related
   information, based on the aspects considered in the Global Reporting
   Initiative guidelines, but their level of disclosure is low, achieving
   40\% of the criteria assessed and mainly focused on general and economic
   information, with lower level of disclosure of social and environmental
   aspects. This work contributes to the literature on the characteristics
   of sustainability disclosure in local governments in developing
   countries such as from the Latin American zone.},

Abstract = {Defining terrorism continues to be a problematic task for scholars,
   politicians, and government officials. Research has shown that
   developing a single definition of terrorism is not only unlikely, but
   also quite difficult. Definitions of terrorism can arguably be
   influenced by cultural, social, and political factors. This study
   qualitatively examines state criminal law and federal organizational
   definitions of terrorism to discern what elements are commonly seen
   across such definitions. Furthermore, this article examines what issues
   arise due to the differences and similarities between and across these
   groups of definitions. This study finds that organizational definitions
   are seemingly tied to institution mission or mandate, whereas state
   definitions are sporadic, lacking consensus, and are evidently
   influenced by major events such as the September 11 attacks. Across
   organizational and state definitions of terrorism, ``violence,{''}
   ``fear, terror,{''} and ``target{''} were the most common dements
   included. However, other definitional elements exhibited different
   trends when comparing organizational and state definitions of terrorism.
   Overall, defining terrorism will continue to be a problem in all arenas
   as long as the definition is allowed to change due to external factors
   or influences.},

Abstract = {This article aims to examine whether vulnerability to Global Climate
   Change (GCC) increases or decreases a country's attempts to securitize
   the issue. The research was based on the hypothesis that the more
   vulnerable the country to GCC, the more likely it is for the government
   to securitize its agenda. Seven countries were analyzed according to the
   Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN), the climate
   vulnerability index. The conclusion is that the hypothesis does not
   stand, and new guidelines for further research were suggested.},

Title = {Military Activism Branded as Peace Activism? Norway's Campaign for a
   Seat on the UN Security Council},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3},
Pages = {397-410},
Abstract = {In seeking to present itself as a peace nation, how has Norway sought to
   address its military activism and NATO membership? This tension was
   apparent in Norway's recent campaign for a seat on the UN Security
   Council, where the idea of the country as a peace nation stood central.
   Using nation branding as an analytical framework, we ask how Norway
   built and sustained this peace narrative and managed the competing
   narrative of its role in controversial armed conflicts. As a secondary
   focus, we ask how Norway's two competitors, Ireland and Canada,
   presented themselves on these two axes of peace and military activism.
   Ireland posed a particular threat as it is not a NATO member. To explore
   these questions, we analyse speeches and texts from Norwegian officials
   regarding the campaign and examine the official campaign material from
   all three countries. Given that the image of all three countries was
   generally similar, we find that each country sought to find unique ways
   to brand themselves as well as countering the few specific advantages of
   the others. In the case of Norway, we find that during the campaign the
   country's military activism was downplayed and other themes were
   foregrounded in the branding, such as gender equality and international
   development cooperation. This would legitimate the idea of Norway as a
   peace nation, a reliable partner that all states could trust.},

Abstract = {Comparison with similar countries is much neglected in studies of Danish
   military `activism'. This contribution seeks to remedy that in an
   analysis of Danish forces' happiness both to travel and to fight', in
   which Norway and Poland serve as the comparative backcloth. The specific
   situation under scrutiny is the crisis over limited air raids over Syria
   in September 2013 in the wake of the regime's alleged use of chemical
   weapons in Ghouta. As distinct from most allies, Denmark was not
   discouraged by the controversial Iraq intervention 10 years earlier. The
   special Danish readiness was less about perceptions of the local
   conditions than about Denmark itself, its relationship to Washington and
   an alleged historical `debt' to the US. However, not only is such debt
   difficult to measure; a challenge to superatlanticism is also that
   Danish interests are geographically more delimited than those of the US
   great power.},

Abstract = {The 2018 parliamentary elections were a watershed year for women in
   Latvian politics where women's descriptive representation increased from
   18\% to 31\% in one election with no gender quota. This paper explores
   this significant gain by examining ranked choice (positive and negative)
   preference voting in the Latvian Saeima (parliament) elections. The
   results show that small institutional changes increased the pool of
   candidates and countered stagnant levels of women's representation.
   Though female candidates were less likely to have their names struck out
   on party lists, women received fewer pluses than their male
   counterparts, revealing gender bias against female candidates.},

Abstract = {The system of informal legislative negotiations between the European
   Parliament, the Council and the Commission now exist for about two
   decades. While so-called `trilogues' aim to enhance the efficiency of
   the legislative process, their relative lack of transparency has led
   them to be criticized for undermining the possibilities of member state
   parliaments and citizens to meaningfully oversee, debate and participate
   in EU legislative decision making. We explore to which extent efforts to
   address these shortcomings have been successful, focussing on the
   oversight role of administrative and judicial actors, in particular the
   European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice. We argue that both the
   institutional structures and agendas of these actors influence the way
   they confront the question of trilogue transparency. Whereas the Court's
   focus is on safeguarding EU constitutional principles relating to
   democracy, the Ombudsman increasingly takes an expansive view of the
   concept of maladministration.},

Abstract = {The thirtieth anniversary is an opportunity to take stock of
   Environmental Politics. To consider where the journal and - by extension
   - the academic study of environmental politics should go, we must have
   insight into where it has been. We aim to generate conversation about
   three questions. The first asks who publishes in the journal - whose
   voices are prominent and whose are missing - and in what ways this has
   changed over time. The second asks what is published in the journal -
   what topics receive attention and by extension what is less visible.
   Again, we are especially attentive to how these topics have changed over
   time. The third question is how environmental politics itself is
   understood and how this might have changed. Much of our examination is
   based upon content analysis and data mining of a comprehensive dataset
   including authors, abstracts, and full-text of 1007 articles published
   in the journal.},

Abstract = {As one component of its mission to reduce trade barriers and encourage
   the liberalization of international commerce, the World Trade
   Organization provides states with a forum in which they can raise and
   resolve complaints about partners' unfair trading practices. This
   mechanism streamlines the process of identifying non-compliant behavior,
   and provides real incentives for the removal of such policies. By
   furnishing a form of dispute resolution, the institution should be both
   trade-inducing and peace-enhancing for member states. However, this very
   mechanism also has the potential to aggravate existing dispute for two
   reasons. First, it removes the opportunity for states to use economic
   policies as instruments of structural linkage in resolving disputes.
   Second, it deprives its members of powerful economic tools that could be
   used in lieu of militarized responses. Using the implementation of the
   WTO Dispute Settlement mechanism, as well as the subsequent expiration
   of Article 13 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (the so-called `peace
   clause'), we examine whether the opportunity to resolve trade disputes
   through the organization affects the likelihood that member states
   engage in militarized conflict with one another. We find that membership
   in a trade institution facilitates peaceful interaction, but that
   judicialization erases these benefits. We conclude that institution
   building requires caution and attention to the possibility of unintended
   consequences.},

Abstract = {Although disciplines are but one element of the institutional matrix of
   higher education, historians of International Relations (IR) rarely
   explore the field beyond its disciplinary context. To redress this
   lacuna, I sketch the history of professional international affairs (IA)
   schools in the United States. IA schools employ many IR scholars and
   train numerous practitioners, constituting a crucial interface between
   the IR academy and the policy world. When the social science disciplines
   were institutionalised at the turn of the 20(th) Century, the mission of
   training IR scholars momentarily eclipsed, but never extinguished, the
   commitment to training practitioners. During the 20(th) Century, this
   commitment increasingly found expression in interdisciplinary
   professional IA schools. I survey the emergence of IA schools, the
   growth of terminal master's programmes within their walls, and the rapid
   growth of enrollments in these programmes. The expansion of IA education
   mirrored the spectacular growth of professional education on US campuses
   in areas such as law, business, nursing, and social work.},

   of the global financial safety net cannot also explain why it is highly
   fragmented and provisioned so inequitably. This study shows that the
   global financial safety net's existence, fragmentation, and inequitable
   coverage can be explained by modeling the global financial safety net as
   a global club good. The primary finding of the model is that when a
   state has a monopoly on the provision of a non-rival and excludable good
   (i.e., a club good), separate multilateral and bilateral club governance
   structures emerge, each with a unique structure and cost. Brief case
   studies of the global financial safety net provisioned by the
   International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank for
   International Settlements support the model.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, we have seen an increased opposition to
   globalization. Within this wave of criticism, firms and more
   specifically multinational corporations have been major targets, accused
   of multiple wrongdoings, such as social dumping, fiscal evasion, job
   cuts, trade deficits, abuses of power, and environmental damages. In
   many respects, this debate echoes the one that took place during the
   1970s with respect to oil shocks, de-industrialization, and imperialism.
   At that time, several international organizations, such as the OECD,
   ECOSOC, ILO, and the European Community started to address the issue of
   multinationals and international investments, and advocated for the
   creation of guidelines to regulate their activities. The following paper
   explores the reactions of Swiss multinationals to these attempts, as
   well as their strategies for protecting their latitude in conducting
   business. Relying on archival material of the Swiss Union of Commerce
   and Industry and of the Federal Archives, this paper shows how the
   biggest companies in the pharmaceutical, machine, and food processing
   industries-all of them still being global players -decided to create a
   task force to deal with these emerging regulations at the international
   level.},

Abstract = {How does regime type affect the likelihood of negotiated settlements
   that end civil conflicts? A limited number of previous studies have
   offered divergent theories and mixed findings about whether democracy is
   an asset or a liability. I draw these disparate findings together and
   present a novel theory on why leaders under fully democratic and
   autocratic regimes may have a particularly difficult time in
   peacemaking, and how leaders in anocratic (hybrid) regimes are more
   likely to be successful in reaching negotiated settlements. Thus, I
   hypothesize that the relationship between regime type and the likelihood
   of conflictresolution is inverted U-shaped. I test this hypothesis using
   data on all internal conflicts between 1946 and 2014, and find empirical
   support. The findings suggest that even if anocracies are more prone to
   the outbreak of civil wars as has been proposed by previous studies,
   they are also better at settling these conflicts.},

Abstract = {Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and their applicability at sea
   now dominate debates about the future of naval operations. This article
   examines the extent to which such technologies, including autonomous and
   unmanned weapon systems and artificial intelligence, will disrupt naval
   warfare. Using two case studies, the South China Sea and the Baltic Sea,
   this article finds that in the key operational output of attaining sea
   control these technologies will not disrupt naval warfare. While they
   may intensify the competition between the operational attributes of
   detection, stealth, range and lethality, they will ultimately sustain
   existing understandings of seapower and its strategic effects.},

Abstract = {Intellectual property rights (IPRs) have been a priority for the
   European Union and the United States. However, over the past two
   decades, the EU and US have failed to advance their preferred IPRs
   standards through multilateral forums and have pursued bilateral
   alternatives instead. How have the EU and US pursued their strategies in
   this fragmented environment? Looking specifically at the Asia-Pacific,
   we compare their bilateral initiatives on IPRs across three strategies:
   treaty-making, coercion and socialization. Through this analysis, we
   examine whether the EU and US's bilateral actions indicate regulatory
   competition, coordination or replication. We find that the overall
   tendency has been towards replication, which raises questions about the
   reasons for this redundancy and its policy consequences. As the rise of
   bilateralism is not unique to IPRs, our findings have implications for
   global governance more generally.},

Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1127-1144},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {The uncoordinated closing down of internal borders, lock-downs and
   quarantines have limited the freedom of movement in Europe as never
   before. How have EU institutions framed this unprecedented immobility
   and what lessons can be drawn for Schengen as a highly politicized
   instrument of governance? Adopting a social constructivist approach, we
   study how between March and July 2020, the European Commission, the
   European Parliament and the Council/European Council have framed the
   debate around immobility in Europe. This article shows that the
   emergence of the public health frame has mostly been linked by EU Member
   States to traditional notions of internal security, demonstrating
   continuity with prior crises. Appeals to a functional-solidarity frame
   involving more coordination and non-discrimination were made by the
   European Commission, mainstream Members of European Parliament (MEPs) as
   well as some countries such as France and Germany. Justified by the
   public health emergency and compensated by innovative solutions such as
   the `green lanes' - proving the adaptability of the EU -, the
   reintroduction of internal border controls has nonetheless been
   normalised, raising questions about the future of transnational
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a
   landmark international treaty that is widely regarded as a cornerstone
   of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. However, pessimists
   point to a growing divergence of preferences between nuclear weapons
   states and non-nuclear weapons states as a precursor to the impending
   `unraveling of this vital piece of international law'. In this article,
   we test for evidence of preference divergence using statements from NPT
   review conferences, which are manifestos presenting each country's
   position on the NPT. We measure preferences on the NPT using Wordfish, a
   method that is frequently used to estimate ideological preferences from
   election manifestos. Our measure estimates the latent positions of state

   little evidence of growing preference divergence between the nuclear

Abstract = {In their article ``Is Religion Really the Enemy of Human Rights?,{''}
   Wade Cole and Gaelle Perrier challenge the bottom-up theory of human
   rights protection and our findings regarding the effects of religiosity
   and of Muslim governments on human rights protection. Their
   counterarguments and re-analysis of the data are not convincing. They do
   not have a coherent alternative theory motivating their empirical
   re-analysis, and they carelessly use multiple regression to undermine
   our original findings. Here we present even more evidence supporting the
   societal religiosity hypothesis and illustrating a large Muslim human
   rights deficit for nearly all human rights. Poor human rights scores for
   Muslim countries result from discriminatory policies that are consistent
   with the tenants of Islam, public opinion in Muslim countries, and
   descriptions of discriminatory policies contained in human rights
   reports. To counter the negative effects of religiosity and Muslim
   governments, we recommend new international and national policy
   initiatives advancing gender equality.},

Abstract = {The \#MeToo movement has exposed the need for education about consent,
   power dynamics and positive relationships. International human rights
   instruments oblige states to provide sexuality education, and there have
   been some legal challenges to state provision of such education. Courts
   at regional and domestic levels have focused on the benefits to the
   state of sexuality education, holding it permissible if it is
   ``objective{''} and if parents may educate privately to avoid it. It is
   argued in this article however that greater focus is required on
   sexuality education as primarily a child's human right, independent of
   state discretion and/or parental rights.},

Abstract = {EU agencies are increasingly subject to a flurry of stakeholder bodies.
   Despite their prevalence, and the considerable variation in structures
   formally professed to serve the same purpose, we know little about the
   actor preferences driving the set-up of such structures or the potential
   implications of specific institutional design choices. We systematically
   map structural variations across EU agencies and analyse to what extent
   the establishment and the design of stakeholder bodies is
   principal-imposed or agency-initiated. Do stakeholder structures enhance
   political control serving to broadly legitimise agencies, or to the
   contrary, do they reflect preferences of the bureaucratic actors they
   are meant to control, and with what implications? We find that, for the
   most part, weak principal control and steering leaves it to the agencies
   themselves to design stakeholder bodies as they see fit. This has the
   potential to introduce unsanctioned biases in favour of specific groups,
   potentially depleting rather than bolstering legitimacy. A major
   implication of EU agencies' stakeholder engagement is that the agency
   model is currently in flux, moving away from the classic insulated
   agency towards greater politicization in regulatory policy.},

Abstract = {As COVID-19 rapidly spread across the globe, every government in the
   world has been forced to enact policies to slow the spread of the virus.
   While leaders often claim responses are based on the best available
   advice from scientists and public health experts, recent policy
   diffusion research suggests that countries are emulating the COVID-19
   policies of their neighbors instead of responding to domestic
   conditions. Political and geographic considerations play a role in
   determining which countries imitate one another, but even among
   countries that are politically or geographically distant, nationalist
   regimes seem to favor certain approaches towards the pandemic. We
   investigate why this is the case by examining whether countries that
   embrace a nationalist ideology are more likely to emulate the COVID-19
   policies of similarly nationalist regimes. We demonstrate that, even
   after controlling for domestic circumstances and linguistic, trade,
   geographic, and political connections, nationalist countries are
   emulating each other's responses. These results are robust and shed
   light not only on new mechanisms of policy diffusion but also on the
   growing international cooperation of nationalist regimes and leaders.},

Abstract = {We have found that collective action theory, as developed by Margaret
   Levi and others, provides a new direction for the study of growth and
   decline of premodern states. By following this lead, we challenge the
   traditional consensus that despotic rule and relations characterized
   most premodern states, demonstrating instead a state-building process in
   which fiscal economies of joint production fostered the implementation
   of good government such as accountable leadership and public goods. In
   this paper we focus attention on causes and consequences of state
   decline, highlighting the decline pattern found in societies where there
   had been good government. Our comparative investigation reveals that
   while regimes providing good government policies and practices were
   highly regarded by citizens and brought benefits to them, they were not
   always enduring over time and regime decline was frequently followed by
   serious demographic and economic consequences. While causes of decline
   were varied, we describe and comment on four well-documented examples in
   which primary causality can be traced to a principal leadership that
   inexplicably abandoned core principles of state-building that were
   foundational to these polities, while also ignoring their expected roles
   as effective leaders and moral exemplars.},

Abstract = {The African Union wants to make `being African' an important immigration
   admission criterion amongst its member states. This would be a
   large-scale change to border control in South Africa, altering the
   nation's symbolic boundaries. But what do ordinary South Africans think
   about this change? And what are the determinants of public support for
   drawing boundaries in this way? Using data from the South African Social
   Attitudes Survey, this paper argues that social identity is one of the
   primary drivers of how people think about this issue. This outcome
   showcases the way identity politics drives South African attitudes
   towards border control.},

Title = {Why share? An analysis of the sources of post-conflict power-sharing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {248-262},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why do former belligerents institutionalize power-sharing arrangements
   after a civil war ends? The choice of power-sharing institutions shapes
   the nature of governance in many post-conflict settings. A better
   understanding of how belligerents come to choose institutionalized forms
   of power-sharing would thus help us explain how belligerents come to
   make a seemingly simple institutional choice that may have immense
   consequences. Existing scholarship emphasizes the nature of the conflict
   preceding negotiations, international actors, or state institutional
   capacity as critical factors for determining whether former belligerents
   will agree to share power or not. Yet these accounts overlook the
   importance of political considerationsbetweenandwithinethnic groups.
   This article argues that elites create power-sharing institutions when
   the most significant threat to their political power comes from an
   outside group as opposed to from within their own group. That is,
   forward-looking and power-minded leaders of former belligerents push for
   the type of power-sharing at the negotiating table that affords them the
   greatest opportunity to influence country-level politics after the
   conflict has concluded in full. For elites facing competition from
   outside, this means securing power-sharing through institutional rules
   and guidelines in the settlement of the civil war to ensure that they
   are included in the governance of the state. By contrast, for elites
   fearing in-group rivals, complex governance institutions are at best
   unnecessary and, at worst, a significant concession to weaker opponents.
   I test the argument with a cross-national analysis of an original
   dataset of 186 power-sharing negotiations from 1945-2011. The empirical
   analysis suggests that elites are most likely to institutionalize
   power-sharing when no single ethnic group dominates politics and when
   most ethnic groups are unified. The quantitative analysis is
   complemented with illustrative examples from cases of power-sharing
   negotiations that offer insight into the proposed theoretical
   mechanisms.},

Title = {Positivity and Negativity Dominance in Citizen Assessments of
   Intergovernmental Sustainability Performance},

Abstract = {Understanding how the public assesses the performance of complex,
   intergovernmental efforts such as sustainability is critical for
   understanding both managerial decision-making and institutional design.
   Drawing from the performance and federalism literature, this study
   investigates the role that distinctive elements of negativity bias play
   in citizen assessments of intergovernmental performance. In three survey
   experiments, this study exploits a well-known intergovernmental
   initiative to explore the effects of episodic performance information on
   citizen support for varying sustainability-related activities. Two
   inter-related research questions are addressed. First, does the positive
   or negative valence of citizen performance assessments vary with the
   type and scope of activity? Second, does positive or negative
   performance information tend to dominate in more realistic scenarios in
   which both types of stimuli interact? The results advance theoretical
   understanding of public performance with evidence that the type of
   activity can influence citizen assessments both positively and
   negatively. Additionally, partisan cues can overwhelm otherwise positive
   views of performance in some contexts, a concept described in the
   psychology literature as negativity dominance. The findings add
   important insights by showing that biased reasoning of citizens is not
   just a blanket affective association with constant treatment effects
   across any type of governmental effort, but is contingent on both the
   activity and political context.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on governments' attempts to intensify crises for
   political gain, and identifies a series of unnecessary crisis management
   responses that follow distinctive policy overreaction styles. It is
   based on the premise that political executives at times face incentives
   to shape voters' perceptions regarding the timing and scope of a crisis,
   even though no crisis actually exists. Analysing Trump's response
   towards the so-called `invasion' by a caravan of asylum seekers, the
   article identifies three distinctive crisis overreaction policy styles:
   communicating in absolutes, performing in absolutes, and challenging the
   rule of law. Each of these overreaction styles includes a specific set
   of tool preferences; an active means of implementation; and an
   impositional manner of execution. By highlighting the potential
   advantages of marrying the concept of crisis to the ideas of policy
   overreaction and policy style, this article makes an important
   contribution to our understanding of the politics of crisis management.},

Abstract = {In the present legal state, the mayor is an important political leader
   in Polish municipalities. On account of being elected in direct
   elections and enjoying a broad range of powers, he/she is a natural
   local leader. Another municipal authority is the council, which fulfills
   decision-making and supervisory functions. Whether the mayor can
   effectively act depends on the outcome of elections and, in consequence,
   the council's composition. Elections may lead to the phenomenon of
   cohabitation. This occurs when the mayor does not have the support of an
   absolute majority in the council or represents the opposite political
   camp to the members of the municipal council. Taking into account 1,737
   questionnaires and 74 interviews, it turns out that mayors do not
   operate in a political and administrative vacuum. Even if they make
   decisions on their own, they need internal (councilors, local government
   employees) and external (entrepreneurs, representatives of NGOs, the
   Catholic Church, political parties) help.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to impacts of climate change is a key pillar of climate
   change policy, and local governments have historically played a major
   role in the design and implementation of these policies. An array of
   political, economic, institutional, social, and individual factors
   influence adaptation policy instrument choice. At the local government
   level, these choices also reflect inter-governmental dynamics that can
   constrain or support local efforts. We analyze eight hypothesized
   drivers of local adaptation policy instrument choice using fractional
   regression analysis and multilevel modelling. Local governments are
   pursuing diverse adaptation policy implementation styles that are
   associated with different levels of internal capacity, local political
   economies and problem perception. Dependence on national governments,
   the presence or absence of national adaptation mandates, national
   decision-making traditions, and national adaptation policy approaches
   may also influence local policy instrument choices.},

Abstract = {Although originating in Algeria, AQIM and its allies had by 2012 become
   so entrenched in the Sahel that they were in de-facto control of vast
   swathes of territory in northern Mali. This article explains how and why
   GSPC/AQIM established itself in the Sahel, and why the group eventually
   decided to take the fight to the Sahelian countries, where they had
   previously found sanctuary. Relying on hitherto unused primary sources,
   this article is the first to show that the leadership of AQIM and
   al-Qaida Central did not want to engage in direct conflicts with the
   Sahelian states. The eventual shift of strategy in the region was
   brought about by the increasing numbers of Sahelians in AQIM's southern
   brigades.},

Abstract = {Voters usually differ in their assessment of the regime's legitimacy,
   depending on their status as winners or losers. However, how wide or
   narrow the winner-loser gap is also depends on the quality of democratic
   institutions. Using survey data from 18 Latin American countries, this
   research provides evidence that winners and losers respond differently
   to the quality of democracy. While most research is concerned with the
   losers' consent, this study shows that the winners express more
   favorable assessments of the supply of freedoms, even in regimes where
   democracy is weak or undermined by the deliberate efforts of the
   political authorities. Instead, in their perception of freedoms, losers
   are more willing to acknowledge if the quality of democracy improves or
   declines. These results suggest that the potential consequences of the
   winner-loser gap for regime stability are highly dependent on the
   democratic attributes of the political context.},

Title = {Securitization of the President: Trump as a national security threat},

Abstract = {Employing securitization theory, this article critically evaluates
   political discourses in the United States involving US President Donald
   Trump. It makes two main arguments: first, present political discourses
   against Trump can be understood as part of a concerted securitization
   process in which Trump's presidency is constructed as a threat to US
   national security. The securitization of an issue gives credence to the
   need for emergency measures to resolve a purported threat; within this
   context, the process aims to justify measures including the emergency
   impeachment of the President. Next, using primary data gathered from an
   online questionnaire (n = 529) and secondary data from polling agencies,
   this article demonstrates that there had been popular resonance and
   acceptance of the securitization discourse, that sufficient
   institutional support for impeachment was generated and that there was
   low coherence of counter-narratives opposed to the securitization. This
   article highlights how securitization can be undertaken over a
   protracted span of time through both discourses and practices, and in
   concert by a slew of actors rather than being carried out by a single
   lead actor. Importantly, it suggests that analysing audience responses
   to an unfolding securitizing move can generate valuable insights about
   the securitization processes and its potential outcomes.},

Abstract = {Which groups do global governance institutions address in their efforts
   to legitimate themselves? Global governance institutions are
   increasingly attempting to present themselves as legitimate vis-a-vis
   both internal and external audiences. Yet, empirical research on these
   legitimation audiences is still nascent. This article proposes a
   conceptual framework that highlights the selection of audiences by
   global governance institutions as a key element of their
   self-legitimation. Specifically, we argue that our approach addresses
   three continuing challenges in empirical research on self-legitimation.
   First, it emphasises how different actors within the institution may
   pursue multiple, and potentially conflicting, strategies with regard to
   the legitimation audiences they address. Second, our framework calls
   attention to what we call intermediary legitimation audiences, that is,
   audiences targeted with the expectation that they will in turn convince
   other audiences of the institution's legitimacy. Finally, instead of
   taking for granted that external critique steers who is targeted by
   self-legitimation, our approach highlights that an institution's
   internal assessment of such critique is decisive. We demonstrate the
   wide applicability of our framework through exploratory studies of three
   global governance institutions that differ with regard to their
   membership compositions: the World Health Organization, the
   International Criminal Court and the Forest Stewardship Council.},

Title = {One terrorism to rule them all: Turkey, the PKK and global terrorism
   discourse},

Abstract = {The international political language on terrorism should be taken
   seriously within IR, both due to its prevalence, its distributing of
   identities, and its role in the legitimisation of policies. Taking a
   discourse-theoretical perspective where `global terrorism' is a
   political concept rather than a distinct empirical object, this article
   studies Turkish representations of terrorism within the United Nations
   and the NATO Centre of Excellence: Defence Against Terrorism. By
   analysing speeches and newsletter articles between 2001 and 2013, I show
   how global terrorism discourse serves as a political resource by
   allowing for three main dynamics: (1) articulating specific, regional
   conflicts to the idea of a global terrorist threat-in this case that
   with the PKK, (2) the tainting of an enemy through association with a
   fundamentally illegitimate terrorist identity, and (3) the
   representation of a rightful and shared international Self, with the
   terrorist as constitutive Other. The article emphasises how the language
   used by the Turkish actors is not idiosyncratic or arbitrary; rather, it
   draws from shared and well-established rhetorical resources.},

Abstract = {We analyse the importance of legitimacy on public policy support by
   comparing how drivers of public policy attitudes evolve across the
   policy process consisting of the input (the processes forgoing
   acquisition of power and the procedures permeating political
   decisionmaking), throughput (the inclusion of and interactions between
   actors in a governance system) and output (the substantive consequences
   of those decisions) stages. Using unique panel data through three phases
   of the implementation of a congestion tax in the Swedish city of
   Gothenburg, we find that legitimacy is indeed important in explaining
   policy support. Moreover, we find a lingering effect where support in
   one phase depends on legitimacy both in the present and in previous
   phases. Hence, our study takes us one step further on the road to
   understand the complicated dynamic mechanisms behind the interactions
   between policymaking, policy support, and the legitimacy and approval of
   politicians and political processes.},

Abstract = {This study examines how military counterterrorism (CT) measures affect
   the quality of democracy by altering civil-military relations (CMR) and
   focuses on CMR as the main causal mechanism. We argue that the use of
   military measures in CT jeopardizes democracy at the societal level by
   increasing the belief that only the military is equipped to deal with
   the threat at hand. Therefore, erosions of civil liberties are tolerated
   in exchange for security. Second, we argue that military CT measures
   change the balance between the military and civilian executive powers in
   procedural and liberal democracies. While the military's executive power
   increases in procedural democracies, civilian executive power increases
   and goes unchecked in liberal ones. Case studies of the United States
   and Turkey show that military CT measures affect CMR in these countries,
   which generate a similar tradeoff between security and the quality of
   democracy, albeit via different causal mechanisms. While that tradeoff
   is less severe in the United States, Turkey is more vulnerable to
   erosion of democracy.},

Abstract = {A review of the recent literature on social movements identifies three
   types of autonomous action of movements in relation to the state: (1)
   rejection of the state and the construction of ways of life on its
   margins; (2) rejection of the state's ways of functioning and the
   construction of alternative modes of organization and action; and (3)
   rejection of historical inequality in state decisions on public policy
   and the proposal of alternatives to that policy. From a theoretical
   point of view, it shows that autonomy as action may coexist with the
   institutionalization of demands, projects, and movement organization. A
   sistematizacao da producao bibliografica sobre a autonomia de movimentos
   sociais dos ultimos dez anos chegou a tres tipos analiticos de acao
   autonoma de movimentos em relacao ao Estado: (1) negacao do Estado e
   construcao de modos de vida a sua margem; (2) negacao das formas de
   funcionamento do Estado e construcao alternativa de organizacao e acao;
   (3) negacao da desigualdade historica nas decisoes do Estado para
   producao de politicas publicas e construcao de propostas alternativas
   para aquelas politicas. Do ponto de vista teorico, mostrou-se que a
   autonomia como acao pode coexistir com os processos de
   institucionalizacao de demandas, projetos e organizacoes de movimentos.},

Abstract = {The constitutional quagmire between the Catalan government and the
   Spanish state has dominated debate in academic, political and public
   spheres for several years. This article examines the evolution of this
   territorial crisis, drawing on interview data with parliamentarians in
   the Catalan Parliament. The analysis illuminates a number of limitations
   with the extant territorial model, including the lack of recognition of
   Spain's plurinational status, the centralising tendency of the central
   state, the absence of shared rule and the prominent role of the
   Constitutional Court in arbitrating territorial disputes. Further, the
   article sketches some potential scenarios for the future development of
   relations between the Catalan and Spanish governments, ranging from
   recentralisation to reformulation, state disintegration to continued
   stalemate. While talk of using autonomy as a conflict resolution
   mechanism was largely absent from the initial debates during Spain's
   transition, the article concludes that the time has come for Spanish
   political elites to rethink this approach, not least if they seek to
   keep the state together.},

   argues (contrary to the prevailing view) that Al Nusra never split from

   leadership of Al Nusra was locked in a power struggle with Al Qaida over
   the control of jihad in Syria and possibly even over the future of Al
   Qaida itself. Efforts to unify the Syrian opposition, even those limited
   to jihadist groups, failed also because of the leadership of Al Nusra
   kept trying to co-opt other opposition groups, rather than forming
   alliances with them.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This article addresses a critical gap in the literature on winner-loser
   effects that consists of the lack of attention for highly contentious
   constitutional referenda. It uses unique multi-wave panel data of over
   13,000 people that is unrivalled in size and richness. We estimate
   causal effects of the referendum on rarely studied but crucial public
   perceptions of the fairness of the way a referendum is conducted. These
   perceptions pertain to the highly contentious 2016 European Union
   (Brexit) referendum in the United Kingdom, which is an ideal-type
   example of a wider class of referenda for which similar outcomes can be
   expected. We use difference-in-differences methods and find winner-loser
   effects of a magnitude far greater than ever observed for general
   elections. Moreover, we find that these effects not only persist, but
   even grow over time. The findings have profound implications for the use
   of such referenda.},

Abstract = {This study is a content analysis of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
   (ISIS)'s French-language magazineDar al-Islam. The first seven issues of
   the magazine are quantitatively examined and broken down into the number
   of articles, images, and terms used as a means of determining how ISIS
   targets French-speaking individuals. This study find that ISIS focuses
   on religious terminology and justifications to rationalize its existence
   and its fight. Also, despite being a French-language magazine, a
   majority of the focus is on Middle Eastern groups, not Western groups.
   Overall, the magazine is similar, but not a carbon copy to ISIS's
   English-language magazine,Dabiq.},

Title = {Genocidal Rape In South Sudan: Organization, Function, and Effects},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {667-694},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Different labels have been used to characterize violence against
   civilians in South Sudan since the beginning of the third civil war
   (2013- present). The United Nations categorized the violence as ``on the
   edge of,{''} or as ``potential{''} genocide. This article contends that
   mass rape by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and affiliated
   militias against civilians is genocidal, based on over 325 interviews
   collected in South Sudan and Uganda's refugee camps in 2015-2017,
   including with rape survivors and witnesses. The article investigates
   the organization and commission of systematic gang-rapes in two of the
   most conflict-stricken areas of South Sudan. It argues that genocidal
   rape is two-pronged. In addition to destroying the target groups,
   genocidal rape also secures gains for the perpetrators. Much of the
   literature on rape as a weapon of war has thus focused on what it does
   (or what it is meant to do) to the victim group and what it accomplishes
   militarily. This article also explains what genocidal rape does for the
   perpetrators, and how it impacts society's social stratification.
   Genocidal rape not only obliterates victim groups: in destroying and
   transferring wealth to the perpetrators, it is part of a capitalist
   logic that consolidates ethnic groupness and domination.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a burgeoning literature has emerged on the relationship
   between religion and conflict. Contradictory theories address the
   dynamics and termination of religious violent conflicts. Some studies
   focus on the destructive role of religion, arguing that religious
   conflicts are longer, more violent, and intractable. Others argue that
   religion has an ambivalent role, both destructive and constructive, and
   recognize religion as a force for peacebuilding. This study focuses on
   the relationship between religion and conflict termination by examining
   termination outcomes, based on the length and the level of violence, as
   well as incidents of reoccurrence. The study quantitatively examines 118
   domestic conflicts between 1990 and 2014, utilizing the Political
   Instability Task Force and Religion and State datasets. The findings
   suggest that religious conflicts are likely to last longer than
   non-religious ones. However, the study reveals that religion has no
   strong significant influence on conflict termination as well as on the
   reoccurrence of conflicts and the violence level.},

Abstract = {Recent work historicises and theoretically refines the concept of
   prefigurative politics. Yet disagreements over the question of whether
   or how it is politically effective remain. What roles does prefiguration
   play in strategies of transformation, and what implications does it have
   for understandings of strategy? The article begins to answer this
   question by tracking the concept's use, from discussions of left
   strategy in the 1960s, a qualifier of new social movements in the
   1980s-1990s, its application to protest events in the 2000s, to its
   contemporary proliferation of meanings. This contextualises reflections
   on the changing arguments about the roles of prefiguration in social
   movement strategy. Based on literature about strategy, three essential
   categories of applied movement strategy are identified:reproduction,
   mobilisationandcoordination. Prefigurative dynamics are part of all
   three, showing that the reproduction of movements is strategically
   significant, while the coordination of movements can take various
   `prefigurative' forms.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the determinants of reforms intending to
   integrate policies and coordinate administrative units by focusing on
   necessary conditions. Firstly, we elaborate theoretical expectations
   about potential necessary conditions for cross-sectoral reforms.
   Secondly, we conduct a condition-oriented fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis to examine our expectations, based on an original
   data set comparing policy integration and administrative coordination
   reforms, in environmental and unemployment policy, across 13 countries
   over 29 years. Our results indicate three necessary conditions for high
   reform intensity: external problem pressure is necessary for policy
   integration and administrative coordination in employment policy; either
   the strength or weakness of the reference party can take the role of
   necessary conditions depending on the policy field; low politicization
   of bureaucracy is necessary, especially for administrative coordination
   in environmental policy. These findings contribute to the development of
   a systematic theory of cross-sectoral policy and administrative change.},

Abstract = {Research on the effects of terrorism mostly focuses on the coercive
   effects of violence on the macrolevel, while other effects like
   provocation, particularly on the microlevel, do not receive the same
   attention. In this article, we seek to address previous omissions. We
   argue that terrorism can provoke ordinary people into a violent
   reaction. By reducing perceived security and creating a desire for
   revenge terrorism may lead civilians to attack uninvolved members of the
   terrorists' constituency. Using geo-referenced data on terrorism (Global
   Terrorism Database) and violent riots (Social Conflict Analysis
   Database), we assess with a matched wake analysis if the treatment of
   terrorist violence against civilians causes an increase in violent
   behavior. The results of our analyses show that terrorism significantly
   increases violent riots. We thus conclude that terrorism can not only
   provoke governments but also civilians into an overreaction.},

Abstract = {The success of Hitler's National Socialism was the success of a
   religious faith, the `false' belief that National Socialism was the
   fulfillment of Christianity. This article wants to show how the long
   development of political theology of the Middle Ages to the `Germanism'
   of the 19th and twentieth century has made this intended
   misunderstanding possible. The religious aspect of National Socialism
   will become clear. In the past this aspect was discussed very
   controversial (no religion, substitute of religion, pseudoreligion,
   political or `real' religion) because no distinction was made between
   the following questions: What did Hitler want that people believe? How
   did the historico-cultural background influence the development of
   National Socialism? How did the people perceive Hitler and his movement?
   What did Hitler personally believe? Hitler'svoelkishapocalypse derived
   from a centuries-old tradition of apocalyptic interpretation of current
   events. The ideology of the GermanReichas kingdom of God and the
   secularization and Germanization of salvation history by German Idealism
   had long prepared the German people to regard themselves as the new
   Chosen People and Hitler as the German messiah. But Hitler himself
   wanted to create a national doctrine ofGermanismmodeled on Judaism as he
   understood it. Hitler's Nationalsocialism could become a `real'
   religious faith because of its connection to deeply rooted traditions.},

Abstract = {Regulatory states manage religious activity within their jurisdiction in
   the same way they manage economic activity, in an alignment pattern that
   reflects institutionally embedded processes. Relying on regulatory
   institutional options to trace consistencies in the way a regime manages
   economic and religious activity, the article develops and tests
   theoretical accounts of the presence and content-in terms of comparative
   variation-of this alignment. The empirical setting, primarily OECD
   countries in recent decades, allows us to reverse a conventional causal
   view and treat religious regulation as causally embedded in the logic
   and practice of economic regulation. If reliance on regulation as a
   means of social control is bound by the same processes across domains,
   this may even suggest the existence of national cross-sectoral models of
   coordinating competition. The study elaborates a broad conceptualization
   of regulatory governance with potentially wide applicability.},

Abstract = {Predictive algorithms are replacing the art of human judgement in
   rapidly growing areas of social life. By offering pattern recognition as
   forecast, predictive algorithms mechanically project the past onto the
   future, embracing a peculiar notion of time where the future is
   different in no radical way from the past and present, and a peculiar
   world where human agency is absent. Yet, prediction is about agency, we
   predict the future to change it. At the individual level, the
   psychological literature has concluded that in the realm of predictions,
   human judgement is inferior to algorithmic methods. At the sociological
   level, however, human judgement is often preferred over algorthms. We
   show how human and algorithmic predictions work in three social
   contexts-consumer credit, college admissions and criminal justice-and
   why people have good reasons to rely on human judgement. We argue that
   mechanical and overly successful local predictions can result in
   self-fulfilling prophecies and, eventually, global polarization and
   chaos. Finally, we look at algorithmic prediction as a form of societal
   and political governance and discuss how it is currently being
   constructed as a wide net of control by market processes in the USA and
   by government fiat in China.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of energy in regionalization processes,
   assessing the case of natural gas finds in the Eastern Mediterranean
   (East Med). It makes three observations. First, we show that energy
   resources are a defining factor in shaping a region by rearranging the
   interactions and networks of actors involved in regionalization
   processes. Second, we demonstrate that such ``energization{''} processes
   are not only-and not even primarily-attributable to security practices
   pursued by state actors. Regionalization underpinned by energy as the
   key governance object is characterized by a variety of actors, including
   governments, but also international energy companies, investors,
   consumers, and regulators. Third, we posit that regionalization
   processes cannot be fully understood without appreciating the importance
   of existing global and regional governance frameworks and the values
   ascribed to the physical resource by international market forces. The
   findings call on International Relations to go beyond analyzing the East
   Med energy region through the prism of security studies, which arguably
   is a function of both theoretical path dependence and a lack of
   attention to the insights from energy studies. Instead, a
   multidisciplinary research agenda promises to strengthen academic
   inquiry into regionalization dynamics in the East Med and the role of
   regions in world politics more broadly.},

Abstract = {The most widespread implementation of the autonomous sovereignty of the
   popular sectors in the socialist policies of Chavez's Venezuela, known
   aspoder popular(popular power), is theconsejo comunal(communal council),
   a neighborhood assembly that has received sizable state funding to
   implement self-managed projects ranging from house renovation to local
   public works and from social events to small-scale productive
   activities. Examination of the establishment and operation of these
   councils in Cumana (Estado Sucre)-their successes and failures, popular
   involvement and personal corruption-reveals the ambiguous role within
   them of political brokers employed by local administrations and heading
   the party's smallest organizational units and shows how incorporation of
   forms of direct democracy into larger institutions (the government and
   the party) hinders the exercise of autonomy. La implementacion mas
   extensa de la soberania autonoma de los sectores populares en las
   politicas socialistas de la Venezuela de Chavez, mejor conocida
   comopoder popular, yace en elconsejo comunal, un tipo de asamblea
   vecinal que ha recibido considerables fondos estatales para implementar
   proyectos autogestionados: desde la renovacion de casas hasta obras
   publicas locales, desde eventos sociales hasta actividades productivas a
   pequena escala. Un analisis en torno al establecimiento y funcionamiento
   de estos consejos en Cumana, Estado Sucre (sus exitos y fracasos,
   participacion popular y problemas de corrupcion personal) revela el
   ambiguo rol que dentro de ellos jugaban los agentes politicos empleados
   por las administraciones locales para encabezar las unidades
   organizativas mas pequenas del partido. Tambien muestra como la
   incorporacion de formas de democracia directa a instituciones mas
   grandes (el gobierno y el partido) obstaculizan el ejercicio de la
   autonomia.},

Abstract = {Humanitarian agencies working in violent conflicts often insist on
   separating humanitarian negotiations from political mediation efforts.
   However, many academics and practitioners also wonder if humanitarian
   negotiations can really be apolitical and disentangled from peace
   negotiations. Using the case study of Syria, this article analyzes the
   interactions between humanitarian negotiations and international peace
   negotiations. By considering various actors involved in Syria and the
   different arenas of negotiations (mainly the Astana talks and the United
   Nations negotiations led by the Special Envoy), it demonstrates that
   humanitarian and peace negotiations are governed by a complex
   interdependence. A dual process of politicization of humanitarian action
   and ``humanitarization{''} of political negotiations is at work, in a
   Syrian context characterized by a fragmented and controversial
   humanitarian space. This article is based on unique data from
   participant observation during four international meetings bringing
   together humanitarian practitioners from different organizations and
   political actors.},

Abstract = {Economic sanctions, and the suspension of budget support in particular,
   are supposed to pressure target governments into complying with sanction
   demands by putting spending commitments at risk. In this article we
   argue that this is too simplistic since governments have more fiscal
   levers at their disposal. The case of Burundi illustrates this argument.
   Following Burundi's 2015 political crisis, donors imposed economic
   sanctions on the country and suspended all budget support to the
   national government. Using monthly data on the government's fiscal
   position between 2005 and 2017, we present evidence from a time series
   analysis showing that aid does not affect spending and that aid
   shortfalls are instead systematically compensated with domestic
   borrowing. It appears that the Burundian government has been able to
   withstand the sanctions and to fulfil its spending commitments by
   substituting domestic debt for aid. Thus, the economic costs of
   sanctions do not necessarily translate directly into political costs but
   are mitigated by the government's fiscal response.},

Abstract = {In a recent article, David Blagden (2019) critiques our research
   published in the International Studies Quarterly (LeVeck and Narang
   2017a), in which we draw on the well-known ``wisdom of crowds{''}
   phenomenon to argue that, because democracies typically include a larger
   number of decision makers in the foreign policy process, they may
   produce fewer decision-making errors in situations of crisis bargaining.
   As a result, bargaining may fail less often. Blagden's critique focuses
   on two supposed flaws: first, that ``{[}d]emocracies may have a larger
   number of more diverse policymakers, of course, but this relationship is
   not necessary,{''} and second, that ``weighing against the superior
   ability of large groups to average towards accurate answers, meanwhile,
   is a substantial drawback of larger groups: the diminishing ability to
   take and implement decisions{''} due to additional veto players. In this
   article, we demonstrate the ways in which we believe Blagden's critique
   to be misguided in its approach to social science inquiry. In
   particular, we argue that much of his critique requires that we reject
   two hallmarks of scientific inquiry: the use of stylized facts in theory
   building; and the use of comparative statics to generate testable
   hypotheses.},

Abstract = {International studies, which in the twenty-first century exists as a
   global, multifaceted and interdisciplinary enterprise, is ready for a
   turn toward graphic communication. Evidence is mounting that the
   complexity of international studies is over and beyond what can be
   managed, intellectually speaking, through an approach that relies
   overwhelmingly on the exchange of words. Effective communication
   throughout international studies requires a turn toward graphic means.
   Thus, the Visual International Relations Project (VIRP) is introduced in
   this article as a pathway toward more effective conveyance between and
   among sectors of international studies. Work within the VIRP focuses on
   creation of an archive that will be available to members of the
   International Studies Association (ISA).
   Work proceeds in six sections. The first section provides an overview of
   the communication-related challenges facing international studies as
   scholarship becomes increasingly global in scope and diverse with regard
   to theorizing and methods applied. Section two makes the case for a
   visual approach to combat intellectual isolation that is intensifying as
   a result of communication through words alone. Along with a few
   alternatives in section three, the foundation for a recommended graphic
   turn, systemism, is introduced. Systemism emphasizes completeness and
   visual representation of theorizing. Section four applies a graphic
   method based on systemism to depict works of scholarship in a common
   format. Value added from visual representation of these scholarly works
   is demonstrated in section five, within which communication takes place
   between and among them. Section six sums up the contributions of the
   graphic approach based on systemism and explores future directions for
   research.},

Abstract = {By drawing on the theoretical framework of the second incorporation of
   heterogeneous social organizations by progressive governments through
   informal contestation and/or technocratic implementation of their
   demands in Latin America, this article argues that the first
   presidential term of Evo Morales in Bolivia (2006-2009) was marked by
   the incorporation of combative social movements through both a
   multidimensional co-optation of movements and the technocratic
   competition of the central movement demands for the nationalization of
   gas and the rewriting of the constitution through a constituent
   assembly. However, by 2010, this incorporation had stripped social
   movements of their ability to mobilize for change and the political
   conjuncture had shifted, making the government less dependent on its
   social bases to maintain political stability. This simultaneously
   transformed movements into defensive movements protecting the gains from
   the previous period and state-social-movement relations into informal
   contestatory regimes in which movements could only struggle against
   proposed political agendas.
   En base a un marco teorico que abarca la segunda incorporacion de
   organizaciones sociales heterogeneas por parte de gobiernos progresistas
   a traves de la contestacion informal y/o la implementacion tecnocratica
   de sus demandas en America Latina, un analisis del proyecto politico de
   Evo Morales en Bolivia sostiene que su primer mandato presidencial se
   vio caracterizado por la incorporacion de movimientos sociales
   combativos a traves de una cooptacion multidimensional de dichos
   movimientos y la competencia tecnocratica de las demandas del movimiento
   central en torno a la nacionalizacion del gas y la modificacion de la
   constitucion por una asamblea constituyente. Sin embargo, para 2010,
   esta incorporacion habia despojado a los movimientos sociales de su
   capacidad de movilizarse a favor del cambio y la coyuntura politica
   habia cambiado, haciendo que el gobierno dependiera menos de sus bases
   sociales para mantener la estabilidad politica. Esto transformo a los
   movimientos en entidades defensivas dedicadas a proteger las ganancias
   del periodo anterior y las relaciones entre el estado y los movimientos
   sociales en regimenes informales de impugnacion dentro de los cuales los
   movimientos mismos solo podian luchar contra las agendas politicas
   propuestas.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the structural and institutional changes that
   occur within the Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) between the Orange
   Revolution and Euromaidan. Why did a security service that was hailed as
   a protector of democracy when it stood against the national police,
   under the command of the Interior Ministry (MVS) who were attempting to
   quash the Orange Revolution protests in 2004 become a leading suspect in
   the anti-democratic shootings that occurred in the Euromaidan protests
   in 2014? One potential explanation is the pervasive patronage political
   shifts that result in personnel changes atop the hierarchy of the SBU.
   Another is that the bifurcated political structure (presidential powers
   vs. those of the legislature) of Ukraine shifted creating a realignment
   of political loyalties. A third potential explanation is institutional
   change that altered the entire Ukrainian political system between 2004
   and 2014. This article uses archival data, content analysis of media
   publications, and semistructured interviews with experts in the field of
   Ukrainian security to examine the changes occurring within the SBU that
   lead to a violent reaction towards protesters in 2014.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This forum piece discusses why multilateral spaces are key `sites' for
   studying struggles over environmental knowledge and how Collaborative
   Event Ethnography (CEE) can open up new avenues for Critical Policy
   Studies. Frank Fischer has argued that contestation over environmental
   knowledge is a discursive struggle over whose reality counts. Yet, the
   analysis of the structuring and ordering effects of `text' also benefits
   from CEE during multilateral environmental agreement making, where
   participants dispute the meaning and place of words in the written
   document being negotiated. I will use the example of marine biodiversity
   negotiations to illustrate that the debate over environmental knowledge
   bears the deep mark of long-standing global imbalances between the
   Global North and the Global South. In order to understand these global
   imbalances and how they shape the ability of actors to determine the
   outcome of text-based negotiations I propose to link CEE to empirical
   studies of scientific fields. I will conclude by arguing that the
   potential of multilateral spaces to shift the epistemic order and change
   the world order for the better is the main reason why we should care
   about their future after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and find ways to
   strengthen their legitimacy.},

Abstract = {According to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
   Peoples, indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own
   identity or membership in accordance with their own collective customs
   and traditions. However, what is left of indigenous customary ways of
   applying membership rules after decades of state intervention? In this
   article, I show that Swedish national legislation has moved Sami society
   away from a relational and responsibility-based understanding of who is
   Sami toward a rights-based understanding. I argue that we need to see
   how national legislation has affected the way in which indigenous
   nations themselves apply their customary membership governance.},

Abstract = {In the last three decades, Egypt's rural population has experienced
   different types of struggle over land as a result of neoliberal land
   reforms, which have favoured landowners and marginalised tenants'
   interests. While the literature highlighted the negative effects on the
   tenants, little attention was given to what landlords did with the land
   after the reforms. Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2011 and 2013
   in five Egyptian villages, the article addresses this lacuna by
   investigating tenants' understanding of land-use change. Using a revised
   conceptualisation of Marx's metabolic rift, the article shows that
   evicted tenants understand this shift as part of a domestic land grab
   that disrupted the ecological system. The article therefore
   conceptualises land dispossession and domestic land grabs as mutually
   reinforcing processes and draws particular attention to the sensorial
   dimensions associated with domestic land grab, in addition to the
   political and economic dimensions.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant economic trends in the last decades has been
   the integration of countries in international markets. What have been
   the consequences of global economic integration upon the territorial
   organization of the states? Has it contributed to centralize powers or
   to further decentralization? The literature so far has provided
   inconclusive evidence. In this article we shed new light on the
   relationship between economic globalization and territorial politics by
   using a varied source of data such as the Regional Authority Index, and
   the KOF indices of globalization for the period 1970-2010. Results show
   that economic globalization is positively associated to
   decentralization, particularly in those countries with more regionalist
   parties and where levels of inequality are lower.},

Abstract = {While it lags behind the US and China in conventional hard power
   indicators, Europe is at par with and even ahead of them in some sharp
   and soft power indicators. Yet it consistently influences below its
   potential in world affairs. Its ability to leverage its sharp and soft
   power is hampered by questions of identity, coherence, and leadership,
   questions that are reflected in the scenario exercise itself. Is Europe
   defined as the EU, the EMU, or the Council of Europe, and will it
   continue to include the UK? The answer will be critical to enhancing
   Europe's power. More effective use of Europe's sharp power will require
   both political will and more strategic coherence in Brussels, along with
   some significant institutional modifications. America's abdication from
   global leadership creates an opportunity for the projection of Europe's
   soft power. Europe's normative role - both through policy innovation and
   higher education - is its greatest strength, and its place in the world
   of 2030 will be determined by how it exercises its potential. It must
   choose whether it has the will to maintain core elements of the previous
   order or transform it into new, post-hegemonic multilateral forms.},

Abstract = {The declining legitimacy of political parties has become something of a
   truism in political science discourse. Less often reflected upon is how
   these legitimacy problems could potentially be resolved. This article
   contributes to this underexplored issue by examining the restorative
   potential of expertise as a supplement to intra-party democracy.
   Building on an established literature on Stealth Democracy, we explore
   the potential for expert-inspired reforms to boost citizens'
   satisfaction with parties. Using original survey questions, we provide
   evidence that a perceived lack of expert engagement in parties predicts
   citizen dissatisfaction, before using deliberative workshop data to
   distil traits that define the appeal of experts and expertise. This
   mixed-methods approach allows us to demonstrate some common desires of
   which parties should be aware, but also traits that make these ideas
   difficult to realise. Combining these insights, we argue that while
   expertise has appeal, parties face considerable challenges in satisfying
   citizens' desires.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the evidence as regards the extent to which trade
   liberalization has led to a decline in tariff revenue, total tax
   revenue, government expenditure, and government debt. Conventional
   theory generally predicts that when tariff losses do occur, they may be
   recouped through better forms of taxation - though a more sophisticated
   body of theory suggests otherwise. The empirical evidence is also mixed.
   Theory driven ex-ante models of trade liberalization assume that trade
   agreements are revenue neutral. Ex-post studies suggest that theory may
   hold in advanced and upper middle-income economies. However, the
   consequences for lower income countries are a matter for concern. The
   majority of the evidence finds that low income countries lose trade tax
   revenue and are unable to recoup much of that lost revenue. At a time
   when fresh bilateral trade and investment treaties are being negotiated
   and WTO reform is on the global policy agenda, this paper highlights the
   need to design a treaty regime that enhances the ability of poorer
   nations to mobilize domestic resources without jeopardizing fiscal and
   financial stability.},

Title = {Aspiring, Ambivalent, Assertive: Bulgarian Middle-Class Subjectivities
   and Boundary Work through Migration},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {This article investigates the subjectivities of a group of aspiring
   middle-class Bulgarians and their boundary work in the context of their
   migrations to the United Kingdom. Drawing on Lamont's critique of
   Bourdieu's theory on class formation and reproduction, it shows how
   people from underprivileged social backgrounds can lay claims to
   middleclassness by strategically drawing on cultural and moral markers
   of distinction revolving around the notions of ``civilization,{''}
   ``culturedness,{''} and the ``West.{''} The adoption of such narratives
   and their enactment in the cultivation of personal attributes, however,
   fails to guarantee full-fledged middle-class membership for people who
   lack the necessary economic and social capital. Thus, boundary-building
   becomes the key mechanism for negotiating ambivalent middle-class
   subjectivities and rejecting objectively assigned positions in the
   social structure. The article traces the emergence of ideal-type models
   of middle-class belonging since 1989, their adoption by aspirational
   middle-class people, and the boundary work and self-differentiation by
   which they try to reassert their superior status both before during and
   after their migrations to the UK. It concludes that the observed
   everyday processes of group classification through the defining of and
   distancing from cultural, moral, and racial ``others{''} reproduces
   class antagonisms that preclude a more critical understanding of the
   discontents of Bulgaria's capitalist transition.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the recent initiatives of the EU against tax
   evasion and tax avoidance from a Multiple Streams perspective. By
   combining a chronological review of EU tax provisions with a
   quantitative content analysis of official EU documents, I show how both
   EU corporate tax policy and the way it is framed have changed over time:
   From market-enhancing toward market-regulating tax measures that
   explicitly address corporate tax avoidance. Contrary to what is often
   assumed, findings show that the crucial window of opportunity did not
   stem from the financial and Eurozone crisis, but rather from the
   accumulation of tax scandals since 2013. Furthermore, my analysis
   differentiates between the entrepreneurship of the Commission as a whole
   and the individual entrepreneurship of single personalities to better
   understand the dynamics that lead to policy change in the EU.

   Resumen Este documento analiza las recientes iniciativas de la UE contra
   la evasion fiscal y la evasion fiscal desde una perspectiva de multiples
   flujos. Al combinar una revision cronologica de las disposiciones
   fiscales de la UE con un analisis cuantitativo del contenido de los
   documentos oficiales de la UE, muestro como la politica fiscal de la UE
   y la forma en que se enmarca han cambiado a lo largo del tiempo: de la
   mejora del mercado a la regulacion del mercado de medidas fiscales
   abordar la evasion de impuestos corporativos. Al contrario de lo que se
   suele suponer, los hallazgos muestran que la ventana de oportunidad
   crucial no se derivo de la crisis financiera y de la zona euro, sino de
   la acumulacion de escandalos fiscales desde 2013. Ademas, mi analisis se
   diferencia del espiritu empresarial de la Comision en su conjunto. y el
   espiritu empresarial individual de personalidades individuales para
   comprender mejor las dinamicas que conducen al cambio de politicas en la
   UE.},

   to produce impact beyond compliance and even in the absence of any

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Almost all regulatory policy stops at the national border. Thus, when
   conducting business abroad, the behaviour of firms is regulated by their
   host, not their home country. Yet, international institutions have
   issued (non-binding) codes of conduct on social/environmental aspects of
   firm behaviour, and various high-income countries discuss how to improve
   extraterritorial firm behaviour - with high political contestation over
   the appropriate mix of state intervention and corporate self-regulation.
   Exploiting a unique national referendum on this issue in Switzerland, we
   investigate how these interact from a public opinion standpoint. Based
   on a nationally representative survey experiment (N=1564), we find that
   while baseline support for state intervention is high (approx. 60\%),
   corporate self-regulation decreases such support. However, only credible
   voluntary business initiatives lead to substantial reductions. Our
   results speak to a broad policy debate in European countries and the EU
   on how to ensure compliance of firms with human rights and environmental
   standards.},

Abstract = {I assess the contribution of policy learning to changes in renewable
   energy support policies in the European Union (EU), focusing on the
   evolution of the `Feed-in Tariff' in Germany and the United Kingdom,
   considering both `endogenous' (responses to the effects of existing
   policy within the country) and `exogenous' (responses based on external
   experience of the policy) learning in shaping the design and operation
   of the mechanism as policy shifted from an expansionary to a
   retrenchment phase. I evaluate the analytical value of a policy learning
   approach compared with other explanations for such policy changes,
   particularly those which draw upon more conventional political drivers
   such as political parties, interest groups and institutional conditions
   at the domestic and EU levels. While there are signs in both cases that
   policy learning has informed changes in the policy in certain respects,
   the principal drivers of, and constraints upon, change have been
   political.},

Abstract = {When activation is an essential cog in public policies, looking for a
   job is top priority for the jobless, and becomes their professional
   occupation. Job search experience is studied here in the light of the
   institutional norms and prescriptions that frame it. Our fieldwork has
   focused on the supposed correspondence between these two, since our
   interviewees were formerly-unemployed people who have managed to land
   relatively long-term positions. Three results were identified: first,
   their experiences espouse a self-help model; second, in spite of
   compliance with this model, the search is jeopardized by its uncertain
   outcome, and third, an alternative model has emerged, characterized by
   job search limitations in the emotional, temporal and behavioral
   registers. These adjustments deviate from institutional standards yet
   are nonetheless the result of thoughtful and personal management, i.e.
   of applying a principle of self-discipline that is paradoxically in line
   with the institutional model of job search.},

Abstract = {A spate of recent scandals concerning personal digital data illustrates
   the extent to which innovation and finance are thoroughly entangled with
   one another. The innovation-finance nexus is an example of an emerging
   dynamic in technoscientific capitalism in which innovation is
   increasingly driven by the pursuit of ``economic rents{''}. Unlike
   innovation that delivers new products, services, and markets, innovation
   as rentiership is defined by the extraction and capture of value through
   different modes of ownership and control over resources and assets. This
   shift towards rentiership is evident in the transformation of personal
   digital data into a private asset. In light of this assetization, it is
   necessary to unpack how innovation itself might be a problem, rather
   than a solution to a range of global challenges. Our aim in this paper
   is to conceptualize this relationship between innovation, finance, and
   data rentiership, and examine the policy implications of this pursuit of
   economic rents as a deliberate research and innovation strategy in
   data-driven technology sectors.},

Abstract = {The past decades have been characterized by a growing number of nonstate
   actors (NSAs) involved in global governance. However, despite this
   growth, only a small number of NSAs have been able to maintain a
   prolonged global presence over a substantial period of time. To explain
   why some NSAs are more active, we rely on resource dependence theory. We
   demonstrate that sustained advocacy over time can be explained by a
   density dependence mechanism, namely the more NSAs mobilize, the lower
   the chance that individual NSAs will prolong their global advocacy
   efforts. Analysis of data stemming from a unique data set of 5,627 NSAs
   active at the global climate conferences demonstrates that much advocacy
   in this field is indeed of an incidental nature, namely a large number
   of groups attend once and never return.},

Abstract = {How does political polarization occur under repressive conditions?
   Drawing on psychological theories of social identity, the author posits
   that the nature of repression drives polarization. Repression alters
   group identities, changing the perceived distance between groups and
   ultimately shaping the level of affective and preference polarization
   between them through differentiation processes. The author tests the
   proposed causal relationship using mixed-method data and analysis.The
   results of a laboratory experiment reveal that exposure to a targeted
   repression prime results in greater in-group identification and
   polarization between groups, whereas exposure to a widespread prime
   results in decreased levels of these same measurements. The effect of
   the primes appears to be mediated through group identification.
   Case-study evidence of polarization between political opposition groups
   that were differently repressed in Egypt and Tunisia reinforces these
   results. The findings have implications for understanding how
   polarization, as conditioned by repression, may alter the likelihood of
   the cooperative behavior among opposition actors necessary for the
   success of democratic politics.},

Abstract = {In the context of the 2014 energy reform, the laws on the hydrocarbon
   and the electricity sector included tools for preventing, mitigating or
   repairing the possible damage that the infrastructure of mega-projects
   relating to this sector may cause to communities. This effort to
   regulate the social impact of projects responds to the promotion of
   sustainable development by the sector, combining the country's energy
   security (availability of energy products at accessible prices) with
   governance of the projects (granting legal certainty to public and
   private investments, while protecting the rights of communities). This
   paper will analyze both the new regulations and their potential
   shortcomings.},

Abstract = {Under the influence of globalization and the European Union membership
   accession process, important administrative reform initiatives have been
   taken in Turkey in the 2000s in the framework of economic, social,
   political, cultural and technological needs. In this process, central
   government agencies and administrations, public financial management,
   local governments and similar public organizations have undergone
   important transitions. The most important initiative taken to achieve
   regional governance is the establishment of Regional Development
   Agencies (RDAs). The present study performs a 10-year longitudinal
   analysis of RDAs in Turkey in the context of governance and local
   elites. The first phase of the study was conducted in 2010, and the
   second phase was conducted in 2019. The aim of the study is to evaluate
   whether RDAs have realized their potential in local democracy,
   sustainable development and decentralization, as well as to define the
   characteristics of policies to be pursued in line with further
   development of these agencies. Consequently, it has been observed that
   maintaining a centralized state tradition, along with institutional
   deficiencies, has transformed RDAs into an apparatus of the central
   government.},

Abstract = {How do disruptions in basic public service delivery shape people's
   perceptions of politicians? We offer evidence from the July 2012
   blackout in India, the largest in human history. Using data from the
   India Human Development Survey, we compare confidence in politicians
   between households that were surveyed during the outage and affected by
   it (treatment) and only days before it (control). Balance statistics
   show that the treatment and control groups are statistically
   indistinguishable, and further tests indicate that there was no
   disturbance to the pattern of surveying. Far from undermining public
   confidence in politicians, the outage increased it, as citizens reacted
   to the anxiety created by the crisis. The implications are normatively
   troubling, as politicians seem to have reaped benefits from disruptions
   in public service delivery.},

Abstract = {Research on user satisfaction has increased substantially in recent
   years. To date, most studies have tested the significance of predefined
   factors thought to influence user satisfaction, with no scalable means
   of verifying the validity of their assumptions. Digital technology has
   created new methods of collecting user feedback where service users post
   comments. As topic models can analyse large volumes of feedback, they
   have been proposed as a feasible approach to aggregating user opinions.
   This novel approach has been applied to process reviews of primary care
   practices in England. Findings from an analysis of more than 200,000
   reviews show that the quality of interactions with staff and
   bureaucratic exigencies are the key drivers of user satisfaction. In
   addition, patient satisfaction is strongly influenced by factors that
   are not measured by state-of-the-art patient surveys. These results
   highlight the potential benefits of text mining and machine learning for
   public administration.},

Abstract = {Members of parliament are key actors for the implementation of energy
   transitions, such as phasing out nuclear power. Before legislators can
   cast their maybe decisive vote in parliament, they need to run for
   office and actively strive for election. This paper assesses what
   political candidates oppose renewable energy transitions and questions
   whether the energy issue matters in national elections, and thus has
   consequences for the implementation of new sustainable energy sources.
   We analyze these questions by first describing the specific
   characteristics of political candidates. The paper then evaluates the
   relevance of the energy issue for electoral success in three national
   elections in Switzerland (2007, 2012, and 2015). Based on candidate data
   from the voting advice application smartvote.ch, we find that female
   candidates support ETs more than men do; that especially the
   French-speaking part of the country is more in favor of a nuclear
   phase-out, and that younger candidates are also more open toward
   restructuring the energy system than older candidates are. Our models
   further show that the energy issue does not matter in elections,
   independently from its salience in the respective election campaigns.
   Candidates are thus relatively free to choose their position on the
   issue and do not have to fear consequences at the ballot. However,
   candidates of center parties, in contrast to the pole parties, are
   sensitive to the energy issue and reflect public mood in their
   positions.},

Abstract = {Pervasive media censorship in China is often seen as a strictly
   political issue. Although in past years reporters have had leeway to
   report on economic issues, the Chinese Party/state has moved to tamp
   down economic journalism, even arresting those who report on bad
   economic news. This shift brings to the fore an issue long ignored by
   social scientists - economic censorship. Economic censorship takes place
   when state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or large private companies pressure
   the state to censor negative reports or directly pay off media companies
   to quash such reports in favor of more positive ones. Such economic
   censorship distorts markets and shifts investor money away from new
   market entrants and towards large, well-resourced and well-connected
   SOEs. Using a database of Chinese newspaper articles from 2004 to 2006
   and a separate database of newspaper articles, blog posts and micro-blog
   posts from 2010, and supplemented by secondary sources, this paper
   examines how media coverage is distorted by censorship and corruption to
   the benefit of China's entrenched interests. In particular, I find that
   private and provincially owned companies receive much more press
   coverage than do their central government (SASAC) owned equivalents,
   controlling for a number of factors.},

Abstract = {Financial flows into Africa are being reoriented through the pervasive
   discourse of the `infrastructure gap'. The article argues that the
   generation of new infrastructures identified as `alternative assets' by
   global finance is also creating landscapes of opportunity for urban
   capital accumulation by more locally embedded actors. Thus, as
   international financial flows are becoming `infrastructuralised',
   domestic capital is increasingly `real-estatised'. The conceptualisation
   of African urban economies in terms of deficits has obscured the extent
   to which they are also characterised by surfeits, including of certain
   kinds of property development and speculation, with important
   implications for the politics of urban accumulation, dispossession and
   violence.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},

Pages = {507-540},
Abstract = {Despite the obvious the risks involved in deterrence bargaining, we know
   surprisingly little about how the public evaluates risk during a crisis.
   A limited deterrence scholarship considers domestic preferences and
   tends to assume that the public's risk tolerance remains stable
   throughout a deterrence episode. Yet, robust findings in cognitive
   psychology suggest that people's risk tolerance can shift dramatically
   based on how the potential outcomes of military options are framed. We
   evaluate these competing views through a series of decision experiments
   grounded in prospect theory. Across an array of potential extended
   deterrence scenarios, we demonstrate that simply reframing the language
   used to describe the possible outcome of military options affects both
   the public's willingness to accept risks and, therefore, their
   willingness to escalate the crisis. These findings condition
   long-standing concerns about the public's intransigent risk disposition,
   which underpin research on costly signaling, deterrence traps, and
   nuclear self-deterrence.},

Abstract = {Based on a discursive analysis of various media reports published in
   2015-2018 by and about the Finnish right-wing street patrolling
   organization Soldiers of Odin (SOO), we explore the gendered dimension
   of contemporary vigilantism. We find that street patrolling as a
   practice of vigilantism, is justified in this case by using
   representations of the cityspace as a place of friction between locals
   and newcomers and of the street as a locus for enacting gendered and
   racial/ethnic identities. Our findings suggest that SOO's vigilant
   practices exhibit a mixture of traditional and new features of
   masculinity. We argue that the activities of anti-immigration groups
   such as the SOO in Finland demonstrate a feminist security dilemma
   concerning the way securitization of public gender-based violence is
   used to enhance militarized performance of white masculinity. We
   identify four recurring themes that are used by group members to portray
   themselves as part of a legitimate social movement: protective
   masculinity, militarized masculinity, supplement of the state, and
   indigenous masculinity.},

   the drivers for popular support of Russia. We find that the primary
   driver of individual-level support of Russia is political attitudes

Abstract = {The Arctic is back on the European political agenda, under the impetus
   given by the Finnish Presidency of the European Council. The European
   Union (eu) has been engaged in the Arctic since 2008 for environmental
   and geopolitical reasons. Based on a geopolitical method of analysis of
   eu documents and a series of mapped interviews, this article identifies
   some of the difficulties of eu's Arctic policy. It examines a dimension
   rarely studied of eu's action as an Arctic geopolitical actor: its
   denial of geography. After a review of the different stages of the
   European Arctic policy, the article analyses eu's geopolitical
   positioning through these categories: legal institutions and
   competences, capacity for action, discourse and geographical
   representation. The article shows, through the case study of the fishing
   ban, the importance of the spatial articulation of a policy. Applied in
   general, this could help to formulate a European geopolitical thinking.},

Abstract = {The extent to which municipal policy is determined by the preferences of
   residents is a topic of growing importance. Recent work on the subject
   has challenged conventional wisdom and found that municipal policy is
   often, but not always, responsive to the ideology of residents. This
   paper takes up an important potential implication of these findings,
   exploring how resident ideology may interact with issue severity in the
   adoption of municipal policy. Hypotheses suggest that resident
   preferences will have the greatest effect in the presence of high issue
   severity and that issue severity will have the largest impact when
   residents have ideological preferences in line with policy solutions. I
   test hypotheses using municipal water rates, with models showing that
   the effects of resident ideology and water scarcity interact with each
   other to influence water conservation policy.},

Abstract = {As France and Germany have become major targets of jihadist terrorism,
   the calls for stronger cooperation in counterterrorism at the European
   level have grown in earnest. However, a comparative analysis of the
   national experiences from both countries evidences significant
   differences in terms of political culture, institutional division of
   labor, and legal oversight. Counterterrorism practices can be described
   following a typology of three broad categories: a military-oriented
   policy that aims to prevent, deter and retaliate against terrorists; a
   regulatory policy that strengthens the legal and judicial resources to
   address the terrorist threat; a diplomatic approach that focuses on
   negotiations, and sometimes accommodation. Whereas France moved after
   the 2015 attacks towards a military-oriented policy, Germany has so far
   opted to sustain its traditional regulatory approach. This article
   details the differences between Paris and Berlin regarding the
   contemporary public debate on jihadist terrorism, to the law enforcement
   framework, to the deradicalization programs as well as to the role of
   armed forces. The paper identifies a clear divergence in each of these
   sectors. As the future extent of bi- and multilateral lateral efforts in
   the field of counterterrorism are likely to rise, these differences
   should be better taken into account.},

Abstract = {When and why do voters change their evaluation of party leaders? Voters'
   evaluations of party leaders are an increasingly important determinant
   of electoral behaviour. Which factors influence these evaluations of
   party leaders? Do voters evaluate party leaders who hold the office of
   prime minister differently from other party leaders, and do electoral
   campaigns and issues change these evaluations? I use a multilevel growth
   model with panel data from the United Kingdom to analyse effects over
   time. I find that campaigns play a significant role and that voters'
   stance on Brexit has a considerable time-varying effect. In addition,
   voters use economic performance as a valence signal for party leaders
   holding the office of prime minister and therefore hold them accountable
   for bad economic performance, especially during election campaigns.
   These findings show that the personalization of politics may endanger
   the democratic function of elections to a lesser extent than is commonly
   feared.},

Abstract = {International cooperation has played a major role in climate governance.
   With a particular focus on China, this study develops a comparative
   framework to understand three pathways to international cooperation on
   climate change: multilateralism, bilateralism and transnationalism.
   Drawing on cooperation theory, we compare the three pathways in terms of
   their leaders, organisations, bargaining process, agreement, and
   enforcement efforts, and analyse their comparative strengths and
   limitations. We suggest that, given the ever-increasing difficulties and
   uncertainty experienced in climate multilateralism, the government
   should pay more attention to developing climate bilateralism and
   transnationalism in order to leverage the benefits of international
   cooperation on climate governance.},

Abstract = {It is a truism to say that we live in a digital era. Advances in digital
   technologies in recent decades have changed personal, political, and
   social practices. Digital tools - and with it, new capabilities for the
   generation, storage, analysis, and exploitation of data - have also had
   profound effects on the political economy, including the
   financialisation of our economy, movements of data, money, and companies
   across national borders. At the same time, economic, political and
   social factors shape what and how digital data are generated, how they
   are stored and used, and for whose benefits. This concluding chapter to
   the Special Issue on the Political Economy of Digital Data gives an
   overview of the contributions` main findings and suggestions.},

Title = {What Justice for the Yazidi Genocide?: Voices from Below},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the ISIL genocide against Iraq's Yazidi minority
   and calls for prosecutions before either the ICC, Iraqi court, or other
   national courts, the authors ask a seemingly simple, though largely
   unexplored, set of questions: what does this idea of ``justice{''} mean
   for the survivors? Do they prefer retributive or restorative justice? Do
   they favor global or local justice? Do they share the perpetrator-victim
   narrative that is so often promulgated, or is theirs a more complex and
   nuanced story? To answer-or at the very least explore-these questions,
   the authors conducted extensive field research consisting of structured
   questionnaires supplemented by unstructured narrative-style interviews.
   The field interviews comprised among more than 1,000 internally
   displaced persons (IDP)-primarilyYazidi survivors, as well as other
   minority groups in the largest IDP camps in Iraq's Kurdish Region. The
   data that emerged provided an illuminating glimpse of grassroots
   perspectives, with responses that are both predictable and unexpected,
   multilayered and complex. What emerged is an understanding of justice
   principally focused on local issues, immediate concerns, agency, and
   prospects of a better future-features more readily achievable through
   local restorative justice rather than global punitive justice. This
   included a predilection for financial assistance, truth-telling and
   public recognition, and a need for healing and reconciliation among
   local communities and, more intimately, neighbors. With many of the
   Yazidi respondents being adult female survivors of ISIL crimes, this
   study also provides a unique insight into perceptions of justice of
   Yazidi women and specifically of female survivors of sexual violence.
   These results underscore the need for scholars and advocates to make a
   concerted effort to listen to the voices from below before defining
   ``justice{''} narrowly as accountability through criminal trials. The
   early and continuing prioritization of the ICC, and the near-singular
   focus of energy and resources on this objective, has undermined the
   pursuit of more restorative forms of justice.},

Journal = {POLITICS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Epistemic justifications of democracy affirm the comparative quality of
   democracies' decisions. The challenge faced by those who endorse such
   views is to explain why we should prefer standard democratic
   institutions to some sort of epistocracy or rule of the wisest. This
   article takes up this challenge by assessing the epistemic potential of
   an epistocratic council, as imagined by Jason Brennan. Members of such
   council would be selected through competency exams, the required
   competencies being defined by the whole population. The argument
   defended in this article is that the potential gain in instrumental
   rationality that such an institution could offer under certain
   questionable conditions would be outweighed by the increased risks of
   misrule and involuntary biases if such council has decision-making or
   veto power. In comparison with the existing literature, this argument
   stresses the importance of moral rightness, here defined as
   impartiality, in the epistemic assessment of democracy and its
   alternatives. The article then ends with a qualified assessment of
   purely epistemic justifications of democratic inclusion, which could be
   insufficient to reject implausible but imaginable forms of epistemically
   justifiable disenfranchisement.},

Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {70-89},

Abstract = {This study examines support for redistribution in the developed economy
   of Hong Kong from three theoretical perspectives: self-interest,
   ideology, and social affinity. The analysis uses a between-subjects
   randomized vignette experiment to explore the interplay between welfare
   and politics; in particular, it addresses whether people express
   opposition to a welfare policy to convey political discontent even if
   they otherwise support the policy. Drawing on a survey of university
   students (N = 1245), the study finds that self-interest and ideology,
   and specifically perceptions of social mobility and individual
   responsibility, are strong predictors of support for redistribution. The
   vignette experiment provides evidence that politics indeed spills over
   into support for welfare policies. Respondents expressed less support
   for public housing if cued that the policy was associated with the
   government and were already dissatisfied with political leadership. The
   findings have implications for research on political support for
   redistribution and welfare policies.},

Abstract = {As the introduction to the special issue on `Contesting liberal
   internationalism: China's renegotiation of world order', this paper
   outlines the theoretical framework of the special issue, namely
   international order and order contestation, and the main arguments of
   the four papers included in this special issue. Recently, a, albeit not
   the, key challenge to the liberal international order stems from the
   leadership aspirations of non-Western, non-liberal states, and their
   increasing demand for a greater voice, most notably China under the
   leadership of Xi Jinping. This special issue is constructed as a debate
   concerning the alleged challenges posed by China to both the political
   and economic spheres of the liberal international order. The four case
   studies and papers are grouped into two core themes: the impact of
   China's state-capitalist development model and practices on the liberal
   economic order, and China's attempts to transform norms and rules in
   security-related matters. The four papers aim to appraise Chinese
   discursive narratives and practices that would collectively challenge
   American liberal hegemony. Altogether they argue that a hybrid of
   order-building norms and practices is likely to co-exist alongside the
   prevailing liberal international order.},

Abstract = {There has been a momentous shift in China's international strategy
   towards a continental orientation since the early 2010s. Underpinning
   this geostrategic reorientation is a new continentalism expressed in a
   growing sense of optimism about China's geopolitical potential in the
   continental direction. This emerging continentalism is in keeping with
   an expansionist foreign policy line that has paved the way for a
   geostrategic outlook oriented towards expansion. As an unstated
   geostrategic doctrine, this expansionist continentalism serves to
   provide a new sense of direction for Chinese geostrategy and reflects a
   reappraisal of the relevance of continental geography for expansionist
   ends.},

Abstract = {Member States have retained core competences in external energy policy
   since the beginning of European integration. Even the new `energy
   chapter' in the Lisbon Treaty safeguards national prerogatives.
   Contrasting this trend, we show that throughout the past decade this
   national stronghold has been eroding and replaced by supranational
   oversight. Reviewing energy-related negotiations of Poland and Lithuania
   with Russia and new regulation on intergovernmental agreements, we
   demonstrate how the Commission gained control over Member States'
   external energy relations. We explain the expansion of supranational
   authority with spillover pressures equipping the Commission with new
   procedural prerogatives. Central to this development was the
   institutionalisation a novel supranational instrument we call `real-time
   compliance'. The term denotes the prompt application of soft and
   coercive means, ensuring compliance of energy agreements between the
   Member States and third countries with EU rules. This expansion of
   supranational powers through procedural competences has implications for
   debates on European energy policy and European integration.},

Abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas but it has received strikingly less
   social science attention than carbon dioxide in examining climate policy
   options. This article explores American state policy toward methane that
   is not captured and instead released into the atmosphere during oil and
   gas production. It examines whether states have adopted market-based
   approaches to price methane flaring and venting through long-standing
   severance taxes on natural gas extraction. Such taxes exist in all but
   one production state, routinely materializing after prolonged adoption
   battles. Most states have maintained methane release exemptions from
   these taxes through either statute or administrative discretion between
   1960 and 2000, although a few have allowed some form of pricing. Two
   state legislatures have explored applying these taxes to methane
   releases on multiple occasions since 2000, amid expanded shale era
   output and growing public concern about climate and air quality impacts.
   Steadfast production industry opposition, rather than technical
   feasibility, emerges as the primary factor leading to rejection in these
   cases. Even when framing releases as a conventional air contaminant or
   as permanent loss of a nonrenewable natural resource, states largely
   continue to exempt flared or vented methane from severance taxes.},

Abstract = {The past three decades have seen an increase in both domestic terrorist
   attacks and loans issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In
   this study, we investigate the connection between IMF loan arrangements
   and domestic terrorism. We find that countries under IMF loans tend to
   observe fewer domestic terrorist incidents and especially when the
   borrowers are democracies. We contend that, while the IMF pressures
   borrower countries to prevent money laundering and combat the financing
   of terrorism, this effect is most pronounced in democracies, whose large
   selectorates incentivize the provision of public goods in a manner that
   works to reduce domestic terrorism. Our research shows how domestic and
   international institutions together can possibly help lower incidents of
   domestic terrorism.},

Title = {Who dissents? Self-efficacy and opposition action after state-sponsored
   election violence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Pages = {62-76},

Abstract = {Reactions to acts of state-sponsored election violence and other forms
   of repression vary greatly across individuals. This article develops a
   theory that the psychological characteristic of self-efficacy moderates
   opposition supporters' reactions to state-sponsored election violence. I
   use data from an original survey and in-depth qualitative interviews
   with opposition supporters in Zimbabwe to illustrate and test this
   theory. Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of intention to take action
   in support of the opposition after episodes of state-sponsored election
   violence and is related to the emotional reactions that opposition
   supporters have after violent events. Specifically, people who are
   higher in self-efficacy report that they would feel more anger relative
   to fear after episodes of state-sponsored election violence. The
   relationship between self-efficacy and persistence in pro-opposition
   action after violence is similar in magnitude to variables that the
   existing literature argues are the most important predictors of dissent
   in repressive environments, including strength of identification with
   the opposition and gender. These results provide empirical support for
   the assumption in many collective action theories that psychological
   characteristics create variation in dissent in repressive environments.
   Understanding how individual psychological differences can shape
   reactions to coercive violence may help explain why forms of repression
   like state-sponsored election violence have such unpredictable effects
   on subsequent pro-opposition mobilization.},

Abstract = {The Singapore model of the political economy of welfare is often
   understood as an anti-thesis to the high spending welfare state in
   Western Europe. In Singapore, the family is the key to promoting
   self-sufficiency. Individual responsibility is maximized through a
   series of highly regulated social provisions, designed to promote
   maximum social conformity and economic instrumentality. Singapore is
   also considerably different from its Northeast Asian counterparts due to
   its remarkable level of welfare regime stability. This article addresses
   the question of how this continuity has been possible for so long and
   whether it is likely to continue. It argues that the institutional
   coherence that is provided through a set of ideational frameworks is
   central in unpacking the stories behind Singapore's road to development.},

   of the five sectors of the theory, namely themilitary, economic,

Series = {Wellbeing in Politics and Policy},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {What is the ultimate goal of Politics and Policy? This introductory
   chapter suggests that the best answer to this question is
   ``Well-being{''}: The ultimate goal of politics and policy should be to
   ensure that citizens are able to live good, flourishing lives. In the
   twentieth century, politics and policy erroneously inverted its means
   and ends: Instead of making human well-being its ultimate goal, it
   focused on economic prosperity, measured by GDP. Resulting policies
   often treated citizens as mere means to the end of a sound economy.
   However, in the early twenty-first century, GDP ``fetishism{''} was
   identified as the fundamental mistake it is, and Politics and Policy
   were called upon to go ``Beyond GDP{''}, and focus directly on human
   well-being. But what is human well-being? Surely everyone has their own
   conception of the good? This chapter argues that, given our common
   biology and common sociality, it would be surprising if there were no
   universals of human well-being. This study will employ a suite of
   methods, including documentary analysis of national constitutions,
   analysis of political ``Beyond GDP{''} programmes, and analysis of the
   World Values Survey, to identify a universal core of human well-being,
   as a foundation for people-centred politics and policy.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides a broad view of the main values operant at the
   political and population levels in North America: the USA and Canada.
   First, the theory of Political Liberalism and its modern North American
   interpretation is discussed. Next, the central principles of important
   political and legal instruments are identified, and ``second-wave{''}
   well-being initiatives are examined. Finally, evidence from the World
   Values Survey reveals mass priorities in this region. Political
   liberalism provides the basis of political conceptions of the good in
   North America, with individual freedom as the defining principle. This
   liberalism is manifested differently in the USA and Canada, with more
   policy focus on social and economic rights in Canada. Despite worries
   about the individualism inherent in classical liberalism, findings
   suggest that, in practice, liberalism does not necessarily entail the
   devaluation of sociality; social relationships are a mass priority in
   both countries. Common priorities emerging from second-wave initiatives
   include Material living standards, Work, Education, Health, and
   Communities and families, and the World Values Survey shows that family
   relationships are a top priority.},

Abstract = {The article sums up the main ideas of Steven Pinker's book The Better
   Angels of our Nature, and introduces main currents of its criticism. The
   currents are categorized; thereafter the strength of Pinker's opponents'
   arguments is evaluated. The conclusions points towards coherence and
   sound empirical foundation of the school of thought emphasizing the
   civilizational downward trend in violence. Recognition of these trends
   can in turn help determine further steps in mitigating levels of
   political violence.},

   reconciliation processes},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-134},
Abstract = {This article assesses how reconciliation in post-conflict Uganda is
   currently approached in the country's education sector. It highlights
   that education is in the main equated with economic development thereby
   side-lining the legacies of past conflicts and social injustices. In the
   view of Uganda's highly politicised reconciliation process, this may not
   come as a surprise. Interviewees pointed to a general fear, that
   addressing past conflicts in official curricula could revive tensions.
   However, fieldwork further revealed that a sheer absence of
   reconciliation through the education sector could be dangerous in two
   ways. First, silencing past conflicts in schools may have a
   depoliticising effect on a population as a whole. It deprives a society
   of constructing a social, cultural and national identity that is based
   on multiple understandings of a conflict. Second, the absence of a
   social truth based on different narratives of the conflict can in the
   long-term trigger new forms of structural violence if not conflict or
   violent unrest.},

Abstract = {Most investigations of state repression presume a unitary state actor,
   but this assumption might not always be reasonable and, indeed, it might
   be hindering our ability to understand what is taking place as well as
   why. For example, it may be that certain perpetrators are engaged in
   more activities than others or that specific ones engage in the most
   violent activities. It may be that certain government actors are
   influenced by some factors whereas other actors are only influenced by
   others. Finally, it might be the case that certain victims are more
   likely treated violently than others. To date, paramilitaries have
   received some attention, but other actors-such as the police, the
   military, intelligence agents, and immigration and prison officials-have
   escaped examination beyond a single form of repression: torture. In an
   effort to better understand the variation that exists within state
   repressive activity (i.e., Political Terror Scale values of 3 and
   above), DyoRep uses State Department and Amnesty International reports
   to identify more precisely who does what to whom and why. These data are
   conceived at the temporal unit of the year yielding approximately 9000+
   spell-year observations (thus far-several thousand more are currently
   being coded). This article introduces the database, provides various
   descriptives regarding who engages in what activity, and explores
   questions that emerge from these data that suggest that we know little
   about state repression but that the future of such research is a bit
   brighter.},

Abstract = {Partisan political corruption behavior has not been properly examined in
   the academic literature. Accordingly, the main aim of this paper is to
   determine the nature of the relationship between corruption and
   political ideology, doing so via a novel dynamic partisan approach which
   will enable us to measure the influence of the passage of time on the
   likelihood of the existence of political corruption and to determine
   whether this likelihood is stronger or weaker in progressive vs.
   conservative governments. This approach will also allow us to determine
   the influence of the different explanatory factors, among which are the
   creation of networks with related private companies by means of
   reiterative contracts, public-private agreements and other
   public-private networks, addressed in such a way that private companies
   with specific interests, political factors (political fragmentation and
   gender) and the long-term neighborhood effect are all considered.
   Survival analysis is applied to 747 cases of political corruption that
   occurred during the period 2002- 2014 in the Spanish local government.
   Our findings show that a significantly larger number of cases have been
   identified of corruption by conservative than by progressive parties.
   Moreover, the cases identified corruption by conservative parties remain
   undetected and unprosecuted for longer.},

Abstract = {This article questions why and how the private sector was articulated as
   a legitimate agent in a field almost entirely dominated, until the

   field across the fractures produced by SSCP and throughout a series of
   normative and managerial adjustments, which we called here regulated
   improvisations.},

Abstract = {The Arctic is changing. Although maritime conditions vary across this
   vast region, increased activity from state and non-state actors alike
   are challenging the littoral northern states. This chapter takes a look
   at the changes occurring in the Arctic, specifically focusing on the
   contrasts between the North American and European Arctic regions, using
   Greenland, Canada and Norway as examples. The overall trend has been
   that the number of maritime vessels has increased steadily since the
   1990s, while vessel activity is becoming more complex, diverse, and
   spread-out. The end of this chapter turns to the need for coast guard
   tasks and what these entails.},

Abstract = {The High North has been on the Norwegian foreign policy agenda for 15
   years. Much has changed over this period. What characterizes the debate
   in 2020 are notions of great power politics and rivalry in the north. At
   the same time, Arctic states claim that the region is defined by
   cooperation and that the Arctic states have common interests that make
   conflict unlikely. How can two such different perceptions of the Arctic
   exist simultaneously? In this contribution, we separate between three
   different levels of security policy in and around the High North and the
   Arctic. This helps clarify how the region can be characterized by both
   cooperation and rivalry at the same time. Cooperation and rivalry differ
   depending on time and place, but they are not mutually exclusive.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Number = {4},
Pages = {490-499},
Abstract = {This study examines what happened to Norway's nordomradepolitikk, or
   High North policy, erstwhile a targeted effort to address foreign and
   security policy challenges in Norway's immediate neighboring northern
   areas. It finds that the current High North policy, after rounds of
   extensive revision, has become less suited to cope with Norway's
   pressing security challenges in the said areas. Over the years, the
   Norwegian High North policy has become so diluted and all-including that
   it encompasses virtually anything and everything with a northern
   dimension, including regional development and industrial policies, to
   the neglect of foreign and security policy considerations. The High
   North initiatives have, at best, gradually transformed into a broad
   policy coordination effort, but without clear or prioritized policy
   objectives. Faced with a number of weighty security challenges in its
   immediate neighboring northern areas, Norway is currently guided by a
   policy that has metamorphosed into a distraction. A High North white
   paper about everything resembles a white paper about nothing.},

Abstract = {The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also
   poses new threats. In our paper, we examine whether a shift from
   traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the
   increased normalization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether
   this change can subsequently increase prejudice to wards minorities. Our
   research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of
   Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents' primary
   sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online,
   social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six
   months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim
   hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were
   frequent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice
   and perceived higher normativity of antiMuslim hate speech than the
   respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also
   found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate
   speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social
   media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice.},

Abstract = {Local Affairs Administration established by local self-governments in
   the 2016-2019period calls for tenders more and more frequently. Beside
   public utility companies founded by local self-government units there is
   an increasing number of the so called ``other enterprises{''} taking
   part in the bidding. The aim of the authors was to determine at what
   prices the Local Affairs Administration concluded agreements with the
   said enterprises that participated in the public bidding. The authors
   came to relevant findings as they had an insight in the agreements
   concluded between the Local Affairs Administration and the bidders in
   the 2017-2019 period. Accordingly, the authors' contribution is in
   finding that following calling for tenders and tender procedures
   agreements between the Local Affairs Administration and bidders are
   concluded at prices that are lower than in case of direct bargaining
   between the Local Affairs Administration and public utility companies.
   That is, conducting tender procedures is beneficial to the Local Affairs
   Administration as less money of taxpayers is spent on the same public
   utility service.},

Abstract = {Combining the insights of EU-specific research on backsliding and
   coalitions with the literature on the international collaboration of
   autocrats, we argue that right-wing political leadership in Hungary and
   Poland have coalesced to advance their respective projects of democratic
   backsliding. We identify three distinct but intertwined uses of the
   coalition: (1) mutual protection afforded within the supranational arena
   aimed at limiting the EU's sanctioning capacities; (2) learning in the
   form of transfer of democratic backsliding policies; and (3) domestic
   legitimation. Three factors have driven coalescence patterns:
   intersecting interests, ideological proximity, and the EU's decision
   rules regarding sanctions.},

Abstract = {Policy termination is an understudied phenomenon. The literature
   identifies some factors that affect its likelihood, but others'
   importance, especially program evaluation, remain ambiguous. For
   insight, this study examines the impact of independent program
   evaluation on the termination of tax incentives for film and television
   production adopted and then terminated by multiple state governments.
   Empirical results indicate that termination was significantly more
   likely after an evaluation showed the incentive's costs exceeded its
   benefits. Results also indicate a contagion effect. Other factors,
   including the incentive's age and employment in the entertainment
   industry, reduced termination likelihood. These findings persisted
   through several robustness and sensitivity checks. Although critical
   program evaluation does not guarantee termination, it appears to make it
   a more likely outcome.},

Title = {Can leader-member exchange social comparison elicit uncivil employee
   behavior? The buffering role of aggression-preventive supervisor
   behavior},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {422-444},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to examine the role of leader-member exchange social
   comparison (LMXSC) perceptions in triggering the instigation of uncivil
   behavior in the workplace. This study also explores the intervening role
   of envy and the buffering role of aggression-preventive supervisor
   behavior within the proposed relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data were collected in two phases separated by an interval of four
   weeks. The final sample consisted of 224 full-time white-collar
   employees working in five large pharmaceutical manufacturing
   organizations in India.
   Findings
   The findings indicate that employees' subjective perceptions of being
   involved in poorer-quality LMX relationships than their workgroup
   members generate envy, which, in turn, evokes them to instigate uncivil
   behaviors onto those higher-LMX counterparts. The indirect effect of LMX
   social comparison on instigated workplace incivility through envy gets
   attenuated when supervisors engage in aggression-preventive behavior.
   Practical implications
   To protect organizations from the financial and productivity losses
   associated with incivility, supervisors are encouraged to exhibit
   aggression-preventive behavior if they form differentiated exchange
   relationships with the subordinates in their teams. Supervisors are
   further advised to avoid the altogether neglect of lower-LMX
   subordinates as doing so may give rise to negative emotions (envy) and
   behavior (incivility) among them.
   Originality/value
   This study expands the limited body of knowledge on the antecedents of
   uncivil employee behavior in the workplace. Specifically, it unveils
   that incivility toward coworkers may be stemming from unfavorable LMX
   social comparisons and ensuing negative emotions such as envy. It also
   offers insights on reducing uncivil behavior by highlighting that the
   impact of LMXSC and envy on incivility instigation gets buffered in the
   presence of aggression-preventive supervisor behavior.},

Abstract = {The World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism is based on
   either bilateral bargaining or third-party rulings by a panel or the
   Appellate Body. When do countries utilize the multilateral procedure,
   and under what conditions do they opt for a bilateral agreement?
   Departing from previous studies emphasizing the role of the complainant
   in shaping the course of the dispute settlement mechanism, this article
   offers an explanation based on the strategic choices of respondents.
   This study suggests that the domestic political interests of respondent
   governments determine the use of the dispute settlement mechanism's
   multilateral track. We argue that respondent governments choose the
   multilateral track to seek political cover for domestically unpopular
   concessions to a complainant. Such cover is required when (1) the
   dispute at stake has high public salience and (2) the respondent faces
   an upcoming election. Our hypotheses are tested using World Trade
   Organization's dispute cases from 1995 to 2017.},

Title = {Can Political Trust Help to Explain Elite Policy Support and Public
   Behaviour in Times of Crisis? Evidence from the United Kingdom at the
   Height of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic},

Abstract = {Trust between representatives and citizens is regarded as central to
   effective governance in times of peace and uncertainty. This article
   tests that assumption by engaging elite and mass perspectives to provide
   a 360-degree appraisal of vertical and horizontal policy coordination in
   a crisis scenario. Specifically, a multi-dimensional conception of
   political trust, anchored in psychological studies of interpersonal
   relations, is operationalised in the context of the United Kingdom's
   response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Detailed analysis of data
   collected from 1045 members of the public and more than 250 elected
   politicians suggests that particular facets of political trust and
   distrust may have contributed to levels of mass behavioural compliance
   and elite policy support in the UK at the height of the COVID-19 crisis.
   These findings help to evaluate policy success during a unique and
   challenging moment while contributing theoretically and methodologically
   to broader studies of political trust and governance.},

Abstract = {In The Fable of the Bees, Bernard Mandeville declared that `it is
   impossible we could be sociable Creatures without Hypocrisy'. Mandeville
   set out his ideas of sociability against Anthony Ashley Cooper, Third
   Earl of Shaftesbury, whose notions of virtue he dismissed as `a vast
   Inlet to Hypocrisy'. The main goal of this article is to reconstruct
   Mandeville's account of hypocrisy, first by explaining why he accords it
   such a prominent role in understanding our moral and social norms, and,
   second, by piecing together his criticisms of Shaftesbury's rival
   ethical theory. In doing so, the article outlines a more general
   Mandevillean framework for assessing when hypocrisy is likely to prove
   either socially beneficial or pernicious, while also examining what is
   at stake in choosing to expose rather than tolerate other people's
   hypocrisy.},

Abstract = {With the discovery of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits and the
   consequent expansion of the commodity frontiers in the past decade, a
   series of territorial disputes over the geological formation called Vaca
   Muerta has arisen in the province of Neuquen, Argentina, between oil
   companies, Mapuche indigenous communities, pastoralists, and the state.
   A general panorama of territorial conflict, state and parastate
   violence, tension, and negotiation among various actors in conflict in
   the department of Anelo suggests that violence in the territory is
   complex and multidimensional, since it supposes the superposition of its
   direct, structural, ecological, epistemic, and mercantilist forms.
   En la ultima decada, con el descubrimiento de yacimientos de
   hidrocarburos no convencionales y la consiguiente ampliacion de la
   frontera mercantil, se han generado en la provincia de Neuquen,
   Argentina, una serie de disputas territoriales en torno a la formacion
   geologica denominada Vaca Muerta entre empresas petroleras, comunidades
   indigenas mapuche, crianceros y diferentes niveles del Estado. Un
   panorama general de la conflictividad territorial, violencias estatales
   y para-estatales, procesos de tension y negociacion entre los diferentes
   actores en pugna del departamento de Anelo sugiere que la violencia en
   el territorio es de caracter complejo y multidimensional pues supone la

Abstract = {Recognition of aspiring states from established countries is central to
   becoming a member state of the international system. Previous research
   suggests that great power recognition decisions regarding aspiring
   states rapidly converge toward either recognition or non-recognition,
   yet great power convergence has still not occurred in the case of Kosovo
   after more than ten years. Unilateral secessions typically remain wholly
   unrecognized, since they violate the norm of home state consent, yet
   Kosovo has now been recognized by more than 100 countries. Why do some
   countries extend recognition to unilateral secessions, and do so early,
   whereas others delay recognition or withhold it altogether? In the case
   of Kosovo, great power influence and contestation, rather than
   convergence, have played a key role in shaping recognition decisions. We
   argue that countries in the US sphere of influence, with strong economic
   and military ties, are more likely to recognize Kosovo and to do so
   relatively fast, whereas countries influenced by Russia are less likely
   to recognize Kosovo at all, or to do so only after an extended delay.
   However, great powers are not equal in influencing other states to adopt
   their preferred position, since the USA is more powerful than Russia and
   can benefit from working alongside allies within the Western-oriented
   world order. We estimate a non-proportional Cox model with new
   time-varying data on Kosovo recognition and provide evidence that US
   military ties influenced other countries in extending recognition to
   unilateral secession.},

Abstract = {This article examines institutional activism between 2011 and 2018 in
   two Brazilian government programs, `Green Grants' and the `Stork
   Network'. Institutional activism is defined as collective action in the
   defense of contentious causes conducted within the boundaries of state
   institutions. The two policies were designed and implemented by
   bureaucrats committed to social movement causes, environmentalism and
   women's health, respectively. The environmentalist bureaucrats were
   mostly permanent public employees with few ties to movement networks,
   while the women's health group included mostly temporary employees with
   long histories of civil society activism. I argue that diverse locations
   in state institutions and movement networks gave these groups access to
   different combinations of institutional and relational resources. In
   dialogue with theories of situated agency and activist strategy, I show
   how those differences both led actors to engage in different kinds of
   strategies and influenced the way those strategies changed as political
   conditions became increasingly hostile.},

Abstract = {The various experiments in community defense of organized groups in
   Guerrero and Michoacan, Mexico, to confront the insecurity produced by
   organized crime are occurring in a social setting in which legality and
   illegality are blurred-a grey area- as a function of regional economic
   reconfigurations that have fostered violence. The state uneasily
   tolerates the emergence of armed defense groups in the region by
   attempting to subject them to the model of citizen participation in
   security matters. Understanding these groups calls for supplementing
   current views about their various forms, which focus on their
   legality/illegality, with an emphasis on the relationship between them
   and the society and its dominant actors.
   Los diversos experimentos en defensa comunitaria de grupos organizados
   en Guerrero y Michoacan, Mexico, para enfrentar la inseguridad producida
   por el crimen organizado ocurren en un entorno social, un area gris en
   la que la legalidad y la ilegalidad se difuminan en funcion de las
   reconfiguraciones economicas regionales que han fomentado la violencia.
   El Estado tolera con incertidumbre el surgimiento de grupos de defensa
   armados en la region al tratar de someterlos a un modelo de
   participacion ciudadana en asuntos de seguridad. Para entender a estos
   grupos es necesario complementar los puntos de vista actuales sobre las
   diversas formas que toman, centrados en su legalidad o ilegalidad, con
   un enfasis en la relacion entre ellos y la sociedad con sus actores
   dominantes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes recent trends of democratic backsliding within the
   European Union (EU). While some scholars highlight threats to the rule
   of law and judicial independence as the key development and problem,
   others focus on elite discourse and partisan competition. We provide a
   comprehensive analysis of the essence of democratic backsliding by
   analyzing changes between 1990 and 2019 on key indicators of democracy -
   polyarchy, liberalism, participation, deliberation and egalitarianism -
   documented in the V-Dem dataset, within the European Union. We find that
   democratic backsliding at its core is structured by a deterioration of
   the quality of deliberation. Deliberation is also the component where EU
   member states differ amongst each other the most and which has featured
   the greatest deterioration in recent years. We conclude by spelling out
   the implications this has for EU policy.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the strategies of civil
   service reforms in Hong Kong and Thailand. It seeks to identify the
   drivers of reforms in the two cases and explain the divergence in
   processes that were intended to achieve similar ends.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a case study approach
   along with a thorough review of the literature. It is based on secondary
   materials, including academic studies, government publications and
   websites, and media reports. It compares approaches, strategies and
   outcomes of civil service reforms in Hong Kong and Thailand. Findings
   Civil service reforms in Hong Kong focused on improving management
   through the implementation of New Public Management (NPM) principles,
   while governance values were prominent in civil service reforms in
   Thailand. Originality/value This paper compares civil service reforms in
   two dissimilar Asian cases. It highlights the impact of global trends on
   traditional bureaucratic organizations and reform strategies, and
   recognizes the impacts of traditions, culture and capacity on civil
   service reforms.},

Abstract = {This article reviews how Beijing's design of a liberal autocracy
   constrains party development in Hong Kong. It shows how the governing
   philosophy and the institutional design and mechanics of the electoral
   system disallow a strong governing party and suppress political
   participation. This situation brings about a weakened state capacity and
   a fragmented ruling coalition with elites working on contrasting
   incentives. It also leads to legislative fragmentation and declining
   public confidence in legislative and party politics. Unable to contain
   political participation, radical street actions arose to challenge the
   government. The 2019 Anti-Extradition Movement best exemplifies the
   weakness of the ruling coalition and the radicalization of street
   politics posing major challenges to the governance of Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {One recurring theme of the immediate post-9/11 environment was that of
   regional political organizations and violent lone-wolf actors pledging
   allegiance to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda group (AQ). Following the
   Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)'s 2014 capture of Mosul, Iraq,
   many of these loose affiliations began shifting to ISIS. This resulted
   in a blurring of distinctions between different types of Sunni jihadi
   organizations, with media commentators and analysts at times referring
   to groups as ``Al Qaeda-like{''} or ``ISIS-affiliated,{''} despite those
   groups' goals and operational scopes being largely disconnected from
   both AQ and ISIS. This article proposes a new typology of Sunni jihadi
   groups according to theater of operation, strategy, and geopolitical
   alignment. This typology offers three categories: global jihad, local
   jihad, and sectarian jihad. In addition, it identifies four types of
   operation types that Sunni jihadi groups adopt: (1) core theater
   attacks, (2) power-projection attacks, (3) local recruitment, and (4)
   foreign recruitment. The main contribution of this article is its
   frameworks for improving the quality of the analysis of Sunni jihadi
   groups.},

Abstract = {Which membership-based voluntary organizations constitutive of civil
   society such as parties, interest groups or service-oriented
   organizations keep their members active and which forms of activism do
   they cultivate? This article addresses this important question
   distinguishing two forms of `member activism': `member involvement',
   defined as members working for an organization, and `member influence',
   defined as members' participation in intra-organizational
   decision-making. Building on incentive-theoretical approaches to
   leader-member relations and resource dependency theory, we present a
   theoretical framework specifying distinct drivers of each form of member
   activism, which is tested using new data from four organization surveys
   conducted in four most different European democracies. None of the
   theorized factors has the same robust effect on both involvement and
   influence. Most notably, professionalization - reliance on paid staff -
   has a positive effect on involvement and a negative one on influence,
   stressing the need to distinguish carefully the different roles members
   play in civil society organizations.},

Abstract = {EU health policy is a policy forged in crisis. Whilst maintaining the
   strict limitations on the EU's role that are described in the treaties,
   crises have historically been followed by incremental but integrative
   policy change. Given this trend, should we be expecting a radical
   expansion of EU health policy in the aftermath of Covid-19? And, if so,
   what parameters and characteristics might this new agenda have? As we
   enter the period in which the EU will try to elaborate its new health
   policy, this paper uses a Complexity perspective to assess how the
   emerging agenda compares to existing and historical EU action on health,
   the kind of decision-making that we are likely to see in the different
   areas of action, and the limitations of EU health policy development as
   it pushes into more political and complex areas of policy.},

Abstract = {The field of deliberative democracy has long recognised the role of
   interruptive protests to make polities more sensitive to good reasons.
   But how exactly interruptive protests enhance deliberative systems
   remain an open question. `Non-deliberative acts may have deliberative
   consequences' is a crucial line of argument in the deliberative systems
   literature, but the precise character of these consequences is yet to be
   spelled out. In this article, I describe three ways in which
   consequences of interruptive protests enhance the deliberative system. I
   argue that interruptive protests can redistribute (1) voice and
   visibility, (2) attention, and (3) deliberative agency which, in turn,
   can lay bare the weaknesses of a dysfunctional deliberative system. The
   arguments I put forward are based on interpretive case studies focusing
   on protest movements in the Philippines and Puerto Rico in the aftermath
   of record-breaking hurricanes. Overall, this paper seeks to clarify the
   relationship between deliberative politics and protest action, by
   identifying the distinctive contributions of interruptive protests in
   redistributing power in dysfunctional deliberative systems.},

Pages = {367-384},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Citizenship has been treated, since World War II, as a robust political
   and legal status. Recent political events have prompted the reassessment
   of the conditions under which it can be justly removed, however. Using
   the lens of democratic theory, I consider one particular instance of
   denationalization, namely, the withdrawal of citizenship from
   naturalized citizens when the granting state believes that the applicant
   `misrepresented' themselves, that is, engaged in some form of deception,
   during the process of naturalization. There is an intuitive plausibility
   to the thought that if an applicant for citizenship lies or fails to
   provide all of the requested information, she should be denied
   citizenship. It seems equally plausible that, if citizenship status is
   nevertheless granted under these conditions, it can be permissibly
   removed. However, I argue that this conclusion is too quick: to be
   permissible, denaturalization procedures must be significantly
   constrained, in the ways that I outline.},

Abstract = {Ideological polarization is a crucial aspect of party systems that
   varies over time and between party systems. Experts have tended to
   highlight its negative effect. This article proposes an alternative
   view, focusing on a possible positive effect, by relating polarization
   to the existence of differentiated ideological options that would
   increase the inclusiveness of the party system as a whole and make a
   positive contribution to satisfaction with democracy. With polarization
   data calculated from the positions of the parliamentary elites of
   sixteen party systems, the analysis addresses the relationship between
   polarization and the quality of democracy. The result suggests the
   relevance of this relationship and the need to reconsider the mechanical
   interpretation of the negative effects of polarization.},

Abstract = {Within the framework of the recommendations of the European Commission
   for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) for the reform of justice in the
   Member States of the Council of Europe, the Protocol of Collaboration
   for Monitoring the Means of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) was
   stablished in Portugal. The objective of this article was to measure and
   model the ADR Means users' satisfaction in Portugal, applying the
   Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) methodology to the data collected
   through the protocol. The scale and model proposed by Catarino and
   Correia (2017) for the Arbitration have been adapted here for all the
   ADR Means - Arbitration, Conciliation and Mediation (between October
   2013 and July 2017). The results obtained have enable to revalidate the
   adapted scale and model, concluding that the users have been ``very
   satisfied{''} with the seven dimensions of ADR Means (Information,
   Operation, Manager, Resources, Facilities, General Aspects and Loyalty).
   This work contributes to meet the recommendations of CEPEJ (2010 and
   2014) and to extent the results of Catarino and Correia (2017) in a set
   of ADR Means and in a longer time lapse.},

Abstract = {The international governance of artificial intelligence (AI) is at a
   crossroads: should it remain fragmented or be centralised? We draw on
   the history of environment, trade, and security regimes to identify
   advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some
   considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak for
   centralisation. The risk of creating a slow and brittle institution, and
   the difficulty of pairing deep rules with adequate participation, speak
   against it. Other considerations depend on the specific design. A
   centralised body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy
   coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial, and fragmented
   institutions could self-organise. In sum, these trade-offs should inform
   development of the AI governance architecture, which is only now
   emerging. We apply the trade-offs to the case of the potential
   development of high-level machine intelligence. We conclude with two
   recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a
   central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set
   of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate
   structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second,
   fragmentation will likely persist for now. The developing landscape
   should be monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply
   inadequate.},

Abstract = {How do practices change? To approach this in practice theory (PT) is a
   widely debated question. This article brings PT in conversation with the
   study of emotions in International Relations by considering the role of
   affect in practice changes. For it is affect that permeates the
   placiotemporal and bodily constellations during practice performances,
   continuously provoking changes in and through practices. In initiating
   this conversation, this article adds to current PT literature by arguing
   that world political transformations not only find their origin in
   external conditions, identified as such through individual reflection,
   but also in affective dynamics of the everyday. To elaborate this more
   theoretical argument, this article evolves against the empirical
   backdrop of dancing as an everyday international practice at the
   Congress of Vienna (1814-1815). Affect that permeated dances in Vienna
   not only substantiated changes in this practice but, with the waltz
   replacing the minuet as the preferred dance among international
   political decision-makers, also changes through it occurred. While the
   minuet embodied collective sentiments of a transboundary European elite,
   the waltz helped to further national imaginations of world politics.},

Abstract = {With the emergence of a series of global security incidents, scholars
   and observers have placed increasing importance on nontraditional
   security (NTS). Since 2012, Xi Jinping's regime has emphasized NTS
   issues and cooperation, which begs the question ``What is the role of
   NTS in China's foreign policy, and how is it shaped?{''} This study
   analyzes articles that include the term ``nontraditional security{''}
   ({''}(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic){''}) inThe People's Dailynewspaper since
   its first mention in 2001. Focusing particularly on the period between
   2012 and 2019, the study explains China's securitization process and its
   motivations toward NTS issues. By analyzing case studies of the NTS
   issues of terrorism, environmental issues, and cybersecurity, and
   further summarizing the logic in common behind the Chinese government's
   process of securitizing NTS issues, this paper highlights the
   correlation between the characteristics of China's NTS and China's major
   foreign policy initiatives that play an active role in leading
   international efforts to enhance global governance and exploring new
   models of cooperation. Based on an analysis of China's emphasis on
   promotion of NTS and provision of public goods, I argue that NTS has
   played an increasingly important role in China's pursuit of greater
   influence in global governance mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has ushered in a global rise in state
   surveillance. In an effort to trace the spread of the disease and to
   enforce lockdowns, governments in democracies and autocracies alike have
   turned to surveillance technologies such as contact tracing apps.
   Governments have also tightened their hold on communication flows in
   other ways, through censorship and information manipulation. These kinds
   of government actions are not new: States have long recognized the value
   of controlling information in times of crisis. In this article, we
   consider these tactics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in
   which, unlike most other security threats, the threat posed is not
   endogenous to governance and applies to all countries. We consider how
   observations from this context prompt future research and reflect on the
   implications of information control for civil liberties.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, Hungary and Poland have developed a distinctive populist
   economic program, which has begun to spread to other Central and East
   European Countries (CEECs). This article develops a theory of the
   political economy of populism in CEECs, arguing that these countries'
   dependence on foreign capital constrained them to follow (neo)liberal
   economic policies. After the global financial crisis, populist parties
   began to break from the (neo)liberal consensus, `thickening' their
   populist agenda to include an economic program based on a conservative
   developmental statism. Case studies of Hungary, Poland, and Serbia
   describe these policies and show that they exhibit a particular form of
   economic nationalism that emphasizes workforce activation, natalism, and
   sovereignty. This shift has gone hand-in-hand with attempts to attract
   investments from Eastern authoritarian states, illustrating the
   connection between CEEC development strategies and sources of foreign
   capital.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the economic crisis of 2014-2016, the Russian government
   implemented tough austerity measures, earning the praise of the
   International Monetary Fund. However, the spending cuts were unevenly
   distributed across different welfare programmes, budget levels (i.e.
   federal and regional) as well as across different Russian regions. The
   article argues that this distribution is indicative of a consistent
   strategy of blame avoidance similar to that of the Western democracies.
   Specifically, the most politically sensitive budget outlays, such as
   pension spending, were largely protected from cuts, while areas less
   visible to voters, such as education, were disproportionately affected
   by austerity measures. Furthermore, the federal centre shifted the
   burden of austerity to the regions, turning regional governors into
   scapegoats for the federal policies. Nevertheless, in some instances
   fiscal considerations trumped political risk, as even cash benefits
   (apart from pensions) experienced deep cuts. Furthermore, the analysis
   of the regional spending patterns reveals that some regional governments
   tried to stimulate the local economy during the crisis. However, this
   led to even more stringent welfare austerity policies than in other
   regions.},

Abstract = {The expansive literature on law and justice across Africa emphasizes why
   people do not use lower state courts. Consequently, a striking lack of
   attention is paid to how and why people do engage with lower state
   courts. Drawing on a systematic literature review and a multi-sited
   qualitative study, we make three contributions on this topic. First, we
   explore how this academic gap emerged. Second, we critique the
   procedural justice model that currently underlies much `access to
   justice' programming, which seeks to improve citizens' engagements with
   the courts. In place of what we describe as its arithmetic assumptions
   about institutional engagement, value, and legitimacy, we propose a
   trifactor framework. Citizen engagement, we argue, occurs as people
   reconcile how they think the courts should act, how they expect them to
   act, and how they need them to act in any given instance. Third, drawing
   on our empirical studies, we highlight that this framework is flexible
   enough to capture people's actually existing decision-making in a wide
   variety of settings and to map how those trade-offs shift throughout the
   process of their case, providing important insights into ideas of
   justice and statehood.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the drivers of pro-worker reforms in Vietnam. It
   shows how commerce, trade deals, aid and geopolitics strengthened
   support for higher wages, social dialogue and freedom of association.
   Strikes have triggered Government concerns about regime legitimacy.
   Manufactures are also keen to resolve strikes and propitiate
   reputation-conscious buyers. Reform was further incentivized by TPP's
   stipulation of Freedom of Association, together with economic and
   geopolitical incentives to join TPP. Donor-supported pilots have not
   motivated reform, but are nonetheless important: enabling reformists to
   explore new ideas; iteratively adapt; garner evidence of what furthers
   their priorities; with which they can persuade anxious colleagues. None
   of these forces are deterministic. They merely stimulate debate,
   authorize experimentation and are used by coalitions to push for reform.
   By tracing the politics of pro-worker reforms, this study draws
   attention to drivers often overlooked by donors: strikes, commerce, and
   trade deals.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on the past, present, and potential future of global
   governance, its historical practices and principles, the interests it
   has served, and who/what it has included/excluded or marginalized. It
   initially explores ontological, conceptual, and normative issues, and
   how these have been historically connected to the dynamics of world
   orders, patterns of global governance, and global capitalism. It
   reflects on developments from the eleventh century up to World War II
   and critically appraises presently dominant principles and practices of
   global governance, in order to highlight key questions concerning the
   future. The essay asks whether current practices are in contradiction to
   the material and human interests and indeed the very survival of
   humankind and the integrity of the planet, its biosphere, and its
   life-forms. It concludes by identifying some forms of political agency
   that might help reshape governance towards more equitable, socially just
   and sustainable planetary governance.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes discussions around the documentary filmShoah, by
   Claude Lanzmann, conducted in the uncensored press in communist Poland.
   In the literature on the subject, a popular thesis claims that the
   democratic opposition in Poland, like the authorities of the Polish
   People's Republic, subjected this film to explicit criticism. The
   authors' research into discussions about the Holocaust in the Polish
   independent press leads to the opposite conclusion. Ours analysis shows
   that authors publishing in the underground press had varied reactions to
   Lanzmann's film. Voices opposing the official campaign against the
   director and his film predominate (which did not mean a complete lack of
   criticism vis-a-vis some of the movie's features). We found only two
   opinions that can be considered clearly negative. The debate about
   Lanzmann's film is important because it shows the complexity of the
   democratic opposition's attitude of toward Polish-Jewish history and
   memory. In the opposition elite's view of history, two currents ran in
   parallel, often in statements authored by the same people. On the one
   hand, the trend was primarily affirmative, as a reaction to the
   communist propaganda that bypassed or completely distorted some aspects
   of Polish history. On the other hand, there was also a tendency to
   include more controversial or even clearly shameful aspects of the
   history of Poland.},

Abstract = {The Czech Republic is one of many states where the new legal regulation
   of tourist taxes was introduced to limit the shortcomings of the
   original regulation. The aim of this paper is to define the
   opportunities and threats of the new regulation in the Czech Republic in
   the area of tourist taxes. To achieve the purpose of this article, the
   tourist tax is defined and Czech legal regulation valid until the end of
   2019 and since 2020 in the given area is analysed. The hypothesis that
   the new regulation is perfect and ideal for the tax administration and
   for the municipalities was confirmed only partially. While most of the
   critical issues were solved and the new tourist charge is a good step
   for both municipalities and the tax administration, the charge rate of
   21 CZK in 2020, resp. 50 CZK in the following years is not adequate.
   With the new regulation, municipalities got new opportunities, primarily
   to increase their revenues. The single tourist charge makes the system
   easier for all stakeholders: for municipalities, for tourists, and for
   quartermasters. Issues arise especially concerning the simplified
   evidence and the non-chargeable long-term stays. Municipalities should
   be particularly careful when defining the exemptions and differentiating
   the charge rate for specific dates in the year, or specific parts of the
   municipality. The unequal treatment might be seen as discrimination or
   even unfair public incentive.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the potential impact of individuals exercising their
   mandate and running for re-election (incumbents) on the
   instrumentalization of the electoral competition. The context chosen for
   this analysis is provided by local elections and by mechanisms used by
   politicians to improve their electoral chances. As in other types of
   elections, the personal dimension of manipulation in local elections is
   asymmetrical in its nature. Due to their position and resources held,
   incumbents are the ones who have a higher manipulative potential than
   their challengers. The aim of the paper is to analyze the advantage of
   incumbents in local elections by indicating the electoral manipulations
   used with regard to three basic types: institutional, communicative, and
   psychological. The analysis is conducted on the basis of Polish
   electoral experience and illustrated with examples justifying the
   importance of the individual manipulations in the electoral competition.},

Abstract = {Existing research provides no systematic insights into if and how
   mediation impedes battle-related deaths. Therefore, this article
   presents a temporally disaggregated analysis and assesses the effect of
   mediation on monthly fatal violence. The article predicts that
   adversaries evaluate opponents' trustworthiness from both fighting and
   negotiation behavior. It argues that reducing fighting intensity during
   negotiations is a sign of cooperation, which can be negotiated by
   mediators to build trust. Over the course of mediation, the content of
   negotiations provides information about how genuinely a conflict party
   is interested in conflict resolution. Only if mediation achieves
   negotiation of core incompatibilities will conflict parties be willing
   to reduce fighting intensity. Under these conditions, information
   revealed in a mediation process can build trust and substantively reduce
   violence. An empirical analysis of all African conflicts between 1993
   and 2007 supports this prediction and shows that on average mediation is
   followed by substantive and lasting reductions in fatal violence, if
   mediation discusses the conflict's main incompatibility. In contrast,
   mediation on other topics is associated with a small, fleeting reduction
   in violence. Data of battle-related fatalities in Syria during
   negotiations as well as qualitative evidence further support the
   theoretical mechanism and the model prediction. The study concludes that
   mediation can reduce conflict intensity substantively, if it achieves
   exchange between conflict parties on the main conflict issues.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have proposed myriad solutions for mitigating
   intergroup conflicts. While the literature, such as studies on
   intergroup contact theory, focuses on intergroup relations, we argue
   that it is important not to ignore intragroup relations that may benefit
   or undermine the improvement of intergroup relations at the same time.
   In this paper, we investigate a typology of eight mechanisms for the
   behavior of intergroup and intragroup relations. Specifically, we
   focused on interactions in a triad consisting of an actor paired up with
   two alters-one ingroup and one outgroup. The triadic network enabled us
   to theorize and test how intergroup and intragroup relations coevolve.
   We conducted a vignette experiment to test the intergroup relationship
   between mainland Chinese and Taiwanese. We found strong evidence for one
   mechanism for improving intergroup hostility: indirect
   reciprocity-people rewarded the outgroup for behaving friendly to their
   ingroup peers. Using agent-based simulation, we predicted that the
   triadic effect found in the one-shot experiment can continuously improve
   and stabilize intergroup relations over time.},

Abstract = {Sovereignism is at the crux of the current wave of radical right-wing
   populism. Populist parties advocate `taking back control' and generally
   do so in the name of the `people', pledging to restore economic
   well-being. This article argues that populism and sovereignism are
   inherently connected in radical right-wing populism politics through a
   set of values that emphasize popular and national sovereignty. To test
   the empirical validity of our proposition, we focus on two established
   European radical right-wing populist parties, namely the Rassemblement
   National in France and the Swiss People's Party and use data from an
   original survey. We find that while Rassemblement National and Swiss
   People's Party voters diverge in general economic orientations, they
   share similar economic populist sovereignist values that significantly
   shape electoral support for those parties. These findings suggest that
   economic populist sovereignism may represent an important driver of
   support for the radical right-wing populism, alongside other correlates
   of radical right-wing populism voting, such as perceived immigration
   threat.},

Abstract = {The US engages in extensive training and education of foreign
   militaries, often through exchange programs carried out at the different
   military services' staff and war colleges. Researchers have recently
   explored the way in which military training can affect civil-military
   relations in the host country, but not much work has studied whether
   military training actually leads to increased US influence in these
   states. This paper proposes a soft-power theoretical framework to argue
   that foreign military training can create affinity for the U.S. that can
   in turn result in more pro-U.S. voting behavior in the UN General
   Assembly. It further expands on the military training literature by
   distinguishing between different military training programs.},

Abstract = {This study argues that the effect of third-party trade on dyadic
   conflicts is conditional on the naval power of both the potential
   conflict initiator and its target state. This conditional effect occurs
   mainly because naval power allows trade-integrated initiators to reduce
   their trade dependence on a given trade partner and its allies more
   easily. At the same time, the target's naval power increases the costs
   that conflict inflict on the initiator's trade. As maritime trade
   accounts for about 80 percent of world trade volume, naval capability
   has an important effect on combatant states' ability to substitute
   trading partners during a conflict and to mitigate trade-related costs,
   thereby affecting the relationship between third-party trade and
   conflict. The findings of our statistical analyses support our
   theoretical expectation that the pacifying effect of third-party trade
   diminishes as the initiator's naval power increases, yet increases as
   the naval power of the potential target increases.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the wave of strikes that flooded Poland in 1980
   and their effect on the birth of a social movement. It retraces the
   process of emerging protests and their spread throughout factories and
   regions. It also discusses the role of the Interfactory Strike
   Committees and shows the mechanisms of circulation of newsletters and
   leaflets published by strikers. The article demonstrates how the spread
   of information influenced the rate and scale of mobilization. The author
   focuses on the role of social networks and the mechanisms that enabled
   diffusion of the elements of this social movement. The spread of the
   protests to other cities relied largely on direct contact between
   individual factories but was also facilitated by the independent press
   and audio recordings. The analysis also addresses the role of
   ``brokers,{''} that is, people who disseminated information about the
   strike and increased the range of the protests. These ``political
   tourists{''} observed the protests while on vacation or on business at
   the seaside and, on returning home, reported what they had seen, often
   bringing back strike-related information leaflets. The other group
   comprised ``political emissaries{''} or people who intentionally
   established contact between individual protest centres. The article thus
   retraces the emergence of Solidarity starting from spontaneous strikes
   to the formation of a nationwide organization.},

Title = {Backlash against naming and shaming: The politics of status and emotion},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {644-653},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The most prominent approach to promoting human rights features the
   naming and shaming of perpetrators of abuses and those who abet them,
   including the tactic of ranking non-compliant states relative to their
   peers to undermine their international status. Neither activists nor the
   scholars who study them have paid much attention to the emotional
   dynamics of the targeted group, and in particular to the emotions of
   shame and shaming, nor to the sociological mechanisms that underpin the
   politics of status and status competition. This article draws upon
   relatively ignored, yet mainstream theoretical literatures in
   psychology, social psychology, and sociology in arguing that naming and
   shaming tactics often lead to backlash by those who are targeted.
   Transnational human rights advocacy commonly appeals to the norms of
   exporting society. On the recipient side, this external outrage plays
   into the hands of elites in a traditional power structure, drawing
   energy from outrage at loss of status in a way that motivates widespread
   popular backlash. The backlash narrative alters public discourse,
   reinvigorates and reshapes traditional institutions, and in these ways
   locks in and perpetuates patterns that leave the progressive namers and
   shamers farther from their goals. Beyond arguing that this is a common
   pattern, I will also investigate the conditions and tactics that are
   less likely to spur counterproductive backlash.},

Abstract = {This article engages in a critical reflection on children's right to
   participation, focusing on their participation in three key
   spaces-streets, online spaces, and schools. These spaces are mentioned
   frequently in UN documents, yet the principle of protection tends to
   trump that of participation when it comes to children's activity in
   these spaces. Such treatment would not only underestimate the
   participatory dynamics of these spaces but also reinforce the dominant
   understanding of children as vulnerable, passive, and immature beings.
   By critically examining UNICEF's annual report, ``The State of the
   World's Children,{''} through a qualitative content analysis and drawing
   on recent counterexamples of children's activities in these spaces, this
   article reconceptualizes the participatory capacities of these spaces.},

Abstract = {How do political economic institutions and different types of
   institutional complementarity in particular influence firm behavior?
   Existing studies do not offer much help in answering this question. In
   this research, we systematically connect institutional complementarity
   and its two distinct logics (the logic of reinforcement and the logic of
   compensation) to firm performance. Using a sample of more than fourteen
   thousand firms from twenty advanced industrial democracies, our
   empirical analysis finds that institutional complementarity is related
   to firm performance in a distinct way. That is, the different logics of
   institutional complementarity apply only to specific segments of the
   economy. While the logic of reinforcement works for small firms and
   labor-intensive firms, the logic of compensation favors large firms and
   capital-intensive firms. The empirical novelty of our research lies in
   offering a cross-national, firm-level and large-n analysis of
   institutional complementarity. Theoretically, our finding of firm
   heterogeneity helps in establishing the boundary conditions of
   institutional complementarity and hence advances the general
   understanding of the subject.},

Title = {Transfer 2.0: Applying the Concept of Transfer from Track-Two Workshops
   to Inclusive Peace Negotiations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {This article argues that the scholarly study of ``transfer{''} from
   track-two workshops to track-one negotiations is highly applicable to
   the study of transfer from other modalities of participation to
   track-one in inclusive peace negotiations. During the last decade, other
   approaches to make negotiations more inclusive have also been
   increasingly employed, such as national dialogue conferences, variety of
   consultation mechanisms, or a diverse set of peace commissions. In this
   paper, we aim to expand the conceptualization of transfer beyond ICR
   workshops and discuss how the knowledge accumulated concerning transfer
   in the ICR literature during the last decades can be applied to
   understand and evaluate transfer from other inclusion modalities used in
   peace negotiations today. We therefore make a distinction between the
   first generation of transfer (1.0) developed by the ICR workshops
   scholars and practitioners and the transfer process from other
   modalities used in inclusive negotiations (2.0). To apply the lessons
   learned from transfer 1.0 to 2.0, we start with an overview of the
   concept as developed in track-two literature. We then suggest a
   conceptualization of transfer 2.0, based on insights from how it has
   unfolded in five of the seven inclusion modalities examined in our
   comparative case study. We discuss the similarities and differences
   between transfer 1.0 and 2.0 and how transfer 2.0 can be studied,
   including and beyond track-two initiatives. We conclude by suggesting a
   number of directions for future research on transfer 2.0 that are
   relevant to several inclusion modalities.},

Abstract = {The generosity of maternity pay has been shown to be an important factor
   for mothers' attachment to the labour market. In the UK, we can observe
   that the generosity of maternity leaves across universities varies
   greatly: some universities top up the statutory maternity pay with
   longer and better paid leaves, others are either less generous or only
   entitle academic women to the legal minimum. We want to understand why
   this is the case. Therefore, this article examines both theoretically
   and empirically how higher education employers decide about the
   generosity of the offered occupational maternity pay. We use a
   bargaining approach to model the supply and demand side of generous
   maternity benefits in universities with different characteristics and
   test the implications with a generalised negative binomial model. We
   find that universities' income does not account for this variation while
   differences in terms of costs and benefits for employers do. Most
   importantly, our results show that more research intense universities
   with a higher previous share of female professors provide more generous
   maternity pay. We offer a range of explanations for these findings.},

Title = {What Isn't a Norm? Redefining the Conceptual Boundaries of ``Norms{''}
   in the Human Rights Literature},

Abstract = {What makes the ``norm{''} a distinct concept? How do norms differ from
   other aspects of the moral and social fabric of society? In this article
   I argue that imposing stricter boundaries on the norm concept could have
   significant analytical payoffs, especially in the human rights
   literature. Greater conceptual clarity on the boundaries of the norm
   concept highlights three important distinctions: the difference between
   norms and moral principles, norms and supererogatory standards, and
   norms and formal law. Clarifying what a norm is (and, importantly, what
   it is not) improves our analytic equipment and theories, but the inquiry
   is not purely a theoretical exercise. Clarifying the norm concept
   enables us to ask new questions about, and rethink old findings on
   issues like the role of shaming in human rights advocacy, the origins of
   norms and challenges to their construction, what constitutes evidence of
   the existence of a norm, and whether, in fact, all human rights have
   been translated into norms.},

Abstract = {The Railroad Economic Belt (REB,yilu yidai) was initiated by the China
   Railway Corporation to support the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The
   goal of REB is to enhance interconnectivity and deepen the BRI's
   infiltration through the export of `China Standards' (zhongguo biaozhun)
   in railway development. This paper focuses on China's export of the
   `China Standard' in highspeed rail and the further integration of
   Eurasia through the China Railway Express (zhong'ou banlie). It examines
   their implications on the global highspeed rail market and global
   logistics governance, respectively. Indeed, China can become a
   rule-maker in some functional domains of global governance. This paper
   argues that the expansion of Chinese standards has been done through a
   `top-level design' approach. Chinese economic statecraft focused on
   strengthening policy guidance and power concentration at the central
   level. Standards that are competing in nature face daunting challenges
   as they have receive backlashes from international competitors. On the
   other hand, those that are complementary have been much more receptive
   to international actors.},

Abstract = {Do management practices have similar anticorruption effects in OECD and
   developing countries? Despite prominent cautions against ``New
   Zealand{''} reforms which enhance managerial discretion in developing
   countries, scholars have not assessed this question statistically. Our
   article addresses this gap through a conjoint experiment with 6,500
   public servants in three developing countries and one OECD country. Our
   experiment assesses Weberian relative to managerial approaches to
   recruitment, job stability, and pay. We argue that in developing
   countries with institutionalized corruption and weak rule of law-yet not
   OECD countries without such features-{''}unprincipled{''} principals use
   managerial discretion over hiring, firing, and pay to favor
   ``unprincipled{''} bureaucratic agents who engage in corruption. Our
   results support this argument: managerial practices are associated with
   greater bureaucratic corruption in our surveyed developing countries,
   yet have little effect in our OECD country. Alleged ``best practices{''}
   in public management in OECD countries may thus be ``worst practices{''}
   in developing countries.},

Abstract = {Ambiguity in policy formulation is a strategy setup with multifarious
   institutional flexibilities that maintain the credibility of functioning
   institutions. In the framework of the `credibility thesis' as introduced
   by Peter Ho, this article posits that Chinese policymakers intentionally
   or unintentionally made a smart choice in coining the highly ambiguous
   term `TVEs' for promoting institutional reforms on property rights, and
   providing a unique buffering effect for a (comparatively) smooth policy
   transition towards increasingly liberal reform agendas. Furthermore,
   TVEs' content was evolving through time and consistently adapting to the
   interactions among various stakeholders in the reform process. The
   conceptual `3C' model of strategic ambiguity in policy formulation
   elaborated by the evidence of TVEs might be an approach for China's
   policy studies.},

Abstract = {In the post-Cold War era, ``Jihadi-Salafi Groups{''} (JSGs) have emerged
   as significant ``violence-making{''} organizations. Almost all JSGs have
   emerged in highly fragile states. The literature on the state
   fragility-terrorism nexus, by focusing exclusively on whether state
   fragility is a cause of terrorism or not, has failed to consider the
   broader impact of state fragility on the emergence of JSGs. The role of
   state fragility as a condition of the emergence of JSGs, in particular,
   is mostly overlooked in the literature. This paper, adding state
   fragility as a condition variable to the causal model of the rise of
   JSGs, fills this gap. The empirical basis of this research includes a
   single case study examining the relationship between state fragility in
   the post-Saddam Iraq and the formation of Islamic State (IS). By adding
   a new variable to the causal model of the rise of IS, this research
   makes a strong within-case inference concerning this case. Although the
   empirical basis of this research includes a single case study, the
   analytical framework developed in this paper has possible implications
   for studying a larger number of Jihadi-Salafi groups.},

Abstract = {This essay uses the official reports as well as sources from the
   intelligence services to provide a clearer picture of the working
   circumstances of the Belgian intelligence and security services and the
   pressure they were under to deal with the challenges posed by violent
   radicalisation and terrorist plots since the emergence of the foreign
   fighters phenomenon. It will be shown how mounting pressure from the
   rapidly expanding threat exacerbated the gradual exhaustion of the
   security services by structural issues of unaddressed organisational
   difficulties, and budget restrictions faced with increasing workloads.
   Due to the high number of foreign fighters, belated initiatives taken to
   assess the threat were impeded by barriers to information exchange,
   unclear guidance, and data overload. The failure of Belgian intelligence
   to detect the attack plans was more a symptom of policy failure than the
   underachievement of the services. A concluding section will reflect upon
   the inadequacy and lateness of policy responses because of a Belgian
   tendency to understate security.},

Abstract = {The attempt to introduce federalism in Iraq to peacefully deal with
   internal diversity and to stabilise the country has largely failed. The
   constitution of 2005, which directly resulted from the intervention of
   the USA and their allies, was unsuccessful in transforming the
   authoritarian centralised state in a federation uniting the different
   components of the country while respecting their diversity. The
   constitution and its patchy implementation are instead associated with a
   quasi-independent Iraqi region of Kurdistan having a charged
   relationship with Baghdad, and an elected government for a highly
   dysfunctional rest-Iraq. This paper aims to demonstrate that it was not
   federalism, which has failed in Iraq, but conflict resolution and state
   transformation in a much broader sense. The fact that the
   constitution-making process was severely flawed had an independent
   outcome on the constitution itself: The constitutional provisions did
   not entrench a hard-earned agreement on how to divide powers and
   resources between Baghdad and the regions and on how to share power at
   the centre, but employed federal terminology in the absence of such a
   consensus. The paper argues that the constitutional regime introduced in
   2005 is not federal but lacks subnational units, a clear division of
   powers and resources, an appropriate participation of the units at the
   centre as well as a neutral arbiter. It concludes that federalism has
   not failed in Iraq, but has not yet been tried.},

Abstract = {In recent years, investigation on 1960s/1970s revolutionary activism in
   Argentina has led to the publication of multiple case studies. Building
   on this literature, a more general view of what is often called the
   ``new left{''} indicates that it is characterized by the importance
   assigned to three issues: social liberation, national liberation, and
   revolutionary violence. Two differentiating lines within this political
   space are an ideological divide (Marxism vs. Peronism) and an
   instrumental division over the strategic status of violence
   (insurrection vs. protracted people's war vs. political-military
   action). En los ultimos anos, las investigaciones sobre el activismo
   revolucionario de la decada de 1960-1970 en Argentina han dado lugar a
   la publicacion de multiples estudios de caso. En base a este material,
   se propone una vision mas general de la a menudo denominada ``nueva
   izquierda{''}, y como esta se caracteriza a partir de la importancia
   asignada a tres factores: la liberacion social, la liberacion nacional y
   la violencia revolucionaria. Hay dos dimensiones dentro de este espacio
   politico: una division ideologica (marxismo vs. peronismo) y una
   division instrumental en torno al papel estrategico de la violencia
   (insurreccion vs. guerra popular prolongada vs. accion
   politico-militar).},

Abstract = {Drawing on a neoclassical realist approach, this article delves into the
   impact that Brexit is likely to have on Italian foreign policy. We argue
   that there are two areas of issue, which are particularly affected by
   Brexit. Firstly, the Italian relationship with France and Germany.
   Secondly, the Italian defence policy within the European context.
   Although Italy has not appeared to have significantly changed its
   foreign policy course after the British referendum, policymakers in Rome
   have been concerned by the risks that Brexit entails for the country,
   and have reacted accordingly. We will observe the variation in
   governmental interest of three ruling coalitions which have alternated
   in power since 2016 and, through a neoclassical realist approach, we
   argue that the Italian response to Brexit has been shaped by both the
   international pressure to preserve its standing in Europe and the need
   shared by all governments to keep up to their electoral promises.},

Title = {The Roles of Experts and Expert-Based Information in the Advocacy
   Coalition Framework: Conceptual and Empirical Considerations Based on
   the Acid Mine Drainage Case Study in Gauteng, South Africa},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {49},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) remains one of the leading
   conceptual models in the policy sciences because it continues to be
   revised and updated as required. A focus area of the ACF that requires
   further theorization is the roles of experts and expert-based
   information in influencing policy problem contexts. Our article takes a
   necessary step in this direction by (1) evaluating the usefulness of
   Weible's expectations regarding the uses of expert-based information in
   different types of policy subsystems and factors that contribute to
   shifts from one subsystem to another; and (2) making critical
   observations that result from this evaluation in the context of the
   controversial acid mine drainage policy case study in South Africa. The
   findings of our case study analysis indicate that Weible's framework
   performed reasonably well but also revealed opportunities for further
   improvement. We therefore suggest adding awareness raising as a use of
   expert-based information, developing a typology of different types of
   experts who participate in policy subsystems, and including a focus on
   the use of expert-based information in policy subsystem shifts. We also
   reflect upon the relevance and importance of continuing to expand ACF
   applications to countries outside of North America and Western Europe.},

Abstract = {There is a growing literature on the use of federalism as a tool of
   conflict resolution. Yet, while this literature focuses mainly on single
   case studies, there remains a gap in our comparative understanding of
   the workings of federalism as a tool to end violent conflicts, as well
   as the conditions under which it may succeed in bringing peace to
   war-torn countries. By discussing core themes that emerge when looking
   at single case studies and relevant theories on the use of federalism as
   a tool of conflict resolution, we highlight the importance of three main
   issues in our understanding of the workings of federalism as a tool of
   conflict resolution: (1) The role of centralization, decentralization
   and recentralization in the management of diversity and to accommodate
   the demands of different groups; (2) Contestation of the state,
   identity, the idea of federalism and other key issues in societies, in
   which ownership over the state is contested and fought over; and (3)
   Third-party intervention, geopolitics, and geoeconomics in the
   management of diversity. By bringing together existing debates on the
   topic of federalism and conflict resolution, and positioning the papers
   in this special issue within these debates, some of the complexities but
   also promises of the use of federalism as a tool of conflict resolution
   will be highlighted.},

Abstract = {Recent studies find that the presence of foreign fighters in a rebel
   organization may increase levels of anti-civilian violence in civil war.
   But why? Evidence from some cases indicates that foreign fighters may be
   used intentionally by local rebel commanders to carry out abusive
   operations against noncombatants. Other cases, however, suggest that
   foreign fighters possess greater capacity for independent agency in war,
   stepping outside the chain of command to inflict harm against local
   noncombatants. We argue that variation in a rebel group's command
   structure-specifically, their degree of centralization-offers a point of
   leverage with which to adjudicate between the generalizability of these
   competing explanations. We investigate this issue with an analysis of
   sixty nine rebel groups active between 1989 and 2015. We find that the
   effect of foreign fighters on civilian targeting is conditional: foreign
   fighters are associated with greater levels of anti-civilian violence
   only when active in groups with centralized command structures. This
   study contributes to the nascent literature on foreign fighters,
   offering insight into how these actors step into the command structures
   of rebel organizations. This study also demonstrates that the abuse of
   civilians in conflict can be explained effectively based on the
   characteristics of armed parties.},

Abstract = {To meet the public requirements for environmental democracy in the
   world, many international environmental public participation programmes
   have been developed by adopting the Local Agenda 21 in Rio 1992. At
   present, some programmes stress the importance of sharing practical
   lessons on environmental democracy by comparing participation policies
   in different countries. However, few academic studies analyze how a
   country's culture affects environmental public participation. The goal
   of this paper is to describe how culture shapes environmental public
   participation by answering two questions: how do certain cultural
   factors categorize each country according to a nation being egalitarian,
   fatalist, individualist, and hierarchical in the Cultural Theory (CT)
   model, and how do the features of CT in each country explain their own
   environmental participation. This paper looks at three cultural
   factors-religious, democratic, and gender culture-and analyzes the
   environmental participation from three cases. This analysis indicates
   that these three cultural factors categorize both China and Italy under
   hierarchism in the CT model, while the Netherlands is categorized under
   individualism and egalitarianism. Italy also has features of fatalism.
   In addition, different features of CT in the three countries explain the
   diversity of forms of environmental participation in their contexts.
   This paper specifically contributes to the analysis of the potential
   cultural uncertainties in studied countries.},

Abstract = {Considering the recent `temporal turn' in International Relations
   scholarship, this article proposes that space and time are concepts that
   `thicken' one another in several ways, with significant implications for
   understanding foreign policy and world politics. In the discourse of
   security and governance, space-time frames work together to facilitate
   and legitimize certain policies, actions, and reactions, and imply
   distinct perspectives on ethics. Drawing on the examples of United
   States (US) drone use, reactions to the event that has become known as
   `Benghazi', and fears of the global spread of disease, this study
   investigates how temporal and spatial framings conceptualize effective
   and ethical security and governance. Arguing that space-time frames take
   shape from the resonance of political, theoretical, and cultural texts,
   four frames are elaborated including `space-time liberations',
   `space-time oppressions', `space-time strategics', and `space-time
   reflexivities'. The article concludes by suggesting that contradictions
   and tensions between the frames along with postcolonial and decolonial
   perspectives can be leveraged to interrogate and displace dominant
   notions of pace and space in the practice and study of world politics,
   and that this is a form of scholarly and political reflexivity.},

Abstract = {Ethnopopulism is an elite strategy for winning votes and concentrating
   power - a common playbook for the erosion of liberal democracy that is
   empowered and justified by a companion playbook of ethnopopulist and
   majoritarian appeals. Ethnopopulism is flexible with the truth, and
   flexible in identifying friends and enemies of ``the people{''}.
   Ethnopopulist parties manipulate opposition to neo-liberal economic
   policies and racialize the immigrant threat. Democratic backsliding has
   unexpectedly taken hold in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, and
   the very factors that seemed to augur well for liberal democracy may
   have contained the seeds of its degradation at the hands of
   ethnopopulist leaders.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a bottom-up perspective on the ``boundary issues{''}
   that emerged between the EU and Russia with and since the end of the
   Cold War: the mobility of people and goods, energy and natural
   resources, security, and protection of minorities. This paper compares
   three zones of contact: Estonia, Moldova and Kaliningrad. Our starting
   point is that there is not a European-Russian relationship, but Russian
   European relations that vary according to interests and representations
   on the ground. We argue that cooperation and conflict are not tightly
   coupled with the geopolitical level but also shaped by the local
   dynamics of symbolic boundary making.},

Abstract = {As the Bolivian government adopts increasingly conservative and
   authoritarian features, a policy meant to boost capitalist extractivism
   is becoming increasingly evident. This should be understood not as the
   end of a ``progressive{''} government but as the consolidation of a new
   structure of state power sustained by an anticommunal stance that has
   involved a redefinition of the government's alliance with the ruling
   classes and the systematic dismantling of the social forces that are now
   struggling to reappropriate political prerogatives in arenas of
   political organization unrelated to the state. A medida que el gobierno
   boliviano adopta caracteristicas cada vez mas conservadoras y
   autoritarias, se ha hecho cada vez mas evidente una politica destinada a
   impulsar el extractivismo capitalista. Esto no debe entenderse como el
   fin de un gobierno ``progresista{''}, sino como la consolidacion de una
   nueva estructura de poder estatal sostenida en una postura
   anticomunitaria que implica una redefinicion de la alianza entre el
   gobierno y las clases dominantes, asi como el desmantelamiento
   sistematico de las fuerzas sociales que ahora luchan por la
   reapropiacion de prerrogativas politicas desde ambitos no estatales de

Abstract = {This article explores how the British Conservative Party has dealt with
   the dilemmas arising from its pursuit of two increasingly discordant
   goals: delivering Brexit and maintaining the domestic Union. Drawing on
   interviews and analyses of parliamentary debates, we identify a
   resurgence in the 2016-2019 period of an older belief in a unitarist
   state, and a new form of pro-Union activism in policy terms. Against
   those commentators who depict Britain's Conservatives as having
   abandoned their unionist vocation, we explore the coalescence of a more
   assertive and activist strain of unionist sentiment. But we also find a
   willingness among Conservatives at the centre to sub-contract thinking
   about non-English parts of the UK to `local' political representatives
   such as the Democratic Union Party and the Scottish Conservatives, and a
   growing anxiety about how to handle emergent tensions between the
   competing priorities associated with delivering Brexit and maintaining
   the domestic Union.},

Title = {Marketization reforms and co-production: Does ownership of service
   delivery structures and customer language matter?},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {98},
Number = {4},
Pages = {941-957},

Abstract = {In public services that are tax funded, public goods are sometimes
   marketized by being delivered using private companies instead of public
   organizations. In addition, marketization reforms can entail service
   users being described as customers for the service rather than as
   citizens. We assess the effects of these aspects of marketization
   reforms on users' willingness to co-produce public services. First,
   service delivery using private companies risks reducing users'
   willingness to co-produce because firms cannot commitex anteto not
   appropriate donated labour for private gain. Second, using
   customer-oriented language risks reductions by priming individualistic
   market norms that lower prosocial motivation compared to
   citizen-oriented language priming citizenship duty. Using three survey
   experiments in the United States, we find that delivery structures are
   not neutral. Private firms delivering local public services reduce
   users' willingness to co-produce, although similar effects are not
   evident from primimg customer rather than citizenship thinking.},

Abstract = {Does the gender of prime ministers and cabinet ministers influence
   cabinet duration? We argue that the risk for early termination of
   cabinets decreases with women's presence in the executive. As scholars
   of social psychology indicate, women apply more consensual and
   compromise-oriented conflict resolution strategies. Disputes between or
   within governing parties, which ultimately lead to early termination,
   should therefore be less likely to emerge and escalate if the government
   is led by a woman or includes numerous female members. To test this
   rationale, we analyse a newly compiled, comprehensive dataset covering
   676 governments in 27 European countries between 1945 and 2018 by
   relying on event history analysis. The results suggest that cabinets
   with a higher proportion of female cabinet members experience a lower
   risk of early cabinet termination. This article contributes to the study
   of women as political leaders through additional evidence for the
   gendered nature of leadership styles.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has made effective corruption control a
   condition for membership, but it cannot sanction non-compliance once a
   country has joined. The Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) was
   an institutional experiment to compensate the loss of sanctioning power
   after accession with continued monitoring. Most commentators dismiss the
   potential of such monitoring without enforcement. This article's
   original coding of the CVM reports with regard to corruption control in
   Romania and Bulgaria provides an empirical basis to assess the CVM's
   ability to foster compliance. It suggests that monitoring can have a
   positive impact on state compliance even without material sanctions:
   despite the low expectations in the literature, compliance in Romania
   was significantly better than in Bulgaria. We explain Romania's better
   compliance record with successful domestic institution-building. In
   contrast to Bulgaria, Romania created strong anti-corruption
   institutions that served as a powerful institutional base for the fight
   against corruption. The CVM has not only had a direct effect on
   institution-building, but also an important indirect effect. As the
   anti-corruption institutions remain vulnerable to governmental
   interference, the CVM played a key role as a social constraint on
   attempts by the government to curb their power and as a focal point for
   societal mobilisation.},

Abstract = {At the international scale, cyber seems to be pervasive, though it is
   rarely mentioned in the International Relations. The ubiquitous nature
   of the cyber is not compliant with the classical criteria of the
   international (territorialization, legal framework, etc.). This leads to
   hinder the understanding of the cyber as a research topic and
   constitutes an epistemological impediment. By analyzing what the cyber
   makes - or not - to the International Relations, this article aims to
   initiate a debate. It deals with the cyberspace as a socio-technical
   system which gradually globalized to the point of being a major stake
   for the international system. It reviews and discriminates two options :
   tackling the cyberspace as one of the technological feature of the
   international system or addressing it as a system that is more than an
   issue but a nature per se whose autonomy is limited by the interactions
   with the international system.},

Abstract = {The question of whether high immigration produces anti-immigration
   hostility has vexed researchers across multiple disciplines for decades.
   And yet, understanding this relationship is crucial for countries
   dependant on immigrant labour but concerned about its impact on social
   cohesion. Absent from most of this research are theories about the
   impact of early-years socialisation conditions on contemporary
   attitudes. Using the British sample of the European Social Survey
   (2002-2017) and two innovative approaches to modelling generational
   differences - generalised additive models and hierarchical
   age-period-cohort models - this paper shows that rather than producing
   hostility to immigration, being socialised in a context of high
   immigrant-origin diversity is likely to result in more positive
   attitudes to immigration later in life. This implies that through
   generational replacement, countries like the UK are likely to become
   increasingly tolerant of immigration over time. Importantly, however, a
   context of high-income inequality may diminish this effect.},

Abstract = {Does party government moderate the responsiveness of public policy to
   public opinion? Analysing a new dataset, we examine whether the ability
   of governments to respond to the public on 306 specific policy issues in
   Denmark, Germany and the UK is affected by the extent of coalition
   conflict and by the fit of the considered policy changes with the
   government preferences. We find a systematic but relatively weak
   positive impact of public support on the likelihood and speed of policy
   change. Contrary to expectations, a higher number of coalition partners
   are not associated with fewer policy changes nor with weaker
   responsiveness to public opinion. We also find no evidence that
   responsiveness to public opinion is necessarily weaker for policy
   changes that go against the preferences of the government. Rather, it
   appears that public and government support for policy change are
   substitute resources.},

Abstract = {Using evidence from China, this study proposes the conflict expansion
   model to explore how pressure for policy change can build up to overcome
   resisting force and stimulate a response from decisionmakers in an
   authoritarian context. Tracing the policy change processes of four
   national policies, this study finds that the social pressure mobilised
   by media reports focused on specific events is a major force for
   facilitating policy change in China. However, owing to institutional
   constraints, the influences of societal actors are sporadic,
   incident-based and varied by population. The policy change process is
   protracted and difficult when it encounters resistance from state actors
   who have multiple institutional access channels for influencing the
   decision-making process. The power distribution between the facilitating
   and resisting forces determines whether policy change proceeds quickly
   or arduously.},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly shaping security narratives, including
   military strategy. While considering climate change a security issue,
   the military's role in this discourse and praxis becomes critical as a
   security actor. However, the interrelationships between climate change,
   security and the military are conceived and approached by different
   states diversely. Within different states, this triangular relationship
   is guided by processes with varied practical/policy implications. While
   `securitization' has generally been used to explain climate security,
   other processes such as `climatization' have assumed significance,
   wherein security practices are climatized. The Indian military too has
   been engaging with security implications of climate change, but by using
   approaches distinct from Western states, which have been the usual focus
   in such analyses. In this paper, the framework of climatization is used
   to analyse the triangular relationship, using the case study of the
   Indian military-by categorizing climatizing moves as symbolic,
   strategic, precautionary and transformative.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the ``audit revolution{''} during the 1980s and 1990s,
   administrative systems across the western world have tended to gradually
   downplay evaluation as a component of the policy process. At the same
   time, auditing has dramatically increased in scope and depth, and has
   also, to some extent, come to fill the role in policymaking previously
   played by evaluation studies. This article reviews this development from
   the perspective of policymaking and institutional change or ``drift.{''}
   Specifically, we look at the types of information and knowledge that are
   lost and gained as a result of these developments. We apply a
   cross-national approach, drawing on the examples from the European and
   North American contexts.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the 2019 local, regional, European and April
   general elections in Spain. The constitutional crisis in Catalonia in
   2017, the motion of no-confidence leading to the new Socialist
   government and the emergence of a radical right-wing party, VOX, all led
   to Spanish politics becoming more polarised. This paper also discusses
   polarisation from both the left-right and the territorial perspectives,
   intimately linked in Spain both for historical reasons but also because
   of agency decisions during the period analysed. Finally, the article
   shows the electoral results, government formation processes and
   political implications of polarisation in a non-institutionalised party
   system.},

Abstract = {This article hypothesizes about the impact that the Russian combat
   practice in Syria might have had on the operational art of Hezbollah.
   Three years of joint fighting with the Russian military has been a major
   formative experience for the organization. Presumably, this profound and
   diverse practice is likely to shape Hezbollah's subsequent military
   transformation, and to project on its force buildup tendencies,
   organizational structures and concept of operations. The article argues
   that Hezbollah's most profound takeaway from the Russian approach might
   relate to the notion of the reconnaissance-strike complex and its main
   segments-intelligence capabilities, command and control, and the element
   related to the actual use of force (Strike). Although this article aims
   to facilitate critical discussion about potential adaptations in
   Hezbollah's art of strategy and operations, its insights extend beyond
   the case itself, as they might be indicative of other hybrid nonstate
   actors in the Middle East and elsewhere.},

   chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attacks are,
   logically and empirically, outliers. Certain characteristics of radical
   environmentalism heighten the risk of such outliers. The majority of
   even radical environmentalists embrace nonviolence. Those who turn
   violent mostly do so in limited ways due to a combination of motivations
   and capabilities. Fringe elements are motivated to commit
   large-scale-including CBRN-violence, but are mostly constrained by
   capability. Yet eco-radicalism also draws more capable adherents. If
   serious CBRN terrorism attacks occur-a risk about which analysts differ
   markedly-radical environmentalist fringe actors are plausible
   perpetrators.},

Abstract = {This article explores the reactions of Russia's new middle classes to
   the embargo and import substitution and their changing consumption
   practices against the background of the economic crisis. It serves as an
   entry point to look at the interplay of the new middle classes'
   socio-economic positionalities and affiliations with the state within a
   particular political economy. Drawing on fieldwork data collected in
   2015-2018, the article traces the subjectivities and orientations that
   enable the new middle classes' coping strategies. It demonstrates how
   their responses are mediated by their imagination of the state and the
   global hierarchies in which they feel situated to a significant extent
   through their state membership. The analysis examines how the
   arrangements of Russia's political economy come into conflict with the
   image of a ``proper{''} state, which the new middle classes associate
   with productive capacity and technological advancement. It invites us to
   revisit the idea of the eclipse of ``production{''} by ``consumption{''}
   in assessing the performance of a nation-state, which, as the article
   shows, is reversed in Russia's context. Furthermore, it highlights how
   the reactions to these new policies become a medium to criticize
   Russia's post-socialist development and to articulate aspirations for
   its repositioning in the global system, which is translated into
   negotiations of the new middle classes' relatively privileged positions.},

Abstract = {Our article explores the contribution of local initiatives to the
   creation of path dependencies for energy transition in Germany and Japan
   in the face of resistance from entrenched incumbents at the national
   level. We use a process-tracing methodology based partly on interviews
   with local participants. In particular, we explore the role of local
   initiatives in securing ``socio-political space{''} for the expansion of
   renewable energy (RE) and in embedding themselves in ``ecosystems{''} of
   public and private institutions. German energy activists were more
   successful than their Japanese counterparts in expanding this space and
   creating positive feedback in part because they were able to build
   horizontal networks that anchored the energy transition firmly in local
   communities. Although problems with grid technology have led to
   retrenchment in both cases, Japanese activists' reliance on vertical
   networks has limited their ability to weather a backlash from national
   government and utility actors. Our study demonstrates the interaction of
   political, economic/technological, and legitimation paths to energy
   transition and highlights the importance of the latter two.},

Abstract = {Are states willing to overlook human rights violations to reap the
   fruits of international cooperation? Existing research suggests that
   this is often the case: security, diplomatic, or commercial gains may
   trump human rights abuse by partners. We argue, however, that
   criminal-justice cooperation might be obstructed when it undermines core
   values of individual freedoms and human rights, since the breach of
   these values exposes the cooperating state to domestic political
   resistance and backlash. To test our argument, we examine extradition: a
   critical tool for enforcing criminal laws across borders, but one that
   potentially threatens the rights of surrendered persons, who could face
   physical abuse, unfair trial, or excessive punishment by the foreign
   legal system. We find support for our theoretical expectation through
   statistical analysis of the surrender of fugitives within the European
   Union as well as surrenders to the United States: greater respect for
   human rights correlates with the surrender of fewer persons. A case
   study of Britain confirms that human rights concerns may affect the
   willingness to extradite. Our findings have important implications for
   debates on the relationship between human rights and foreign policy as
   well as the fight against transnational crime.},

Abstract = {Ever since they first entered the European Parliament in 1979, the EU
   has proven to be a strong legitimising tool for far right parties,
   providing them with funding, visibility and a higher degree of
   credibility and respectability. While recent literature has explored
   some of these dynamics, the role of the far right's ideological
   positioning on Europe as a source of public legitimacy has been
   neglected. This paper argues that as a relatively new and contentious
   political issue, Europe can function as a powerful ideological resource
   for far right parties by allowing them to convey a more acceptable
   political message. This argument is illustrated through a case study of
   two key aspects of the Rassemblement National's ideological approach to
   the European Union: the party's claim to be pro-European but anti-EU and
   its opposition to EU integration on grounds of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Over a decade of security force assistance (SFA) initiatives to build an
   effective Somali National Army (SNA) failed because of the interrelated
   effects of political, contextual and operational challenges. The key
   political challenges were interest asymmetry between international
   actors and Somali elites, insufficient focus on institution-building and
   a lack of donor coordination. The principal contextual challenges in
   Somalia were the legacies of two decades of state collapse and the
   negative effects of clan dynamics. The main operational challenges were
   building an army while simultaneously fighting a war, the complexities
   of military integration, and the severe capability gaps afflicting the
   SNA.},

Abstract = {Immigration has extended to regions with sub-state nationalist
   movements, such as Scotland, Friesland, the Basque Country and, as is
   the focus of this research, Catalonia. In a context of political
   upheaval in the region, this article aims to examine the impact of the
   successive waves of immigration to Catalonia on the modern independence
   movement. The respective status of the immigrant population in Catalonia
   is a major issue about which there is a divergence of opinion. This
   study approaches attitudes toward immigrants through the threat-benefit
   framework, which perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial
   for the receiving society. The data, gathered from six focus groups and
   ten narrative interviews, reveal a complexity of attitudes on the impact
   of immigration on the secessionist movement. Two themes emerge in the
   informants' discussion: `Immigration: Rising Benefit' and `(New)
   Immigration: (New) Challenge'. The comments of the respondents indicate
   that, against the backdrop of the independence process in the territory,
   there exists a range of views on the impact of the various waves of
   migration to Catalonia. This study suggests that a fuller understanding
   of the situation in the territory may be facilitated by qualitative
   approaches.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of partisan electoral interventions on terrorism in
   the intervened countries? Attempts by the great powers to affect the
   election results in other countries have been quite common in the
   postwar world with electoral interventions occurring in nearly one of
   every nine competitive elections between 1946 and 2000 as well as in the
   2016 U.S. presidential election. However little research has been done
   on the possible effects such interventions can have on the target
   countries chances to suffer from domestic terrorism. In this paper I
   analyze the effects of electoral interventions on terrorism utilizing
   measures of domestic terrorism and of terrorist group emergence between
   1970 and 2000 and 1968 and 2000 respectively. I find that while not all
   electoral interventions have terrorism inducing effects, overt
   interventions of this kind significantly increase the amount of domestic
   terrorism in the target as well as the probability of new domestic
   terrorist groups emerging},

Abstract = {This article examines the rise of the Islamic State (IS) through its
   anashid (a cappella), analyzing their lyrics and their musical
   attributes such as sonic elements, pitch, and harmony, among others. It
   focuses on key themes that define the group's lyrics and traces the
   evolution of anashid production and use-an evolution that began with the
   IS borrowing existing jihad-themed anashid to articulate its message and
   accompany its video messaging, and led to a far more developed and
   sophisticated sonic identity in the form of internally produced,
   group-specific anashid. The IS's claims to legitimacy as the caliphate
   are sounded out in the group's anashid. The recurring appearance of
   propaganda in the form of anashid and videos builds a strong case for
   the genre's significance among the highly complex factors catalyzing an
   individual's involvement in carrying out violence, especially among
   recent attacks within Western countries in the name of IS.},

Abstract = {This article analyses responses in the Russian media to the economic
   sanctions imposed in the wake of the annexation of Crimea. We look at
   the near-Kremlin figure Dmitry Kiselyov, explaining how elite actors
   employ persuasive tools in order to fashion and promote collective
   resilience not only as a value, but also as part of a quest for a
   post-Soviet identity. We show how resilience in the face of economic
   hardship is built and sustained, ensuring the continuity of the
   incumbent government. We further theorise on the underpinnings of
   constructing resilience, which ultimately strengthens national identity
   in the post-Soviet ideological vacuum.},

Abstract = {Humankind faces a growing spectrum of anthropogenic existential threats
   to human civilization and survival. This article therefore aims to
   develop a new framework for security policy - `existential security' -
   that puts the survival of humanity at its core. It begins with a
   discussion of the definition and spectrum of `anthropogenic existential
   threats', or those threats that have their origins in human agency and
   could cause, minimally, civilizational collapse, or maximally, human
   extinction. It argues that anthropogenic existential threats should be
   conceptualized as a matter of `security', which follows a logic of
   protection from threats to the survival of some referent object.
   However, the existing frameworks for security policy - `human security'
   and `national security' - have serious limitations for addressing
   anthropogenic existential threats; application of the `national
   security' frame could even exacerbate existential threats to humanity.
   Thus, the existential security frame is developed as an alternative for
   security policy, which takes `humankind' as its referent object against
   anthropogenic existential threats to human civilization and survival.},

Abstract = {While numerous studies consider the roles that media consolidation,
   court-packing, and economic crises have played in Hungary's democratic
   decline since 2010, none have considered the subnational mechanisms
   driving illiberalism. This study examines the types of subnational
   procedural tinkering that propel illiberalism by reducing local capacity
   for institutional resilience. Specifically, we trace how the right-wing
   Fidesz-KDNP government implemented subnational constraints to prevent
   the reemergence of a viable political opposition by (a) limiting
   opportunities for political contestation and (b) reducing oversight of
   the governing coalition. We employ a multimethod approach, pairing
   systematic document analysis of city council rules and regulations in
   Hungary's 27 largest municipalities with 26 in-depth elite interviews
   across five Hungarian regional cities with mayors, councilmembers, and
   local leaders of each major political party. In contrast to a large
   literature on subnational democratic resilience, we examine how
   subnational maneuvers can enable single-party consolidation and
   exacerbate authoritarian tendencies in declining democracies.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Disruptive technology and innovation represent complex conflicts in
   nature. This paper aims to present an analytical review of the
   heterogeneity and conflicts that exist in the disruptive
   technology/innovation between the eastern and western countries using
   Chinese high-speed railways to illustrate disruptive innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The emerging economy brings about other theoretical and practical
   conflicts. Qualitative analysis is conducted on Chinese high-speed
   railways to assess the validity of innovation characteristics using
   Professor Clayton M. Christensen's theories of disruptive
   technology/innovation and conflict. The authors explore the conflicts
   that can accompany the introduction of disruptive technologies in the
   current platform and how appropriately this specific context can lessen
   these conflicts.
   Findings
   The study revealed that Christensen's theories could be applied 100per
   cent to the Chinese context if the western disruptive innovation theory
   can meet the practical requirements of Chinese disruptive
   technology/innovation. Qualitative analysis showed that Chinese
   high-speed railways had experienced greater success with disruptive
   innovation mechanism. The authors conclude that while the Chinese market
   is critical in shaping the kind of innovations that are emerging there,
   many disruptive technologies/innovations in China have their roots in
   the low-end market and new market. Implications for theory and practice
   are discussed.
   Originality/value
   There exists a research gap in the literature on the Chinese context.
   Conflict of disruptive technology and innovation within China and the
   characteristics of the Chinese high-speed railway prompt further
   research for scholars and practitioners.},

Abstract = {This article fills a gap in the literature on the European Neighbourhood
   Policy (ENP) by examining the role that epistemic communities play in
   the policy. It follows an interdisciplinary approach for categorising
   their role in the ENP and the use of their knowledge by policymakers.
   Based on the examination of two key areas of the ENP, anti-corruption
   and rural development, the study challenges one-dimensional assumptions,
   which claim that expertise and knowledge improve the technical-economic
   efficiency of EU policies. The findings of this research suggest that
   the knowledge of epistemic communities takes three different forms for
   policymakers: political/symbolic, instrumental and conceptual.},

Abstract = {This essay is a critical reflection on the challenge to academic freedom
   presented by the globalisation of practices of knowledge production. It
   explores a tension within the logic of the internationalisation agenda:
   UK universities are premised upon forms of knowledge production whose
   roots lie in European Enlightenment values of rationalism, empiricism
   and universalism, yet partnerships are growing with universities
   premised on rather different, non-liberal and, perhaps, incommensurable
   values. Therefore, in advancing the internationalisation agenda in
   non-liberal environments, UK-based scholars find themselves caught
   between a rock and a hard place: either legitimising and sustaining the
   subjection of knowledge production to the state on one hand, or engaging
   in a form of epistemological colonialism by demanding adherence to `our
   values' on the other. Using Chinese research culture as an illustration,
   the article contributes to ongoing debate on the ethics of social
   science research collaboration with universities based in contrasting
   epistemological cultures.},

Abstract = {This contribution conceptualises bottom-up politicisation in Europe's
   multi-level system. EU-level actors, we argue, respond strategically to
   the functional and political pressures `travelling up' from the member
   states. Perceiving domestic dissensus as either constraining or
   enabling, actors display both self-restraint and assertiveness in their
   responses. Motivated by the survival of the EU as a system `under
   attack', and by the preservation of their own substantive and procedural
   powers, actors choose to either politicise or depoliticise
   decision-making, behaviour and policy outcomes at the supranational
   level. As a collection, this Special Issue demonstrate that the choices
   actors make `under stress' at the EU-level - ranging from `restrained
   depoliticisation' to `assertive politicisation' - are, indeed,
   conditional on how bottom-up pressures are perceived and processed.},

Abstract = {Individuals tend to favor important trade partners in their foreign
   policy preferences. Cultural affinity is also known to influence
   individuals' foreign policy stances. This study examines how citizens
   prioritize international relations with trading partners in the face of
   ethnolinguistic divisions. Using survey data on foreign policy
   preferences paired with data on bilateral trade between Ukraine and its
   two largest trade partners (Russia and the European Union {[}EU]), I
   find that ethnolinguistic identity and relative trade exposure both
   affect foreign policy preferences and that these effects introduce
   cross-cutting cleavages. Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians in regions where
   the economic importance of trade with Russia is relatively higher are
   more likely to favor foreign policy oriented toward Russia than
   Ukrainian speakers elsewhere. Similarly, Russian speakers in areas with
   high levels of trade with the EU have more EU-oriented foreign policy
   preferences.},

   policy through trade or strictly business?},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the horizontal coherence between EU trade and
   foreign policy, from the perspective of EU trade instruments. Drawing
   from different strands of literature, it puts forward the argument that
   synergetic coherence between the trade and foreign policy spheres of the
   EU is not likely to be realised due to the constraining impact of
   institutional-ideational factors within the EU, more specifically the
   continuing institutional compartmentalisation and cross-pillar divides
   of the EU system of external policy, with DG Trade being a highly
   autonomous sub-system. The establishment of synergetic coherence in the
   trade-foreign policy nexus has been further impeded since the mid-1990s
   by the emergence of three interrelated factors: legal restraints imposed
   by the World Trade Organization, growing export-oriented interests of EU
   businesses and the ideological pro-liberalisation bias of the EU. This
   argument is empirically illustrated through an analysis of various EU
   trade initiatives, including the Global Europe agreements, the Economic
   Partnership Agreements, the Generalised System of Preferences, and the
   Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas with the countries of the
   European Neighbourhood Policy.},

Abstract = {This study examines crime and corruption among Russian law enforcement
   agencies after 2009 Police Reforms (henceforth referred to as Reforms).
   These Reforms sought to curb corruption at all levels of the Russian
   civil service and among uniformed law enforcement personnel. Many law
   enforcement officers thought that the rebranding of the militsiya as
   ``politsiya{''} would have a transformational effect within the
   organization as well as how others perceived it. Ultimately, the
   rebranding effort failed; the only concrete changes were the
   organization's name and its personnel's uniforms. In fact, the Reforms
   seem to have contributed to even more corruption and abuse of power, as
   well as an expansion of the Ministry of Interior's ties to corrupt
   networks.},

Abstract = {Democratic centralism was the Leninist-Bolshevik pyramidal model of
   internal organization in operation in all communist parties for most of
   the 20th century. Thus far, the question of whether it functioned
   consistently across the non-ruling parties has not been addressed
   explicitly or systematically. This article examines the implementation
   of this essential internal dynamic in a French and an Italian communist
   party federation in the early postwar period. Drawing on new personal
   testimonies from more than 50 informants, and inedita archival evidence,
   this analysis reveals not only similarities but also clear functional
   disparities between the two cases.},

Abstract = {Despite much commentary in the media and the popular assumption that the
   banking industry exerts undue influence on government policy-making, the
   academic literature on the role of the banks since the 2008 financial
   crisis remains theoretically and empirically under-specified. In
   particular, we argue that different forms of financial power are often
   conflated, while favorable policy outcomes are too-readily assumed to be
   evidence of regulatory capture. In short, we still know relatively
   little about how bank influence varies over time and in different
   national contexts, the extent to which banking interests are unified or
   divided, and the conditions under which banks are capable of producing
   meaningful variation in policy outcomes. This article has three
   objectives: 1) to explain why the debate on bank influence matters; 2)
   to examine the evidence of bank influence since the international
   financial crisis; and 3) to set out a range of conceptual tools for
   thinking about bank power.},

Abstract = {A common problem with using organizational performance as the dependent
   variable is the ignoring of feedback effect. The current
   conceptualization of the turnover-performance relationship is mostly
   unidirectional, focusing on how turnover affects organizational
   performance. Only a few scholars have investigated the possible reverse
   relationship between turnover and performance. Aiming to further the
   research on the feedback effect of organizational performance, this
   study employed cross-lagged structural equation models that are
   especially suitable for modelling the possible reverse relationships
   between variables. Data were collected from public elementary and middle
   schools in New York City over a three-year period. The results
   consistently show that organizational performance was negatively related
   to subsequent employee turnover. This research contributes to the
   development of a more valid and comprehensive understanding of the
   relationship between employee turnover and organizational performance.},

Abstract = {As the number of European countries that recognise same-sex unions
   increases, so does the number of countries that resists this
   institution. This trend runs counter to the conventional wisdom, which
   links anti-LGBTI policies to domestic demands and developments. Instead,
   this paper argues that political homophobia needs to be situated within
   an international context. Using the Slovak case as a plausibility probe,
   the article shows that the bans on same-sex marriage were adopted as a
   precautionary measure: worried by the growing support for LGBTI rights
   elsewhere in Europe, conservative lawmakers feared that their
   traditional family values would come under threat.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the influence of political traditions on
   policymaking at the interface of national and transnational governance.
   It uncovers various dimensions of influence on boundary-setting through
   policy change, derived from a case study examining how Australia
   reconceptualised longstanding freedom of residential movement and equal
   treatment for citizens across the Tasman. These policymaking activities
   spanned boundaries across policy subsystems at the interface of both
   domestic and transnational arenas, in response to perceived dilemmas.
   This paper focuses on the enabling role of neoliberal ideations to
   effect an agenda driven by more covert motives. In context of bilateral
   economic integration, conflicting traditions created a dilemma for
   Australia, which sought to maintain the advantages of the free
   labour-market whilst minimizing the problem of granting access to social
   security and citizenship to those perceived to be unsuitable. I find
   that Australia, in resolving this dilemma, allowed neoliberal
   conceptions of labour as a commodity, thereby enabling traditions of
   exclusion and border control, to override longstanding trans-Tasman
   traditions.},

Abstract = {Monitoring institutions are usually perceived as efficient instruments
   for improving governance. This article evaluates the link between
   corruption monitoring and the supply of politicians in nondemocracies.
   Using China as a case, I show that corruption monitoring pushes capable
   young elites away from seeking government positions. This effect may be
   driven by two possible mechanisms: economic returns and career
   prospects. Specifically, corruption investigations may reduce the
   expected economic returns for government officials, undermining capable
   young elite' willingness and efforts to become government officials. In
   addition, corruption investigations may indicate that there are
   potential uncertainties and risks involved when taking on a political
   career, which reduce capable young elites' desire to pursue a political
   career. The empirical analysis confirms these two mechanisms and
   provides unique evidence for the unintended negative impact of
   corruption monitoring institutions.},

Abstract = {Why do political actors prefer one counter-terrorism policy over
   another? We apply discourse network analysis and the advocacy coalition
   framework to the recent debate on counter-terrorism measures in Austria
   and argue that actors' positions are based not so much on objective
   security factors and international or structural causes but on domestic
   politics and three interdependent variables. Political actors choose
   specific counter-terrorism policies because of: (1) a sense of
   ownership; (2) ideology; and (3) anticipated political gains. We show
   how different actors in Austria exploit the counter-terrorism debate to
   shield themselves from being blamed for being passive, to promote their
   ideological views, and/or to gain politically.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the changes in commemorative culture in
   postcommunist Poland, namely, the loss of status of the traditional
   self-sacrificial martyr/hero at the expense of the passive victim, have
   produced new models for individual and collective identification based
   on vulnerability and suffering. Through the analysis of
   Pilgrim/Majewski's surrealist plays The Peregrinations of the Black Iza
   of Walbrzych (2009) and The Testimonies of the Ups Downs Ups Ups Ups
   Downs and so on of Antek Kochanek (2012), I examine the artistic
   transformations of two nearly forgotten city legends into victims of
   communist gender oppression and cultural icons of tolerance and
   inclusiveness for the purposes of reinventing the Lower Silesian Town of
   Walbrzych's postcollapse identity. I argue that Pilgrim/Majewski's plays
   challenge the centering of Walbrzych's post-1989 identity discourse on
   the traumatic loss of the coal-mining industry by undermining hegemonic
   male heterosexuality's exclusive claim on collective trauma and
   inscribing female and queer trauma into collective suffering. By
   heroizing two marginal characters with ``socially inappropriate{''}
   sexual behavior, the playwright brings to the fore alternative
   subjectivities predicated on gender, sexuality, and the body, thus
   advocating for a more inclusive, polyvalent citizenship. More broadly,
   the author questions essentialist understandings of the self as a set of
   immutable core attributes (hinting at Walbrzych's clinging to its
   traditional identity as a coal-mining center) and promotes the social
   constructivist approach to identity as a fluid entity, a product of
   human definition and interpretation shaped by cultural and historical
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, Europe has seen increasing interest in and
   pressure to coordinate social policy. Studies on the coordination of
   social policies have found that institutional settings affect
   coordination patterns when comparing different welfare state
   ideal-types. Adding to this body of research, this paper compares two
   countries with diverging authority to regulate social policy areas;
   Sweden representing a unitary decentralized state and the UK
   representing a regionalized state. With labour market programs for youth
   serving as a case, the purpose of this paper is to compare the
   development of inter- and intra-policy coordination over a period of 10
   years, analysing the impact of regulatory authority. Policy documents
   which set the regulatory frame of the programs are analysed from the
   perspectives of instruments, and territorial levels of regulatory
   authority and how these connect to coordination patterns. The results
   show that levels of discretion and processes of decentralization and
   fragmentation of regulatory authority impact on coordination patterns,
   where inter- and intra-coordination develops under different
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {Hajer and Wagenaar originally proposed Deliberative Policy Analysis
   (DPA) as an approach suited to transforming a policy world characterized
   by complexity, pluralism and unpredictability. Because its
   transformative ambitions have long remained unfulfilled, DPA has begun
   embracing a variety of Action Research (AR) approaches committed to
   generating policy change in a world beset by multiple sustainability
   crises. However, a systematic assessment of how AR can make DPA more
   transformative has been absent thus far. We argue that AR can strengthen
   the transformative ambitions of DPA in three ways. First, it helps
   clarify the purposes of DPA based on a critical and relational worldview
   emanating from their shared pragmatist foundations. Second, it unveils
   the structural challenges of becoming more transformative in the shadow
   of the hegemonic institutional organization of academic and policy
   systems. Finally, it provides a heuristic framework for engaging in the
   critical-relational dynamics of generating policy change and
   sustainability transitions. We conclude with a number of
   recommendations, based on AR principles, practices and experiences, that
   deliberative policy analysts can adopt to help their initiatives become
   more transformative.},

Abstract = {The work of TE Lawrence is traditionally included among theories of
   insurgency and irregular warfare. However, such a reading of Lawrence's
   work disregards the political theory of state creation underpinning his
   strategic understanding of insurgency. This article comprises a
   historically driven analysis of Lawrence's writing and action in order
   to discern his military theory and return the Arab Revolt to its context
   of proxy warfare. This article argues that Lawrence's work is strategic
   and political as opposed to tactical. Rather than a simple theory of
   insurgency, Lawrence's military theory is one of proxy war that
   envisions state creation as a strategic goal.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {State attempts to legislate for civility, such as the UK's Injunctions
   to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance, are usually challenged on libertarian
   grounds. This article develops a novel democratic challenge to such
   legislation, arguing that un-civil behaviours sometimes constitute
   masked expressions of dissent. It first elaborates a conceptual
   analysis, linking the forms of annoying behaviour targeted by
   legislation with the practice of incivility. It then articulates a
   structural association between incivility and dissent and develops on
   that basis a substantive normative case for the democratic value of
   incivility. In this way, the article highlights the role of bad
   behaviour in sustaining liberal democratic institutions and the ways in
   which the tradition of political thought about civil disobedience can
   obscure the possibilities of democratic dissent. It thereby informs
   public debates about the `crisis of civility' in modern society and
   offers a new perspective on scholarly debates about the ethics of
   resistance.},

Abstract = {Territorial contenders are political entities that control territory but
   differ from sovereign states in that they lack diplomatic recognition as
   legal members of the international system. One consequence of this
   difference is that international relations data sets have historically
   excluded information about them. And yet, as evidenced by the Islamic
   State's impact on politics in the Middle East and beyond, territorial
   contenders are important actors in the international system. In this
   article, we introduce a new data set of territorial contenders, compare
   territorial contenders to other categories of territorial nonstate
   actors, explore how the presence of territorial contenders affects the
   probabilities of civil war and state failure, illustrate the conditions
   under which territorial contenders are more likely to emerge, and
   discuss a series of studies now possible given the existence of this new
   data set.},

Abstract = {Governments produce vast and growing quantities of freely available
   text: laws, rules, budgets, press releases, and so forth. This
   information flood is facilitating important, growing research programs
   in policy and public administration. However, tightening research
   budgets and the information's vast scale forces political science and
   public policy to aspire to do more with less. Meeting this challenge
   means applied researchers must innovate. This article makes two
   contributions for practical text coding-the process of sorting
   government text into researcher-defined coding schemes. First, we
   propose a method of combining human coding with automated computer
   classification for large data sets. Second, we present a well-known
   algorithm for automated text classification, the Naive Bayes classifier,
   and provide software for working with it. We argue and provide evidence
   that this method can help applied researchers using human coders to get
   more from their research budgets, and we demonstrate the method using
   classical examples from the study of policy agendas.},

Abstract = {For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the USA faces a
   geopolitical challenger in the shape of China. According to the National
   Security Strategy 2017 (NSS 2017), China-alongside Russia-poses a threat
   to America primacy, a view that reflects a new consensus among national
   security experts about the need to get tough in relations with Beijing.
   As of now, however, American public opinion remains ambivalent on the
   China challenge-opinion polls showing only a modest downturn in views of
   China recently, despite pronounced anti-China rhetoric in the context of
   the Trump administration's trade war. The present paper asks why there
   is such a disparity between elite and popular opinions, and whether the
   disparity will last. It does so through a historical comparison between
   the present and the immediate post-WWII period, before a threat from the
   Soviet Union resonated widely among the American public. Acceptance of a
   Soviet threat was a product of a rhetoric of anti-communism used in
   partisan political debate. In turn, anti-communism drew on a conflation
   of ``communism{''} meaning US-based labor groups and communism meaning
   the Soviet Union. By showing the immense effort needed to manufacture
   the resonance of geopolitical competition in the post-war years, the
   paper highlights the necessary domestic conditions of geopolitical
   competition, conditions currently absent.},

Abstract = {The workplace is a focal point for debates about religion and public
   life. This article examines the question of religion at work, and how to
   fairly resolve the conflicts it generates. Specifically, it advocates
   for the use of alternative dispute resolution to address these
   conflicts. Alternative dispute resolution refers to a set of dispute
   processing methods, mainly arbitration and mediation. Unlike litigation,
   these procedures rely on the consent and cooperation of the parties
   involved. I argue that alternative dispute resolution is best conceived
   of as a desirable complement to the rule of law rather than a cheaper
   alternative. It conveys a distinctive approach to procedural fairness,
   which is attentive to individual circumstances, and it frames the
   relationship between disputants in a cooperative way. Alternative
   dispute resolution is thus a valuable tool for the accommodation of
   religious diversity in the professional world.},

Abstract = {Menstrual health and hygiene have become important parts of the human
   rights agenda in recent years. This article examines the ways in which
   human rights actors invoke the language of human dignity to illuminate
   and address the vulnerabilities menstruating individuals face. It argues
   that although the norms associated with conventional accounts of human
   dignity provide an important resource for this project, they can also
   present a stumbling block. To the extent that menstrual rights actors
   rely on conventional accounts of human dignity associated with bodily
   self-control they may unwittingly reinforce the period stigma at the
   heart of the problem.},

Abstract = {Disputes over collective memory are a common source of bilateral
   friction in international politics. For example, differences over war
   memory have negatively impacted Sino-Japanese relations for many
   decades, despite apologies and other attempts to deal with the problems.
   Why are history-related issues so persistent? Existing explanations
   suggest, for example, that efforts to improve relations have been
   insufficient, or that collective memory is used instrumentally for
   political expediency. This article contributes to this discussion by
   shifting the conceptual focus from memory to forgetting. It argues that
   dominant notions of forgetting as fading away and denial often
   facilitate an understanding of collective memory in terms of security.
   It suggests that a conceptualization of forgetting that sees it as
   inherent to all remembering could ameliorate tension over collective
   memory by making those involved in international memory politics
   recognize that not only others forget, but that they themselves also do
   so as they remember.},

Abstract = {While Deliberative Policy Analysis primarily focuses on the role of
   public agencies in deliberative practices, this paper extends the
   analysis of deliberative platforms to industry-civil society
   deliberations. More in particular, the paper examines deliberation
   processes that took place within a three-year bilateral partnership
   between a non-governmental organization, Environmental Defense Fund and
   a large multinational chemical company, DuPont, to develop a joint risk
   framework for engineered nanoscale materials. I will show that the
   deliberative space created by EDF and DuPont did not meet the ideal of
   communicative rationality, i.e. the possibility of those affected by a
   particular problem having the opportunity to participate in the
   deliberative platform and share their issues and concerns. However, the
   outcomes of this bilateral partnership did become part of the public
   sphere, i.e. the open space in society supported through a diffuse media
   infrastructure. As such, opportunities were created for those excluded
   to share concerns and raise questions. Inspired by this case study I
   will argue that to gain insight into problematic situations evoked by
   the development of newly emerging science and technology, deliberations
   in the public sphere are just as important as face to face deliberations
   in concrete, tangible spaces.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right parties are naturally Eurosceptic. Many responded
   positively to the British referendum vote to leave the European Union;
   various observers even spoke of a potential populist radical
   right-instigated `domino effect'. We ask whether this Brexit-enthusiasm
   prevailed in the proximate aftermath of the UK referendum, by means of a
   comparative analysis of populist radical right parties' national
   election campaigns in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. The
   analysis considers whether the UK referendum result served as an
   external stimulus for populist radical right parties to harden their
   Euroscepticism and politicise the issue of European integration. The
   results show that this has, generally speaking, not been the case, and
   that Brexit has also not stimulated or amplified calls for leaving the
   European Union. Relating our findings to literature on the
   politicisation of European integration and strategic party behaviour, we
   argue that populist radical right parties had few incentives to act
   differently given the uninviting political opportunity structure.},

   fictional narrative that the ``super-terrorist{''} Carlos the Jackal was
   an agent of the KGB, exploited against the Soviet Union's Cold War
   enemies. The analysis shows that the stories originated from
   disinformation operations of Western intelligence services, which were
   then spread by the news media, politicians, and Carlos himself. The
   mythical Carlos simulated through Cold War psychological warfare is
   deconstructed as a symbol of Soviet control of international terrorism.},

Abstract = {This article explores how electoral manipulation intersects with issues
   of impunity in a constituency in Western Uttar Pradesh, North India. By
   casting electoral manipulation as a tool to obtain, maintain and enhance
   impunity this article argues that there is often more at stake in
   manipulating elections than simply winning. More specifically it shows
   how an holistic ethnography of `electoral seasons' sheds light on the
   kinds of authority and legitimacy produced by the visible non-punishment
   of electoral manipulations and in so doing offers new insights into
   ongoing debates in the anthropology of power, leadership and the law.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-97},

Abstract = {This article uses multi-level governance theory to investigate American
   cultural policy towards the arts and humanities. The National Foundation
   on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 articulates the value of the arts
   and humanities for the American people, providing the foundation for the
   development of a complex bureaucracy at state and federal levels. The
   resulting multi-level governance model highlights the interplay among
   public agencies at federal and state levels, the links with nonprofit
   organizations, the varied organizational structures that imply different
   mechanisms for involving citizens, and the diverse sources of funding.
   These findings show how American cultural policy is based on a
   fragmented but coordinated bureaucracy that supports a pluralistic
   society.},

Abstract = {This article addresses a neglected question about the effects of
   dispersed authority in the European Union (EU) on the EU's ability to
   manage external contestations. It investigates authority challenges from
   two major external actors in the energy, and specifically the gas
   sector, and scrutinizes the management of authority conflicts at local
   sites in different EU states in the Baltic Sea region. The second
   Russian transboundary submarine gas infrastructure project Nord Stream 2
   (NS2), owned and managed by a whole-owned subsidiary of the Russian
   state-controlled energy giant Gazprom, serves as an illustrative case
   study. It reveals how multiple authority conflicts at different sites
   and levels, and the challenges from both the Russian Federation (Russia)
   and the United States of America (USA), played out, and why formal
   adjudication has been a primary tool for the EU and several of its
   member states to assert their authority and manage contestations at the
   local, national and EU level.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Cross-national quantitative data measuring human rights practices have
   existed for about four decades. However, those data have yet to gain
   much traction in the public sphere, leaving human rights advocacy a
   largely data-free enterprise. We argue that the underutilization of
   these data is due to (1) a heavy reliance on public documentation alone
   as an information source, (2) incomplete coverage of the entire list of
   internationally recognized rights, and (3) the many barriers to data
   access and understanding faced by those outside of academia. In response
   to these problems, we introduce the Human Rights Measurement Initiative,
   a global collaborative project committed to generating the best
   cross-national, comprehensive human rights data possible through a
   process of codesign across disciplines and professions and presenting
   those data in ways that are accessible and useful to academics,
   practitioners, and everyday people alike.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the special issue by presenting a framework for
   the study of regulatory politics using the analytical tools and
   approaches of comparative political economy. Having traced the evolution
   of studies on regulation, it argues that scholars should pay more
   attention to the systemic features affecting regulation and to the
   relationship between regulatory policies and their outcomes. The article
   presents the foundations of an analytical framework based on the
   ``regulatory policy process,{''} a comprehensive approach that links
   inputs, outputs, and outcomes. The review of the contributions to this
   special issue shows that regulatory regimes can be better understood by
   placing them within the broader political economy of a state or region.
   A renewed focus on regulatory outcomes can help foresee what one should
   expect from the impact of a certain regulatory regime on a
   political-economic system.},

Abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in democratic governance is whether
   policies are best decided by elected officials or by appointed
   bureaucrat-experts. The study examines this issue in the context of how
   municipal government form influences government-wide budgetary solvency.
   Government form creates distinct incentives for executive action that
   shape budget outcomes. In mayor-council governments, the elected
   executive's desire to be reelected increases responsiveness to voters'
   preferences. Vote maximization incentivizes the adoption of policies
   that are popular among voters but can lead to budgetary imbalance. In
   contrast, the appointed executive in the council-manager form is
   interested in career advancement, which she achieves by building a
   reputation for leading a fiscally sound government. Insulated from the
   demands of voters, the manager can rely on expert knowledge and
   professional norms to choose policies that result in balanced budgets.
   Using data from audited financial reports for 655 mid-sized and large
   city governments in the United States from fiscal years 2006 to 2013,
   the econometric analysis shows that council-manager cities have stronger
   budgetary solvency compared with mayor-council cities.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Abstract = {Previous research on ceasefires in armed conflicts has primarily focused
   on the aggregated country-level of analysis. By contrast, this article
   contributes by examining the local-level dynamics of local ceasefire
   arrangements. In particular, this study examines a novel set of 106
   local-level ceasefire arrangements in the Syrian Civil War, reached
   between the years 2011 to 2017. Most (72 percent), but not all, of the
   ceasefire arrangements were respected during the stipulated time period.
   We argue that informal and domestic peacemaking should outperform formal
   and external approaches in managing conflicts with multiple rebel
   groups, ongoing violence, and different fronts such as in Syria. We find
   that the presence of insider mediators ({''}insider-partial{''}) as well
   as confidence-building measures between the belligerents are positively
   associated with successful ceasefire arrangements, whereas explanations
   emphasized by previous research-external third-party mediation as well
   as various indicators of quality of agreement-fail to explain outcomes
   of ceasefires. Yet, we also find some evidence indicative of a selection
   effect in that external mediators are associated with more difficult
   conflict situations. The study of local ceasefires in the Syrian Civil
   War can stimulate further examinations of the micro-dynamics of
   peacemaking in civil wars, including the causes and consequences of
   local ceasefires.},

Abstract = {Canonical models of costly signaling in international relations (IR)
   tend to assume costly signals speak for themselves: a signal's
   costliness is typically understood to be a function of the signal, not
   the perceptions of the recipient. Integrating the study of signaling in
   IR with research on motivated skepticism and asymmetric updating from
   political psychology, we show that individuals' tendencies to embrace
   information consistent with their overarching belief systems (and
   dismiss information inconsistent with it) has important implications for
   how signals are interpreted. We test our theory in the context of the
   2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran, combining two
   survey experiments fielded on members of the American mass public. We
   find patterns consistent with motivated skepticism: the individuals most
   likely to update their beliefs are those who need reassurance the least,
   such that costly signals cause polarization rather than convergence.
   Successful signaling therefore requires knowing something about the
   orientations of the signal's recipient.},

Abstract = {The Idea of Ethnically Pure States Still Influential in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina 25 years have passed since the end of the war in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina. In spite of this, the citizens live in poverty and
   frustration. It is hard to grasp how Bosnia's enduring political elite
   can stay in power without being seriously challenged. Even though they
   regularly figure in corruption scandals that drain the state's
   resources, hobble the administration and institutions and destroy mutual
   trust within the population. What, then, do the politicians offer their
   voters, when they cannot deliver progress and prosperity? A key part of
   the answer is: the idea of an `ethnically pure' state. This idea still
   has a large impact on politics in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as in the
   other Yugoslav successor states. External actors are exploiting the idea
   for their own purposes; in particular it seems the Republika Srpska
   strongman, Milorad Dodik, is getting Russian help in his continuing
   endeavour to further cement ethnic divisions in Bosnia. But just like in
   the 1990s, the idea of ethnic separation fails to offer solutions as to
   how the region's countries can become prosperous and live in peace with
   their neighbours.},
