Abstract = {Intended to capture the entangled history of Marxism, Alvin Gouldner's
   two Marxisms also frame the intellectual biography of Erik Olin Wright.
   In the 1970s Wright's Scientific and Critical Marxisms were joined, but
   later they came apart as each developed its own autonomous trajectory.
   Erik's Scientific Marxism was the program of class analysis that first
   brought him international fame. Begun in graduate school, it tailed off
   in the last two decades of his life, when it played second fiddle to the
   Critical Marxism of the Real Utopias Project that Erik began in the
   early 1990s.},

Abstract = {Erik Olin Wright's scholarship is often considered to be formed by two
   entirely disjoint projects represented by his early work on class
   analysis and his later writings on ``real utopias.{''} This essay uses
   Michael Burawoy's recent formulation of the ``two Marxisms{''} thesis as
   a foil to argue for the continuities rather than discontinuities in the
   body of work produced by Wright. More particularly, the critical spirit
   of the real utopias project infused Wright's work on class analysis from
   its inception. It is further argued that the limitations Wright
   encountered in realizing those critical aims directly seeded the search
   in his later work for institutional design principles and an explicit
   articulation of normative values that could undergird alternatives to
   capitalism.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 and its associated disease control measures have greatly
   altered everyday life. The burden of these challenges has fallen
   disproportionately on women. Drawing on qualitative inquiry in agrarian
   north India and Nepal, this research note analyzes how South Asian
   COVID-19 lockdowns have affected women's labor responsibilities in
   sometimes surprising ways. We find increased responsibilities for
   caregiving within the household, substantial stress in responding to
   food insecurity, and growing expectations to fulfill public roles in
   disease response measures. However, we also find that the return of male
   migrants and youth has, in some cases, reduced women's farming
   responsibilities and created opportunities for household togetherness at
   a time of great uncertainty. We conclude that more research is needed to
   examine the nuanced aspects of COVID-19's gendered labor impacts to
   create comprehensive policy responses to address the multiple and
   sometimes conflicting effects the lockdown has had on agrarian women's
   informal labor and well-being.},

Abstract = {Research has long observed the absence of gender in child care policy,
   media, and elections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has invoked
   critical questions about child care and its importance to states'
   economic recoveries around the world. In this research note, we analyze
   news coverage of child care in major Canadian daily newspapers to
   explore whether and how news narratives regarding child care are
   shifting in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, are we seeing
   a focus on women and gender in child care coverage amid the compounding
   pressures that women face in the current social and economic climate?
   The results of our analysis suggest that the pandemic has not shifted
   the conversation on child care and that current coverage principally
   reflects long-standing trends in child care framing. We find that gender
   remains systematically written out of coverage of child care, occluded
   by a larger focus on health-, economic-, and accessibility-related
   concerns about child care services.},

Abstract = {Scholars call for ``adaptive governance{''} to balance concern about
   technology uncertainty with the need for innovation in the governance of
   emerging technologies. Yet, empirical assessment of such governance
   systems remains sparse. Do the actors interested in the potential
   regulation of an emerging technology focus on their own interests and
   opportunities, or do they think in terms of the collective interest? We
   focus on the actors who embed such systems from a novel landscape
   perspective that combines two dimensions of governance: the nature of
   the regulatory target, and the nature of the process they advocate for
   governing the target. We present data from over 70 actors in the area of
   cryptocurrencies for evaluating this new logic.},

Title = {Responsible Veto Restraint: a Transitional Cosmopolitan Reform Measure
   for the Responsibility to Protect},
Journal = {GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {385-414},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article examines reform to the `veto' power held by the five
   permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The
   responsibility to react to mass atrocity crimes under the Responsibility
   to Protect (R2P) lies predominantly in the hands of the Security
   Council, meaning that R2P and the veto are inseparable. Veto use can
   obstruct the Council from meeting its R2P, reflected by the ongoing
   crisis in Syria, over which 16 Council draft resolutions have been
   vetoed to date. This article applies a transitional cosmopolitan
   framework to offer an informal `Responsible Veto Restraint' (RvR)
   recommendation for veto reform. This measure provides a more effective
   and feasible avenue for veto reform than the recommendations of the
   Accountability, Coherency, and Transparency Group's Code of Conduct and
   the France-Mexico Joint initiative for veto restraint. RVR can help
   promote R2P action through the Security Council, offering an avenue for
   progress towards addressing the problem of atrocity crimes.},

Abstract = {Economic sanctions usually fail, sometimes even provoking the opposite
   of the intended outcome. Why are sanctions so often ineffective? One
   prominent view is that sanctions generate popular support for the
   targeted government and its policies; an outcome referred to as
   therally-around-the-flageffect. We quantify this effect in the context
   of a major trade dispute between Ukraine and the Russian Federation,
   which led to a cut in gas exports to Ukraine and a sharp increase of gas
   prices. Using individual data on political and economic preferences
   before and after the trade dispute and exploiting the cross section
   heterogeneity in the individual exposure to the price shock-measured by
   the connection to a centralized gas/heating system-we find that people
   more directly affected by the increase of gas prices were significantly
   more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style
   political and economic systems preferred by the incumbent government,
   consistent with arally-around-the-flageffect.},

Abstract = {Regulation, welfare, and markets grow interdependently, shaping,
   reinforcing, and supporting each other: markets allow for the expansion
   of welfare states, and welfare states create demand for regulatory state
   services that help to solve perceived welfare problems. Crises can drive
   this path dependency because they create opportunities for growth in
   markets, regulation, and welfare institutions. The momentum toward
   interdependent risk of ecological crises, economic crises, and security
   crises is formidable, but regulatory-welfare-market path dependencies
   might be mustered to counter it. This article proposes a meta governance
   of path dependence, emphasizing multiple interactions in the
   regulation-welfare-market system and suggesting that meta governance can
   steer path-dependent regulation, welfare, and markets in the governance
   of crises. I discuss whether patterns of path dependence explain why
   regulation, welfare, and markets interdependently persist and grow.},

Abstract = {Did the Cold War of the 1980s nearly turn hot? Much has been made of the
   November 1983 Able Archer 83 command-post exercise, which is often
   described as having nearly precipitated a nuclear war when paranoid
   Warsaw Pact policymakers suspected that the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) was using the exercise to launch a preemptive
   nuclear strike. This article challenges that narrative, using new
   evidence from the archives of the former Warsaw Pact countries. It shows
   that the much-touted intelligence effort to assess Western intentions
   and capabilities, Project RYaN, which supposedly triggered fears of a
   surprise attack, was nowhere near operational at the time of Able Archer
   83. It also presents an account of the Pact's sanguine observations of
   Able Archer 83. In doing so, it advances key debates in the
   historiography of the late Cold War pertaining to the stability and
   durability of the nuclear peace.},

Abstract = {This article has two goals. First, to make explicit the theories of
   change currently operative within transitional justice and, second, to
   critically engage with both these theories, and dominant theories in
   international development. As such, it seeks to replace a focus on
   results, attribution, and linearity with a privileging of process,
   contribution and complexity. Developing theories of change for
   transitional justice is challenging, as it is characterised by diverse
   interventions, complex and contested contexts, and the need to balance
   principles and pragmatism. Normative, linear and mechanism-based claims
   remain dominant, while the evidence base for transitional justice is
   still weak. This article looks at insights from adjacent fields, some of
   the challenges facing the development of theories of change within
   transitional justice, and evidence from impact studies and evaluations.
   In a final section we propose an alternative, drawing on complexity
   theory and actor-oriented approaches, which suggest an important set of
   terms - systems, interaction, contingency, context, encounter,
   emergence, incrementalism - to inform what we term evaluation as
   understanding.},

Abstract = {Why, once governments decide to pay reparations, do they fulfill their
   reparations promises to some groups and not to others? I argue that the
   organizational capacity of a victim group helps explain which groups
   receive reparations. I develop this argument through an in-depth case
   study of the postwar experience of German Sinti and Roma, supported by
   archival and interview data. I show that organized victim groups
   received reparations from the West German government in the 1950s, while
   Romani Germans, who did not organize until the late 1970s, were largely
   and deliberately excluded from receiving reparations payments until
   1981, when the West German government created a reparations fund to
   benefit Romani German survivors. I show that this policy change cannot
   be understood without considering the efforts of Romani organizations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the experience of oversight during the last fifty
   years in order to inform current debates in both the older and newer
   democracies. First, there is a discussion of certain key concepts:
   intelligence governance including control, authorisation and oversight;
   second, the difficulties facing oversight, specifically, how these can
   be alleviated by a structure involving both parliamentary and specialist
   bodies and, third, the challenges presented by the structures of
   surveillance corporatism and its reliance on bulk collection. It is
   concluded that this new intelligence architecture requires a form of
   decentred regulation of and by state and corporate actors.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the role of (stock and derivative) exchanges as
   powerful actors in global finance. While most IPE accounts of exchanges
   analyse `exchanges as marketplaces' and focus on equity market trading,
   they miss how exchanges have fundamentally transformed in the last 25
   years. Through marketisation, internationalisation and digitisation, the
   business model of exchanges has fundamentally changed and led to the
   emergence of global exchange groups that dominate the exchange industry
   (CME, ICE, LSE, Cboe, Nasdaq and Deutsche Borse). Thereby, exchanges
   transformed from national marketplaces to global providers of financial
   infrastructures. They control the infrastructures that enable the
   functioning of capital markets: from market data, indices, financial
   products, trading platforms to post-trading activities such as clearing,
   exchanges create the rules according to which market transactions take
   place. This provision of financial infrastructures enables them to shape
   capital markets and represents a source of structural power, as
   exchanges potentially influence the actions of companies, investors and
   states entangled with these infrastructures. By shedding light on
   exchanges and their changed role and activities within capital markets,
   this paper makes a case for including exchanges as powerful actors into
   IPE analyses of global finance and for more closely analysing the
   structural power of (financial) infrastructure providers in the global
   economy.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) - today one of the most powerful actors at
   EU level - was intended to be a mere consultative assembly at the
   founding of the European Communities. This article studies the
   beginnings of the EP's parliamentarization, from its establishment in
   1952 to its first direct elections in 1979. The article uses the concept
   of Europeanization to analyse what ideational, normative and rationalist
   factors induced MEPs - delegates from the member states' national
   parliaments at the time - to invest considerable time and effort into an
   institution that promised no significant political impact, career
   improvement, or acknowledgement by voters. In so doing, the article
   demonstrates that despite the fact that careers were made at the
   national level, MEPs swiftly began to behave as Euro-parliamentarians
   rather than national delegates. Inside the EP, MEPs were therefore both
   themselves Europeanized and pushed for the Europeanization of the EP
   more generally.},

Abstract = {Conceptualizations and measurements of Euroscepticism tend to assume
   that, while parties may change positions from one period to another,
   they unequivocally espouse hard or soft euroscepticism at a given point
   in time. However, there are good theoretical reasons for some parties
   not to do so, in order to speak to different audiences and keep their
   decision-making options open. Through an analysis of manifestos and
   leaders' speeches we show how two populist radical right parties, the
   Italian Northern League and the Austrian Freedom Party, espoused what we
   term `equivocal euroscepticism' in the years around the 2014 European
   Parliament elections. Specifically, these parties articulated a
   distinct, albeit ambivalent, stance by combining elements of both soft
   and hard euroscepticism at the same time. We argue that `equivocal
   euroscepticism' can give these parties strategic advantages, including
   the freedom to cooperate both with other radical right, hard
   eurosceptic, parties at European level and more moderate parties at the
   national one.},

Abstract = {How well do firms in the United States maintain compliance with
   occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) standards after
   being cited for a violation? How and why does this vary among standards?
   This paper identifies serious violations of 91 frequently cited
   standards at manufacturing plants during 1992-2002 and tracks compliance
   with that standard in later inspections over 10 years. While formal
   measures of Repeat violations are quite low, we find considerably higher
   re-violation rates for some standards once we look separately at how
   often health standards are cited in later health inspections and safety
   standards cited in later safety inspections. Characteristics of the
   standards affect re-violation rates, but not always in the expected
   direction. Standards whose violations are rated as more hazardous or
   which received higher initial penalties tend to have more re-violations.
   These findings could reflect inspector behavior, with those standards
   getting more attention and thus being cited more frequently. When, as in
   the case of OSHA and other enforcement agencies, we know about
   violations only when inspectors cite them, we need to consider
   bureaucratic behavior as well as employers' incentives.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the use of film as pedagogical material to teach
   Everyday International Political Economy (EIPE). Film is an effective
   tool to bridge IPE research and teaching, and to fully integrate the
   everyday an as object of IPE scholarship and pedagogy. Film allows
   students to develop an understanding of IPE that considers often
   forgotten actors of the global economy, and to see how the global
   economy shapes and is shaped by what takes places in schools,
   workplaces, and households. The article discusses one practical
   experience of using film to teach EIPE: a `Political Economy of East
   Asia' course developed by the author. It offers a concrete demonstration
   of how three movies can be integrated into the curriculum to discuss
   themes such as regional outsourcing, financial crises, East Asian
   developmentalism, the global division of labour, cultural globalization,
   and China's economic rise; how active learning through film is
   encouraged; and how students' work on these movies is assessed. The
   article concludes by addressing methodological difficulties, students'
   evaluations of the course, and future research.},

Title = {Globalization as ideology: China's effects on organizational advocacy
   and relations among US trade policy stakeholder groups},

Abstract = {While literature on US voter trade policy preferences has an established
   diversity of theories and methods, academic and popular approaches to US
   organizational trade policy advocacy are underdeveloped. The dominant
   methodologies in economics conceptualize stakeholder group policy
   preferences as a continuum from free trade to protectionism. In
   contrast, this study builds on literature that assumes that
   organizations have both economic and ideological motivations. I examine
   China's effects on US stakeholder group advocacy and intergroup
   relations (e.g. multinational business associations, domestic
   manufacturing groups, and labor unions). I use interviews with
   organizational leaders and content analysis of documents from US
   stakeholders in manufacturing and services sectors. I argue that
   US-China issues reshaped organizational advocacy by expanding and
   evolving ideological interests. As groups increasingly advocate on the
   basis of their ideological interests, their discrete economic interests
   are a shrinking share of the content of trade politics, including
   traditional protectionism. Rather than simply advocating their
   microeconomic interests, US stakeholder groups organize around their
   competing ideologies for the future of US-China integration-free trade,
   strategic trade, and fair trade. China issues led new organizational
   agreements and disagreements along those ideological lines, which
   preceded policy outcomes reflective of the convergences and divergences
   of their goals.},

Title = {The Future of Financial Activism in Taiwan? The Utility of a
   Mindset-centred Analysis of Developmental States and Their Evolution},

Abstract = {Since the end of WWII, the so-called developmental states of East Asia
   have become famous for their `financial activism': their efforts to link
   the financial and productive sectors of their economies in ways that
   advance national development objectives. However it is now widely
   acknowledged that the twin pressures of global financial integration and
   financialisation have transformed the policymaking landscape and
   complicated the pursuit of financial activism. So what do these
   developments mean for the capacities of East Asian states to pursue
   developmental ambitions? To address this question, I adopt a novel,
   mindset-centred analytical framework for the study of developmental
   state evolution and apply it for the first time to the case of Taiwan.
   My analysis reveals that the evolutionary trajectory of Taiwan's
   developmental state has not been linear; since the early 2000s, the
   state's commitment to and capacities for financial activism have waxed
   and waned. Moreover, two factors emerge as particularly significant in
   this waxing and waning: social legitimacy and political leadership. This
   paper demonstrates the analytical utility of a mindset-centred analysis
   when it comes to investigating the dynamics of developmental state
   evolution, and why some national variants appear more durable than
   others at different moments in history.},

Title = {RMB transnationalization and the infrastructural power of international
   financial centres},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1028-1054},
Abstract = {The internationalization of the renminbi (RMB) raises important
   questions concerning dynamics of transformation within the post-crisis
   global monetary order. International political economists have
   predominantly analysed the currency's cross-border evolution as a
   consequence of China's macroeconomic conditions, domestic politics, and
   currency statecraft within a broader framework of international monetary
   hierarchy. In this article, we draw upon insights from financial
   geography to rethink the rise of the RMB as a process of transnational
   market-making involving actors and political agency across distinctive
   scales. We develop a multi-scalar framework that illuminates the
   distinctive agency of London and Hong Kong in this process,
   conceptualizing it as a form of subnational infrastructural power that
   facilitates financial market-making in concert with (and despite)
   dynamics of interstate geopolitics. This goes some way in remedying the
   scalar deficiency of existing theories of political economy of
   international money, as well as integrating considerations of power and
   political agency into financial geography perspectives. Empirically, we
   trace how the unique development of London's offshore RMB market
   reflects this interplay between private financial actors,
   municipal-level authorities, and national political priorities. Finally,
   we discuss how IFC-led market-making relates to system-level dynamics by
   both facilitating `tipping points' in global monetary change, as well as
   diluting national monetary power.},

Abstract = {Research recognizes that strategic business interests can provide an
   important driver of private regulation, even in the absence of
   significant societal pressure and non-governmental
   organization-constructed demand. This article examines a range of
   competition and collective action-related interests that can motivate
   firms to promote and adopt certification schemes. We pay particular
   attention to the hitherto underexplored collective action interest to
   safeguard common-pool resources, upon which an industry may depend to
   sustain yields. Based on a case study of salmon aquaculture
   certification, the article argues that while the corporate motives
   repertoire includes strengthening competitiveness and industry
   reputation, safeguarding shared waters for culturing salmon is key to
   explaining industry commitment to and adoption of private regulation in
   this sector.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a spatial perspective to examine the nature of
   China's transnational influence, focusing on the implications of the
   Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for international relations. Drawing upon
   political economy, regional studies and critical geopolitics, we argue
   that the most interesting puzzle concerning the BRI pertains to the
   ongoing reconfigurations of political space. Contemporary sociospatial
   reconfigurations as analyzed through a multidimensional framework offer
   key insights into the operations and the extent of China's growing
   global power in general and with respect to the BRI in particular. We
   draw on a broad range of materials such as maps, Chinese academic and
   policy discourse as well as observations about corridor projects to
   theorize (a) how the spatiality of global and regional connectivity is
   reconfigured through the process of China's integration with the world;
   and (b) how corridorization as a dominant physical and ideational
   process shapes Chinese investment projects and reconfigures state
   spatiality along the BRI. The results indicate that the main territorial
   pattern is not the nation or the region but the corridor. Furthermore,
   expansionist and unidirectional stories of China's growing power
   overlook the local encounters and negotiations necessary for
   infrastructure projects to succeed. In addition, China's economic
   statecraft is contextualized within the ongoing post-financial crisis
   political-economic restructuring of territories, places, and scales
   within the global capitalist system.},

Abstract = {Congress may engage in intelligence oversight by authorizing third-party
   requesters as `fire alarms' to promote transparency under the Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA). FOIA authorizes requesters to sue federal
   agencies to ensure their cooperation with requests for agency records.
   This article considers judicial review and the national security
   scholar's role as fire alarm oversight by examining the litigation for
   the Pfeiffer Bay of Pigs CIA operation history, draft volume V. The
   article illustrates a compliance gap that requesters and courts can
   close by canvassing the advantages that scholars, especially historians,
   enjoy in enabling judicial oversight that promotes executive agency
   transparency.},

Abstract = {Total birth rates have fallen dramatically in many European countries
   during the last 40 years. Job and income instability caused by labor
   market polarization are significant drivers of declining birth rates
   because employment certainty and stability are crucial to childbirth
   planning among young adults. This article investigates the impact of job
   instability on the fertility intentions of young adults in Europe,
   focusing on employment protection legislation (EPL) in European
   countries. I use data from twenty-seven countries that participated in
   the European Social Survey in 2004 and 2010 to show that job instability
   measured as temporary employment, informal work, and unemployment
   decreases fertility intentions among European youth regardless of the
   EPL in the country. Unemployed young adults tend to plan less for having
   their first child in the countries with high EPL. Contrary to the
   hypotheses, multilevel modeling showed that young people in temporary or
   informal employment in countries with low EPL show decreases in their
   fertility intentions.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the response of Myanmar's early
   contemporary poets to the experience of dictatorship and oppression, and
   the response of more recent poets to the uncertainty that followed
   political transition in 2010. The article argues that aesthetic
   differences in the styles of poetry that emerged during different
   periods reflect different understandings about temporality and the
   corresponding possibilities for claims of justice. The article suggests
   that the earlier poems, written during the period of military rule,
   represent what the philosopher Vladimir Jankelevitch calls `irreversible
   time.' Later poems, written after the period of dictatorship, reflect an
   aesthetic of `irrevocable time.' The article explains that we are yet to
   see, in Myanmar, the emergence of poetics representing time's third
   domain: imprescriptible time (the time of jurisdiction, redress for
   crimes against humanity and the claims of justice).},

Abstract = {In connection with the so-called territorial dimension of the cohesion
   policy promoted by the European Commission, a gradual Europeanization of
   territorial organization can be observed in EU member states. Two main
   approaches can be identified in literature describing this phenomenon:
   scholars in European studies discuss the issue in terms of the notions
   of governance, while planners tend to focus on the priorities of
   regional development. What is missing is a unified conceptual
   understanding that includes the diverse aspects of these processes. This
   article offers an innovative view of the Europeanization of
   territoriality. Its key argument is that there are two ways of studying
   the Europeanization of territoriality: (1) as changes in the spatial
   organization of member states and the establishment of new regions (a
   static component of the polity); and (2) as changes in relations between
   actors of governance in consequence of the new territorial arrangement
   (a dynamic component of politics).},

Abstract = {In the 1990s, the `knowledge economy' was hailed as a key driver of
   future prosperity by progressive policymakers in developed democracies.
   According to its proponents, in the knowledge economy, companies and
   countries alike would succeed by cultivating workers' knowledge - as
   opposed to traditional forms of capital such as plant and machinery.
   This had radical implications for public policy, implying that education
   reform and other supply-side interventions could deliver inclusivity as
   well as prosperity. Today, however, this benevolent vision of the social
   and economic impacts of technological progress has been superseded by an
   altogether more dystopian view, associated with automation and the rise
   of artificial intelligence, as well as transformations in the digital
   economy and the evolving nature of globalisation. This paper analyses
   that transition. It charts the key assumptions of the knowledge economy
   concept, through an intellectual history that focuses on how these ideas
   manifested themselves in the rhetoric of the UK Government under Tony
   Blair. It then shows how evolving understandings of the digital economy,
   technological progress and globalisation challenge these assumptions,
   and the policy agenda that was premised on them.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the phenomenon of policy divergence in response to
   crises of a similar nature. We argue that politically dominant
   interpretations of the nature of a crisis constitute a central mechanism
   that determines the shape of prevailing policy responses to that crisis.
   These interpretations lend legitimacy to views and policy proposals of
   certain political actors over others, which strengthens their position
   in the political bargain from which the eventual policy response
   emerges. As a consequence, political actors can exert a greater
   influence within the policy-making process even in the absence of a
   shift in the underlying institutional or political configuration of
   power. We illustrate this via a case study which explores two crisis
   episodes - the Great Irish Famine (1845-1850) and the Lancashire Cotton
   Famine (1861-1865) - in which one particular policy response was
   proposed by policymakers, yet the eventual legislative outcome differed
   significantly.},

Abstract = {In this article, we offer an analysis of the gender gap in political
   ambition that takes personality and other canonical predictors of levels
   of ambition into account simultaneously. We use original large-N survey
   data from Britain. We find that the gender gap in nascent ambition is
   robust to the inclusion of measures of personality alongside traditional
   socio-economic predictors of political ambition. Second, we find that
   increased extraversion is related to higher levels of nascent ambition,
   but only for women. Third, we find that personality does not drive any
   move from intending to run for office to actually doing so.},

Abstract = {This article analyses publicly reported statements of motivation by
   non-incumbent women US House candidates in 2018 to assess the role of
   negative emotions, particularly those cued by catalysing events like the
   2016 presidential election, in women candidate emergence. Findings
   reveal that Democratic non-incumbent women candidates were most likely
   to describe negative inducements, including feelings of urgency, anger
   and/or threat, as motivating candidacy, with these emotions slightly
   more evident in white women's statements. This indicates that women's
   candidacies can emerge, at least in part, from perceptions that the
   costs of not running are too high to stay on the sidelines.},

Abstract = {This chapter opens up on the premises of the Syrian refugee crisis,
   situating it within the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regional
   order. Doing so, it offers an overview of the socio-economic and
   political factors that led to the Syrian civil war and the massive
   displacements of populations beyond the Syrian borders. It argues that
   the crisis is the fruit of the regional turmoil and Syrian domestic
   politics, mainly the authoritarian regime of Assad. The silence of the
   regional actors, symptomatic of the regional disorder, led Jordan and
   Lebanon to cope alone with the refugee influx. Although exhibiting
   different domestic policies, both countries became largely reliant on
   the humanitarian support offered by the international community. Yet,
   humanitarian aid contributed to the burden of Syrian refugees, failing
   to strengthen the resilience of host communities.},

Abstract = {A degree of collective identity is often perceived to be a requirement
   for integration of core state powers, and even more so when
   redistributive measures are at stake. Existing research has shown that
   European identity is an important correlate of support for European
   social policy in general. This article explores the ways in which
   collective identities relate to the multidimensional nature of social
   policy at the European level. We explore in particular the features of
   European social policy that receive the most support from European
   publics, and how local, national and European identity moderates these
   preferences. We expect that people who have primarily sub-national or
   national attachments are less supportive of generous schemes and schemes
   that involve greater cross-country redistribution, and are more in
   favour of decentralized schemes administered by the member states than
   those with stronger European identities. We find support for these
   expectations in a conjoint survey experiment fielded in autumn 2018 in
   13 EU member states.},

Abstract = {The promise of evidence-based policing is to reduce harm with better
   research for targeting, testing, and tracking police actions. The
   problems of using evidence-based policing to reduce harm are found in
   the emotional dimensions of ethics and risk. These problems are most
   pronounced with fatal police shootings, where the risks of injury to
   American police are often framed as a zero-sum choice in relation to the
   ethics of taking citizens' lives. Yet evidence-based policing offers
   good prospects for reframing the debate over fatal police shootings, in
   ways that could reduce harm to both police and citizens. This volume
   offers substantial new evidence for initiatives at all levels of U.S.
   government that could help to save lives in police encounters with
   citizens. Putting that evidence to work remains the major challenge
   facing the American police.},

Abstract = {The United States has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, yet many
   Americans have responded indifferently toward policies designed to
   combat the spread of the virus. While nearly all 50 states have
   implemented some type of stay-at-home policy to encourage social
   distancing, there has been high variation in the degree of compliance.
   We argue that this variance is partly driven by gender resentment.
   Gender resentment reduces trust in female political leaders and thus
   decreases compliance with government policy and recommendations. Using
   data from SafeGraph and the 2016 American National Election Study, we
   demonstrate that the effect of stay-at-home policies on social
   distancing is reduced when gender resentment increases in states with
   female leaders. However, when gender resentment is low, there is no
   difference in the effect of policies on behavior. This research has
   important implications for understanding unseen barriers that can
   mediate the efficacy of female political leaders.},

Abstract = {The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic has significantly altered lives across
   the globe. In the United States, several states attempted to manage the
   pandemic by issuing stay-at-home orders. In this research note, I
   examine whether the gender of state policy makers in the executive
   branch might impact a state's adoption of a stay-at-home order. Using
   event history analysis, I find that the governor's gender has no impact
   on the likelihood of a state adopting a stay-at-home order. However, I
   find that gender plays a significant role for agency heads.
   Specifically, my analysis shows that states with a female-headed health
   agency tend to adopt stay-at-home orders earlier than states with a male
   administrator. These findings shed light on how female leadership in the
   executive branch may impact public policy regarding COVID-19.},

Abstract = {To understand the divergent institutional development in transition
   economies, we examine the role of institutional experience from the
   pre-Soviet era in institution-building after the dissolution of the
   Soviet Union. To measure institutional experience, we construct an index
   that captures previous experience with independent non-Soviet
   institutions. A cross-sectional analysis shows that institutional
   experience is statistically significantly associated with the quality of
   political, administrative, and legal institutions in transition
   economies today. To provide a more comprehensive picture and to control
   for confounding factors, in a second step, we apply a Hausman-Taylor
   estimator on panel data. This analysis confirms the positive
   relationship between institutional experience and institutional
   development. Moreover, the results suggest that the association between
   institutional experience and political institutions is stronger than the
   association to the other dimensions of institutions. Overall, the
   analysis highlights the importance of institutional experience and
   provides a rationale for the persistency of institutions.},

Abstract = {The horrific violations committed in South Sudan's civil war led to the
   establishment of mechanisms ensuring the prosecution of serious crimes
   and reconciliation within communities shattered by war. Through a peace
   deal, three mutually supportive but independent institutions of
   transitional justice were formed: The Commission for Truth,
   Reconciliation and Healing, The Hybrid Court for South Sudan and The
   Compensation and Reparation Authority. This article examines the extent
   to which these mechanisms can achieve their respective aims, and argues
   that prosecutions need to be implemented in an integrated manner
   alongside reconciliation and healing because of the massive scale of
   abuses and enormous number of perpetrators. The article further contends
   that their collaboration with local, indigenous justice mechanisms is
   crucial because of the latter's extensive experience in facilitating
   accountability and reconciliation within divided communities in South
   Sudan. The article concludes that whilst a limited amnesty is
   inevitable, a blanket amnesty is counterproductive to the aims of
   transitional justice in post-conflict South Sudan. Further, the article
   cautions against the use of immunity, arguing that this would deny
   justice to victims and could lead to a rise in revenge or private
   retribution, lawlessness and impunity.},

Abstract = {Contemporary child welfare policies in the United States are well-suited
   for prevention of child abuse but fail to account for the relationship
   between family financial hardship and neglect, that is, the lack of safe
   and consistent care. We argue that rates of child neglect have been
   stagnant because of two failures: (1) lack of recognition of financial
   hardship as a causal mechanism of neglect and (2) federal policy that
   purposefully omits alleviation of financial hardship as a solution to
   the occurrence of neglect. Because U.S. antipoverty programs operate
   independently of one another, our siloed policy structure misses
   opportunities for the alleviation of child maltreatment and, worse,
   creates negative and unintended consequences in child welfare. We
   present a model for change: systems synergy for the promotion of safe
   and consistent care that makes reduction of child maltreatment the
   responsibility of every social service program in the United States.},

Abstract = {This article discusses challenges posed by the implementation of
   international human rights law through the case of child marriage in
   Indonesia. Supporting data consist mostly of court decisions and
   interviews with judges carried out at three separate Islamic courts in
   West Java. Results show that the Indonesian pluralistic legal system is
   structurally organized so as to accommodate human rights norms with
   religious concerns and customary practices, which therefore provides
   judges with significant leeway in arbitrating between different types of
   law, which conflict on the question of child marriage. Left at the
   discretion of judges, rulings on child marriage cases may result in
   religious or customary law being favoured over state and international
   law. Judges do so to `protect children' from social stigma, which is
   associated with pregnancy and sexual intercourse out of wedlock.},

Abstract = {The lived experiences of child protective services (CPS)-involved
   parents is rarely considered from a social justice perspective. Parents
   and children endure the oversight of the child welfare system in myriad
   ways, and these experiences usually vary based on race, ethnicity, and
   socioeconomic status. This article explores how CPS interactions affect
   family dynamics and well-being and how family members view their
   experiences with CPS, including their sense of autonomy and empowerment.
   I focus on the inherent power dynamics between CPS workers and parents,
   race and ethnicity, and family. I highlight the perspectives of parents
   and their intended (rather than unintentional) parental behaviors (e.g.,
   providing healthy food choices) to understand ways in which their
   socioecological contexts impact the well-being of their children. I
   report results of a pilot study designed to enhance the voices of
   parents in the literature and provide recommendations for policy and
   practice that inform innovative solutions to better support CPS-involved
   families.},

Abstract = {Pharmacogenetic tests provide genetic data to tailor drug treatment and
   were widely predicted to be one of the first fruits of the Human Genome
   Project. In the mid-2000s, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)
   became an advocate for pharmacogenetic testing, but its efforts to build
   a market for this new technology brought the agency into dispute with
   other regulatory actors over the type of evidence needed for the
   adoption of pharmacogenetic testing, in particular the importance of
   randomized control trials. The warfarin case highlights the tension
   between a new form of promissory regulation driven by future
   expectations and FDA's established role as protector of public health;
   and the controversy can be conceptualized as a struggle over regulatory
   epistemologies within a complex polycentric regulatory space. Our case
   study addresses two themes central to the burgeoning scholarship on the
   governance of emergent science and technologies (EST): the political
   economy of regulation, in particular the role that regulators play in
   creating markets for EST; and the epistemological politics of regulatory
   science, in particular the controversy that arises when regulators
   modify scientific standards to accommodate EST. Linking these two themes
   is the concept of promissory regulation: the idea that regulatory policy
   may be shaped by an institutional commitment to the transformational
   potential of EST. This concept sheds new light on the neo-mercantilist
   nature of contemporary regulatory capitalism.},

Abstract = {Following 11 September 2001, the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
   established and expanded counterterrorism and security intelligence
   capacities to an extent unprecedented for an American local government.
   These powers necessitated new legislative oversight responsibilities.
   While the NYPD's efforts to address terrorism have received scholarly
   attention, City Council oversight of those efforts has not. This study
   helps fill that gap by examining the amount and nature of City Council -
   specifically the Committee on Public Safety - oversight hearings
   pertaining to terrorism and its mitigation. It also discusses additional
   City Council oversight options and needed research directions.},

   of UK disability benefits},
Journal = {GLOBAL DISCOURSE},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 OCT 5},
Abstract = {This paper represents a collaboration between a policy researcher and a
   behavioural scientist who studies cooperation. Our goal was to develop a
   shared understanding of one particular policy topic, the reforms to the
   UK system of disability benefits initiated during the last term of the
   New Labour Government and accelerated under the Conservative-led
   administrations since 2010. These reforms introduced much stronger focus
   on conditionality and assessment, aiming to reduce the cost of the
   benefit by identifying and removing `cheaters'or `undeserving'
   recipients from the system. The reforms have failed by even their own
   stated goals. Here, we seek to understand why they seemed appealing and
   intuitively likely to succeed. We argue that humans are vigilant
   cooperators, sensitive to cues of need in others, but also highly
   susceptible to the idea that others are cheating. This vigilance is
   particularly marked where they lack a reassuring stream of direct
   personal evidence to the contrary. The vigilance of human cooperative
   psychology makes ideas of greater conditionality and punishment easy for
   politicians to conceive of and sell. However, set against this, there
   are principles that can be used and successfully appealed to in
   advocating greater generosity in welfare systems. These include the
   fundamental social similarity of recipients and non-recipients, and the
   idea that resources are not generated individually but represent the
   common windfall of a whole group.},

Abstract = {Redress for communities harmed by transnational business activity
   remains elusive. This paper examines community efforts to access redress
   for human rights-related harms via recourse to transnational nonjudicial
   mechanisms (NJMs) - a prevalent but widely debated instrument of
   transnational business regulation. Drawing together insights from
   theoretical debates surrounding nonjudicial regulation and evidence from
   a major empirical study of human rights redress claims in Indonesia and
   India, the paper explores the conditions under which NJMs can support
   community access to remedy. Three conditions are shown to be central in
   enabling some degree of NJM effectiveness: the institutional design of
   regulatory strategies, the institutional empowerment of regulatory
   institutions, and social empowerment of affected communities and their
   supporters. While all three conditions are required in some measure to
   underpin effective NJM interventions, these conditions can be combined
   in varying ways in different contexts to underpin either top-down or
   bottom-up pathways to redress. The former derives its primary influence
   from institutional authority and capacity, while the latter relies more
   heavily on diffuse societal leverage in support of community claims.
   These findings have significant implications for theoretical debates
   about the capacity and limits of nonjudicial regulatory approaches to
   support human rights redress within decentered contexts of transnational
   regulation where both regulatory power and agency are widely diffused.},

Abstract = {Criminal violence is one of the most pressing problems in Latin America
   and the Caribbean, with profound political consequences. Its effects on
   social policy preferences, however, remain largely unexplored. This
   article argues that to understand such effects it is crucial to analyze
   victimization experiences and perceptions of insecurity as separate
   phenomena with distinct attitudinal consequences. Heightened perceptions
   of insecurity are associated with a reduced demand for public welfare
   provision, as such perceptions reflect a sense of the state's failure to
   provide public security. At the same time, acknowledging the mounting
   costs and needs that direct experience with crime entails, victimization
   is expected to increase support for social policies, particularly for
   health services. Survey data from twenty-four Latin American and
   Caribbean countries for the period 2008-12 show that perceptions of
   insecurity indeed reduce support for the state's role in welfare
   provision, whereas crime victimization strongly increases such
   preferences.},

Abstract = {Trans{*} people and trans{*} issues have been part of the scientific
   literature for over a decade, though framed most of the time under
   umbrella terms such as `LGBT' or `LGBTIQ{*}' and often without further
   consideration regarding trans{*}-specific issues. In this article, we
   take an emancipatory approach and focus on trans{*} people as political
   subjects. For the first time, we thus present data on the political
   preferences, attitudes and voting behaviour of trans{*} people in
   Germany, and put them in relation to the parties' manifestos for the
   2017 German general election (the 2017 Bundestagswahl). We discuss our
   findings in the theoretical context of trans{*} citizenship and trans{*}
   visibility. This approach positions trans{*} people as citizens in the
   centre of analysis and adds to our understanding of the citizenship of
   minority groups in our modern societies.},

Abstract = {Political parties and party competition have been important factors in
   the expansion and retrenchment of the fiscal welfare state, but
   researchers have argued that regulatory welfare is not part of political
   debate among parties. We explore this claim theoretically, and then
   empirically examine it in the case of employment protection legislation
   (EPL) in twenty-one established democracies since 1985. EPL is a mature
   and potentially salient instrument of the regulatory welfare state that
   has experienced substantial retrenchment. We test three prominent
   mechanisms of how electoral competition conditions partisan effects: the
   composition of Left parties' electorates, the strength of pro-EPL
   parties, and the emphasis put on social justice by pro-EPL parties. We
   find that the partisan politics of EPL is conditioned by electoral
   competition under only very specific circumstances, namely when blame
   sharing becomes possible in coalitions between EPL supporters.},

Abstract = {The current article builds on complexity theory and offers a new
   perspective on EU actorness in external policies. It does so by looking
   at the EU as a complex adaptive system and by adding new instances to
   previous analyses on EU agency. More concretely, the article critically
   assesses the idea that the EU becomes a policy interpreter when external
   actors start to interact following new policy practices. This entails
   examining how external actors enable EU institutional learning, and,
   through this, new forms of EU actorness. The argument is illustrated by
   using the case of triangular cooperation as a recent policy practice
   helping the EU to fulfil its commitments to aid effectiveness.},

Abstract = {While women's contributions to peacebuilding and conflict mediation are
   currently viewed as central to the durability of peace, women peace
   leaders still face constraints in their work toward a peace that is
   gender-just. In this article, we reflect on the gendered rules that
   structure the conflict transition environment in Solomon Islands, a
   context that is shaped by interactions between internationally driven
   liberal peacebuilding and local influences. Building on insights from
   feminist institutional analysis, we describe this environment as a
   complex ecology of gendered rule making in which constraints to women's
   participation are formidable. Nonetheless, we are motivated to
   investigate whether closer attention to Indigenous deliberative
   institutions in this context, and perhaps in others, might offer
   possibilities for navigating these constraints. Our research suggests
   that if due consideration is given to these institutions, the political
   weight of women's stories of ``struggle,{''} ``cries,{''} and
   ``sweat{''} might drive change more effectively, making the objectives
   of durable and gender-just peace more attainable for those in
   conflict-affected societies.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal restructuring and the feminization of export-led industries
   are often associated with the disempowerment of women in the workplace.
   Surprisingly, this disempowerment was not the case with a public textile
   company in Mahalla, an industrial city north of Cairo. Between 2006 and
   2008, workers organized wildcat strikes involving around 24,000 workers.
   In contrast to the strike waves of the 1980s, women were integral to
   organizing the strikes and assumed leadership roles in them. This
   article argues that even as Egypt adopted structural adjustments in the
   1990s that led to the decline of the historically leading sectors of
   textiles and yarn, exports of clothing increased. By the 2000s, the
   clothing sector was completely feminized and women in Mahalla were
   positioned in the most productive departments. This change empowered
   women by elevating their role and induced skeptical male colleagues to
   support women's activism in the company and to build cross-gender
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {The essay addresses the nexus between security challenges and response
   strategies in the Baltic region. The analysis is based on the framework
   provided by a shelter theory, which distinguishes three levels of
   security strategies oriented towards external players: political
   (military), economic and societal. The essay finds out that, first,
   military and economic challenges to the Baltic states are mostly managed
   through `external shelter' (NATO (United States) and the European
   Union); second, most of the current security challenges manifest in the
   societal sector, predominantly as a result of Russia's hybrid offensive
   activities in the region. To deal with these societal challenges, the
   Baltic states are employing combined strategies of `shelter' and
   `building a buffer from within', but with a clear priority on internal
   efforts.},

Abstract = {This article discusses counter-terrorism intelligence cooperation
   between Britain and its mainland partners. In contrast to disciplinary
   assumptions whereby Britain is loosely connected to Europe, it argues
   that British intelligence has a European connection. This is supported
   by extensive ethnographic fieldwork with British counter-terrorism
   police liaison officers deployed in France and a reading of intelligence
   cooperation from a sociological perspective. In mobilising a
   Bourdieusian approach that focuses on the study of social actors and
   their practices, the article shows how British intelligence is embedded
   in European intelligence cooperation as well as the increasing place of
   law enforcement in counter-terrorism intelligence.},

Abstract = {Based on the inductive analysis of two parallel cases of private
   environmental governance - private, market-driven fisheries governance
   and private, market-driven governance for electricity decarbonization -
   this paper uncovers a trigger for positive public policy spillovers from
   private environmental governance. It identifies circumstances that
   prompt groups of business actors working as private regulators to also
   take on a role as public policy advocates and supporters, revealing a
   potential for private governance initiatives that are targeted at a
   particular environmental problem to serve as a bolster for the public
   regulatory governance of that problem as well. Both private governance
   cases at the basis of this analysis feature groups of business actors
   seeking to meet voluntary sustainability goals through the tools of
   private governance (specifically, through flexing buyer power and
   private authority in an effort to reform environmentally problematic
   practices among particular groups of suppliers). In both cases, the
   business's inability to attain private sustainability goals though
   private governance means alone has given rise to business demand for
   facilitative public environmental policy and regulation. The analysis
   presented in this paper thus points to the occurrence of a particular
   and intriguing pattern of complementarity between private authority and
   public policy - one where public policy is called on to fill gaps left
   by private environmental governance and authority. And it identifies key
   conditions for such private-governance-driven recentering of public
   policy to occur, namely the presence of private supply chain greening
   goals and commitments that are economically, reputationally, and/or
   competitively critical for businesses to attain, combined with
   shortfalls in the capacity of businesses' private authority to bring
   about such attainment. The two case analysis further suggests the
   importance of ENGOs in identifying and activating some of the
   opportunities for leveraging shortfalls in private environmental
   governance to the advantage of public environmental policy and
   regulation.},

Abstract = {For over 50 years, America and Germany read much of the world's
   communications. With `Operation Rubicon', the CIA and the BND undermined
   the encryption security of foreign governments by controlling the Swiss
   technology company, Crypto AG. Puzzlingly, investigative journalists and
   customers increasingly identified the relationship and the
   vulnerabilities of their products. Yet, Rubicon continued, producing
   dividends for over half a century despite repeated revelations. This
   article asks why? It argues that geopolitical influences on targets, the
   consumer's limited resources, and individual brilliance by CIA-BND
   agents within Crypto AG combined to enable operational longevity - where
   other sigint operations would have failed.},

Abstract = {Leading up to the 2016 election, single women were heralded as the
   ``hot{''} new constituency. With unmarried women posed to comprise
   approximately half of the population of adult women and 23\% of the
   electorate (Traister 2016), pundits claimed that the rising number of
   single women could transform American politics. Building on this recent
   enthusiasm about single women, this study provides one of the first
   systematic analyses of how contemporary women's organizations represent
   single women by analyzing 1,021 comments that women's organizations
   submitted to rule makers between 2007 and 2013. Using automated text
   analyses and a series of statistical analyses, it shows that despite the
   rising numbers of American single women, women's organizations only very
   rarely explicitly refer to single women during their comment writing
   campaigns, preferring to highlight the experiences of married mothers
   instead. Moreover, it shows that the political context unexpectedly has
   little to no effect on the degree to which women's organizations focus
   on single women, possibly because they so rarely mention them at all.
   Altogether, the results suggest that for single women to become
   politically powerful, they will need more than just large numbers; they
   may also need niche organizations that can help them organize and
   articulate their broader policy needs.},

Abstract = {Rising economic inequality has aggravated long-standing labor market
   disparities, with one exception: government employment. This article
   considers the puzzle of black-white wage parity in the American public
   sector. African Americans are more likely to work in the public than in
   the private sector, and their wages are higher there. The article builds
   on prior work emphasizing institutional factors conditioning this
   outcome to argue that employee mobilization can motor it. As public
   sector unions gained political influence postwar, their large
   constituencies of black, blue-collar workers, drawing on both militant
   and nonviolent tactics of the urbanizing civil rights movement,
   advocated for improved working conditions. Archival sources confirm this
   pattern at the federal level. The employment and activism of African
   Americans in low-skilled federal jobs pivoted union attention to
   blue-collar issues and directly contributed to the enactment of a
   transparent, universal wage schedule for the blue-collar federal
   workforce (the Federal Wage System). The result was greater pay parity
   for African Americans, as well as for other disadvantaged groups.},

Abstract = {Central Asian states are more complex than what a first glance at their
   authoritarian nature might suggest. Despite their relatively recent
   independence, they have strengthened and managed to effectively improve
   their economic performance. This article aims at analysing two
   case-studies, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and demonstrating how their
   statehood evolved in relation to both domestic dimensions (such as the
   traditional legacy of clans and the more recent Soviet experience) and
   powerful international influences, especially those of Western-driven
   neoliberalism, neighbouring Russia and China. While neoliberalism has
   had a significant impact on Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan has remained more
   anchored to the legacy of the Soviet Union. Yet both states have
   demonstrated autonomy in their economic choices and strong political
   agency; far from being pawns in the hands of Great Powers, they are
   active protagonists of twenty-first century global politics.},

Abstract = {A considerable number of recent analyses report statistical evidence
   indicating that governments manipulate official macroeconomic
   indicators. Employing creative strategies to identify systematic biases
   in statistical outputs, these studies have shown that political
   manipulation of economic statistics does occur. But they have paid less
   attention to the questionhowofficial statistics are being manipulated.
   To shed light on the processes behind data manipulation, this article
   examines three recent high-profile cases in depth: Greece's public
   deficit figures, controversies about Argentina's inflation statistics,
   and the Brazilian ``fiscal pedaling{''} scandal. We make two main
   contributions: first, macroeconomic indicators are much more ambiguous
   than it is commonly realized. Therefore, the line between accurate and
   manipulated data is more blurry than typical narratives about
   manipulation acknowledge. Second, in recognition of this ambiguity we
   introduce a typology distinguishing four types of manipulation: outright
   manipulation (type 1), politically motivated guesstimating (type 2), the
   opportunistic use of methodology space (type 3), and
   indicators-management through indirect means (type 4). The findings from
   our cases highlight that the politics of statistics do not revolve
   around ``right{''} and ``wrong{''} numbers. They are better understood
   as contestations about different shades of wrong.},

Abstract = {The article reports on a follow-up of a case study conducted in
   1998-1999 investigating the rules governing the behaviour of Russian
   forest enterprises. The new study, carried out in 2011-2012, used the
   same survey in interviews with a subset of the enterprises that took
   part in the original investigation. The objective was to see whether
   enterprises' behaviour and the rules governing their behaviour had
   become more market efficient since our original study. The new study
   showed that, over a ten-year period, the behaviour of the surveyed
   enterprises became better adapted to rules governing a modern market
   economy. However, many traits of the virtual economy remained.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This article examines agency responsiveness to mass comment campaigns -
   collections of identical and near-duplicate comments sponsored by
   organizations and submitted by group members and supporters - in
   administrative rulemaking in the United States. Focusing on 1,049 mass
   comment campaigns that occurred during 22 Environmental Protection
   Agency rulemakings between 2012 and 2017, the article develops and
   assesses expectations regarding responsiveness to campaigns relative to
   comments submitted outside of campaigns. The analysis demonstrates that,
   procedurally, the agency references mass comment campaigns in its
   responses to comments, but cites campaigns at lower rates than other
   comments. In terms of outcomes, the agency's regulations are generally
   not consistent with changes requested in comments, a lack of association
   that holds especially for mass comment campaigns. These patterns suggest
   that legal imperatives trump political considerations in conditioning
   agency responsiveness, given that mass comment campaigns - relative to
   other comments - generally contain little ``relevant matter.{''}},

Abstract = {Research suggests that women may use social media to overcome
   disadvantages when running for and serving in public office. However,
   limited research has explored how party and gender influence
   politicians' social media engagement and whether the promotion of
   women's issues remains gendered and marginalized online. I use negative
   binomial regression to analyze how gender and party influence US House
   members' discussion and framing of one women's issue, the Defund Planned
   Parenthood Act of 2015, on Twitter. I find that Republican women are the
   most engaged, on average, and frame the defunding of Planned Parenthood
   as a women's issue and fetal rights issue, balancing gender and party
   expectations to strategically engage in this debate.},

Abstract = {We typically think of emotional states as highly individualised and
   subjective. But visceral gut feelings like discomfort can be better
   understood as collective and public, when they reflect implicit biases
   that an individual has internalised. Most of us evade discomfort in
   favour of comfort, often unconsciously. This inclination, innocent in
   most cases, also has social and political consequences. Research has
   established that it is easier to interact with people who resemble us
   and that such in-group favouritism contributes to subtle forms of
   discrimination. If we want a more equal and unbiased society, we have a
   duty to expose ourselves to more discomfort. Living up to this duty
   requires an enhanced emotional vocabulary that captures the political
   dimensions of physiological affect. I argue that a better understanding
   of what I call interaction discomfort can mitigate subtle forms of
   discrimination.},

Abstract = {The evolving roles of women in Congress have received appreciable
   attention from legislative scholars. In this research note, we seek to
   couple research on departures from Congress and women in Congress by
   examining what happens in Senate seats vacated by electoral defeat,
   death, resignation, and retirement. Using data from 1919 through 2019,
   we analyze the circumstances under which women are appointed Senate
   successors and particularly on the ability of female senators to be
   replaced by other women once they leave office. This article builds on
   previous work on women's accession to high political office,
   particularly ``political widowhood,{''} but to the best of our knowledge
   is the first to focus on female successors in the US Senate.},

Abstract = {There has been a marked rise in the breadth and depth of the South
   Korean state's support of entrepreneurial finance since the Asian
   Financial Crisis. This article provides novel conceptual and
   empirically-grounded understanding of the phenomenon by answering two
   interconnected research questions: (1) does the government's financial
   support of high-technology entrepreneurship in the Creative Economy
   Action Plan constitute continuity or change in the Korean state's
   encouraging of entrepreneurial finance? and (2) what is motivating these
   efforts? Making use of interview data and policy document analysis, we
   argue that Creative Economy efforts represent continuity of
   entrepreneurial finance support, especially since the Asian Financial
   Crisis. In answering the second question, we argue that legitimate
   social purpose has propelled Post-Asian financial crisis South Korean
   policy-makers to strive to diversify the sources of economic activity
   and job creation away from chaebols while simultaneously embedding the
   chaebol in the growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. The legitimate social
   purposes have input legitimacy via fit with employment and
   diversification aims and output legitimacy gleaned from the perceived
   positive performance of the entrepreneurial ecosystem.},

Abstract = {This article explores common organizational pressure points for `Five
   Eyes' intelligence communities in their ability to understand, prevent
   and disrupt potential emerging bio-threats and risks. The acceleration
   in the development of synthetic biology and biotechnology for legitimate
   markets (e.g. pharmaceuticals, food production and energy) is moving
   faster than current intelligence communities' ability to identify and
   understand potential bio-threats and risks. The article surveys several
   political leadership and intelligence governance challenges responsible
   for the current sub-optimal development of health security intelligence
   capabilities and identifies possible policy suggestions to ameliorate
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Street-level interpretation and enforcement are critical to defining the
   meaning of law. To understand street-level regulatory decisions, prior
   studies have highlighted internal office conditions, neglecting the
   influence that peer offices can have. This study examines the role of
   horizontal inter-office interaction among frontline offices and
   illustrates how and under what conditions it shapes the meaning of law.
   Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data on Japan's Soil
   Contamination Countermeasures Act, this study reveals that inter-office
   interaction occurs within fixed groups and comes to shape shared
   interpretations of law that regulators believe are legally valid. This
   implies that under legal ambiguity, inter-office interactions develop
   institutionalized notions of appropriateness and reinforce the
   perception of legal consistency, which bolster the legitimacy of
   enforcement. Although peer office networks encourage convergence on the
   interpretation of law, because of their clustered structure, legal
   meanings develop differently across various groups.},

   questions: what is strategy? And what constitutes good strategy? Judged
   against a baseline definition of good strategy, the EU lacks an agreed
   assessment of its external environment, struggles to prioritize
   competing foreign policy objectives, avoids difficult foreign policy
   choices, and often lacks the ways and means necessary to achieve its
   goals, yet is reluctant to modify its objectives. These problems reflect
   the EU's character as a polity: differences amongst member states and
   the primarily intergovernmental nature of EU foreign, security and
   defence decision-making fundamentally constrain the Union's ability to
   develop and implement external strategy. The EU is better understood as
   an astrategic actor: an actor without a strategy in the proper meaning
   of the word and one that will continue to find it difficult to develop
   such a strategy.},

Title = {Does Care Experience Affect Policy Interests? Male Legislators, Parental

Abstract = {A central argument in theories on women's political interests has been
   that the sexual division of labor, inter alia, gives women greater
   experience of responsibility for the care of others, especially
   children, which in turn influences their political attitudes. However,
   the specifics of this claim have not been sufficiently examined in prior
   literature. By applying unique data on Swedish legislators' subjective
   policy preferences and use of their parental leave over time, this
   article explores empirically whether the personal roles of members of
   parliament (MPs) in reproduction affect their political preferences,
   regardless of their sex. The analysis reveals that men's interest in
   social policy tends to increase after being on parental leave while in
   office, whereas women's interest in social and family policy remains
   strong, regardless. This finding might indicate a care experience
   mechanism at work, pertinent also to men, but with a possibly shallower
   content. The analysis raises the question: are care issues, previously
   seen as women's issues, now becoming human issues? It furthercontributes
   to the discussion on ways tomeasure gender other than using sex as
   proxy.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamics of low income household (LIH)
   indebtedness under austerity in Britain. Building on a range of
   political economy studies on the role of the state in the process of
   financialisation, the paper discusses the transition in the nature of
   LIH indebtedness in connection to the recent welfare retrenchment. The
   analysis of survey data and semi-structured interviews establishes the
   fact that LIHs experienced the greatest growth in unsecured debt to
   income ratio under austerity. More importantly, unlike the pre-crisis
   period when LIHs' debt reflected a desire `to keep-up with the Joneses',
   post crisis, a different form of indebtedness has emerged. There has
   been a notable rise in debt for essential needs such as rent, food and
   utility services. Liabilities are not only owed to banks and fringe
   providers (payday lenders, money shops, etc.) but also to non-financial
   companies and local authorities which have become de facto creditors.
   The evidence in this paper shows that these changes are directly related
   to the austerity measures, especially, to the cuts in welfare budgets
   and the intensified use of `disciplinary techniques' in the form of
   sanctions and administrative / legal enforcement of debt collection by
   public sector entities.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a critical reading of market discipline and its
   limitations as a mechanism in European economic governance. Consistent
   with neoliberal beliefs about market-based governance, the Economic and
   Monetary Union (EMU) is premised on the functioning of the government
   bond market as a fiscal-policy discipliner. However, the operation of
   market discipline requires that neither governments nor their private
   creditors can rely on an authority to bail them out. It, therefore,
   precludes the kinds of intervention by Eurozone's supranational
   institutions witnessed during the euro crisis. In the post-crisis
   context, efforts to strengthen market discipline continue to be
   frustrated by the growing reliance of financial institutions on
   government bond markets as well as the European Central Bank's (ECB)
   active participation in those markets. Having undermined the credibility
   of the market as an autonomous and apolitical mechanism of discipline,
   European economic governance struggles to come to terms with the rise of
   a supranational `economic sovereign' in the Eurozone.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the Myanmar Government, the Myanmar Tatmadaw (military) and
   eight ethnic armed organisations (EAOS) signed the 2015 National
   Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). In 2019, this agreement was signed by three
   more EAOS, and there have been four annual conferences (Union Peace
   Panglong Conference 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019). The ceasefire arrangements,
   which are present primarily in Southeast Myanmar, have failed to make
   significant progress in key areas such as the provision of access to
   civil documents and land to returning refugees, displaced persons and
   conflict-affected communities. Violence has escalated in the last two
   years. It is not an exaggeration to say that Myanmar is at a critical
   juncture of transition. This article examines how the peace process is
   being communicated amongst different civil society organisations,
   international organisations, donor organisations, and government
   representatives in an area directly affected by the peace process. The
   article details the experiences of these participants exchanged in
   workshop in Mon State in July 2018. The exchanges during the workshop
   reveal a practical obstacles faced by civil society organisations,
   especially, in their attempt to support returnees. Many reported
   frustration with the implementation gap between promoting a peace
   process and providing for local enabling conditions that support peace.
   Specific barriers faced by civil society organisations, and in turn the
   communities they are seeking to help were threefold: information and
   communication barriers concerning the peace process; women's fear and
   reluctance to seek services due to personal safety concerns, and the
   persistence of traditional gender norms which affects access to
   information.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the nature of expert knowledge-claims made about
   catastrophic reactor accidents and the processes through which they are
   produced. Using the contested approval of the AP1000 reactor by the US
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as a case study and drawing on
   insights from the Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature, it
   finds that the epistemological foundations of safety assessments are
   counterintuitively distinct from most engineering endeavors. As a
   result, it argues, those assessments (and thus their authority) are
   widely misconstrued by publics and policymakers. This misconstrual, it
   concludes, has far-reaching implications for nuclear policy, and it
   outlines how scholars, policymakers, and others might build on a revised
   understanding of expert reactor assessments to differently frame, and
   address, a range of questions pertaining to the risks and governance of
   atomic energy.},

Abstract = {Sir Maurice Oldfield became a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College,
   Oxford, when he retired from being head of MI6. No details have
   previously been given but recently his report to the college has been
   unearthed. It provides valuable insights but shows he was not a
   professional historian. He was looking at the interaction between
   unofficial advice and official policy, and picked on three key figures
   from before the Second World War. Comprehensive accounts of their
   exploits have only recently been published, significantly using material
   not available in 1978-9. His choice is impressive; his judgment was
   astute.},

Title = {A Genealogy of Economic Growth as Ideology and Cold War Core State
   Imperative{*}},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-29},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article critically examines and problematises the `taken for
   granted' status of economic growth within modern politics and political
   economy. It views economic growth is an ideology and structural interest
   of the capitalist state, one that serves the interests of a specific
   class or elite rather than, beyond a threshold, the interests of a
   majority in society. The article outlines some of the historical and
   institutional origins of economic growth as a core state imperative. It
   focuses on the immediate post-WW2 period, the Cold War, and the role of
   the OECD (and its predecessor the OEEC) in systematically disseminating
   and promoting GDP growth in Western European countries as a key part of
   the US led competition of the `free capitalist world' against the
   Communist bloc. The article suggests that economic growth is s a
   powerful idea that has become a keystone of the (initially
   Keynesian-based) political ideology of growth, which in turn enabled and
   empowered state and supra-state institutions, and acted as a
   legitimating ideology throughout capitalist societies.},

Title = {V for Vendetta as Vernacular Critique: The Exceptional State of
   Liberal Political Economy{*}},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-121},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper suggests that the liberal state in market society presents an
   inherent tension between liberalism and democracy. It shows how the
   tradition of liberal political economy provides for a constitutional
   form that supports specific and contestable values, relies on
   depoliticising the foundation of those values (especially in relation to
   private property and the bases of commercial society), and the exercise
   of authority - enshrined in the Rule of Law and backed by the force of
   law. The paper suggests that this has been poorly mediated in mainstream
   discourse, but that Moore and Lloyd's V for Vendetta provides an astute
   vernacular critique of the liberal state by developing clearly
   recognisable allegories of Thatcherite political economy that illustrate
   the formal nature of justice and democracy under the liberal state form.
   The paper makes the specific claim that V for Vendetta can be read as a
   significant critique of the political economy of the liberal state, and
   the more general claim that cultural artefacts have the potential to
   develop important insights into the relationship between state, economy,
   and society in keeping with the traditions of the `new political
   economy'.},

Abstract = {Collaborative research has grown remarkably in social science, bringing
   many benefits. Arguments for collaborative research are sometimes
   overstated, however, and this risks counterproductive consequences. In
   particular, the presentation of how collaborative research relates to
   other approaches to research may be problematic. Four issues are
   explored, concerning the potential consequences of: paying insufficient
   attention to history; conflating different and better; advancing
   simplified accounts of complex issues; and courting conflict. These
   discussions relate to cautionary tales involving diverse emotions: hope
   and disappointment, pride and shame, love and anger, and hubris and
   humility. All are variations on the theme that exaggerating a case can
   unintentionally hamper rather than assist the achievement of high
   quality, socially useful research. The conclusion advances a
   methodological pluralist stance, treating collaborative research as one
   option available to researchers rather than an inherently superior
   approach, thereby encouraging mutual tolerance and constructive dialogue
   while reducing the risk of reigniting oppositional `paradigm wars'.},

Abstract = {In post-Ferguson America, police departments are being challenged to
   implement evidence-based changes in policies and training to reduce
   fatal police-citizen encounters. Of the litany of recommendations
   believed to reduce police shootings, five have garnered widespread
   support: body-worn cameras, de-escalation training, implicit bias
   training, early intervention systems, and civilian oversight. These
   highly endorsed interventions, however, are not supported by a strong
   body of empirical evidence that demonstrates their effectiveness. Guided
   by the available research on evidence-based policing and informed by the
   firsthand experience of one of the authors in implementing departmental
   reforms that followed the fatal shooting of a civilian by an officer,
   this article highlights promising reform strategies and opportunities to
   build the evidence base for effective use-of-force reforms. We call upon
   police executives to engage in evidence-based policing by scientifically
   testing interventions, and we call on academics to engage in rapid
   research responses for critical issues in policing.},

Abstract = {The agenti imperiali, the officials, ambassadors and military commanders
   representing the Emperor Charles V in Italy, made use of his status as
   Holy Roman Emperor and of the claims this gave him and them to intervene
   in Italian states over which he did not rule directly, to aid in
   establishing Spanish hegemony over Italy. The example of Lucca, a small
   state that asked for Charles's protection as an Imperial city, while
   resolutely maintaining its independence and trying to fend off demands
   from the emperor and the agenti imperiali for heavy financial
   contributions to the maintenance of the Imperial army in Italy, casts
   light on how this was done. It shows that even if Italian states such as
   Lucca might occasionally describe themselves as subjects of the Emperor,
   they were not prepared to be treated as though they were; it was the
   manner in which the demands were made, not just the amounts of money
   demanded, that aroused their resistance. The attitude Charles took to
   Lucca, his willingness to listen, eventually, to the protests of the
   Lucchese and to order his agenti in Italy not to oppress them or to make
   incessant demands on them, support the position of those who argue that
   he was not inherently hostile to republics.},

Abstract = {Controversial incidents involving uses of force by police in recent
   years have led to calls for improving officers' de-escalation skills. A
   more fruitful approach to police training reform may be a broader focus
   on improving officers' social interaction skills. By viewing all
   police-citizen encounters as social interactions that can either
   escalate toward or de-escalate away from the use of force, police
   training can develop what other fields call a ``deliberate, repetitive
   practice{''} framework. This article describes the implementation of a
   randomized trial that brought such training to two U.S. police agencies
   and yielded encouraging results. We conclude that the conceptual
   framework was generally well received but that results depended heavily
   on the selection and performance of each agency's own trainers.},

Abstract = {Since the heyday of Jacques Delors, the Commission has been challenged
   by the rise of the European Council, the empowerment of the European
   Parliament and the creation of European agencies. However, while many
   scholars agree about the direction of change, there is disagreement
   about the extent to which the Commission's position has declined. A
   number of studies are sceptical, and we join this sceptical line. Our
   contribution is to focus on the Commission's role as a maker of both
   legislative and executive rules (implementing and delegated acts). These
   rules are all decided under complex inter-institutional procedures. But
   the Commission possesses the right of initiative in all procedures. We
   investigate how the Commission can use this first-mover advantage to
   influence EU policy. We establish a framework for understanding what
   strategic options the first-mover advantage entails and provide a first
   empirical illustration with a qualitative analysis of ten selected
   Commission proposals.},

Abstract = {Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The
   stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional.
   United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence
   community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to
   explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations
   are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence
   practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an
   intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the
   problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate
   both intelligence and cybersecurity.},

Abstract = {Violence against women continues to be one of the most pressing global
   concerns. Reparations for women victims of violence have been addressed
   by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
   against Women Committee over the last 15 years. This article critically
   examines the evolving practice of the Committee on reparations, in light
   of the transitional justice doctrinal and normative acquis on
   gender-sensitive reparations. We systematize legal interpretations,
   identify trends and milestones, and link them to transitional justice
   elements. We also suggest that the transitional justice reparations
   framework can be, and is in fact being, applied to nontransitional
   contexts, independent of armed conflict and authoritarian regimes.
   Further, we propose recommendations for the Committee to engage in a
   more explicit `dialogue' with these ongoing developments to the benefit
   of women in their everyday lives and in recognition of the structural
   dimension of violence against women, even in what are other so-called
   peaceful and stable societies.},

Title = {Who Is and Is Not Served by Child Protective Services Systems?
   Implications for a Prevention Infrastructure to Reduce Child
   Maltreatment},

Volume = {692},

Abstract = {The majority of alleged abuse or neglect reports to the U.S. child
   welfare system are either screened out prior to an investigation (i.e.,
   at the ``hotline{''} stage) or investigated only to be closed with no
   finding of immediate child safety concerns. Yet while many of these
   children and families are at risk of subsequent incidents of child
   maltreatment or child welfare system involvement, they are not
   systematically offered services or benefits intended to reduce this risk
   at the point that child protective services (CPS) ends its involvement.
   This article provides an overview of the ``front end{''} of the child
   welfare system, commonly referred to as CPS, highlighting which families
   are served and which are not. We then argue for a systematic and
   coordinated child maltreatment prevention infrastructure that
   incorporates elements of ``community response{''} programs that several
   U.S. states have implemented in recent years. Such programs are focused
   on families that have been reported to, and sometimes investigated by,
   CPS, but no ongoing CPS case is opened. We further argue that such
   programs need to pay particular attention to economic issues that these
   families face.},

Abstract = {Private regulatory programs, such as certification schemes, seek to
   control market access by providing greater certainty about products'
   credence attributes, including sustainability features of production
   processes. This article contributes to the literature that assesses the
   verification processes that determine whether private rules are being
   followed sufficiently by applicant rule-targets (usually companies), and
   the regulatory intermediaries (auditors, assessors) that perform
   verification functions. By examining variation in the duration of
   verification processes of applicant rule-targets, we question the
   assumption that within the context of a given program's design the
   efficiency of the verification process is invariant across time and
   space. We argue that the verification process can impose hurdles that
   are independent of rule-targets' sustainability and their adherence to a
   private program's rules. Our analysis of 312 fisheries seeking Marine
   Stewardship Council certification shows that variation among
   intermediaries and objections to their certification decisions explain
   differences in the time it takes fisheries to receive market access.},

Abstract = {This article offers a discourse analysis of ideas of international
   brotherhood in Central and Eastern Europe. Taking the example of
   brotherly ideas centred on the Caucasus in Polish and Serbian media, it
   examines structures and dynamics of the imagined brotherly connections
   between these nations. Using the sociology of knowledge approach to
   discourse (SKAD) and critical geopolitics as a theoretical framework, a
   three-tier model of circulation of geopolitical imaginations is
   developed. The analysis interprets the emergence of brotherly ideas as
   resulting from the elite search for new geopolitical certainties after
   1989.},

Title = {The Cruel Optimism of Militarism: Feminist Curiosity, Affect, and Global
   Security},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {This article asks: why do communities located at the periphery of the
   global security market continue to participate, even when they gain the
   least economically and politically? To answer this, we explore how
   militarism-an affectively felt logic that understands military service
   as desirable and/or inevitable-manifests through both affective
   relations and colonial structures. We focus on Gurkha communities in
   Nepal with a colonial military heritage of two hundred years with the
   British. Feminist and postcolonial research on militaries has
   demonstrated how war and global insecurity is framed through gendered
   colonial economies and discursive logics, shaping military systems and
   subjects. Yet what remains underexplored is the affective dimension of
   how militarism operates within, and in relation to, militarized
   communities outside the ``West{''} whose identities and material
   conditions are structured through colonial histories. To address this
   gap, we operationalize Lauren Berlant's (2011) concept of cruel optimism
   to capture why these communities stay attached to militarism when the
   costs abound. We argue that militarism within the Gurkha context is both
   affectively felt and structurally experienced in such a way that it
   renders a military pathway to a good life as natural and desirable,
   despite evidence of the fragility and impossibility of pursuing this
   path.},

Abstract = {Attempts to integrate feminist security studies (FSS) and feminist
   global political economy (GPE) were first meticulously studied in the
   Critical Perspectives sections of the June 2015 and December 2017 issues
   of this journal. Although the debate has gained presence in workshops,
   at international conferences, and even on dedicated websites, the
   diverse contributions have remained rather theoretical (e.g., Bergeron,
   Cohn, and Duncanson 2017; Hudson 2015). The aim of these Critical
   Perspectives essays is to take the integration of FSS and GPE one step
   further by presenting empirically grounded contributions that help us
   contextualize the existing theoretical debates. By focusing on postwar
   contexts, the pieces here take seriously the material conditions of
   women's empowerment from a perspective attuned to the gendered and
   racialized logics structuring social orders in postwar states. We
   believe that these are the spaces where war economies and peace
   economies meet and where (gendered) structural transformation of
   societies is possible. Like the two previous collections, we do not
   understand FSS and GPE as additive (Chisholm and Stachowitsch 2017).
   Rather, we understand them as traditions that share a common goal,
   namely, to undermine the racialized neoliberalism and patriarchal
   capitalism underpinning international intervention and postwar
   reconstruction projects.},

Abstract = {What does the state do to prevent consumers from losing access to basic
   services in the market due to financial hardship, and under what
   conditions will this occur? Bringing together the literature on
   regulatory governance and the welfare state, this article compares
   regulatory regimes that prevent loss of access to services in the UK,
   Sweden, and Israel in housing credit, electricity, and water, as well as
   to the electricity and housing credit sectors in the EU, from the early
   1990s to the 2010s. The article finds that regulation to address this
   issue was introduced in all but the Swedish cases. This highlights the
   significance of the welfare state context in addressing these issues
   through regulation, as more residual welfare regimes are associated with
   more social protection through regulation.},

Abstract = {This article uses a unique dataset from the September 2019 municipal
   elections in St. Petersburg in order to examine empirically the efficacy
   of strategic voting under authoritarianism, as manifest in the effects
   of the ``smart vote campaign{''} of Alexei Navalny in Russia. The
   analysis allows for the conclusion that the campaign, while technically
   similar to the vote advice applications that are now widespread in many
   democracies, was efficient enough to make a significant difference in
   the overtly authoritarian context. We demonstrate empirically that
   Navalny's call for strategic voting did indeed affect the behavior of
   the electorate, particularly by improving strategic coordination among
   opposition-minded voters; that the electoral results of the candidates
   backed by the ``smart vote{''} campaign tended to be better than the
   electoral results of other non-United Russia candidates; and that as a
   result of the ``smart vote{''} campaign, the dominant party's electoral
   results deteriorated quite visibly.},

Abstract = {Most theoretical and empirical accounts of trade politics focus on
   political conflict among competing private interest groups and over
   policies between the dichotomy of trade liberalization and
   protectionism. This article challenges this conceptualization by arguing
   that issues of antitrust, market power, and competition are central to
   the politics over free trade, and that in this domain state actors are
   comparatively more important. Original archival evidence from the
   American New Deal and post-war foreign economic policy shows that
   post-war free-trade policies were heavily influenced by views, formed in
   the 1930s, about domestic industrial organization and antitrust. These
   preferences were then pushed into international economic policy during
   and after World War II through trade negotiations, extraterritorial
   application of American law, and pressure for domestic competition laws
   abroad. In one of the most prominent episodes of trade liberalization,
   an antitrust campaign and debate permeated trade issues, based in
   independent state learning and economic preferences.},

Abstract = {This article compares immigrant and ethnic organizations in four major
   immigrant-receiving cities and reveals substantial variation across
   these immigrant gateway cities. Using data from ethnographic fieldwork
   and an original database of relevant organizations in New York City; El
   Paso, Texas; Paris; and Barcelona, I find differences in organizational
   type and density, as well as in their legitimacy and funding. This
   article contributes to a growing literature on immigrant organizations.
   Although immigrant organizations have a long history in some cities,
   they may not always operate in ways that enhance refugee and migrant
   integration. Comparing immigrant organizations is fruitful because it
   tells us more about city and national political systems and why distinct
   localities deal with cultural minorities differently. These comparisons
   can help the readers to understand the barriers and ladders that
   immigrants encounter in different cities and inform policy-makers in
   designing better approaches to incorporate immigrants.},

Abstract = {Citizens' identification with Europe could consolidate European
   integration. European Schools, created for children of EU officials,
   should mirror the EU's vision of citizens of member states united in
   (national) diversity. Instead, this study reveals that European School
   students construct an explicitly European in-group and deviate from EU
   visions by differentiating themselves from a more national and less
   mobile lifestyle. The article draws on qualitative content analysis of
   in-depth and focus group interviews with teachers and 101 students in
   European Schools in Germany, Luxembourg and England. This elucidates the
   relationship between European schooling and this peculiar but ultimately
   European identity. In a dual mechanism, by `doing Europe', students
   actively nourish a transnational social network in school; by `telling
   Europe', students are more passively exposed to European and diverse
   national narratives. Both the analysis of how their European identity
   emerges and descriptive underpinnings show the complexity of European
   identity construction even under most favourable conditions.},

Abstract = {In view of the deferred start of negotiations for the modernization of
   the customs union between the EU and Turkey (CU-EUT), we looked back and
   analysed the ex post trade consequences of the CU-EUT. Employing
   up-to-date econometric best practices for regional integration
   agreements, we quantified both the total and the heterogeneous trade
   effects of the CU-EUT. In contrast with most previous studies, our
   results indicate that the CU-EUT made a significantly positive, large
   and robust impact, implying there was an additional increase in
   EU-Turkey trade in manufacturing by 55-65 per cent compared with that
   during the previously active Ankara Agreement. We also provide evidence
   that the CU-EUT significantly increased Turkey's trade with non-member
   countries of the CU-EUT. Additionally, a substantial heterogeneity in
   the CU-EUT effect was found across different industries as well as for
   each of its member countries and the direction of trade. We linked the
   heterogeneity of up to 911 coefficient estimates to the differences in
   initial trade costs and show that it cannot be ascribed to reductions in
   bilateral tariff rates.},

Abstract = {This article advances scholarship on comparative regulation by moving
   beyond the conventional focus on formal law and EU comitology to assess
   the extent of `practice convergence' in the implementation of EU
   regulation. Drawing on 50 key informant interviews, a survey, and policy
   document analysis, we compare how regulators in England, Germany, France
   and the Netherlands have implemented EU requirements that food safety
   inspections be `risk-based'. Focusing on a clear dependent variable -
   risk-scoring methods - we find important differences in the conception
   and targeting of risk-based inspections; with starkly different
   implications for what kind of food businesses they need to target to
   ensure safety within an ostensibly harmonized single market. We
   attribute variation in the implementation of risk-based inspection to
   the ways that EU requirements were filtered through long-entrenched
   regulatory styles and modes of food business organization in each
   country, reinforcing preexisting inspection practices in the design of
   new risk-based tools.},

Abstract = {Against the ``intellectual monoculture{''} that organizes American IPE,
   this paper draws on Inayatullah and Blaney's conception of ethnological
   IPE and Escobar's analysis of the production and management of poverty
   in the Third World in order to study Appalachia. The paper focuses on
   Christian missionaries and educators and their work among populations of
   poor whites at the Konnarock Training School for girls. It shows how
   diverse actors transformed a stable set of social differences into stark
   interpretations of neediness, institutionalized those interpretations,
   and enacted them onto the bodies of locals in specific ways that
   reflected global, colonial patterns of stark inequality (1830-1930). The
   paper is organized into an historical narrative with four main points of
   examination: the contact zone where class and religious differences
   emerge as politically significant interpretations of neediness; the
   institutionalization of those differences as neediness through the
   construction of a church, mission, and school; the educator's discursive
   production of class and religious differences in a global context
   through their writings in a missionary magazine; and the educator's
   discursive production of scientifically measured differences of race,
   particularly a degraded whiteness. Through a cultural political economy
   of colonialism, Appalachia was produced as a peripheral zone populated
   by a marginal people within the world's economic core.},

Abstract = {Imperial powers, facing considerable information challenges in far-flung
   territories, adapted intelligence practices and machinery to fit local
   conditions. In contrast to the attention placed on British intelligence
   activities in territories considered within the `formal empire' (i.e.
   where Britain was in direct control), we know very little about
   intelligence arrangements in `informal empire,' where external powers
   exerted influence and protected their interests by working through local
   elites. Exploiting declassified documents and drawing upon interviews
   with retired intelligence officials, this article reveals Britain's
   unique intelligence system in a remote corner of empire - the Trucial
   States (today's United Arab Emirates) - which was built around a group
   of roaming officers tasked with collecting full-spectrum intelligence.},

Abstract = {While political scientists have researched explanations for the dearth
   of women in elected office for decades, no consistent account has
   emerged. We enter the discussion using an original experimental survey
   on an adult sample at the national level to examine whether gender
   stereotypes affect the evaluation of candidates running for office. We
   specifically look at situations where there is alleged wrongdoing to
   explore whether evaluations are asymmetrically applied to men and women.
   We find that voters treat candidates differently, exhibiting a general
   preference for women. When malfeasance is alleged, however, women suffer
   greater consequences for wrongdoing under certain conditions,
   potentially as a result of a ``backlash{''} effect for violating gender
   norms.},

Abstract = {Based on original survey data, this essay analyses the political
   attitudes of individuals displaced by the war in eastern Ukraine. We
   systematically compare attitudinal differences and similarities along
   three axes: the displaced relative to the resident population; the
   displaced in Ukraine relative to the displaced in Russia; and the
   displaced from the (non-)government-controlled areas relative to the
   resident population in the (non-)government-controlled areas of Donbas.
   This fine-grained comparative analysis highlights the variety of
   attitudes held by the displaced, similarities in attitudes across
   displacement locations, and the effect of war casualties on attitudes
   and self-declared political interest.},

Abstract = {Memory in Colombia is a human right that is recognized for victims and
   society in the framework of processes of transitional justice, and in
   the last decade there has been an institutionalization of memory, with
   organizations arising whose purpose is to manage memory initiatives in
   the country. However, organizational and community memory and
   denunciation processes and practices have been developed, materialized
   and represented through objects/images, like sources and references for
   memory aimed to account for the atrocious past and promote acts of
   resistance and humanity amid the inhumanity of war. From a fragmentary
   perspective, we concentrate on three cases of images in Colombia that,
   based on religious and cultural representations, allow us to observe
   their power in processes of recovering memory, of denunciation and
   demands with regard to respect for human rights.},

Abstract = {Violent borders are one of the most pressing ethical and political
   questions of our time. This article seeks to challenge the violent
   construction of borders through the concept of noise. Drawing on Michel
   Serres's philosophy of noise and Marie Thompson's emphasis on its
   affectiveness, the article shows the generative, disruptive, and
   affective power of noise at the border. I argue that noise creates a
   disruption in the system and, in doing so, calls for new encounters and
   relations that operate within and beyond existing power relations. I
   suggest that the figure of the noisy-subject creates, interrupts, and
   disturbs the border. The noisy-subject simultaneously prompts disorder
   and order on the border and transforms it into a third space that is
   neither simply captured by the sovereign nor fully emancipated from its
   power. The border as a third space constantly moves with the affective
   force of its noisy-subjects.},

Abstract = {Men have slowly increased their presence in paid care jobs that have
   long been considered as ``women's jobs.{''} But job growth in the paid
   care sector is polarized between ``good{''} jobs and ``bad{''} jobs in
   terms of pay and job security, and racial minority men are more likely
   to enter low-paying care-work jobs. Using work history data from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and 1997, this study examines
   the patterns and mechanisms of racial disparity in young men's access to
   jobs of varying pay levels in the care-work sector and how such patterns
   have changed as the labor market has become more precarious and unequal.
   Findings suggest that young black men-especially those without a college
   education-have been increasingly excluded from accessing ``good{''} jobs
   in the paid care sector. Moreover, this black-white disparity cannot be
   fully explained by racial differences in individual-level
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {This essay provides an economic geography perspective on the causes and
   consequences of the war in eastern Ukraine. It focuses on the
   controversial proposition that the armed conflict in 2014 was triggered
   by domestic, economically determined factors. The essay argues that
   economic and material circumstances in the region had generated neither
   necessary nor sufficient conditions for a locally rooted, internally
   driven armed conflict. The role of the Kremlin's military intervention

Abstract = {The contributions comprising this special section are part of a more
   general wave of research that is revisiting and/or re-envisaging the
   environmental state. They do so from the perspective of critical
   political economy. This article provides an assessment of their
   respective contributions while also reflecting on how those seeking to
   understand the greening (or de-greening) of the state from this critical
   political economy perspective might extend their critical theory to
   `critical problem-solving' in ways that are attentive to the politics of
   transition. To this end, I play Bailey off against Barry and Craig to
   illustrate how critical problem-solving might be approached.},

Abstract = {After a long siege, on 12 July 1470 Mehmet II's troops conquered the
   island city of Negroponte (Eubea), a colony crucial for the Venetian
   maritime state after the fall of Constantinople. Two days after the sack
   the sultan made his triumphal entry into the city and ordered the
   massacre of the adult male population, both colonials and members of the
   Venetian government in loco, in revenge for a similar action by Venetian
   troops exactly one year earlier, during the sack of Aenos (Eno), near
   the Dardanelles. The hero of that sack, the Venetian captain-general
   Nicolo da Canal, now became the villain when he refused to order his
   outnumbered fleet to relieve besieged Negroponte, and was ordered
   brought back to Venice in chains to await trial. Women and children were
   carried off as slaves and held for ransom. A number of the colonial
   women in time made their way to Venice and petitioned for government
   aid; two of them co-founded a convent of Franciscan tertiaries, the
   convent of the Holy Sepulchre, on the site of a hospice for female
   pilgrims on Venice's Riva Schiavoni. In the church was a ``grotto{''}
   designed by Tullio Lombardo and meant to represent the sepulchre in the
   Holy Land. Some of the nuns, considered capable of working miracles,
   were raised to the status of beate by Franciscan hagiographers.},

Abstract = {Over the past seventy-five years, the UN secretary-general has come to
   occupy a highly visible position in world politics. While the UN Charter
   describes the post merely as the ``chief administrative officer{''} of
   the organization, today it is widely recognized that the
   secretary-general also plays a central role in political matters. What
   makes the role of the UN secretary-general special? Where does the
   office's authority come from? As part of the special issue on ``The
   United Nations at Seventy-Five: Looking Back to Look Forward,{''} this
   essay looks back at the tenures of previous UN secretaries-general and
   applies ideas from sociological institutionalism to argue that the UN
   secretary-general holds the position of a ``guardian{''} of the UN
   Charter. The UN secretary-general, more than anyone else within the UN
   system, represents the UN overall. From this flows great
   responsibilities and challenges, as the UN secretary-general is often
   expected to step in when other parts of the UN are unable or unwilling
   to act, and to take the blame when things go wrong. But this special
   position also endows the office with a substantial degree of authority,
   which future holders of the office can use to shape policies and
   mobilize support as the UN seeks to address urgent global challenges.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has undermined the division between the private
   sphere of the home and the public sphere of politics that has
   traditionally disadvantaged women political leaders. Whereas male
   political leaders historically drew on their traditional role as the
   male head of household to display forms of masculine protectionism
   toward citizens, women leaders are now able to draw on their traditional
   motherly role-for example, as the member of the household who
   traditionally cares for the sick-to display forms of feminine
   protectionism. As a result, international women leaders have managed to
   leverage women's role in the home to their advantage in the political
   sphere. Significantly, an appreciation of traditionally feminine
   attributes in women political leaders has been displayed in much media
   coverage, providing more favorable coverage of female political leaders
   than was previously the case.},

Abstract = {One of the main objectives of EU trade policy is to establish wider
   protection for its regional specialty foods, known as Geographical
   Indications (GIs). In spite of US opposition, the EU has successfully
   considered additional protection for its GIs a red line in recent trade
   agreements. A key piece to the puzzle of this success is that whereas
   the literature has typically treated trade and non-trade issues as a
   dichotomy, GI protection encompasses both trade and non-trade aspects.
   In the EU, trade agreements are negotiated by the Commission but require
   member state approval. Both Greece and Italy have threatened not to
   ratify CETA over insufficient GI protection, so GIs clearly matter. This
   article develops and tests a theory of GI protection using new data on
   GIs listed for protection in 11 recent EU trade agreements. It finds
   that EU trade agreements are more likely to protect GIs with higher
   sales values and from countries in the South of Europe, where GIs are
   highly salient because of gastronationalism. These findings illustrate
   how economic, cultural and political factors shape and enable EU policy
   exports through trade agreements.},

Abstract = {This article frames whistleblowers as regulatory intermediaries who
   provide a response to the problem posed by the fragmentation of
   knowledge in a complex society and market economy. I identify two ways
   in which whistleblowers become regulatory intermediaries: The first is
   by remedying informational asymmetries between the regulator and the
   target (instrumental approach). Both in the United States and in the
   European Union, whistleblowers are protected on the basis of the value
   of the disclosed information for the advancement of regulatory
   objectives. The second way in which whistleblowers become regulatory
   intermediaries is by contributing to the development of ``communities of
   compliance{''} and by enhancing the internal self-regulatory capacities
   of regulatory targets (reflexive approach). Creating internal channels
   of reporting and monitoring is perceived as a way to change the
   organizational culture of targets. Through the instrumentalism -
   reflexivity dipole, competing rationales and normative visions of
   regulatory intermediation become apparent: It could, on the one hand,
   facilitate state intervention and legal sanctions or, on the other hand,
   signal the aspiration to embed public and social values in private
   actors.},

Abstract = {This article documents the findings of an empirical project combining
   socio-legal and media studies, which examined journalists' perceptions
   of their role in relation to transitional justice in Kosovo. Based upon
   the qualitative analysis of 30 semi-structured interviews with
   professional journalists in Kosovo during the summer of 2018, the
   article shows that key issues in the study of transitional justice
   appear in respect of what, building on notions of `peace journalism',
   can be termed `transitional journalism'. Issues include the extent to
   which `transitional journalism' is, or should be, a distinct `field' at
   all; as well as debates about the relative priority to give to
   accountability, reconciliation, historical accounting, or victims'
   rights within the practice of `transitional journalism' at any given
   time. Identifying and engaging with these issues will allow greater
   agency in, and ownership of, decisions taken about `transitional
   journalism'.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the power of large technology corporations has become a
   focus of public debate in both developed and developing countries. This
   growing chorus brings together complaints about breaches of privacy and
   data protection, competition and market consolidation, and electoral and
   other political interference. The most powerful of these companies have
   grown into behemoths by establishing themselves both as purveyors of
   their own products, and as the hosts of ``platforms{''} that
   circumscribe, and profit from, the activities of other organizations.
   This platform function gives these companies substantial power over
   their commercial rivals, who depend upon these platforms to operate.
   More fundamentally, this article argues, the dual function of these
   ``platform companies{''} allows them to straddle the very categories
   that we use to organize our understanding of the political and economic
   world. They are at once product companies, service companies and
   infrastructure companies; players in the market and markets of the
   marketplace; private platforms and public spheres. The straddling of
   these categories places these companies in the institutional cracks of
   the regulatory system. Moreover, companies consciously exploit this
   regulatory straddling to thwart challenges to their power. This article
   argues that such deliberate shape-shifting has allowed these companies
   to control the political and economic stage on which their own power
   must be contested, and compromised the ability of scholars, the public
   and ultimately states to see clearly, and therefore constrain, that
   power.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on transnational business governance has begun to
   examine public-private interactions and the active role of governments.
   We make two key contributions that integrate and expand this literature.
   First, in juxtaposition to functionalist accounts, we foreground the
   fundamentally political and often contentious character of these
   interactions. As private transnational governance schemes and standards
   ``hit the ground,{''} private-public interactions, we argue, are
   embedded in national political arenas and tied to domestic
   distributional struggles among competing regulatory coalitions. Building
   upon multiple empirical streams of research, we develop a
   political-strategic framework that maps the diversity of Southern
   government responses (substitute,adopt,repurpose,replace, orreject) to
   transnational private governance. Our framework shows that government
   responses are a function of bothstrategic fitwith domestic industrial
   capabilities and structures, and strength ofdevelopmental state
   capacity. Second, our proposed framework adopts the vantage point of
   Global South governments and industries, particularly how development
   challenges and strategic options within global value chains affect their
   understanding of, and responses to, transnational schemes and standards.
   This is an important corrective to a Northern bias in the private
   governance literature.},

Abstract = {This article examines Irish and Portuguese protesters' perceptions of
   the EU in the decade since the European debt crisis. Building on EU
   politics, social movement and protest literatures, we ask how domestic
   protesters in both countries perceive the EU during its age of crisis
   protest timescape. We find that critical Europeanism, which rejects
   technocratic and neoliberal Europe and works towards an alternative,
   social Europe, has travelled beyond austerity/bailout protests into
   women's rights and housing protests in both countries, although to
   varying degrees. We suggest that the expansion of critical European
   perceptions in these traditionally Europhile member states forms part of
   the social and political legacy of the European debt crisis, but also
   contributes to the continued Europeanization of the European social
   movement space. It could have positive impacts on the EU's legitimacy
   deficit if EU institutions engaged meaningfully with critical European
   voices.},

Abstract = {Transnational sustainability governance often builds upon standards.
   Considering that the rise of transnational governance has blurred
   accountability relations, this article interrogates how and with what
   consequences a standards development organization (SDO) mobilizes
   standards for the sake of accountability. Following a partial
   organization perspective, standards are conceptualized as combinations
   of organizational elements that enhance accountability both
   retrospectively and prospectively. A historical case study of the
   Fairtrade program details the argument and shows how the SDO modified
   standards aligned with institutional expectations. As the alteration of
   one organizational element led to a chain reaction, the standards
   unintentionally transformed from an organizationally lenient tool into a
   sophisticated blend of organizational elements. Thus, the standards
   strengthened the accountability of those being governed, while
   accountability to the public was enhanced by changes in the
   organizational structure of the SDO. The article contributes to a
   nuanced understanding of the link between accountability and standards,
   highlighting their contingency and context dependency.},

Abstract = {The expansion of social welfare regimes in middle-income countries
   (MICs) has become a global trend that has involved the adaption of
   robust social assistance programs aiming to alleviate poverty and
   diminish inequalities. We analyze conditional cash transfers in Brazil,
   Mexico, and Turkey, identifying the types of regulatory regimes that
   exist in each, namely ``loose decentralism{''} in Brazil, ``strict
   centralism{''} in Mexico, and ``subcontracted dirigisme{''} in Turkey.
   We argue that regulatory design is key to understanding how the newly
   flourishing welfare regimes can control political manipulation, and that
   where manipulation occurs, social assistance programs can deviate from
   their initial objectives and endanger the welfare of the poor and hazard
   trust in the government and political institutions. However, when social
   welfare regimes work in line with their objectives and eschew political
   discretion, regulatory welfare states can enhance trust in and
   legitimacy of political institutions. Our analysis indicates that a
   centrally regulated social assistance governance nurtured by local
   knowledge is key to avoiding political manipulation and to alleviating
   poverty, major issues in MICs.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-2009, by means of a major
   Western state-led initiative in tax cooperation designed to eliminate
   tax evasion in the world, offshore financial centers were required to
   exchange information on bank accounts, first on request, then
   automatically. Even though all major offshore financial centers have
   agreed to the new tax standards, the emerging literature on global tax
   politics disagrees on their effectiveness. To make sense of these
   contrasting findings, I argue that we need to shift our focus to the
   diverse ways that targeted actors have responded to the new standards. I
   develop a typology of resistance strategies and show why state actors
   engage in one or the other strategy despite pressure from great powers.
   New tax treaty data, as well as archival and interview material in the
   matched cases of the Bahamas and Barbados demonstrate variance in the
   relationships between governments and the financial industry, and
   governments and international organizations, which in turn leads to the
   pursuit of different resistance strategies. Ultimately, by highlighting
   the heterogeneity of targeted actors' responses to global standards, the
   study has important implications for the literature on institutional
   emergence and design writ large.},

   Global Economic Power},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-267},

Abstract = {A comparative historical perspective shows how globalization and the
   specificities of China's rapid growth era limit its hegemonic potential
   in the twenty-first century global economy. Although state capitalism
   and openness to foreign capital facilitated China's economic
   transformation, interactions among three forms of capital-state,
   private, and foreign-have produced developmental dynamics that constrain
   China's capacity to assume the position of the world's economic hegemon.
   These include (1) the compromised competitiveness of China's corporate
   sector due to the domination of state-owned enterprises, (2) limits on
   the ability of Chinese firms to develop leading transnational
   corporations, and (3) early openness to and continued dependence on
   foreign capital. Moreover, the party-state's efforts to ameliorate these
   constraints arouse external suspicion rather than support a Chinese-led
   hegemonic order based on consent and shared interests. These
   historically conditioned realities should temper expectations that China
   is converging teleologically toward a familiar hegemonic role in the
   international economy.},

Abstract = {The middle of the twentieth century witnessed a serious border dispute
   between China and India. This article explores how these countries used
   multiple media (e.g., historical documents and film) to support their
   respective territorial claims. The two countries pursued similar
   authoritarian approaches by expanding their archival holdings, banning
   books, and selectively redrawing maps. They regarded dissenting views
   not only as incorrect but as national security threats. China and India
   policed domestic media to legitimize government policies and to present
   their cases to the international community. The British government, for
   its part, demonstrated its support for India. Because British leaders
   sympathized with their former colony and because the borders of India
   were a product of the British Empire, leaders in the United Kingdom
   endorsed Indian propaganda. Nevertheless, democracy in India and the
   United Kingdom rendered complete control of the media difficult. The
   Sino-Indian conflict therefore represented a war over information as
   well as territory.},

Abstract = {In opening this special issue, our conceptual essay reclaims the
   importance of revisionism for regional analysis. It identifies and
   offers key conceptual and analytical tools for a multifaceted analysis
   of revisionism, discussing its various forms in relation to the aims and
   risk propensity of a given country. As a transdisciplinary and
   theoretical eclecticism, dilemma analysis is utilised to bridge the
   divide between political science, international relations, and security
   studies. To ascertain the extent of revisionism, we offer and
   operationalise six dilemmas seen as central for grasping its
   contemporary parameters: political order, political regimes, technology,
   migration, the economy, and the international system.},

Abstract = {Italy is the second largest market for Russian gas in the EU, and
   Italy-Russia energy relations stretch back to the Cold War period. By
   developing an original framework for the study of the politics of
   producer-consumer cooperation based on an international political
   economy approach and the analytical concept of forms of state, this
   article examines the origins, evolution and current features of
   Italy-Russia dyadic energy relations. This analysis, in turn, offers an
   important contribution to the study of EU-Russia relations and sheds
   light on the reconfiguration of East-West gas interdependence within the
   context of the integration and liberalisation of the EU energy sector.},

Abstract = {This article examines the official U.S. reaction to the Soviet
   government's use of force in the Baltic republics in January 1991, not
   only showing the complexity of the U.S. position but also demonstrating
   how reactions in Washington became harsher in the space of a week,
   eroding the previous ``Gorbachev first{''} attitude. The article
   identifies the main reasons for this shift, especially West European
   reactions, domestic pressures, and growing concerns that violence in the
   Baltics marked the end of perestroika. The analysis sheds light on a
   larger debate between Kristina Spohr and Celeste Wallander about Western
   attitudes toward the Baltic question at the Cold War endgame. The
   article is based on newly available archival materials in the United
   States and France as well as on documents from the archives of the
   Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow and in the Latvian State Archives.},

Abstract = {The rise of populist political rhetoric and mobilisation, together with
   a conflict-riven digital public sphere, has generated growing interest
   in anger as a central emotion in politics. Anger has long been
   recognised as a powerful driver of political action and resistance, by
   feminist scholars among others, while political philosophers have
   reflected on the relationship of anger to ethical judgement since
   Aristotle. This article seeks to differentiate between two different
   ideal types of anger, in order to illuminate the status of anger in
   contemporary populist politics and rhetoric. First, there is anger that
   arises in an automatic, pre-conscious fashion, as a somatic, reactive
   and performative way, to an extent that potentially spirals into
   violence. Second, there is anger that builds up over time in response to
   perceived injustice, potentially generating melancholia and
   ressentiment. Borrowing Kahneman's dualism, the article refers to these
   as `fast' and `slow' anger, and deploys the distinction to understand
   how the two interact. In the hands of the demagogue or troll, `fast
   anger' can be deployed to focus all energies on the present, so as to
   briefly annihilate the past and the `slow anger' that has been deposited
   there. And yet only by combining the conscious reflection of memory with
   the embodied response of action can anger ever be meaningfully sated in
   politics.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The term ``global South{''} refers to developing countries as a whole,
   but recently, numerous developing countries - Brazil, China, India,
   Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Thailand, South Africa, and others -
   simultaneously grew wealthier while many other countries remain poor.
   This prompts a fundamental question: does the global South demonstrate
   unity in international politics, with developing countries at various
   wealth levels behaving like one another, and in ways unlike the
   industrialized ``North{''}? Or is the global South fractured, too
   economically and politically diverse to operate in tandem? Theoretical
   expectations are mixed, and the empirical record is inconclusive. To
   adjudicate, we pinpoint a stringent set of observable implications that
   should hold if the developing world is to be considered at all unified
   vis-a-vis the industrialized world. Then we probe those implications
   with statistical analyses of over 3,600 paragraphs of text from
   governments' negotiations concerning trade and environmental policy, a
   policy space that facilitates generalizability by representing
   fundamental sovereignty and wealth issues underlying traditional
   North-South frictions. Our finding - that overall, developing countries
   exhibit surprising unity - weighs in on central theoretical and policy
   debates in international relations, comparative politics, and political
   economy.},

Abstract = {International political economy (IPE) has explained financial
   globalization as the result of states deciding to open up and liberalize
   domestic financial systems. Complementing this `negative integration'
   view, we present a theory of financial globalization during the 1970s
   that emphasizes the importance of `positive integration.' Credit money
   systems are characterized by public-private infrastructural
   entanglements, the management of which require substantial institutional
   work by monetary technocrats, both at the domestic and at the
   international level. To illustrate our theory, we trace the expansion of
   the Eurodollar market during the 1970s. Drawing on archival records from
   the `Standing Committee on the Euro-currency Market' at the Bank for
   International Settlements, we show how this group of G-10 central
   bankers sought to elevate the management of infrastructural
   entanglements from the domestic to the international level. By ensuring
   that the Eurodollar market did not interfere with domestic monetary
   governability, while seeking to provide protection for issuers of
   Eurodollars, monetary technocrats helped establish the institutional
   infrastructure for the expansion and globalization of the offshore US
   dollar system.},

Title = {Brexit for finance? Structural interdependence as a source of financial
   political power within UK-EU withdrawal negotiations},

Abstract = {For most analysts, Brexit reveals the highly contingent power of finance
   and the clear limits to its ability to influence crucial policymaking
   outcomes. By contrast, I contend that UK-EU negotiations demonstrate the
   unique capacity of finance to secure substantial commercial protections
   relative to all other business sectors and that the structural sources
   of the City's political power remain exceptionally robust. Elaborating a
   notion of `structural interdependence', the paper demonstrates how
   policy officials on both sides came to perceive that the future
   prosperity and stability of their economies relied upon maintaining open
   trading relations in financial services. This necessitated broad
   continuity in access to London's deep financial markets for EU firms and
   preservation of the City's leading role in the UK growth regime. In
   establishing these claims empirically, I document an extensive range of
   contingency measures designed throughout December 2018-April 2019 that
   would function to protect the financial industry from economic
   disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The outcome illustrates how
   finance benefits from a form of structural power that does not require
   instrumental mobilisation, but rather shapes policy decisions on the
   basis of deeply entrenched and commercially vital cross-border financial
   entanglements.},

Abstract = {The unemployment rate among youths (age 20-29) in South Korea has
   increased sharply from 6.6 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2016. At
   the same time, the college entrance rate remains around 70 percent, and
   skill mismatch among college goers is a critical policy concern. Little
   attention has been paid to temporal change in labor market outcomes
   among college graduates or to the kinds of graduates who are
   particularly vulnerable to labor market uncertainty. We investigate how
   labor market experiences for college graduates have changed over time
   using data from nine different graduating cohorts of the Graduate
   Occupational Mobility Survey (GOMS). The results reveal that the
   proportion of those searching for a job has increased over time, and
   that even for those who were employed, job quality deteriorated. We also
   find a growing gap in labor market outcomes by reputation of graduating
   universities and college major.},

Abstract = {Are women's parties effective? More than 50 women's parties have emerged
   since 1990 in countries all over the world, contesting and winning seats
   in local, national, and regional legislatures. Although women's parties
   are not infrequent, appear in a variety of contexts, and advance common
   agendas related to inclusion and equality, we know very little about
   their experiences or whether they have been able to achieve their goals.
   In this article, Frauen Macht Politik (FraP!) is examined to consider
   whether and how women's parties present an avenue for advancing
   women'smovement goals. The evidence shows that forming a party can help
   the movement to set the public agenda, can increase the attention paid
   to their issues, and can influence the formal institutions of politics.
   Many variables neglected elsewhere in the literature shape the ability
   of niche parties to affect the commitments of more established parties:
   the nature of the small party; its composition, intent, reach, and
   resources; its institutional context; and the boundaries of the
   organization. These features also determine the extent to which women's
   movements can use a political party to influence the representativeness
   of a political system.},

Abstract = {Investigating the nexus of transnational capital, gender, and race, I
   argue that sexual violence and internal displacement tacitly serve the
   interest of transnational corporations (TNCs). Drawing on extensive
   ethnographic research in war-torn regions in Colombia, I elucidate how
   violence is deeply intertwined in the globalization of neoliberal
   capitalism and operates by exploiting and instrumentalizing
   constructions of gender and race that are articulated through colonial
   legacies and further dehumanize the ``Other.{''} The focus on
   intersectional power relations advances a critical understanding of the
   political economy of armed conflict. First, it reveals how local and
   global (economic) actors are entrenched in exacerbating local forms of
   domination that produce sexual violence and internal displacement
   through a particular political economy of masculinity and neoliberal
   forms of expansion and exploitation. Beyond that, both forms of violence
   are not only the product of colonial, capitalist, and gendered
   structures and ideas but also serve to re-entrench these power relations
   between dominant and subaltern groups. I conceptualize this relationship
   as the ``coloniality of violence.{''} It constitutes a shared space for
   violent forms of domination and appropriation that facilitates capital
   accumulation, and it may further foster a relation of structural
   oppression in ``post-conflict{''} Colombia.},

Title = {The Unconscious Countermovement and the Conscious Polanyian Movement: A
   New Vocabulary for Contemporary Polanyian Scholarship},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {152-167},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article aims to overcome an impasse in current Polanyian
   scholarship by suggesting a new vocabulary to explain Polanyi's `double
   movement' and `countermovement' concepts - the unconscious
   countermovement and the conscious Polanyian movement. It argues current
   literature often misinterprets these core concepts, which can lead to a
   misunderstanding of Polanyi's general thesis. This paper uses the Carton
   (2018. On the Nature of the Countermovement: A Response to Stuart et
   al.'s `Climate Change and the Polanyian Countermovement: Carbon Markets
   or Degrowth?'. New Political Economy)-Stuart et al. (2019. Climate
   Change and the Polanyian Counter-movement: Carbon Markets or Degrowth?
   New Political Economy, 24 (1), 89-102) debate on the countermovement to
   exemplify some of the current misapplications of the countermovement as
   explicitly `anti-capitalist' (Stuart et al. 2019. Climate Change and the
   Polanyian Counter-movement: Carbon Markets or Degrowth? New Political
   Economy, 24 (1), 89-102) movements. This paper argues that in fact all
   countermovements, as described in The Great Transformation, are
   necessarily non-ideological. I argue that dialectics and consciousness
   are fundamental to understanding the double movement and countermovement
   concepts and that highlighting the conscious/unconscious dynamic within
   Polanyi's work helps avoid misreadings of key concepts and provides a
   clearer and more comprehensive understanding of Polanyi's general
   theory.},

   treaty bodies, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights being
   one of them. Although the responsibility to implement lies with the
   state, treaty mechanisms play an important role in ensuring compliance
   with their decisions. The African Commission does not have an
   institutionalized mechanism tasked with implementation. It does however
   use other means such as promotion visits and the consideration of state
   reports to follow up on implementation of its decisions. This practice
   note recalls the approaches that the Institute for Human Rights and
   Development in Africa (IHRDA) and its partners have used and plan to use
   to follow up on implementation of the Kilwa decision. After a brief
   background on the case, this note assesses the content of the Kilwa
   decision, and outlines the road map for implementation. The note
   concludes with a look at the impact expected from the implementation of

Abstract = {This article describes a major shift in French capitalism: the emergence
   and development of the new private equity sector. It discusses the
   particularities involved in the construction of this capital
   accumulation centre in France, studying how an advantageous
   institutional arrangement was coproduced by fund managers, government
   and traditional industrial managers. As such, it takes an institutional
   approach focusing on the history of the rules that enable financial
   activities. This article's empirical material takes the form of
   (hitherto untapped) archives from the professional association of French
   private equity funds covering the period from 1984 to 2017, 12
   interviews with former presidents of the association and ten interviews
   with partners of large French private equity funds.},

Abstract = {``Civilization{''} is back at the forefront of global policy debates.
   The leaders of rising powers such as China, India, Turkey, and Russia
   have stressed their civilizational identity in framing their domestic
   and foreign policy platforms. An emphasis on civilizational identity is
   also evident in U.S. president Donald Trump's domestic and foreign
   policy. Some analysts argue that the twenty-first century might belong
   to the civilization state, just as the past few centuries were dominated
   by the nation-state. But is the rise of civilization state inevitable?
   Will it further undermine the liberal international order and fuel a
   clash of civilizations, as predicted by the late Samuel Huntington? Or
   might ideas from East Asian and other non-Western civilizations
   contribute to greater pluralism in our thinking about world order and
   the study of international relations?},

Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-188},
Abstract = {Armed reprisals are the limited use of military force in response to
   unlawful actions perpetrated against states. Historically, reprisals
   provided a military remedy for states that had been wronged (often
   violently) by another state without having to resort to all-out war in
   order to counter or deter such wrongful actions. While reprisals are
   broadly believed to have been outlawed by the UN Charter, states
   continue to routinely undertake such self-help measures. As part of the
   roundtable, ``The Ethics of Limited Strikes,{''} this essay examines the
   doctrine of armed reprisals in light of recent instances of states using
   force ``short of war{''} in this manner. We argue that the ban on
   reprisals has been largely ignored by states, and that recent attempts
   to apply the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain (such as
   theTallinn Manual) are further weakening this prohibition. We conclude
   that this is a potentially dangerous development that lowers the bar for
   resorting to military force, risking escalation and thereby further
   destabilizing the international system.},

   and unilateralism. Though it has been resilient in the past, the current
   challenges from within the order are unprecedented. Without being too
   pessimistic, I expect the LIO will survive but retract to its original
   core states in North America, Europe, and Northeast Asia, shedding some
   of its universal pretensions. States that remain within the liberal
   order, in turn, will compete with an alternative Chinese-led
   international hierarchy built around all or part of the current Belt and
   Road Initiative countries. While international institutions can
   facilitate cooperation, they do not bridge this emerging divide
   sufficiently to forestall conflict and, in any event, will not be
   sufficiently robust to prevent a new cold war. As part of the roundtable
   ``International Institutions and Peaceful Change,{''} this brief essay
   sketches this argument and concludes with some possible ways of
   moderating future conflicts.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research among far-right youth movements, this
   chapter discusses the view of a ``new Europe{''} as manifested in young
   activists' discourses and practices. In arguing that it is necessary to
   better understand local contexts of political mobilization, it
   simultaneously foregrounds the transnational orientation of young
   far-right militants and the interplay of local and translocal factors in
   shaping their activism. In so doing, this chapter seeks to shed light on
   the background and the main rationale for their alternative
   conceptualizing of Europe and to situate it in a long tradition of
   thinking about Europe, recognizing similarities with the developments in
   the early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {In July 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a Commission on
   Unalienable Rights, charged with a reexamination of the scope and nature
   of human rights-based claims. From his statements, it seems that Pompeo
   hopes the commission will substantiate-by appeal to the U.S. Declaration
   of Independence and to natural law theory-three key conservative ideas:
   (1) that there is too much human rights proliferation, and once we get
   things right, social and economic rights as well as gender emancipation
   and reproductive rights will no longer register as human rights; (2)
   that religious liberties should be strengthened under the human rights
   umbrella; and (3) that the unalienable rights that should guide American
   foreign policy neither need nor benefit from any international
   oversight. I aim to show that despite Pompeo's framing, the Declaration
   of Independence, per se, is of no help with any of this, whereas evoking
   natural law is only helpful in ways that reveal its own limitations as a
   foundation for both human rights and foreign policy in our
   interconnected age.},

Abstract = {This article examines United States (US) women service members' and
   veterans' feelings about their military lives and afterlives as they
   participated in the annual Ms Veteran America (MVA) contest. Drawing on
   observations and qualitative interviews, the article explores the
   workings of gendered power within the US armed forces, and US militarism
   more broadly, through the tensions and contradictions of these women's
   experiences. The article makes two contributions. First, MVA is shown to
   be a rich site for feminist analysis, with the contest constituting a
   distinct political space that permits the expression of emotions and
   affects that contestants feel otherwise unable to express in their
   everyday military lives. Second, through its attention to the range of
   emotions and affects felt by the women, the article complicates stories
   of militarized desire, as contestants are simultaneously drawn toward
   and pulled away from their military lives and US militarism. The article
   argues that the everyday functioning of US military life relies on, and
   is productive of, particular feelings of its women members, and that
   these affective experiences matter for understanding US militarism and
   military power.},

Abstract = {In this article, we evaluate gender differences in COVID-19 conspiracy
   theory beliefs. We find that women are significantly less likely than
   men to endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories and that this gender
   difference cuts across party lines. Our analysis suggests that this
   gender gap is partially explained by two dispositional factors: learned
   helplessness and conspiratorial thinking. Our findings qualify past work
   on the antecedents of conspiracy theory beliefs, which does not uncover
   robust and significant gender differences. The results highlight the
   need for work in this area to better theorize about the significance of
   gender.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has gendered implications for women's time and
   resources. The use of informal institutions that pose obstacles to
   women's electoral viability may also be particularly consequential at a
   time of rapid change, when election dates and procedures are being
   amended because of health concerns. Together, these dynamics suggest
   that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact women's electoral participation,
   support, and viability in meaningful ways. The November 2020 Brazilian
   municipal elections provide an opportunity to explore this. Employing
   data from an original survey of eligible individuals and aspirant
   candidates, we find that the main obstacle to women's representation is
   not personal political ambition or efforts but women's perceptions of
   their access to support for their candidacies. In the face of greater
   challenges, resilient aspirants are choosing to work harder to
   compensate for potential losses in campaign support and funds.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political consequences of widespread social
   changes in North Korea to illuminate how, if at all, shifts in everyday
   life influence the power of an autocratic government. Our study is based
   on 23 interviews with North Korean defectors in 2017 and supplemented by
   interviews conducted in previous years. The main finding is that social
   practices associated with marketisation, flows of information, and
   increased corruption have not yet provided the foundation for collective
   challenges to the regime. It is, however, also clear that official
   norms, rules, and institutions have been significantly weakened to adapt
   to new social realities.},

Abstract = {A crisis often presents an opportunity for policy shift and a time to
   get ahead of the competition. But for the Gulf Arab states, the twin
   crises of the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapse of oil prices in 2020
   have accelerated trends already underway to differentiate their economic
   policies and force more aggressive responses to demands for job creation
   and market liberalization. The Covid-19 pandemic has called upon states
   to intervene and support domestic economies, making the competing
   priorities of shrinking public sector payrolls and stimulating domestic
   demand all the more difficult. What emerges are trade-offs that reveal
   leadership priorities, targeted support, and important distinctions
   within the ever-weakening body of the GCC on a range of policies from
   immigration, labor markets, fiscal programs and taxes, to monetary
   policy.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the existence of a previously unknown but
   important type of self-directed political behavior by International
   Organizations (IOs) that I termintervention. Intervention occurs when an
   IO secretariat acts with the intention of altering an anticipated
   decision at a partially-overlapping IO in a regime complex. Intervention
   is a distinct type of behavior by IOs that differs from either
   bureaucratic competition among IOs for mandates, resources and policy
   influence, or cooperation to achieve joint regulatory goals and enhance
   performance. I probe the plausibility of intervention through an
   analysis of three illustrative case studies in the regime complex for
   food security showing self-directed political actions by the
   secretariats of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Food
   Programme (WFP) and Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
   (OHCHR) directed at altering decision-making by states at the World
   Trade Organization (WTO). I identify three distinct intervention
   strategies - mobilizing states, public shaming and invoking alternative
   legal frameworks - in which IOs utilize their material, ideational and
   symbolic capabilities to influence decision-making not within their own
   institutions, but at other, overlapping organizations in a regime
   complex over which they have no direct control.},

Abstract = {Many international development organizations (IDOs) have officially
   mandated anti-corruption criteria for aid selectivity. Substantial
   debate remains over whether corruption deters aid and whether
   anti-corruption rules are effectively implemented. We argue that the
   extent to which both corruption and anti-corruption mandates factor into
   IDO allocation depends on the composition of the donors. Using existing
   data on corruption alongside newly collected data on anti-corruption
   mandates, we demonstrate that organizations composed of corrupt donors
   are just as likely to adopt, but less likely to enforce, anti-corruption
   mandates. Organizations composed of less corrupt donors, by contrast,
   tend to divert aid away from corrupt states, with or without formal
   anti-corruption rules in place. The findings have implications for the
   debate over whether international efforts to institutionalize ``good
   governance{''} standards are sincere or cheap talk, whether multilateral
   strategies are in fact less politicized than bilateral aid allocation
   strategies, and whether international organizations should be inclusive,
   open to membership by many or even all states, including those with
   dubious track records.},

Pages = {1236-1256},

Abstract = {Respondents often answer `don't know' to sensitive survey questions to
   avoid revealing their true opinions, especially in post-conflict
   societies, thus requiring difficult decisions for analysing affected
   survey data. Using the same five sensitive questions in ten surveys from
   conflict-affected societies in the former Soviet Union in the period
   2005-2014, methods for coping with missing data resulting from `don't
   know' responses are presented. Many commonly applied missing data
   treatments are shown to be incompatible with the missing data mechanism
   for politically sensitive questions, while also significantly affecting
   statistical results and conclusions. Ultimately, knowledge of local
   context is paramount for choosing proper missing data treatments.},

Abstract = {Although political scientists have increasingly focused on the role of
   gender in the policy process and the characteristics of individual
   lobbyists, little is known about the gender politics of the government
   relations profession. We extend the study of professional women to the
   unique political context of Washington, DC, lobbying, an important form
   of political participation that is understudied in terms of gender.
   Using data from more than 25,000 individuals registered to lobby the
   federal government from 2008 to 2015, we show that women account for
   37\% of the lobbyist population in Washington, that female lobbyists are
   more likely to work as in-house employees than for contract lobbying
   firms, and that the largest Washington lobbying firms are strongly
   biased towards employing men. We add to these findings qualitative data
   from in-depth interviews with 23 lobbyists to reveal how the
   professional experiences of women often depend on the idiosyncrasies of
   lobbying employment and the political nature of their work. We conclude
   that the underrepresentation of women in the professional lobbying
   community is an underappreciated problem with broader implications for
   gender equality in elite political participation.},

Abstract = {This special section ofNew Political Economydemonstrates the value of
   critical environmental political economy for our understanding of
   energy, and possibilities for, just energy transformations. In the
   following essay, I identify key themes from the special issue papers
   addressing the political economy of decarbonisation strategies and
   potentially deeper green transformations in capitalist economies. These
   are: (1) the historicity of energy-society relations; (2) the crisis
   tendencies of energy capital; (3) the spatial re-configurations
   associated with energy transitions, and (4) the generative and
   contradictory dynamics of political contestation. By foregrounding these
   analytic themes, political economic analyses challenge much of the
   existing energy transition literature that describes fuel switches and
   technological innovation without thematising relations of power or the
   historical significance of capitalist eco-social relations of energy. In
   order to advance the critical political economy contributions to our
   understanding of energy transition, I discuss key analytic insights from
   this tradition into agency, structure, space and process.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of the reframing of climate change
   as a question of the `end of the fossil fuel age'. This was a common
   interpretation of the logic of the Paris Agreement in the UNFCCC in
   December 2015, the implications of the IPCC's fifth assessment report,
   and in the framing of climate change by the fossil fuel divestment
   movement. The paper argues that this signifies an important shift in the
   framing of climate change, away from ones such as `emissions reduction'
   or `decarbonisation', towards more transformational understandings of
   climate change. It aims to contribute to attempts to repoliticise
   climate change by focusing on how this frame helps us re-emphasise the
   political conflicts inherent to climate change politics, ignored by more
   technocratic visions of `economic efficiency' or `transition
   management'. But at the same time, it seeks to problematise some
   attempts to recast climate change as political, by emphasising the

Abstract = {China has drawn massive benefits via expanded trade since it acceded to
   the WTO in 2001. We might therefore reasonably expect it to have taken a
   more assertive lead in trying to rectify the travails in which the
   organisation finds itself mired, attendant with its rising power status,
   its active trade diplomacy elsewhere, the high levels of relative gains
   it has enjoyed since becoming a member, and its broader trade
   dependency. That China has not done so represents a puzzle, which is
   usually answered with reference to the international picture: i.e. that
   global trade has appeared to be holding up reasonably well throughout
   and beyond the global crisis, and, despite some inchoate protectionism,
   there generally exists a broad commitment to an open trading regime. Yet
   this only tells part of the story: China's approach cannot simply be
   `read off' from the structural context and there are, in fact, a series
   of interesting domestic explanations for why China has remained a
   `reluctant leader' of the WTO too. On the basis of a series of
   interviews with Chinese experts, we offer a more complete account of
   these processes that better recognises patterns of agency, and how China
   navigates a contingent international order.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the discovery by Britain and the
   United States in the late 1940s/early 1950s that cipher machines
   produced compromising emissions, a phenomenon which became known as
   Tempest. The British and Americans were forced to develop security
   measures to protect their encrypted communications but the Soviet Union
   was still able to exploit Tempest emissions from cipher machines in
   Western embassies in Moscow and read their diplomatic traffic. At the
   same time, Tempest became an important new way for the NSA and GCHQ to
   gather communications intelligence, particularly from developing world
   states and NATO allies.},

Abstract = {This article outlines a rigorous and systematic approach to evaluating
   both the performance and impact of national preventive mechanisms (NPMs)
   formed under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
   Many human rights practitioners remain sceptical about both the
   desirability and feasibility of evaluating human rights work. One
   obstacle has been that `indicators' of human rights progress are
   formulated without evidence that they actually have a causal
   relationship to the intended outcome. By contrast, the tools used in
   this assessment model are derived from scientific research into what
   forms of torture prevention actually work, meaning that greater weight
   can be assigned to more effective activities (and vice versa). The model
   is piloted in an assessment of the performance and impact of the
   Georgian NPM, which in ten years of work is shown to have had a
   significant impact in reducing the incidence of torture and other
   ill-treatment, particularly in police detention and prisons.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to scholarship on power, agency and ownership
   in professional transitional justice. It explores and details the
   relationship between `professional' agency arising from recognized
   expertise and `unprofessional' voices relaying lived experiences,
   concerns and needs. I approach this relationship via a microperspective
   on the work of the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission
   (2002-2004), specifically its work on women and sexual violence, which
   the commission was mandated to pay special attention to. Based on
   interviews and rich archival materials, I show how this work was driven
   by the notion that there was a right way of dealing with women and
   sexual violence. To avoid mistakes, commissioners and staff members
   demanded and relied on recognized expertise. This led to a
   marginalization of victims' voices. I argue that, to some degree at
   least, such marginalization belongs to professional transitional justice
   and will persist despite improved victim participation.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine whether and how the success of refugee
   integration varies over time and the factors that facilitate successful
   integration. Using data from the Refugee Integration Survey and
   Evaluation (RISE), we assess the integration of 467 newly resettled
   refugees in Colorado over three consecutive years, beginning in 2011. We
   find that that integration significantly increases with more time in the
   United States, and that age, gender, and education in one's home country
   explained approximately half of the variance in overall integration
   three years postarrival. The integration pathways we derive from the
   data explain a sizable component of the variance, and we find
   differences in the integration process across the population subgroups
   that we examine.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an amendment to and empirical application of the
   much-acclaimed concept of market-based banking to the case of
   GermanSparkassen.It does this by challenging both public and scholarly
   opinion on savings banks as resilient spearheads of traditional banking
   and relationship lending. Through a close and structured comparison of
   two thrift institutions in the context of the entire savings banks
   sector during three decades it demonstrates that alternative banks
   should not necessarily be considered as bulwarks against
   financialisation, but analysed more carefully with respect to various
   push and pull factors, while bearing in mind the changing context in
   which they operate. This not only opens up new paths for further
   research on the relationship of structure and agency in an era of
   finance-led accumulation but stimulates a critical debate on the
   prerequisites of and perils to not-solely for-profit financial services.},

Abstract = {This article makes a dual contribution. First, it adds an intersectional
   perspective to studies of depletion through social reproduction,
   examining the depletion experienced by children and adolescents caring
   for their younger siblings in Mexico City. The depletion that child
   carers experience is shaped by age, low income, other forms of work in
   and outside the home, and gender. Second, we explore the limitations of
   cash transfer welfare programmes by examining their failure to address
   the needs of children who provide care within the family and show how
   misperceptions by social policymakers of the experiences of young carers
   limit the capacity of social policies to make a difference to their
   well-being. The article underlines the importance of the greater
   recognition of social reproductive work by poor children and
   adolescents, and of the intersectional depletion that they experience,
   both within social policy and in academic research.},

Abstract = {A comparative analysis of emotional taxation was conducted to
   investigate the affective cost of entering the political process among
   1,019 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI)
   activists in the United States (n = 355), the United Kingdom (n = 230),
   South Africa (n = 228), and Australia (n = 206). Four consistent trends
   were identified across these four contexts, with important implications
   for the study of social movements, youth activism, gender, sexuality,
   and race. First, levels of emotional taxation resulting from LGBTQI
   activist work were consistently very high. Second, emotional burdens
   were systematically greater for young, nonwhite, and transgender
   activists. Third, emotional taxation was compounded for activists whose
   identities crossed multiple marginalized groups. This finding supports
   the validity and importance of intersectional approaches to LGBTQI
   issues. Fourth, the sources of emotional taxation varied greatly among
   activists, and transgender activists were particularly stressed by
   public engagements such as major events and marches. Transgender
   nonwhite activists also indicated relatively high levels of emotional
   stress related to online forms of engagement, such as posting on Twitter
   and Facebook. These findings could help identify the kinds of activists
   who participate, the kinds of issues advocated for, and why certain
   tactics are used.},

Abstract = {The 1999 unprecedented emergence of West Nile virus in the western
   hemisphere represented a health security warning intelligence failure.
   This paper reviews the timeline of warning signal recognition and
   associated missed opportunities to bridge strategic and tactical
   assessments. The complexity of signal evolution involving multiple
   public and private institutions and professional disciplines, coupled to
   inherent biases and shortfalls in interpretation, resulted in
   significant delays in warning communication and lost opportunity for
   preparedness and emergency response.},

Abstract = {Intelligence in defence organizations is widely seen as an
   under-researched topic. This paper assesses this claim and, by means of
   a metareview, systematically analyses the body of literature that has
   focused on intelligence in defence organizations between 2009 and 2018.
   The review includes 13 key journals on intelligence studies (e.g.,
   Intelligence and National Security), military studies (e.g., Small Wars
   and Insurgencies) and conflict and peace studies (e.g., Journal of
   Strategic Studies). The analysis provides insight on the focus areas,
   the timeframes and conflicts that are addressed as well as the authors
   involved. Based on this, the paper provides suggestions for further
   research into intelligence within defence organizations.},

Abstract = {This Note discusses a new creative approach to intervene in the
   interaction between survivors who contribute their memories of a painful
   past and the public they want to reach. It proposes that by turning both
   the narrator and the public into performers of listening, they are
   placed in a relational context that offers an alternative space in which
   victims' and the public's memories, emotions and thoughts in a
   transitional context can be worked through. The method thereby corrects
   the notion of the public as a disembodied, virtual totality underlying
   state-led transitional justice institutions.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the evidence on young people in the UK making the
   transition from school to work in a changing socioeconomic climate. The
   review draws largely on evidence from national representative panels and
   follows the lives of different age cohorts. I show that there has been a
   trend toward increasingly uncertain and precarious employment
   opportunities for young people since the 1970s, as well as persisting
   inequalities in educational and occupational attainment. The joint role
   of social structure and human agency in shaping youth transitions is
   discussed. I argue that current UK policies have forgotten about half of
   the population of young people who do not go to university, by not
   providing viable pathways and leaving more and more young people
   excluded from good jobs and employment prospects. Recommendations are
   made for policies aimed at supporting the vulnerable and at provision of
   career options for those not engaged in higher education.},

Abstract = {Some form of legislative oversight of intelligence has become the norm
   in most democratic states. The near universal acceptance of the need for
   democratic oversight does not, however, mark the end of a process of
   intelligence accountability. In many states following a period of
   establishment and then consolidation, intelligence oversight mechanisms
   have begun to evolve as oversight committees have sought extra powers
   and developed new roles. This article examines reforms in parliamentary
   intelligence oversight committees in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and
   the UK, focusing on the form, mandate, membership, powers and resources
   of the committees as well as their engagement with other parliamentary
   actors.},

Title = {The Social Contradictions of Regional Development in the ALBA-TCP: The
   Case of Food Production},

Abstract = {The Latin American regional institution of the ALBA-TCP (Alianza
   Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra America-Tratado de Comercio de
   los Pueblos) has garnered much deserved scholarly attention due to its
   radical rhetoric, novel forms of geopolitical cooperation and forms of
   regional development. However, extant studies of ALBA provide little
   insight into the concrete actors at the helm of its development
   policies. To expand our understanding of this regional organisation,
   this article offers a critical political economy perspective into the
   class dynamics of food production within ALBA, via empirically grounded
   research findings. Mobilising Nicos Poulantzas' theory of the capitalist
   state, as well as subsequent innovations in neo-Poulantzian theory, the
   analysis reveals how the spatial organisation of food production
   exhibits a markedly statist character. With specific focus on a series
   of ALBA-created rice-producing factories located in Venezuela, I show
   how the prevailing relations of production within these factories
   assumes a state-capitalist form, which runs counter ALBA's philosophy of
   social empowerment. Overall, the ALBA region's organisation of `shared
   development' remains highly fragmented and un-coordinated in the context
   of food production, vastly underwritten by the circulation of Venezuelan
   oil rents, and ultimately subsumed under the power of the bureaucratic
   state. There is, therefore, a conspicuous gap between the discourse of
   ALBA and the reality of its political economy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Russia's use of lethal violence against
   intelligence defectors has to be understood as a public spectacle in
   which Russian leaders and intelligence officials never intended to hide
   their role. This ``theatrical murder{''} functions primarily as a
   political signaling tool for a reasserting Russia to communicate to
   distinct domestic and foreign audiences. We historicize the phenomenon
   by outlining and explaining the KGB's approach towards defectors during
   the Cold War and show that ``theatrical murder{''} is a unique feature
   of Russia under Putin's rule. The empirical findings are used to
   significantly advance theorizing on signaling through covert action.},

Abstract = {How does inequality shape regime evaluations in Europe's multi-level
   governance system? I argue that rising inequality improves citizens'
   evaluation of the EU's political system. This effect is driven by two
   mechanisms. First, adverse social and political consequences of
   inequality within national democracies strongly erode national regime
   evaluations. This leads to an improvement of EU regime evaluations in
   relative terms. Second, citizens compensate negative national conditions
   by redirecting hopes to the supranational level. This compensation
   mechanisms further tilts regime evaluates in favour of the EU. An
   empirical analysis of change in national and European parliament trust
   across 27 member states and 14 years provides empirical support for this
   argument. It also shows that the two mechanisms coexist and that their
   relevance is conditioned by previous levels of regime support.},

Abstract = {The promotion of regionalism is a long-standing aim of EU foreign
   policy. This article argues that this aim also constitutes a strategic
   narrative of the EU, although it has not been framed as such thus far.
   The article assesses the EU's Asia policy using a strategic narrative
   framework, and relates this to the EU's relations with the Association
   of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It finds that the EU's promotion of
   regionalism narrative has changed over time, and that this change has
   primarily been triggered by the EU's reactions to ASEAN and the context
   of southeast Asian regionalism, and events closer to home, such as
   internal crises. However, it also finds that while the EU's narrative
   may have changed in response to the its own experiences, Brexit and
   other crises associated with the EU have not had a significant impact on
   how the EU's narrative is received, or on perceptions of the EU in
   ASEAN. This is primarily because ASEAN's perceptions of the EU have not
   always been aligned with the EU's promotion of regionalism narrative.},

Abstract = {``Independent{''} sex work outside red light areas in big cities in
   developing countries is an understudied phenomenon. Through a survey of
   independent sex workers in Delhi, India, this paper sheds light on the
   governance of independent prostitution. It shows that in the sex work
   industry, which is informal in nature and faces a complex legal
   architecture, regulatory intermediaries (RIs) drive both regulation and
   responsibilization strategies. On behalf of the state, the police act as
   regulatory intermediaries, implementing hierarchical regulation. In red
   light areas, sex workers' collectives and solidarity networks operate as
   RIs on behalf of workers. But in independent sex work, it is pimps who
   act as intermediaries for workers, driving their responsibilization
   strategies. Independent sex workers take up the services of pimps even
   though they charge hefty fees, in large part because pimps can negotiate
   their protection from the police. I examine several characteristics of
   the relationships between prostitutes, pimps, clients, and the police,
   and refine the RIT model of regulatory intermediaries (Abbott et al.
   2017) in the context of prostitution in a developing country.},

Abstract = {Bilateral relations between France and either Germany or the UK are the
   backbone of European security and defence cooperation. From a strategic
   and cultural point of view, these relations are not self-evident. In
   this article, we track the memory-framing processes accompanying the
   creation of major bilateral initiatives. Leaders such as Adenauer and De
   Gaulle, Mitterrand and Kohl, Blair and Chirac, and Sarkozy and Cameron
   imagined bilateral communities of fate informed by mutually
   understandable historical memories: the World Wars for the Franco-German
   relationship and the Empire for the Franco-British relationship. Based
   on these memory frames, Franco-German identity undergirds a policy-based
   integration of core state powers while Franco-British identity informs
   capacity-building and force projection (a resource-based integration).
   These bilateral identities led to earmarking national military forces
   for common purposes and intertwined defence industries. In some cases,
   they also provided an impetus for EU cooperation in the context of the
   Common Foreign and Security Policy or the Common Security and Defence
   Policy.},

Abstract = {This chapter critically assesses the assumption that the European Union
   (EU) is undergoing a crisis of legitimation. Using survey data, it shows
   that support of the EU and European integration is solid and that it
   plays a small role in the rise of populist parties. Then, it shows that
   Europeans favor increasing European cooperation but are reluctant to
   transfer national sovereignty to the EU. Finally, it traces this
   reluctance to the primacy of national over European identification.},
