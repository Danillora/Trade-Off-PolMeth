Abstract = {One of the justifications offered by European imperial powers for the
   violent conquest, subjection, and, often, slaughter of indigenous
   peoples in past centuries was those peoples' violation of a duty of
   hospitality. Today, many of these same powers-including European Union
   member states and former settler colonies such as the United States and
   Australia-take increasingly extreme measures to avoid granting
   hospitality to refugees and asylum seekers. Put plainly, whereas the
   powerful once demanded hospitality from the vulnerable, they now deny it
   to them. This essay examines this hypocritical inhospitality of former
   centers of empire and former settler colonies and concludes that, given
   that certain states accrued vast wealth and territory from the European
   colonial project, which they justified in part by appeals to a duty of
   hospitality, these states are bound now to extend hospitality to
   vulnerable outsiders not simply as a matter of charity, but as justice
   and restitution for grave historical wrongs.},

Abstract = {This article explores two gaps in the literature on European Union (EU)
   crises: firstly, the external effects of the crises on EU actorness and
   its relations with other countries and regions and, secondly, the
   uniqueness of the EU crises when compared to other world regions. The
   article explores these questions and argues that the crises did affect
   external views on the EU and its role in the world due to the influence
   of third country perspectives on its actorness and its ``intermestic
   nature,{''} but that the EU is not the only regional organization in
   crisis. As the case of Latin American regionalism shows, other regions
   have suffered from common systemic factors at the global level as well
   as from the decreased EU support of regionalism abroad.},

Abstract = {In its seventy-fifth year, the UN needs to reflect more seriously on its
   value in the current global scenario, the current flow of ideas, and the
   current flow of power that is prevalent in the world. It is important to
   recall that the UN was founded after World War II as a way of addressing
   conflict at the negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
   Negotiating peace, attempting to provide some form of justice, and
   affirmation of human rights seemed to be the aspiration. It is within
   this context that women engaged in affirming their own special location
   in society and economy. However, over the years the UN has revealed its
   inability to fulfill these goals. Perhaps in the midst of all these
   failures, the only category of people that has drawn strength from the
   UN, but now has to leave it behind, are women. Scattered as they were
   across a world of distances, women of different cultures and classes
   found strength in numbers and, through the UN system and the conferences
   they convened, became a power of their own. As part of the special issue
   on ``The United Nations at Seventy-Five: Looking Back to Look
   Forward,{''} this essay argues that today, however, women do not need
   and cannot have their aspirations be facilitated by the UN, because in
   their engagement with one another they have also recognized their
   differences. Being of similar gender does not necessarily overcome other
   oppressive differences.},

Abstract = {The complex issues of the twenty-first century cannot be addressed by
   disparate actors in the global arena. This has become even more apparent
   in 2020, as we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the UN and
   have witnessed the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The
   pandemic has put the UN system to the test, demonstrating weaknesses in
   regard to peace and security, sustainable socioeconomic development, and
   human rights, the three core mission areas of the organization. The
   underlying tensions between the ideals of liberalism associated with the
   UN's human rights and socioeconomic-development agendas and the
   institution of sovereignty, under nationalist strongman leaders
   throughout the world, stood in the way of an effective response. This is
   especially true as powerful states are able to thwart collective action
   in favor of their own perceived national interests. While the UN and its
   affiliated agencies, such as the World Health Organization, are still
   able to foster cooperation, their success is limited by the
   organization's inability to establish some form of authority and
   command.},

Abstract = {Much ink has been spilt by historians examining the social divisions
   within Venice's Terraferma population during the War of the League of
   Cambrai (1509-1517). Defeat at Agnadello (1509) saw most of the
   Republic's territory quickly over-run and occupied by the forces of the
   League, an occupation which saw the rural peasantry and urban working
   classes generally supporting the Republic, while the nobility was often
   divided in its loyalties. These divisions shape the background to this
   essay; but the essay itself focuses on more pragmatic questions. Did the
   lower orders fight for Venice? What forms did the resistance take? Did
   any such armed resistance contribute positively to the Venetian war
   effort? What can be reported about local leadership and the balance
   struck between spontaneous action and resistance organised and
   controlled centrally? What arms were available to the resisters? The
   essay seeks to address these questions by tracking the incidents (often
   horrific) reported in the early months of the war in the rural
   communities of Piove di Sacco in the Padovano, Mirano on the approaches
   to Mestre, the city of Treviso which uniquely remained in Venetian hands
   throughout the conflict, Feltre sacked many times, the violent
   borderland of the Valsugana and the city of Brescia, scene of the
   conflict's most destructive sack following the failed uprising of 1512.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents the work of Sheldon S. Wolin and Leo Strauss as it
   pertains to the politics of pedagogy. Their work shares the assumption
   that teaching is the transmission of knowledge. In contrast to this
   approach, I defend Jacques Derrida's concept of textual interpretation
   because it displaces the authority of the instructor, increases the
   interpretive range of texts and opens a space for the voice of students.
   This chapter thus puts into question the authority, hierarchy and
   knowledge nexus present in Wolin and Strauss's work and develops a form
   of radical political theory pedagogy as the practice of equality.},

Year = {2020},
Pages = {53-76},
Abstract = {There has been a considerable amount of studies on the quality and
   construction of social memory lately. The relationship between social
   memory and memory spaces and the construction of the nation and national
   identity is searched with respect to various countries, historical
   contexts and spaces. Social memory is accepted as a social production
   and construction but we must take into account the differences in
   historical contexts, specific conditions and places. In the Turkish
   case, most of the latest research on this area are concentrated on the
   early Republican period. In the 1920s and 30s, while trying to heal the
   wounds of the Balkan Wars, the Great War and the War of Independence the
   political cadres of the Republican period tried to improve the economic,
   political and social needs of the society, while working on the
   construction of the Turkish nation in domestic and foreign grounds. They
   tried to visualize and propagate the efforts of the new Republic and the
   developments of the period. Publications of those times were interesting
   in this sense. They published books and periodicals in foreign
   languages, joined in international fairs and exhibitions, especially in
   western countries. In this paper I would like to depict those efforts in
   a periodical published over 49 issues between 1933 and 1949, La Turquie
   Kemaliste that includes a catalogue of visual materials and
   illustrations representing modern Turkey.},

Abstract = {Police kill more than a thousand civilians each year in the United
   States, a much higher death rate than occurs in any other developed
   nation. One important cause of the epidemic of civilian deaths is the
   larger risk that the police who patrol American communities face from
   civilian assaults with firearms, widely owned and often not visible. Yet
   many hundreds of killings each year of civilians in the United States
   are not necessary to protect either police or others from
   life-threatening attacks. Governments in the United States have failed
   to collect reliable data, investigate the causes of high death rates, or
   develop administrative standards to reduce unnecessary killings. The
   power and expertise vacuums that govern the current ignorance and
   overkill in the police use of deadly force are the direct, if
   unintended, consequences of state and federal government failures to
   assert authority over the many thousands of local police forces that are
   progeny of the American federal system.},

Abstract = {Nation-building has been an important and often complicated process in
   countries like Ukraine, which emerged from ethno-federal communist
   systems. In Ukraine, a civic approach to national identity has gained
   support since 2013, but it exists alongside a more ethnic
   Ukrainian-focused view of national identity. This article focuses on a
   central element of civic national identity in Ukraine: citizenship.
   Survey data from both closed-ended and open-ended questions are used to
   gauge the appeal of a citizenship-based identity and the reasons that
   respondents view citizenship as an important part of who they are. The
   results point to a strong connection to citizenship as an identity, and
   to patterns about which groups of people claim citizenship as an
   important part of their identity and why. The findings indicate that, if
   and when a more civic-oriented identity becomes predominant approach to
   nation-building in Ukraine, citizenship will be a central part of the
   process.},

Abstract = {Does the International Monetary Fund (IMF) increase inequality? To
   answer this question, this article introduces a new empirical strategy
   for determining the effects of IMF programs that exploits the
   heterogeneous effect of IMF liquidity on loan allocation based on a
   difference-in-differences logic. The results show that IMF programs
   increase income inequality. An analysis of decile-specific income data
   shows that this effect is driven by absolute income losses for the poor
   and not by income gains for the rich. The effect persists for up to 5
   years, and is stronger for IMF programs in democracies, and when policy
   conditions, particularly those that demand social-spending cuts and
   labor-market reforms, are more extensive. These results suggest that IMF
   programs can constrain government responsiveness to domestic
   distributional preferences.},

Abstract = {Resilience is a concept in world politics that emerged as a way to
   respond to the impossibility of guaranteeing security in an era of
   complexity. Without a central authority to provide security, risk is
   devolved to the individual. Those who cannot secure themselves are
   enjoined to constantly adapt to the unknown. Where control over complex
   systems is now thought to be impossible, the path to managing risks is
   through self-control. This paper demonstrates how such a subject is
   produced, and indeed whose production, I argue, is crucial to the
   functioning of a global labor market that is governed ``without
   government.{''} Migrant domestic workers acutely instantiate the kind of
   human subjectivity called forth by neoliberalism-a ``resilient
   subject.{''} The paper describes how this ideal worker is produced
   through resilience training in various stages of the migration
   trajectory-during recruitment, training prior to deployment, and while
   on their overseas residency. This paper demonstrates how managing the
   insecurities of migrant domestic work means working on the ``self{''}
   rather than addressing gaps in legal or regulatory mechanisms. In
   resilience training, the worker becomes the necessary component of
   neoliberalism as a governmental rationality, one that is enjoined to
   transform risk into opportunity.},

Abstract = {The essay sheds light on the role of constitutional courts in
   transitional justice, focusing on their role in mitigating the conflicts
   between transitional justice and international human rights commitments.
   Through a study of the Czech Constitutional Court's case law, we
   demonstrate that international human rights work both as a constraint
   and a tool. Constitutional courts use international human rights law
   selectively, when it suits their reasoning and views on transition.
   Nevertheless, the influence of international human rights law
   strengthens over time, especially when supported by the adverse rulings
   of international bodies, and gradually prevails over transitional
   justice justifications.},

Abstract = {If we make reasonable guesses about where blind spots might exist in
   IPE, we might be able to shine a little light in their direction. A
   disciplinary blind spot is suggested whenever our innate scholarly
   skepticism gives way to assertions of certainty. A conceptual blind spot
   seems indicated whenever we take the idea of political `structure' to be
   more than a metaphor for the status quo and its impermanent routines. An
   empirical blind spot is to be suspected when the ideology of
   intergovernmentalism encourages us to exaggerate the limiting effect of
   organisational innovations in the mid-1940s, to avert our gaze from
   complex and ambiguous developments eight decades later, and to discount
   the probability of fundamental transformation in global governing
   practices over time.},

   measurement},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {65-87},

Abstract = {Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one of the world's most influential
   economic indicators, did not become truly global until it was
   implemented by China. China officially adopted GDP as an indicator of
   economic performance in 1993 when the country abandoned its
   Marxist-inspired national accounting system and joined the
   internationally harmonized System of National Accounts. As such, it was
   the last major country to begin producing GDP figures according to
   international standards. Since then, GDP has become deeply ingrained in
   China's economic governance. Yet, the adoption of GDP was complicated by
   mismatches between the ideology guiding China's reform process and the
   economic ideas underpinning international statistical standards. The
   Chinese government's translation of the standards into the domestic
   political-economic context lasted nearly a decade. This process was not
   foisted upon China from the outside, but rather was driven by domestic
   factors in an experimental fashion. This is best characterized as an
   atypical case of diffusion and an unsuccessful case of translation. It
   makes clear that macroeconomic measurement is inherently political, not
   a set of neutral `best practices'. The findings also point to the
   characteristics of the diffusion object as an underexplored but
   important factor that can undermine domestic attempts to translate or
   localize global policy ideas.},

Abstract = {To shed a realist light on court administration and the regulation of
   judges in liberal-democratic countries, we conduct an empirical study of
   an organ that has attracted little attention: the Director of Courts in
   Israel - an administrative entity that ``manages{''} the judiciary. In
   important respects, the Director may be regarded as a regulator of
   judges, thus assessment of judicial independence in Israel is incomplete
   without recognizing its presence. The institution of the Director has
   undergone agencification, which entailed augmentation of its capacities
   and an evolution in mindset regarding the implementation of these
   capacities. As a result, its powers, mode of operation, and organization
   have fundamentally transformed over time, as has the regulatory terrain
   within which judges conduct their business. By introducing novel
   indicators for assessment and applying them in an unfamiliar context,
   this paper offers important theoretical contributions to studies of the
   regulation and administration of courts and judges, and agencification.},

Abstract = {It is claimed that authoritarian regimes actively export their political
   systems. An alternative explanation maintains that authoritarian states
   are primarily concerned with geopolitical interests. Both explanations
   can produce coherent narratives. This article adjudicates among them by
   looking at Russia's relations with Transnistria, South Ossetia and
   Abkhazia. In all three unrecognised states Moscow could dictate the
   outcome of elections but has, increasingly, abstained from interference.
   These client states are utterly dependent on Russia's patronage and with
   its geopolitical interests ensured, Russia appears willing to grant them
   wide latitude.},

Abstract = {Radical right European contestation is analyzed mainly as claims
   denouncing European integration. Less focus is put on narratives
   suggesting how a supposed `truly European' political process should be
   and work. This paper explores how radical right actors use such
   counter-European claims within their competition strategies.
   Computer-assisted qualitative analysis of communication by Front
   National, Alternative for Germany and Fidesz during the humanitarian
   crisis debate 2015-16 demonstrates that radical right
   counter-Europeanism constitutes a nuanced tactical resource deployed to
   normalize nativist supply in the name of Europe. Unlike Eurorejectionist
   FN, Fidesz and AfD redefined Europe in nativist terms, attempting to
   draw legitimacy from association with European identity and cooperation.
   Concurrently, both actors justified Euronativism not only as
   antithetical to current EU values and political principles, but mainly
   as their more fundamental practice juxtaposed against `not (truly)
   European elites', effectively `hijacking' Europe from within. The
   findings deepen our understanding of radical right Europe-contesting
   competition strategies.},

Abstract = {Do business groups donate to the European Union's (EU) political
   parties? Does the party's ideology influence the donations it receives?
   Since 2008, the EU's political parties can receive financial
   contributions from private actors. This paper systematically maps and
   analyses the entire population of donations given to EU political
   parties from 2008 to 2015. The results show that business interests
   follow a selective strategy targeting with their donations right-wing
   parties; with Eurosceptic parties performing better than pro-integration
   parties. Conceptually, this study provides a hard resource for
   conceptualizing EU lobbying beyond information-access models, and
   potentially opens a path for comparatives with the US literature.
   Furthermore, it reveals that some parties have moved away from the
   public utility paradigm, raising question over donations impact on EU
   politics and policy-making. Empirically, it provides a unique image of
   interest group donations to EU parties over time.},

Abstract = {Since its academic introduction in the late 1980s, the concept of
   intersectionality has made a staple contribution to feminist
   scholarship. However, its institutionalised popularity and apparent
   depoliticisation have led scholars to raise two major concerns: the lack
   of a clearly defined intersectional methodology; and the erasure of
   black women scholars in intersectionality scholarship, particularly in
   the discipline of political science. While the latter rightly addresses
   epistemology and the politics of knowledge production, the former has
   lacked a thorough discussion on the ways in which epistemology impacts
   intersectional methodology, focusing instead on methods and method
   choice. Drawing on my own experience studying lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   trans{*} and queer people of colour activism in Canada, I argue that we
   need to bring epistemology into intersectional methodology. Hence, this
   article demonstrates how reflecting on one's positionality, one's
   embodiment of privileges and one's ethical responsibilities informs the
   ways in which researchers operationalise intersectional projects,
   thereby shaping methodology.},

   Turn in Macroeconomics},

Abstract = {The last decades of the twentieth century saw a liberal turn in
   macroeconomic policy from government discretion towards policy rules and
   depoliticisation. Intellectually, this turn was inspired by the wave of
   the New Classical Macroeconomic (NCM) theory that emerged to eclipse
   Keynesianism in the 1970s. This paper revisits some of the central
   papers and models of NCM, including Kydland and Prescott's 1977 `Time
   Inconsistency Model', Sargent and Wallace's 1976 `Policy-ineffectiveness
   proposition' and the micro foundations of the Lucas-critique from 1976.
   Through an investigation of the political and economic context inspired
   by Ellen Meiksins Woods' social history of political thought, this paper
   investigates the ideological tenets of the neoliberal turn in
   macroeconomics associated with NCM. In policy and scholarly debates, NCM
   has primarily been viewed as a critique of government intervention in
   the economy. This paper challenges this notion and stresses that NCM is
   not primarily a critique of government action, but rather a critique of
   the role of democracy and popular participation in governance. This
   rereading offers new insights into the relationship between neoclassical
   economics and neoliberal policy in the 1970s transition and casts new
   light on our general understanding of the relations between liberal
   political economy and democratic governance.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the transitional justice framework has expanded to
   include a broader notion of transformative justice, which strives for
   socio-political reform in addition to legal accountability. Over the
   course of two civil wars, Sudan has grappled with various attempts at
   transition and transformation with mixed results. Though the 2005
   Comprehensive Peace Agreement brought an end to decades of North-South
   conflict, South Sudan's subsequent descent into civil war has been
   characterised by a flawed transition and a lack of any immediate
   transformative potential.
   This paper analyses the Comprehensive Peace Agreement's transitional
   mechanisms. In doing so, it explores how certain mechanisms frame the
   `meta-conflict' about what the conflict is about, and how this can cut
   off a range of conflict resolution opportunities. It concludes by
   considering the legacy of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in
   contemporary Sudan and South Sudan, and how it might inform the
   prospective transitions in both countries.},

Abstract = {Minority groups frequently challenge the legitimacy of legal
   authorities, particularly the police. Without trust and legitimacy, the
   police encounter constant conflict and cannot function effectively.
   While past research has examined minorities' perceptions of the police,
   national minorities provide an interesting and under-investigated test
   case because of their inherent identity conflict with the state. The
   current research examines three factors to explain minority-majority
   disparities in views of the police: (i)police effectiveness and
   fairness; (ii)intergroup discrimination(termed relative deprivation in
   policing); and (iii)identification with the state. Findings from a
   survey of Jewish and Arab residents of nationally mixed neighborhoods in
   Israel (n= 394) suggest that while all of these factors account for
   minority-majority discrepancies in views of the police, perceptions of
   police fairness are particularly important. Furthermore, feelings of
   discrimination and low levels of identification with the state are less
   important than evaluations of fairness in explaining minorities'
   negative perceptions of the police.},

Abstract = {While national inequality has made headlines in recent years, income is
   far more unequally distributed globally than it is within any state. It
   is striking that global economic inequality has garnered so little
   attention in International Political Economy (IPE), given the field's
   longstanding interest in the distribution of resources and the structure
   of the global economy. This paper argues that IPE should regard the
   unequal global distribution of wealth and income as a central research
   concern and outlines a research agenda for doing so. Drawing on recent
   work by economists, it argues that global inequality is distinctively
   political in cause and consequence and sufficiently different from both
   global poverty and national inequality to constitute a unique object of
   inquiry. IPE has the theoretical and conceptual tools to study global
   inequality, but doing so will require bridging divisions between those
   who consider distributional consequences, though primarily in a national
   perspective, and those concerned with global hierarchies, but with less
   regard to national agency and economic policymaking. The effort is worth
   it, however, given the rich substantive agenda that foregrounding global
   inequality opens up on a series of topics that have not all (to date)
   been recognized as the core of the field.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how EU member states' distinct constitutional
   traditions shape the impact of EU juridification on national welfare
   states and social rights. These traditions come with different
   `constitutional social rights norms' - that is, distinct distributions
   of obligation and power to protect social rights between judicial and
   political actors. The article argues that norms common to the political
   constitutional tradition are less compatible with the EU's juridified
   notion of rights than those distinguishing legal constitutionalism. To
   develop this argument, the article takes an in-depth look at Germany and
   Sweden, which represent the two constitutional traditions. This reveals
   how the Swedish constitutional understanding of social rights as
   politically defined collective rights has shifted towards a more
   juridified notion of rights, as EU law effectively makes social
   entitlements defined in national legislation more justiciable. The
   already significantly juridified understanding of social rights in
   Germany, in contrast, comes closer to that of the EU.},

Abstract = {When addressing complex societal problems, public regulation is
   increasingly complemented by private regulation. Extant literature has
   provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of such complex
   governance structures, with most empirical studies focusing on how
   public regulation influences private regulation. Conversely, the impact
   of private on public regulation is less well studied. Here, we
   investigate this impact with a focus on technological change as possible
   mechanism. Based on a case study of energy efficiency in buildings in
   Switzerland, we find evidence of a symbiotic interaction between public
   and private regulation that leads to ratcheting-up of regulatory
   stringency. We identify technological change as the mechanism linking
   private and public regulation. We discuss the relevance of our findings
   for governance literature and regulators.},

Abstract = {This article offers a critique of a widespread political discourse that
   distinguishes `resentment' from `ressentiment', legitimating the former
   and dismissing the latter. This distinction not only incorporates some
   reactive sentiments at the cost of the depoliticisation of others, but
   also obscures the conditions of political action and judgement as such.
   Why is it necessary to constantly protect the socio-political order from
   the risk of moral corruption in these terms, and for whom? First, a
   historical distinction is made between three problems that play a key
   role in the evaluation of the reactive attitudes: their rationality,
   their authenticity, and their justness. It is then argued that the first
   two problems are ill-posed. These problems concern differences in
   degree, and are therefore always prone to the relativism of what,
   retrospectively, can be called `the resentment-ressentiment complex'.
   The true problem with retributive passions concerns a difference in
   kind, not between resentment and ressentiment, but between active
   affects and passive or reactive affects. This Nietzschean
   `demoralisation' of the problem of reactive attitudes by means of a
   historico-systematic reorientation leads to the concluding claim that
   while moral sentiments and political actions are always entangled, only
   the latter constitute the ground of social justice.},

Abstract = {As part of the ``better regulation{''} agenda, the European Commission
   created a semi-independent institution, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board,
   to monitor the preparation of policy proposals. The position of this
   Board is potentially wide-ranging. A proposal that is not given the
   green light by it cannot proceed in the Commission's internal
   decisionmaking process. But so far, the Board has only received scant
   scholarly attention. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact
   of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on the Commission's policy preparation.
   Using machine learning techniques and quantitative text analysis, we
   study 673 Board opinions and compare almost 100 draft and final policy
   proposals. Our findings show that the Board is an active watchdog that
   is taken seriously by the Commission's departments. A full understanding
   of policy preparation in the EU therefore requires more scholarly
   attention to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board.},

Abstract = {After an initial phase of firefighting against the euro crisis that
   began in 2010, one that was characterized by policies that focused on
   strict austerity, from 2014 onwards the European Commission gradually
   began to ease its recommendations about fiscal consolidation. Between
   2015 and 2016, this policy turn was reflected in series of procedural
   changes in the European Semester. These gave the Commission a certain
   degree of discretion in applying the rules and interpreting the
   benchmarks of the post-crisis EU economic governance arrangements. This
   article investigates if this double shift in fiscal policy and
   governance that was initiated in 2014 has been consolidated in 2019,
   and, if so, what has driven that consolidation. By building on the
   literatures on EU politicization and policy learning, it asks whether
   the character of this intra-paradigm policy shift has been more Bayesian
   or sociological. Based on interviews and on a small-scale survey
   conducted with key civil servants working at the European Commission, we
   find evidence to support the putative explanation that, through a
   political process of policy learning, European Semester officials have
   acquired a more politicized and flexible practice of fiscal governance
   and a more social vision of the European Semester.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do international governmental organizations (IGOs)
   cease to exist? Surprisingly, leading theories of international
   organization rarely address this question. Across the theoretical
   spectrum scholars assume that international organizations have a high
   degree of ``staying power{''}. Yet reality looks different. More than
   one-third of IGOs created since 1815 have since died. This article
   addresses the puzzle of why IGOs cease to exist. Using a combination of
   cross-sectional and survival analysis, I seek to identify factors
   associated with IGO termination. My analysis is based on a novel dataset
   coding detailed information on all IGO created since 1815, including
   their function, membership, and geographic span. Against prevailing
   theoretical expectations, my analysis demonstrates i) that overall
   mortality is high among IGOs, ii) that states often prefer to create new
   IGOs as opposed reforming existing ones, and iii) that having a large
   and heterogeneous membership is associated with greater organizational
   survivability. These findings indicate a need for refinement of existing
   theories of `institutional robustness'.},

Abstract = {This article utilizes feminist literature on victimhood and rape
   mythology to suggest a new theoretical lens by which to view victims of
   sexual violence and the politics of state recognition through apology.
   The campaigns of two South Korean victim groups, the comfort women and
   camptown women, are examined to demonstrate that the process in which
   they must battle to obtain state redress through apology implies the
   existence of a discursive, gender-normative regime of victimhood. In
   this context, this article suggests that although the delivery of an
   apology for sexual violence might provide some form of gendered justice,
   this process may produce additional effects which work to discipline the
   related identities of gender and victimhood, and which have forced the
   comfort women and camptown women to compete for recognition by the South
   Korean state. The results of this struggle are ambivalent when it comes
   to victim agency and, in the cases examined in this article, the
   politics of apology has resulted in a somewhat impoverished form of
   redress for sexual violence.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the introduction of gender quotas affected
   female representation in an open-list proportional representation
   system. Based on the Polish parliamentary elections of 2005, 2007, 2011,
   and 2015, it attempts to explain the gap between the share of female
   candidates and the share of female legislators. The authors estimate
   changes in individual electoral chances using logistic regression.
   Subsequently, counterfactual reasoning is applied to display the results
   in the metrics of seat shares. The analyses of candidate-level data
   demonstrate that after the introduction of quotas, significantly more
   women ran for office, but parties and voters, on average, changed their
   preferences to the disadvantage of female candidates, even when
   incumbency and previous electoral experience were controlled. The
   article demonstrates that women benefited from the introduction of
   quotas, but not right away. The desired effect of gender quotas (an
   increase in female legislative representation) was mitigated mainly by
   the unequal distribution of ``electoral capital{''} among candidates of
   both genders. The impact of this factor was moderated by ballot ranking
   patterns. Once women acquire more electoral capital, the role of party
   elites' negative bias in ballot ranking becomes more visible.},

Abstract = {Why did ordoliberal Germany unconditionally privatize its aerospace and
   defense industries in the 1980s, whereas the neoliberal government in
   the United Kingdom established significant state control? To shed light
   on this puzzle, this article builds on the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC)
   and theorizes how different production regimes - complemented by
   distinct legal traditions - shape governments' decisions about how to
   privatize state-owned industries. I argue that Germany's coordinated
   market economy included informal networks between state and business
   actors that were based on trust. These relationships enabled the
   government to transfer ownership of the defense industries to the
   private sector without retaining any formal control. The United
   Kingdom's liberal market economy, by contrast, lacked such informal
   trust-based networks. That explains why the British government
   maintained formal control instruments and thus intervened more
   forcefully in its aerospace and defense sector. The comparative
   process-tracing analysis draws on original sources, such as formerly
   secret archival files and interviews with decision-makers. The article's
   contribution lies not only in extending the firm-centered logic of VoC
   to coordination between corporate actors and the state, but also in
   institutionalist theory-building: Trust-based coordination within
   informal networks systematically reduces vulnerabilities and can thus
   substitute for the arguably constant need of formal control.},

Title = {`We Serve the People of Europe': Reimagining the ECB's Political Master
   in the Wake of its Emergency Politics},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Euro crisis, the mission statement on the European
   Central Bank's (ECB) website was changed from `Our mission is to serve
   Europe's citizens' to `Our mission is to serve the people of Europe'.
   This article situates this discursive shift within a broader change of
   the ECB's self-presentation in public discourses and explores its
   meaning in terms of political theory and public law. The article argues
   that the shift represents a response to the perceived necessity of
   reimagining the ECB's foundation of legitimate governmental authority
   following its exercise of emergency powers during the Euro crisis. The
   discourse emphasizes an organic link between the ECB and `the people of
   Europe' as a political subject able to authorize previously unauthorized
   governmental practices such as the outright monetary transactions
   programme. It reflects, furthermore, a new governing philosophy that
   stresses flexibility and discretion rather than strict adherence to
   rules in the ECB's exercise of power.},

Abstract = {Since the Soviet Union's collapse, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia have
   faced the challenge of taking their positions in the politics of
   international law as part of their transformation processes. Strong
   dynamics of conflict have shaped these states' politico-legal actions
   and interactions, for example, the Russo-Georgian War, the annexation of
   Crimea and the armed conflict in East Ukraine. This essay explores
   whether, how and why Georgia, Ukraine and Russia `speak' international
   law in international politics differently. It discusses conceptual
   approaches to empirically analysing the processes of translating
   political preferences into legal arguments as well as how `communicators
   of international law' in the post-Soviet region use the language of
   international law differently.},

Abstract = {Ghana, an emerging democracy, lags far behind in women's representation
   in Parliament. This article, based on interviews with delegates,
   aspirants, candidates, Members of Parliament and potential female
   presidential candidates, suggests that women are dissuaded from standing
   for Parliament by the exorbitant `cost of politics', humiliating
   `politics of insult' and keen appreciation of Parliament's limitations.
   Still, women may be eager to hold appointive office. Until new
   democracies are established with electoral systems devoid of costly and
   insulting electoral politics, and with elected offices in which women
   may accomplish important goals, women will not exhibit the political
   ambition to participate in those spaces.},

Abstract = {The United Nations human rights treaty bodies are independent bodies of
   experts tasked with monitoring the implementation by states parties of
   human rights treaties. These bodies monitor the implementation of
   treaties, inter alia, by making decisions on allegations of individual
   human rights violations under the individual complaints procedures
   (these decisions are officially referred to as `Views'). The number of
   complaints to the treaty bodies has increased exponentially since the
   first complaint was examined by the Human Rights Committee in 1977 and
   is expected to continue to rise. At the same time, a backlog in cases
   has increased, as resources have never matched the rise in cases to be
   considered. In addition, decisions in which the treaty bodies find
   violations of human rights are not always implemented-that is, states do
   not necessarily grant the victim of the violation the remedy prescribed
   by the treaty body examining the case. This current situation is taking
   place against a global backdrop of increased criticism of human rights:
   a global pushback against human rights, including from states which have
   been heretofore human rights supportive. Surely, the response from
   supporters of human rights should be to reinforce the importance and
   universality of the treaties as the foundation of human rights norms.
   This article seeks to demonstrate one way to do so by focusing on
   implementation of treaty body decisions in individual cases.},

Abstract = {Many right-wing parties have attempted to increase their share of female
   representatives to appeal to women in the electorate. Underlying this is
   the assumption that women will offer a distinct perspective to the
   party. Using a comparative dataset of male and female candidates of
   Conservative and Christian Democratic parties across 21 European and
   Anglo-Saxon countries, we show this is the case. Female candidates in
   right-wing parties are less right wing than male candidates, both in
   terms of their overall ideology and their issue positioning. Perhaps as
   a consequence, female candidates perceive a greater distance to their
   own party than male candidates.},

Abstract = {Pjodmyndir was a collaborative photography project carried out by
   individuals frequenting two social service organisations that work in
   close partnership in Isafjorour, Iceland, under the guidance of the
   author. It offered participants an opportunity to express themselves
   creatively in the public sphere and aimed to engage them in
   participative processes of learning, creating and reflecting to this
   end. The project struggled with the participatory and collaborative
   research traditions that informed it, yet it defined its own, unique
   collaborative culture around the social learning that emerged from the
   participants' entering into relation with and emotionally affecting one
   another. Consequently, it succeeded at creating a space for the
   processes of subject formation inherent to discussions of both
   collaborative research and social-relational affect. This paper examines
   instances of affect and collaboration particular to the project through
   the lens of disability studies in order to advance an understanding of
   the intersectional relevance of affect theory and collaborative
   methodologies to social care practice.},

Abstract = {In the age of globalization, a large number of transnational legal
   disputes come before domestic courts. To resolve these disputes,
   national legal systems have to cooperate with each other, yet their
   willingness to do so varies significantly. This article introduces the
   concept of transnational-litigation frameworks, which describes the
   extent to which national rules facilitate or constrain cooperation on
   litigation. Focusing on the socially embedded nature of law, we build an
   argument to explain variation in countries' openness to legal
   cooperation. This argument suggests that ethnocentric societies are less
   willing to circumscribe their legal sovereignty and cooperate on
   transnational litigation. A cross-national analysis of legislative
   policy on extradition and foreign-judgment enforcement finds strong
   support for this argument; so does a sub-national analysis of
   foreign-judgments policy across the American states. This study
   highlights the importance of domestic law in global affairs as well as
   the role of socio-cultural factors in explaining the contours of
   globalization. It also suggests an important new research agenda
   concerning the interaction of domestic legal systems in an age of
   complex interdependence.},

Abstract = {The idea that it is possible to use memory and ``lessons from the
   past{''} to arm today's citizens against future violence is a welcome
   band-aid for our insecurities; it protects the individual who subscribes
   to it from doubts they may have about their own moral convictions. This
   belief in the effects of memory has been institutionalized in the form
   of public policies and through the increasing number of specialized
   institutions, both of which have been transformed by dedicated
   professionals convinced of how useful they are. For some observers, this
   may provide the only moral norm compatible with a globalized world.
   Describing this belief and the concrete way in which it is implemented
   constitutes the first chapter of this book. In doing so, this first
   chapter pays particular attention to the implementation of these memory
   policies in schools, memorial-museums, truth commissions and justice
   courts.},

Series = {Rethinking Political Violence},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {65-85},
Abstract = {The last chapter concluded with the question: how is violence understood
   `without' politics? Any response to such a question faces the inadequacy
   of the interdisciplinary dialogue between political scientists and
   theorists on the one hand, and the many other disciplines which engage
   with the problematic of violence on the other. The classical theorists
   based their understandings of politics, the political and the State on
   ontologies of human violence. However, they emphasized quite different
   factors in these ontologies, for instance, whether `man's' violence is
   due to `his' `evil' or `his' `passions' and/or where and whether
   `emotions' fit in. They wrote at times of great upheaval and also of
   limited understanding of violence as a phenomenon to be understood
   through multiple lenses. The critical alternatives of more recent
   decades tried to distinguish violence from politics or to build a
   conflict `friendly `but violence `unfriendly' politics. The
   understandings of violence in these alternatives are, however, also
   narrow and ultimately unpersuasive, even though they greatly advanced
   the discussion on what might make a violence, but not conflict, free
   politics imaginable. A violence free politics remains a utopian
   proposition for most people, and the possibility that conflicts could be
   prevented from descending into violence requires a much deeper
   understanding of how and when the one slips into the other. Another
   approach is to tackle the issue from the perspective of violence itself
   rather than from that of politics. In other words, to treat violence as
   a phenomenon with its own distinctions, `without politics'. Thus, this
   chapter explores how we might make sense of violence in and of itself.},

Abstract = {China is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world.
   The people of all nationalities in China have jointly created a splendid
   culture and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Feudal China was
   gradually reduced after 1840 to a semicolonial and semifeudal country.
   The Chinese people waged wave upon wave of heroic struggles for national
   independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom. Great and
   earth-shaking historical changes have taken place in China in the
   twentieth century. The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
   abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China.
   But the Chinese people had yet to fulfil their historical task of
   overthrowing imperialism and feudalism. After waging hard, protracted,
   and tortuous struggles, armed and otherwise, the Chinese people of all
   nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao
   Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949, overthrew the rule of
   imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism, won the great victory
   of the new- democratic revolution, and founded the People's Republic of
   China. Thereupon the Chinese people took state power into their own
   hands and became masters of the country.},

Abstract = {Using a national survey of Generation Z conducted in late May 2020, we
   measure attitudes about the impact of the coronavirus on personal
   health, financial and job concerns, views about shelter-in-place laws,
   and 2020 voting intentions. Gen Z women express greater health and
   economic concerns and support for shelter-in-place measures than their
   male counterparts, but this gender gap is largely mitigated by party and
   other covariates. Party also mediates the differences between young male
   and female voters concerning the influence of the coronavirus on their
   vote choice in 2020. Notably, women have significantly greater concern
   about the impact of COVID-19 on their personal financial situation,
   while Gen Z men express more concern about their personal health amid
   COVID-19 in more fully specified statistical models. This research
   contributes to the growing literature that examines not only the sorting
   effect of party on the gender gap but also how different identities-in
   this case, generation-can help explain the persistent political divides
   between men and women.},

Abstract = {Both the European and the Inter-American human rights systems are in the
   process of adapting themselves to the emerging and pressing needs in
   their respective regions. The high-level conferences on the future of
   the European Court of Human Rights and the newly-established Forum of
   the Inter-American Human Rights System are two analogous institutional
   reform processes. This policy note compares these initiatives. We argue
   that these parallel processes may have been provoked by similar
   concerns, yet they have generated different outcomes. The Inter-American
   system has taken advantage of the Forum to increase its functions and
   outreach. The high-level conferences, on the other hand, have provided
   an opportunity for member states to call on the European Court to
   circumscribe the extent of its functions. Finally, we believe that
   although these initiatives both envisage strategies tailored for their
   respective systems, mutual learning between the systems could yield more
   effective solutions.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {This article links Russians' individual experiences during the
   late-Gorbachev and early-Yeltsin years to beliefs they espoused in the
   Putin era, over a decade later. Drawing on the 2006 wave of the Life in
   Transition Survey, I show that a range of attitudes - including
   diminished support for markets and democracy and stronger support for
   reducing inequality - can be explained by whether an individual suffered
   labor market hardships in the half decade from 1989 to 1994. Subsequent
   labor market disruptions, surprisingly, bear no such relationship to
   beliefs in 2006. Relative to the rest of the former Soviet Union, this
   pattern is unique. Though an explanation is difficult to pin down, one
   speculative hypothesis is that for Russians, individual economic
   hardship, in conjunction with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, may
   have been particularly disorienting. Life experiences during those years
   of instability, uncertainty, and diminished status may have left a
   uniquely enduring impression.},

Abstract = {A strong leader - i.e. an individual who concentrates great power in his
   hands and uses it to solve the country's problems - is often considered
   a good thing in contemporary politics. Vladimir Putin has always
   presented himself as precisely this kind of leader. This article
   considers whether Putin actually is a strong leader who has used his
   powers to do great things for Russia. The analysis begins by considering
   whether Putin is a strong leader in terms of the powers that he holds.
   It then assesses whether Putin has used these powers to solve Russia's
   problems in terms of economic development, order, and national standing.
   Russia here is compared to the other states of the Former Soviet Union,
   as they all share a common Soviet heritage and have been subject to
   comparable structural forces. The study utilizes the data (arguably
   underused in the field) provided by institutions such as the World Bank
   to examine a large number of socio-economic factors. If Putin really is
   a strong leader who has transformed Russia, we would expect performance
   in Russia to be better than in these other countries. The article finds
   that Russia's record is average at best and that Putin is an
   unexceptional leader.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long debated the relationship between foreign aid and
   international migration, with some arguing that foreign aid can deter
   emigrants and others contending that aid enables them. We contribute to
   this discussion by exploring whether negative aid shocks affect
   migration patterns. We theorize that these shocks, which occur when
   there are large and abrupt decreases in aid disbursement to a given
   country, lead individuals in aid-recipient countries to emigrate. Such
   shocks lead to reductions in the provision of public and community
   services that are funded by aid. These reductions in turn force
   individuals who depend on these services to seek better lives abroad. We
   expect this effect to be especially evident among low-skilled
   individuals, who are most reliant on the services that are supported by
   foreign aid. We use country-level panel data to test hypotheses derived
   from these arguments and we find, first, that negative aid shocks are
   accompanied by heightened emigration rates and, second, that this effect
   is driven by the emigration of relatively unskilled individuals.},

Abstract = {Using data from nationally representative surveys in 2015 in Georgia,
   Russia and Ukraine, we show that legal attitudes are shaped by
   experiences within a country's specific political-legal order. Many who
   expressed support for legality when their own needs were at stake became
   more willing to evade the law when reminded of elites doing so. And, in
   an authoritarian, rule-by-law setting, expressed respect for legality
   correlates negatively with support for democracy. Whether a country's
   most democracy-supporting citizens more strongly support legality will
   depend on whether the legal system is a fair and neutral arena or a tool
   of undemocratic political authorities.},

Title = {Divisions of regulatory labor, institutional closure, and structural
   secrecy in new regulatory states: The case of neglected liquidity risks
   in market-based banking},

Abstract = {Monetary policy and financial regulation have been regarded one of the
   paradigmatic domains where states can reap the benefits of delegating
   clearly delineated and unequivocal policy tasks to specialized
   technocrats. This article discusses the negative side-effects and
   unintended consequences of particular ways to partition such tasks. The
   separation between monetary policy formulation, central banks' money
   market management, and financial supervision has weakened policy makers'
   capacities to address risks associated with banks' active liability
   management and to mitigate pro-cyclical dynamics in money markets. These
   adverse effects derive from the neglect of liquidity as a regulatory
   problem in formal task descriptions; from the obstacles to positive
   coordination between specialized technocrats in the self-contained
   domains of monetary policy formulation, implementation, and prudential
   regulation; and from a dissociation between formal responsibilities,
   which lie with regulators, and the resources residing in money market
   divisions - market expertise and influence over counterparties - that
   are critical to influence bank behavior. I explore these mechanisms with
   an in-depth case study of British monetary and financial governance
   between 1970 and 2007. I posit that we can generalize the respective
   mechanisms to explore unintended effects of `agencification' and to
   contribute to a broader re-assessment of those organizing principles
   that have guided the construction of `new regulatory states'.},

Abstract = {Regulatory initiatives are frequently shaped by the ability of the
   financial industry to build alliances across the wider business
   community. Yet comparative and international political economy
   scholarship remains divided over how to explain the resulting networks
   of financial lobbying. Using quantitative text analysis of 1300
   responses to EU financial regulatory consultations between 2010 and
   2018, we map patterns of lobbying coordination based on cosigning and
   text re-use in consultation responses for the first time. This unique
   dataset is used to analyze hitherto hidden patterns of domestic and
   cross-border coordination by financial organizations within and between
   European countries. We find that while distinctive national lobbying
   networks persist at the country level, the internationalization of
   financial actors is statistically associated with the formation of
   coordination ties with foreign financial actors. This suggests that
   European financial integration has facilitated the emergence of new
   cross-border alliances which complement - rather than substitute for -
   existing domestic financial interest coalitions. We argue that the
   text-as-data approach employed here makes an important new contribution
   to scholarship on business power and the political economy of Europe.},

Abstract = {We study the political economy of allocation decisions within a major
   state investment bank. Our focus is the European Investment Bank (EIB) -
   ``The Bank of the EU{''} - which is the largest multilateral lending
   (and borrowing) institution in the world. We study the behavior of about
   500 national representatives at the EIB's Board of Directors - the
   bank's decisive body for loan approvals - and show that a
   representative's appointment increases the probability that the
   sub-national region where she works receives a loan by about 17
   percentage points. This ``home-bias{''} effect is driven by large loans
   financing infrastructure projects. We discuss several pieces of
   evidence, which are consistent with the hypothesis that this home-bias
   lending may be due to favoritism, however, we cannot conclusively
   demonstrate this case of resource misallocation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the key aspects of the BRICS countries' joint
   position on the -'responsibility to protect' (R2P) concept, as well as
   the degree of their influence on transforming R2P into a global norm.
   The author's aim was to answer the following questions: What
   interconnection is there between the brics and R2P discourses? How can
   brics stimulate an alternative interpretation of the R2P idea? In terms
   of cross-border partnerships, is R2P-based cooperation possible within
   the brics framework, and are states ready to expand it in the future?
   brics member states have demonstrated several common approaches to R2P,
   including their reliance on mechanisms strengthening the role of the
   state, their support for the UN position on peaceful conflict
   settlement, and preventive diplomacy.},

Abstract = {In the period 1950-1970, the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) managed
   the economy and all enterprises. However, the party central authorities
   were unable to manage every single plant directly. One of the most
   important elements of the governing system was the local communist party
   apparatus, which supervised factories in the regions. This article
   examines the strategies of local apparatchiks in their relations with
   the factory managers. Using archival documents of PUWP from the Warsaw
   area, this article identifies the prevailing behaviours of party actors
   and changes in their strategies over time.},

Abstract = {International Political Economy (IPE) textbooks tend to present the
   concept of a clear state-market dichotomy as the disciplinary
   mainstream. Yet we argue that a critical consensus has emerged around
   the mutual constitution of states and markets. Underpinning this is the
   Polanyian thesis that economic activities are always politically
   embedded. However, we claim that this notion of state-market mutual
   constitution is inadequate to grasp the peculiarities of the capitalist
   political economy. While capitalist market relations are underpinned by
   states, they take on an autonomous, dominating logic that limits states'
   agency. Concretely, by reproducing international monetary relations,
   states accidentally contribute to the establishment of world labour
   productivity averages that force them to boost national competitiveness
   in order to keep pace with world market standards. In place of the
   notion of mutual constitution, then, we offer Marx's concept of
   alienation as a theory of a form of social relations that have escaped
   the control of the institutions that produce them. The challenge of
   state governance - reflected in the canon of liberal thought - is to
   reconcile the impersonal imperatives of world market relations with the
   creation of a legitimate national political project, which we term the
   politics of governing alienation.},

Abstract = {The downward trend in capital taxes since the 1980s has recently
   reversed for personal capital income. At the same time, it continued for
   corporate profits. Why have these tax rates diverged after a long period
   of parallel decline? We argue that the answer lies in different levels
   of change in the fights against tax evasion and tax avoidance. The fight
   against evasion by households progressed significantly since 2009,
   culminating in the multilateral adoption of automatic exchange of
   information (AEI). In contrast, international efforts against base
   erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) failed to curb tax avoidance by
   corporations. We theorize that international cooperation is an
   intervening variable, countering the negative impact of tax competition
   on capital taxation by reducing the risk of capital flight. Under such
   conditions, domestic political pressures in favor of higher capital
   taxes can unfold. We confirm our argument in a difference-in-difference
   analysis and through additional tests with data for up to 35 OECD
   countries from 2000-2017. Our central estimate suggests that the average
   tax rate on dividends in 2017 is 4.5 percentage points higher than it
   would have been absent international tax cooperation.},

Abstract = {Recent public opinion research has established an empirical regularity
   of unusual stability and strength: citizen beliefs in the legitimacy of
   national and international institutions are highly linked. The dominant
   interpretation of this link holds that citizens draw on their
   perceptions of national institutions as a heuristic when forming
   opinions about international institutions. This article proposes an
   alternative mechanism, privileging social trust as an antecedent factor
   contributing to both national and international legitimacy beliefs.
   Using original survey data on citizen attitudes toward four
   international institutions in three countries, the article provides
   evidence for social trust as an antecedent factor, while granting no
   support for the dominant interpretation. The article suggests three
   broader implications: social trust has more far-reaching consequences
   for international cooperation than previously understood; political
   efforts to affect the legitimacy of international institutions are
   constrained by individual predispositions; and a comparative approach is
   central to the study of public attitudes toward international
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Morality policies evince a much closer relationship to religious
   doctrines than is the case in other policy areas and hence constitute a
   most likely case for the observation of religious effects on
   policymaking and regulatory change. Yet we still lack generally accepted
   answers to the questions of whether and how religion matters to morality
   policy. In this paper, we present a theoretical argument that helps to
   overcome the seemingly contradictory expectations derived from the
   secularization and religion matters hypotheses. We postulate a
   bottleneck effect of religious opposition: while religious influence
   matters most during early stages of the policy process when the problem
   definition of a moral issue is still in flux, it diminishes during later
   stages when the issue has made it onto the political agenda. We find
   evidence of the bottleneck effect in a dataset of policy permissiveness
   covering 26 countries and spanning 50 years for five morality policies
   (abortion, euthanasia, homosexuality, pornography, and same-sex
   marriage). The data is analyzed via a multilevel model and using
   Bayesian inference.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of China's 1999 acceleration of higher
   education expansion on when college graduates find their first skilled
   job. We use a natural experiment to test our hypotheses and exploit the
   unique education and work history data of a nationally representative
   survey, as well as estimate a causal inference model. We find that the
   1999 education expansion caused a delay in the landing of a skilled job
   among graduates from technical colleges, while graduates from four-year
   colleges were not affected in job acquisition. We also find that family
   origins and individual social positions are significant determinants of
   who entered college both before and after the education expansion. These
   findings shed new light on the workings of early adulthood and on social
   inequality in China.},

Abstract = {A recent wave of research - including the five books we review - argues
   for paying more attention to business and the private sector when
   explaining development outcomes. We draw on these books to make four
   main arguments. First, micro-attention to variations in business
   organization and behavior forces a framework shift away from a statist
   literature that attributed explanatory power to bureaucracies and state
   capacity and away from market-oriented institutionalists who focus on
   rules - domestic and international - rather than organizations like
   firms. Second, we identify aspects of firm organization and ownership as
   key variables in assessing business impact on development. Third, we
   highlight the development-enhancing networks that grow out of, and
   transcend, firms. Fourth, we suggest that business characteristics
   should be both inputs into policy-making and targets of policy. The
   paper closes with a reminder that beyond its direct contributions to
   development, business is also a powerful actor in shaping politics and
   policy in its favor.},

Abstract = {Effective systems of vocational education are crucial to economic and
   social development. However, the coordination of labour market demand
   and the supply of skill requires either well-functioning labour market
   institutions or institutionally embedded strategic partnerships among
   government, labour and employers. In particular, the transplantation of
   German-style dual education methods to a different environment poses
   significant institutional dilemmas. Russia presents a useful case for
   examining the conditions under which such arrangements can be
   established. Based on a series of interviews in six Russian regions and
   a set of case histories, we seek to draw testable hypotheses that can be
   applied to other settings.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of supranational human rights bodies in
   the implementation of their orders and recommendations in individual
   cases. It elicits the means, roles and impact of supranational
   mechanisms in triggering implementation processes by looking at the
   practice of UN treaty bodies and the three regional systems, through the
   in-depth study of specific cases and semi-structured interviews with
   relevant stakeholders. The article argues that supranational bodies are
   doing more than monitoring implementation of orders and recommendations
   in individual cases despite the scarcity of resources. They use
   different tools, both persuasive and coercive. Dialogue is central to
   their work, a dialogue that at times is opened to other actors such as
   civil society organizations, national human rights institutions and
   others. However, supranational bodies could do more to enhance the role
   they have promoting implementation by states of their orders and
   recommendations.},

Booktitle = {BEYOND MEMORY: CAN WE REALLY LEARN FROM THE PAST?},
Series = {Palgrave Macmillan Memory Studies},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {113-121},
Abstract = {In the last few years, memory has been considered one of the ways in
   which we can help build better societies. Memory studies often focus on
   the objectives of memory policies. Should we prevent victims from taking
   advantage of their status, or should we limit ourselves to condemning
   perpetrators? Should we prioritize history over memory? Should we accept
   ``forgetting{''} rather than the overabundance of references to the
   past? Should we defend the ``historical truth{''} or the memory of ``the
   weak{''} against ``the strong{''} and thus remember the ``forgotten to
   history{''}, such as the legitimate victims of colonial conflicts?
   Although these political and moral questions are interesting, they do
   not provide an answer to what we would actually do if one option were
   chosen over the other. In this book, we have therefore sought to move
   away from the terms of the existing debates in order to understand what
   is at work in these contemporary references to the violent past. As a
   result, there is no ``lesson{''} to be learned here. But this does not
   rule out a reconceptualization of objectives or a reflection on the way
   in which memory policies could be more effective, in light of the goals
   that are generally assigned to them. This conclusion is the place to do
   so. In other words, if memory is not enough, can memory policies be more
   effective?},

Abstract = {Subversive pedagogy is an embodied experience of disruption that
   shatters the oppressed colonial subject, undermines the discourse of
   universality, fosters a bottom-up perspective and gives birth to new
   militant political identities. After I present these aspects of Fanon's
   thinking, I draw some parallels between Fanon's subversive pedagogy and
   National Football League (NFL) athlete-protestors. Subversive pedagogy
   emerges as a visceral experience of disruption that exposes the
   authority, hierarchy and knowledge nexus and the doctrine of color
   blindness as neocolonial practices.},

Pages = {473-485},
Abstract = {As part of the roundtable ``International Institutions and Peaceful
   Change,{''} this essay examines the role of institutional soft balancing
   in bringing forth peaceful change in international relations. Soft
   balancing is understood as attempts at restraining a threatening power
   through institutional delegitimization, as opposed to hard balancing,
   which relies on arms buildup and formal alignments. We argue that soft
   balancing through international institutions can be an effective means
   to peaceful change, spanning minimalist goals, which aim at incremental
   change without the use of military force and war, and maximalist goals,
   which seek more profound change and transformation in the form of
   continuous interstate cooperation aimed at a more peaceful and just
   world order. However, the success of soft-balancing strategies in
   fostering peaceful change varies widely, even in today's globalized and
   institutionalized international environment. We explore these variations
   and identify three conditions for success that can inform both academic
   analysis and political practice: inclusion, commitment, and status
   recognition. We draw lessons from two historical examples: the Concert
   of Europe in the early nineteenth century and the League of Nations in
   the early twentieth century, and discuss how current threats to the
   liberal international order challenge soft balancing for peaceful
   change.},

Abstract = {In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon empowered the EU to pursue an
   international investment policy and to conclude international investment
   agreements. The EU's first steps in this policy domain have attracted
   considerable public attention. Analysts depict competing societal
   interests as the main forces shaping EU policy in this domain. This
   article scrutinizes this widespread perception. It argues that
   competence struggles between the European Institutions and Member
   States, which still echo broad Member State opposition against the
   initial decision to empower the EU in this domain during the drafting of
   the Lisbon Treaty, play a similarly important role in shaping EU
   international investment policy. This article enhances our understanding
   of EU policy-making in a highly salient policy domain and theoretically
   contributes to research on European Integration in that it shows that it
   matters for policy-making `how' the EU received an underlying
   competence.},

Abstract = {In this article we examine the limited effectiveness of major advanced
   central banks' expansionary measures - particularly quantitative easing
   (QE) - in raising inflation from a post-Keynesian growth model
   perspective that distinguishes the sectoral-allocative effects of these
   policies from their class-distributive effects. In terms of
   sectoral-allocative effects, we empirically link the weak recovery of
   aggregate demand to the lack of rebalancing of the debt-led growth and
   export-led growth models and highlight the role of QE in reproducing
   these growth models. In terms of class-distributive effects, we draw
   attention to the flattening of the Phillips curve in advanced capitalist
   economies and explain this flattening from a post-Keynesian conflict
   model of inflation, pointing to the weakening of labour's bargaining
   power as well as to the role of central banks' overly premature
   withdrawal of monetary stimulus in contributing to that weakening.
   Finally, our analysis points to the entrenchment of a self-defeating
   macroeconomic policy mix (consisting of combination of loose monetary
   policy and restrictive fiscal policy) in debt-led and export-led growth
   models, which will continue to thwart efforts of central banks to
   significantly raise inflation.},

   tradecraft underlying the 2008 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on
   Iran's Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities. AIS's director and senior
   officials from several IC elements briefed the President's Intelligence
   Advisory Board (PIAB) on the findings in order to demonstrate that the
   NIE manifested the Intelligence Community's (IC's) improved tradecraft
   capabilities. The PIAB's response, however, was to criticize NIE's
   substance and hence minimize the salience of its superior tradecraft.
   The result was a missed opportunity to bolster the IC's reputation.},

Abstract = {This article highlights a counterintuitive dynamic of neoliberal
   globalization. India has controversially liberalized foreign investment
   rules in the politically sensitive food retail sector. Critics argue
   that India bowed to pressure from multinational corporations, consistent
   with a common view that under neoliberalism markets eclipse state power.
   We suggest by contrast that policymakers seek multinational firms to
   strengthen their capacity to govern food markets that for centuries have
   been dominated by networks of local traders. These traders use informal
   conventions of market governance that have long proven resistant to
   centralized state control. Global retailers promise to transform these
   opaque, ``traditional{''} systems into transparent, ``modern,{''} supply
   chains that comply with liberal rule of law principles. Thus we argue
   the turn to multinational capital should neither be understood simply
   through the logics of state capture or welfare economics, but rather
   also as a political governance project that illustrates how different
   kinds of markets produce different conceptions of the state.},

Abstract = {With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, many state
   and local governments were forced to implement necessary policies to
   contain transmission of the deadly virus. These policies ranged from
   closing most businesses to more controversial proposals, such as
   postponing primary elections. In this research note, we examine the role
   that scientific knowledge and gender played in citizen perceptions of
   these virus containment policies, both in the general population and
   among partisans. We find that while a gender gap persists in scientific
   knowledge, both in the general population and within the parties, women
   are generally more likely to use this knowledge to inform their policy
   views on necessary government action during the COVID-19 pandemic. These
   findings shed light on how knowledge and gender intersect to drive
   support for government intervention during the time of a severe public
   health crisis in a partisan America.},

Abstract = {Growing research shows a correlation between gender, benevolent sexism,
   partisanship, and COVID-19 public health compliance. We show first that
   women are more likely than men to engage in protective behaviors to slow
   the spread of COVID-19. We also find that while Republicans and
   Independents are less likely to comply with these measures, benevolent
   sexism moderates the effect of partisanship and can increase compliance.
   These results suggest that framing public health directives in terms of
   chivalry and protection activates benevolent sexism, potentially
   offsetting patterns of noncompliance associated with partisanship. We
   discuss the negative consequences of these results and posit a need for
   bipartisan messages to reduce reliance on benevolent sexism in the
   future.},

Abstract = {This article examines the transnational ties between the Italian
   revolutionary left and Palestinian militants from the mid-1960s through
   the early 1980s. Some observers have cited these connections to explain
   the magnitude of Italian terrorism in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   However, in the absence of empirical research, the issue has remained
   murky. The archival sources and detailed interviews with protagonists
   used in the article shed light on this phenomenon by addressing four
   questions: first, the reception of the Palestinian cause within the
   Italian revolutionary left; second, the way Palestinian terrorist groups
   established roots in Italy and how the political context facilitated
   those efforts; third, the interactions between Italian and Palestinian
   militants both in Italy and in the Middle East; and fourth, the factors
   that strengthened or weakened the relationships between these entities.
   The evidence indicates that although Italian revolutionaries forged
   concrete ties with Palestinian militants and terrorists, these ties were
   not as extensively developed as some of the Italian leftists had hoped.
   The interactions encouraged radicalization but did not significantly
   foster violent escalation and terrorism in Italy.},

Abstract = {During the novel coronavirus pandemic, early data suggested that men
   were slightly more likely to contract COVID-19 than women, less likely
   to seek medical attention for the disease, and far more likely to die as
   a result of COVID-19. While several studies have explored this gender
   gap, none has attempted to isolate the psychological processes
   underpinning this phenomenon. In this research note, I suggest that
   sexism partly explains these differences. Using data from a large (N =
   100,689) survey of American adults conducted between March and June 2020
   by the Democracy Fund and the University of California, Los Angeles
   (Nationscape), I find that sexist beliefs, a component of masculine
   norms, are consistently the strongest predictor of coronavirus-related
   emotions, behaviors, policy attitudes, and ultimately contracting
   COVID-19. This study highlights how gender ideology can impact health
   and impede government public health efforts.},

Abstract = {Corporations increasingly engage in innovative `tax planning strategies'
   by shifting profits between jurisdictions. In response, states try to
   curtail such profit shifting activities while at the same time
   attempting to retain and attract multinational corporations. We aim to
   open up this dichotomy between states and corporations and argue that a
   wealth defence industry of professional service firms plays a crucial
   role as facilitators. We investigate the subsidiary structure of 27,000
   MNCs and show that clients of the Big Four accountancy firms show
   systematically higher levels of aggressive tax planning strategies than
   clients of smaller accountancy firms. We specify this effect for three
   distinct strategies and also uncover marked differences across
   countries. As such we provide empirical evidence for the systematic
   involvement of auditors as facilitators in corporate wealth defence.},

Abstract = {Aumann's agreement theorem and subsequent work shows that people who are
   rational in a certain Bayesian sense cannot agree to disagree on matters
   of fact. This result hinges on a type of epistemic impartiality: a
   rational person will not give extra weight to a piece of evidence simply
   because they themselves discovered it rather than someone else. We
   extend this argument by questioning the possibility of reasonable
   political disagreement for political liberals. On our reading, a ``Good
   Liberal{''} must not give extra weight in public deliberations to their
   own preferences or values simply because they are their own. This
   political impartiality mirrors the epistemic impartiality of Aumann's
   theorem and we argue that disagreement on policy is impossible in a
   world of ``Good Liberal Bayesians,{''} assuming common knowledge of both
   Bayesian rationality and Liberal reasonableness. The persistence and
   predictability of disagreement in the real world provides support for
   expressive accounts of political behaviour and points to the important
   role of epistemic trust in politics. This issue of epistemic trust
   provides insight into recent trends in political polarization in the
   United States and elsewhere.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {937-950},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {The question of how the urgent transformation in fossil fuel based
   economies might be realised has come to occupy an increasingly prominent
   place within the social sciences. The challenge here is often cast in
   terms of how one or more existing system can be replaced by alternatives
   in which the carbon content has been removed or at least diluted by
   purposeful interventions. Here we approach the question from a different
   angle, asking how ongoing transformations in critical systems (in this
   case energy) are or may be leveraged in relation to climate change. We
   take as our focus the emergence of the smart city and examine a case in
   which the notion of the smart city has become wedded to the ambition for
   a low carbon city: Malmo, Sweden. As commentators suggest, the growth of
   the smart city reflects a capitalist reflex to develop new waves of
   investment to realise new arenas for capital accumulation in the city.
   Yet shifting from this broad political economy diagnosis, we argue that
   there is a need to attend to the ways in which climate is imbued and
   embedded in the smart city and how this in turn enables and constrains
   low carbon transitions.},

Abstract = {What problems can private regulatory governance solve, and what role
   should public policy play? Despite access to the same empirical
   evidence, the current scholarship on private governance offers widely
   divergent answers to these questions. Through a critical review, this
   paper details five ontologically distinct academic logics - calculated
   strategic behavior; learning and experimentalist processes; political
   institutionalism; global value chain and convention theory; and
   neo-Gramscian accounts - that offer divergent conclusions based on the
   particular facets of private governance they illuminate, while ignoring
   those they obfuscate. In this crowded marketplace of ideas, scholars and
   practitioners are in danger of adverse ontological selection whereby
   certain approaches and insights are systematically ignored and certain
   problem conceptions are prioritized over others. As a corrective, we
   encourage scholars to make their assumptions explicit, and occasionally
   switch between logics, to better understand private governance's
   problem-solving potential and its interactions with public policy.},

Abstract = {The challenge of `emerging' countries in the 21st century has been
   conducted in a much more peaceful manner than in past eras when power
   transitions were most commonly accompanied by war. The hallmark of this
   peaceful transition has been the elevation of the G20, a forum in which
   established and emerging powers jointly deal with global economic issues
   and which - despite or precisely because of its informal character - has
   become the prime forum for global economic governance. Significantly,
   however, this new openness and flexibility of the international system
   and its increasing informalism have not only provided an avenue for
   emerging powers to be integrated into the inner circle of global
   economic governance, but have also allowed them to set up alternative
   institutions. By forming their own exclusive BRICS group in parallel to
   their membership in the G20, emerging powers have pursued a dualistic
   strategy that allows them to be simultaneously institutional `insiders'
   and `outsiders'. The article focuses on this seemingly ambiguous
   international behaviour and explains why the BRICS have opted for this
   dualistic approach. Far from being socialised into the established
   system, the oppositional psychology of the past has not disappeared
   completely.},

Title = {The Shape of `Rising Powers' to Come? The Antinomies of Growth and
   Neoliberal Development in Turkey},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {791-812},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {The short-term GDP growth-based economic success of the BRICS has
   spawned a trend of grouping large emerging market economies under shared
   monikers. The proliferation of a wide array of labels - from MINTs to
   VISTAs - within political and financial circles has been accompanied by
   a growing scholarly interest in the study of these `emerging markets'
   and future `rising powers'. This paper discusses the literature on
   Turkey's `rising power' status to problematise the conceptual and
   analytical parameters that shape these wider debates. Accordingly, I
   argue that the established parameters are wholly based in, and in turn
   reproduce, a neoliberal conception of development which prioritises a
   narrowly construed metric of economic progress based on GDP growth,
   while simultaneously ignoring the associated socio-economic and
   environmental costs. The paper interrogates the ways in which select
   macroeconomic indicators have been deployed to legitimise neoliberal
   reform in Turkey and utilises this case study to mount a methodological
   challenge to the relevant IR/IPE literatures that conceptualise
   `emerging markets' and `rising powers' from growth-oriented
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {Although transitional justice has been mobilized to address violence
   perpetrated under regimes of settler colonialism that are also
   established liberal democracies, this article theorizes the inability of
   paradigmatic transitional justice to confront settler colonialism. The
   liberal teleology of transitional justice risks working to realize the
   self-supersessionist goal of replacing the colony with a
   `post-colonial', settler/settled polity. Drawing on Indigenous scholars,
   decolonization is explored through refusal, resurgence and
   prefiguration. The article advances a counterfactual proposition: If
   transitional justice is radicalized it has the potential to contribute
   to decolonization through decentring the state, inter-nationalizing the
   justice relation, challenging the legitimacy of the settler regime and
   abandoning liberal teleology. The article argues for a decolonizing
   acceptance of indeterminacy and uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Agencies consult extensively with stakeholders such as industry
   associations, nongovernmental organizations, and trade unions. One
   rationale for consultations is that these improve procedural legitimacy
   and lead to greater acceptance of regulatory outcomes by citizens and
   the regulated industry. While this presumption of a positive relation
   between stakeholder consultations and the legitimacy of agencies is
   widespread, research analyzing this relationship remains scarce. Using a
   survey experiment, we examine the effect of open and closed
   consultations on the acceptance of procedures and regulatory outcomes in
   the field of environmental politics. The results demonstrate that
   consultation arrangements positively affect the acceptance of
   decision-making procedures, especially when regulators grant access to
   different types of stakeholders. However, although the consultation
   arrangement itself does not directly affect acceptance of the regulatory
   outcome, procedural legitimacy matters, as it increases decision
   acceptance among individuals who are negatively disposed toward
   government regulation.},

Abstract = {Canada established independent signals intelligence in 1946, after years
   of British and American guidance. The dominant driver was inclusion in
   postwar intelligence sharing. Wartime intelligence negotiations depict
   Canadians framing themselves relative to their allies, seeking to shake
   off a `younger brother' mindset and to migrate from British-led models
   towards autonomous intelligence sharing with the Americans. This paper
   traces the origins of autonomous Canadian signals intelligence in the
   context of postwar intelligence sharing with the United States and
   United Kingdom, demonstrating Canada's prioritization of capabilities
   that would ensure inclusion in the intelligence-sharing partnership
   known today as Five Eyes.},

Abstract = {Current scholarship is inconclusive whether stakeholder involvement in
   regulatory politics can be legitimizing. This article argues that
   stakeholder involvement can only be legitimizing if bias in mobilization
   is limited. As bias is limited if a heterogeneous set of stakeholders
   participates mobilizes, stakeholder mobilization in public consultations
   on EU financial regulation is examined. Due to the financial crisis and
   subsequent institutional reforms, stakeholders' perception on who is
   affected by regulation and the reach of the agencies' operations has
   changed. Subsequently, mobilization is expected to be more heterogenous.
   The analysis is based on a novel dataset of stakeholder responses to
   public consultations of the European Supervisory Authorities before and
   after the financial crisis and reforms. The results show shifts in
   interest mobilization, but these do not follow the research
   expectations. Therefore, the findings show that public consultations do
   not necessarily decrease bias. As such, consultations show important
   limits for legitimizing EU regulatory policies.},

Abstract = {Frustration is widely recognised to be central to many cases of moral
   anger in a political context, yet little philosophical attention has
   been paid to it. In this paper, I offer a much-needed philosophical
   analysis of frustration, working primarily with the example of the
   recent South African student protests. By developing a deeper
   philosophical understanding of frustration and its connections to moral
   anger, I argue that the movement between the two has a couple of
   important aspects. First, the movement involves a transformation from
   simply responding to some opposition to viewing that opposition as
   wrongfully imposed by an agent; second, in the cases that are my focus,
   the movement is a response to a persistent opposition that is compounded
   by an erosion of trust, confidence and hope within a moral community,
   which ultimately changes the very nature of the opposition into a form
   of wrongdoing. These aspects allow us to assess the appropriateness of
   the movement, thereby developing a rich analysis of moral anger arising
   out of frustration in a political context.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine the phenomenon of what I call `green shame',
   the shame one feels when knowingly behaving in ways that have a severe
   negative impact on the environment, like flying or eating meat, while
   other options are available at a financially and socially
   non-debilitating cost. I argue that individual green shame can
   contribute to the greening of society. I do so by first setting out my
   understanding of shame and distinguishing it from other significant
   feelings like guilt or embarrassment. I understand shame as the emotion
   one feels when one believes to have sunk below the standards of what
   dignity requires. I then draw out my account of green shame and
   distinguish it from green guilt. I raise three possible objections: the
   objection that green shame does not change behaviour, the objection that
   green shame does change behaviour but does not change it for the better,
   and the objection that (individual) shame is not the most efficient
   strategy in pursuing the greening of society. I argue that these
   objections can be met and show how that can be done. I conclude that
   green shame can contribute to the greening of society because, apart
   from its effect on individual choice, the sting of green shame urges
   people to demand action at an institutional level and creates a support
   base for much-needed institutional change.},

Abstract = {This article, based on newly available materials from the former Soviet
   archives, deals with the famine that struck a large part of the North
   Korean countryside in the winter of 1954-1955. The famine was related to
   the policies of crash industrialization and collectivization favored by
   Kim Il-sung-or at least, this is how many contemporaries, including
   Soviet diplomats, saw it. The famine, mentioned only once in openly
   available publications of the period, sparked political instability and
   prompted the urgent delivery of food assistance from the USSR and China.
   Soviet leaders, seeing the famine as another sign of the dangerous
   trends of Kim Il-Sung's policies, gave Pyongyang strong ``advice,{''}
   demanding a moderation of policies and partial halt of the
   collectivization drive. The ``advice{''} was followed, but the entire
   confrontation contributed to the further buildup of tensions between
   Moscow and Kim Il-Sung.},

Pages = {211-233},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Attempts to intervene in the Syrian and Myanmar crises have been
   hampered by political deadlock, leading even supporters of R2P to
   question its continued salience. Yet, upon closer consideration, Member
   States and other members of the international community have, by and
   large, upheld their protection responsibilities, via the creation of
   innovative mechanisms that have been used to bypass Security Council
   deadlock. Not only have these mechanisms served to uphold R2P in these
   two cases, they have created alternate pathways to operationalise R2P,
   thus serving to further advance the norm. The theoretical claim put
   forth is that norm violations have served as an alternate vehicle for
   norm advancement, as flagrant norm violations committed by the Syrian
   and Myanmar governments, as well as by the Security Council, have
   reminded members of the international community of the costs of failing
   to protect.},

Title = {The Regulatory Gift: Politics, regulation and governance},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {203-218},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article introduces the ``regulatory gift{''} as a conceptual
   framework for understanding a particular form of government-led
   deregulation that is presented as central to the public interest. Contra
   to theories of regulatory capture, government corruption, ``insider{''}
   personal interest, or profit-seeking theories of regulation, the
   regulatory gift describes reform that is overtly designed by government
   to reduce or reorient regulators' functions to the advantage of the
   regulated and in line with market objectives on a potentially macro
   (rather than industry-specific) scale. As a conceptual framework, the
   regulatory gift is intended to be applicable across regulated sectors of
   democratic states and in this article the empirical sections evidence
   the practice of regulatory gifting in contemporary United Kingdom (UK)
   politics. Specifically, this article analyses the 2011 UK Public Bodies
   Act, affecting some 900 regulatory public bodies and its correlative
   legislation, the 2014 Regulator's Code, the 2015 Deregulation Act, and
   the 2016 Enterprise Bill. The article concludes that while in some cases
   the regulatory gift may be aligned with the public interest - delivering
   on cost reduction, enhancing efficiency, and stimulating innovation -
   this will not always be the case. As the case study of the regulatory
   body, the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, demonstrates,
   despite the explicit claims made by legislators, the regulatory gift has
   the potential to significantly undermine the public interest.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the education of youth and parents influences
   the transition of youth from schooling to the labor market. I use a
   representative survey of youth aged 16 to 29 (N = 1,590) in Lithuania in
   2013 to create an analysis that yields estimates of the influence of
   family education on factors such as youth employment, obstacles to
   finding a first job, and difficulties in the first job. My hypothesis
   that youth from families with less education have greater difficulties
   in the labor market transition was confirmed. My hypothesis that the
   higher the parents' education, the easier it is for young people to
   adapt in the first workplace was also confirmed. Results also reveal
   that lower parental education means that their children lacked general
   workplace competencies, had less-decent working conditions, and faced
   other difficulties in the labor market.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the gendered circuits of violence that create and
   sustain economic insecurity in Ukraine. Drawing on feminist political
   economy analysis of the dependence of structural adjustment programmes
   on women's labor, and feminist security studies critical analysis of the
   negative effects of militaries on human security, the paper shows how
   IFI-imposed austerity measures in Ukraine are inextricable from
   processes of militarization. While the gendered impacts of each of these
   distinct processes have been explored, this paper empirically
   demonstrates how IFI loan conditionalities and militarization intensify
   and reinforce one another precisely through the burdens they place on
   households and especially on women in the context of conflict.},

Abstract = {This article scrutinises and criticises the notion of efficiency and the
   role of state in the emergence and evolution of institutions and
   property rights within the tradition of new institutional economics.
   Specifically, the attempt is to criticise the efficiency view of the
   formation of property rights and institutions. It is shown that the
   efficiency concept cannot provide a sufficient rationale for explaining
   the origins of private property. Additionally, some recent developments
   of North's thought are critically scrutinised, showing that his
   theoretical apparatus could be conceived as a paradise for the eclectic.
   Further, the role of the state in different versions of the theory of
   property rights - with a special reference to North's treatment of the
   notion of state - is, also, critically examined. Although North's work
   has virtues compared to the `naive model' of property rights by
   recognising and addressing the role of the state and the issue of power
   in the formation of property rights and institutions, he does not
   succeed in fully accounting for the existence of institutional
   arrangements, due to his adherence to an individualist framework.},

Abstract = {Classical economists characterised free competition as, alternatively,
   freedom of contract and freedom to trade. These notions were still at
   centre stage of the economic discourse during the Gilded Age and early
   Progressive Era, notwithstanding the dramatic rise in industrial size
   and concentration. In particular, they played a key role during the
   so-called formative era of American antitrust (1890-1914). The essay
   argues that the history of economic thought may offer an essential,
   though seldom recognised, perspective for understanding the rationale
   behind some of the Sherman Act's early case law. As it turns out, US
   courts were still framing their discourse in terms of the two classical
   images of free competition. Proposals for antitrust reform would in turn
   stem from the difficult reconciliation between these images and the new
   reality of Corporate America.},

Abstract = {In this article we explore the ways in which universities and
   communities can work together drawing on our experience of a
   community-university co-produced project called `Imagine'. We reflect on
   our different experiences of working together and affectively co-produce
   the article, drawing on a conversation we held together. We locate our
   discussion within the projects we worked on. We look at the experiences
   of working across community and university and affectively explore
   these. We explore the following key questions:
   How do we work with complexity and difference?
   Who holds the power in research?
   What kinds of methods surface hidden voices?
   How can we co-create equitable research spaces together?
   What did working together feel like?
   Our co-writing process surfaces some of these tensions and difficulties
   as we struggle to place our voices into an academic article. We surface
   more of our own tensions and voices and this has become one of the
   dominant experiences of doing co-produced research. We explore the
   mechanisms of co-production as being both a process of fusion but also
   its affective qualities. Our discussions show that community partners
   working with academics have to bear the emotional labour; by `standing
   in the gap' they are having to move between community and university. We
   also recognise the power of community co-writing as a form that can open
   up an opportunity to speak differently, outside the constraining spaces
   of academia.},

Abstract = {We present novel evidence suggesting that cronyism had a negative effect
   on economic growth in Egypt, during a period when international
   organizations praised the country for its reforms of business
   regulation. We identify 385 politically connected firms under the
   Mubarak regime. This large database allows us to show that 4-digit
   sectors that experienced crony entry between 1996 and 2006 exhibited
   lower aggregate employment growth subsequently than those that did not.
   In manufacturing, labor productivity grew more slowly in sectors that
   experienced crony entry. Ample, though not definitive evidence suggests
   that this effect was causal. Crony entry skewed the distribution of
   employment toward smaller, less productive firms; crony firms do not
   appear to have entered sectors that would have also grown more slowly
   even in the absence of crony entry; and they enjoyed multiple regulatory
   and fiscal privileges that reduced competition and investments by
   non-crony firms, including trade protection and energy subsidies. These
   privileges account for the higher profits of politically connected
   firms.},

Abstract = {Following the unsuccessful attempt to get a woman appointed as UN
   secretary-general in 2016 and the drop in women in senior posts in 2015,
   it appeared that gender equality at the UN was as distant as ever. Yet,
   gender equality within the Secretariat and UN system has been on the
   organization's agenda since 1970, with goals and target dates set for
   the level of women's participation and achievement. These have been met
   in some issue areas (for example, in so-called feminine portfolios) and
   organizations, but not others. As part of the special issue on ``The
   United Nations at Seventy-Five: Looking Back to Look Forward,{''} this
   essay traces the evolution of efforts to increase the representation of
   women in the UN system and takes stock of their current representation
   therein, analyzing the data on the Secretariat and appointments to
   senior posts as well as in various operations and programs.},

Abstract = {Environmental problems were not among the core issues for the United
   Nations at its creation in 1945. In the 1970s, however, they created a
   crescendo of public concern as the threats posed by toxic chemicals,
   large-scale destruction of natural ecosystems, and the loss of species
   became visible and were obviously linked to human activity. Pollution,
   it was clear, did not stop at national borders and solutions required
   common effort. As part of the special issue on ``The United Nations at
   Seventy-Five: Looking Back to Look Forward,{''} this essay explores how,
   as the only institution equipped to identify global problems and
   generate collective action toward their resolution, the UN became the
   platform for creating multilateral environmental agreements, convening
   global conferences, and mobilizing national and international effort
   through a progressively larger number of institutions at the national
   and international level to guide decisions and influence behavior. We
   have moved the environmental needle in terms of information,
   institutions, and awareness. Yet, many environmental problems persist,
   some are getting worse, and new challenges and, indeed, crises are
   emerging.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {813-828},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Traditional notions of financialisation require updating to study the
   reorganisation of finance around digital infrastructures. We introduce
   the concept of digital financialisation, defined as the often-coerced
   merging of two hitherto separate aspects of citizens' lives -
   interactions using digital technologies and financial transactions -
   into a new hybrid realm. This realm is undergirded by an infrastructure
   that harvests citizens' data, which companies can monetise and
   governments can use for political surveillance. In developing countries,
   the state plays a key role in creating surveillance infrastructures,
   often using coercive means in the name of financial inclusion, as the
   demonetisation and Aadhaar projects in India show. Unlike the
   industry-finance conflict in `analogue' financialisation, digital
   financialisation involves domestic and cross-border conflicts between
   tech and finance companies for control of the hybrid realm. The state
   mediates these conflicts. In India, it deploys a narrative of
   technocultural nationalism to cultivate its domestic political
   constituencies and downplay its reliance on foreign technology.},

Abstract = {For the first time in the history of central banks, the Federal Reserve
   has been pursuing monetary policies which allow shadow banks to access
   its reserves. The paper examines these policies in an analysis based on
   the concept of security structure. The aim is to facilitate a better
   understanding of complex institutional arrangements which convert credit
   claims into money or enable them to simulate the money-form. As the
   financial crisis reached its peak in September 2008, the Fed was not
   able to contain the impact precisely because the security structure
   existing between banks and the Fed did not extend to the shadow banking
   system, which had meanwhile become thebackbone of the global financial
   system. To address this situation, the Fed initiated new security
   structures that were designed to also give players in the shadow banking
   system access to liquidity and collateral. The concept `security
   structure' serves as an analytical tool to explore dynamic forms of
   safety and liquidity generation and to distinguish between credit
   expansion and money creation. It also helps to differentiate between
   three qualitatively different stages of security: central bank money,
   quasi-money and shadow money. In this way, it foregrounds the politics
   of (shadow) money creation.},

Abstract = {This study applies the growing field of network science to explore
   whether police violence is associated with characteristics of an
   officer's social networks and his or her placement within those
   networks. To do this, we re-create the network of police misconduct for
   the Chicago Police Department using more than 38,442 complaints filed
   against police officers between 2000 and 2003. Our statistical models
   reveal that officers who shoot at civilians are often ``brokers{''}
   within the social networks of policing, occupying important positions
   between other actors in the network and often connecting otherwise
   disconnected parts of the social structure between other officers within
   larger networks of misconduct. This finding holds, even net measures of
   officer activity, career movement, and sociodemographic background. Our
   finding suggest that policies and interventions aimed at curbing police
   shootings should include not only individual assessments of risk but
   also an understanding of officers' positions within larger social
   networks.},

Abstract = {The literature on Normative Power Europe (NPE) largely omits the
   question of why the EU chooses to focus on particular norms in the first
   place. This paper goes beyond the assumption that the EU simply
   externalizes its internal norms, because such a perspective does not
   sufficiently explain why the EU prioritizes certain norms over others,
   particularly in the case of contested norms. Using LGBTI rights and
   Freedom of Religion or Belief (FoRB) in the EU's external human rights
   policy as two cases, I demonstrate how norm entrepreneurs - both
   external and internal - have been essential for bringing these norms to
   the EU's attention. Only after initial internal resistances had been
   overcome, were these norms able to reach the EU's external agenda. The
   two cases illustrate the internal political struggles that precede norm
   selection, supporting recent calls for a more politics-oriented
   perspective on Normative Power Europe.},

Abstract = {Recent research argues that complex problems such as climate change are
   best tackled through co-creation, which brings together public and
   private actors, including citizens, neighborhoods, and civil society
   organizations, in collaborative processes that define problems and
   design and implement solutions that produce innovative public value
   outcomes. This article explores the viability of co-creation as a
   strategy for achieving ambitious CO2 emissions reductions in the City of
   Copenhagen, Denmark. It analyses the starting conditions, the
   co-creation processes, the drivers and barriers, the positive results
   and outcomes, and the role of institutional design and leadership in an
   effort to understand the actual use of co-creation in city-level climate
   governance. The main finding is that institutional, discursive, and
   political barriers create a discrepancy between the commitment to and
   actual use of co-creation, but also that a new focus on consumption and
   transport among citizens may lead to stronger future waves of
   co-creation.},

Abstract = {During terrorism trials, social media activities such as tweeting,
   Facebook posts, and WhatsApp conversations have become an essential part
   of the evidence presented. Amidst the complexity of prosecuting crimes
   with limited possibilities for criminal investigations and evidence
   collection, social media interactions can provide valuable information
   to reconstruct events that occurred there-and-then, to prosecute in the
   here-and-now. This paper follows social media objects as evidentiary
   objects in different court judgments to research how security practices
   and knowledge interact with legal practices in the court room. I build
   on the notion of the folding object as described by Bruno Latour and
   Amade M'charek to research the practices and arguments of the judges
   through which they unfold some of the histories, interpretations, and
   politics inside the object as reliable evidence. This concept allows for
   an in-depth examination of how histories are entangled in the
   presentation of an evidentiary object and how these references to
   histories are made (in)visible during legal discussions on security and
   terrorism. The paper therefore contributes to the field of critical
   security studies by focusing on how security practices are mediated in
   the everyday legal settings of domestic court rooms.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of industrial policy in promoting
   upgrading in commodity sectors by examining the case of the petroleum,
   rubber, and palm oil industries in Malaysia. By doing so, it aims to
   contribute to an emerging scholarship that bridges the developmental
   state and the global value chains literature. Several findings emerge
   from this study. First, linkages do not unfold through market forces
   alone. Commodity value addition processes can be hindered by a range of
   barriers, including power dynamics alongside global commodity chains.
   The existence of high barriers for linkage development in developing
   nations justifies the need of state interventions. Second, successful
   government interventions for commodity value addition in Malaysia have
   gone far beyond fixing market failures and a `facilitative' role of the
   state. Instead, the productive capabilities necessary for value addition
   were accumulated through coherent industrial policies and the strategic
   orientation of rents towards achieving productivity gains and learning.
   Third, political considerations, such the base of the ruling coalition,
   the regime type (marked by both executive dominance and political
   competition), and the influence of the regional intellectual climate,
   are essential to understanding both the policy will and ability to
   pursue a developmental approach towards commodity value addition.},

Title = {Foreign aid, oil revenues, and political accountability: Evidence from
   six experiments in Ghana and Uganda},

Abstract = {Foreign aid may act much like oil money in reducing voters' willingness
   to demand accountability from their government, enabling corruption,
   clientelism, and repression. This is an important causal mechanism
   connecting public budgets to quality of governance. Yet other
   scholarship counters that aid is more beneficial than oil, either
   indirectly because of donor oversight or directly because aid is more
   likely to produce citizen pressures on governments. Empirical work on
   the topic employs observational data at the national, macro level, and
   has left the question unresolved. At the micro level, in some countries
   citizens have experience with aid revenues and oil funds, thus
   possessing information about the political implications of these
   different revenue sources. This article provides the first experimental
   tests of the direct mechanism linking aid and oil revenues to demands
   from citizens for greater political accountability. We report the
   effects of randomly assigned treatments identifying aid funds compared
   to oil money on behavior of citizens in six survey and lab experiments
   in Ghana and Uganda. We find no differences in accountability pressures
   when subjects are randomly assigned to aid or oil conditions in any
   experiment, including a survey-based field experiment in Uganda that
   employed very strong information treatments on the extent of aid and oil
   funds. Though little evidence suggests that either windfall necessarily
   reduces accountability demands from baseline in a meaningful way,
   citizens' actions for aid money were statistically indistinguishable
   from oil revenues across all experiments. Aid may well have governance
   effects through the indirect route of donor oversight, but the results
   presented here suggest no evidence that aid, compared to oil, directly
   induces greater accountability demands among citizens.},

Volume = {692},

Abstract = {This volume of The ANNALS aims to increase awareness among scholars,
   policy-makers, and practitioners of the size, scope, and functions of
   child welfare services in the United States. We aim to promote a wider
   understanding of the broad impacts of child welfare policies and point
   to ways in which child welfare services can be better incorporated into
   cross-cutting social policy debates. The articles in this volume offer
   concrete recommendations for policies and practices that can reduce
   child maltreatment, and for systemic approaches-both within the purview
   of child welfare services and across the broader community and social
   policy landscape-that can better identify and respond to the needs of
   children and families in which maltreatment has already occurred or
   where there is a risk of abuse and neglect. This introduction sets a
   foundation for understanding the contents of the volume: we provide an
   overview of child welfare services in the United States and highlight
   current challenges that the U.S. child welfare systems face.},

Abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems have come to support, pre-empt
   or substitute for human decisions in manifold areas, with potentially
   significant impacts on individuals' lives. Achieving transparency and
   accountability has been formulated as a general goal regarding the use
   of these systems. However, concrete applications differ widely in the
   degree of risk and the accountability problems they entail for data
   subjects. The present paper addresses this variation and presents a
   framework that differentiates regulatory requirements for a range of ADM
   system uses. It draws on agency theory to conceptualize accountability
   challenges from the point of view of data subjects with the purpose to
   systematize instruments for safeguarding algorithmic accountability. The
   paper furthermore shows how such instruments can be matched to
   applications of ADM based on a risk matrix. The resulting comprehensive
   framework can guide the evaluation of ADM systems and the choice of
   suitable regulatory provisions.},

   surveillance of migration in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1970s},

Abstract = {Surveillance studies have long argued that electronic databases are
   designed to maximize state surveillance as a ``superpanopticon{''} or
   ``surveillant assemblage.{''} But how are databases being implemented in
   practice, and do they actually enhance control? This article addresses
   these questions by examining the case of the German Central Foreigners
   Register (Auslanderzentralregister{[}AZR]). Established in 1953, the AZR
   was one of the first databases on migrants in the western liberal world,
   and remains a pillar of Germany's migration control system today. By
   analyzing internal ministerial records from the 1950s to the 1970s - the
   time when this database was introduced, expanded, and automatized while
   still relatively free from legal or public constraints - this article
   examines whether, or how, databases enhance state control. I argue that
   the AZR did not provide the ``perfect surveillance{''} it was intended
   to deliver; rather, it produced major bureaucratic and political
   challenges and a series of malfunctions. This case study confirms that
   database surveillance, such as the German AZR in the 1970s and European
   databases today, depends on three basic conditions: shared expectations
   regarding data usages, cooperation in data supply, and capacities of
   data storage and maintenance. Moreover, databases serve the additional
   symbolic function of reassuring the self-imagination of sovereign,
   modern state power.},

Abstract = {Despite the fascination with female fighters in the international media,
   there is still limited knowledge about how female combatants see
   themselves and how their conflict experiences shape their lives after
   war. Women's participation in armed conflict is often dismissed and
   depoliticized, emphasizing either their role as victims or as
   peacemakers. This article contributes to a body of literature that
   foregrounds the diverse voices of ex-combatant women, as a particular
   group who challenged traditional gender norms during conflict. Their
   narratives complicate the simplistic and limited depictions of female
   combatants and instead reveal a multi-layered and complex account of how
   communities of female ex-combatants frame their wartime experiences and
   daily lives today. The article proposes participatory documentary
   filmmaking as a feminist method to make female combatants' experiences
   in conflict visible without extracting knowledge or speaking on their
   behalf. Working with two ex-combatant women from non-state armed
   movements in Aceh (Indonesia) and Burundi as co-researchers who
   collected and curated the stories of their former comrades on camera
   means that a more diverse and personal picture emerges. This article
   highlights the challenges, complexities, and possibilities of
   participatory filmmaking as an approach that can enrich the
   methodological toolkit of scholars researching women in conflict.},

Abstract = {The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) was embraced at the World Summit 15
   years ago, before nations and civil society had built the tools,

   a policy researcher with R2P expertise who became a US diplomat involved
   in these issues, this piece reflects on the experience of the Obama
   administration's efforts to bring US government focus to atrocity
   prevention. It considers what it got right, what it missed, and options
   for looking forward to address R2P in the decade ahead.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Why do some business associations mobilize, engage in collective action,
   and take public stands against the populist right while others do not?
   This article examines business mobilization against the populist right
   in Germany, which is heavily export-oriented and reliant on the European
   and global market order. Drawing on interviews with three business
   associations, the article presents three key findings. First, economic
   self-interest is a powerful driver of business mobilization: perceived
   threats and vulnerability spurred two German associations to act
   collectively against right-wing populism. However, mobilization is
   driven not by declining revenues or profits but by a mixture of values
   and material interests. Second, business associations that mobilize
   stress the need to reform the system, democratize the European Union,
   and address those who feel ``left behind.{''} Third, medium-size,
   export-oriented manufacturers are the core business constituency
   supporting liberal democracy and the European Union. The article shows
   that some business factions can play a role in defending the liberal
   international order against right-wing populism.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the challenge of illiberalism to democracy, even
   though the nature of this contestation is ambiguous. The illiberal
   critique of liberal democracy is contextualised using conceptual history
   and two major `political credit ratings', namely the Democracy Index and
   theFreedom in the WorldReport. Empirically we concentrate on Hungarian
   politics, which we consider to be an example of soft authoritarianism,
   drawing on two key speeches by Prime Minister Viktor Orban: his launch
   of the idea of the `illiberal state' in 2014 and his emphasis on
   `Christian democracy' after the 2018 election campaign.},

Abstract = {Current scholarship offers conflicting conclusions about whether female
   candidates have a feminine advantage or a disadvantage. Previous work
   does not consider whether voters respond similarly to all types of
   messages that might emphasize feminine stereotypes, such as feminine
   trait and feminine issue messages. I argue that voters will respond
   differently to trait-based feminine messages relative to issue-based
   feminine messages. I test the effects of trait-based and issue-based
   feminine messages through two survey experiments. The results
   consistently show that emphasizing feminine traits harms female
   candidates, whereas emphasizing feminine issues helps female candidates.
   I use role congruity theory to argue that feminine traits activate
   feminine stereotypes about women, and feminine issues do not activate
   these stereotypes. I also show that trait-based and issue-based feminine
   messages affect Democratic and Republican female candidates in very
   different ways. These results have implications for the ability of women
   to win elected office and reverse the pervasive underrepresentation of
   women in politics.},

Abstract = {The Swedish welfare model is gradually losing its former
   characteristics. Notable is the extensive privatization of provision and
   the emerging privatization of funding, primarily through new and
   half-private services in health care, education, and elderly care. The
   clearest example of this trend is the rise of private health insurance,
   which is now signed by every tenth person of working age. This article
   points out different types of regulations that have provoked the rise of
   private health insurance, and discusses types of regulations that could
   potentially slow privatization. Further, this article analyzes three
   official welfare investigation reports. These reports avoid the decisive
   regulations they are supposed to discuss, and sometimes go against
   directives to do so. I argue that regulations for private health
   insurance have occurred without much debate, while every potential
   regulation against private health insurance is very much disputed by
   industry interests and many of the political parties.},

Abstract = {In this article, two white, Western female researchers reflect on the
   methodological, ethical, and practical dilemmas experienced while
   conducting social science fieldwork in Botswana for their doctoral
   degrees. In addition, their shared research assistant examines her role
   as a social and cultural interlocutor, which was essential to the
   researchers' successful navigation in their various field sites. Drawing
   on distinct but common experiences conducting research in northern and
   western regions of rural Botswana, the authors reflexively consider a
   series of interwoven issues tied to their positionalities: the disparity
   in benefits and return on research investment between the researcher and
   research participants; the nature of commodified or transactional
   relations, especially in an impoverished region highly dependent on
   foreign tourists; the complex nature of researcher-research assistant
   relationships; and the contradictory dynamics of being female
   researchers in a patriarchal society while also embodying privileges of
   whiteness and Western nationality. Building on these reflections, the
   authors engage with current debates in the social sciences to argue that
   researcher reflexivity is not an adequate end point and should result in
   engagement with ethical and epistemological questions regarding the
   decolonization of research practices more broadly.},

Abstract = {In this paper we argue that efforts to apply Varieties of Capitalism to
   emerging economies can retaining a central role for institutions as
   constraining, it is important to incorporate into the analysis the
   nature and role of social blocs and the development of growth regimes.
   The paper develops a framework that systematically explores the links
   and interactions between institutions, the politics of social blocs and
   the viability of growth regimes as a way of understanding the trajectory
   of varieties of capitalism. We illustrate the value of this framework by
   applying it to developments in Brazil over the last three decades. In
   our concluding section, we describe how the application of the framework
   can be broadened not just to other emerging economies but also to the
   challenges currently being faced by advanced capitalist democracies. We
   identify a series of research questions developing and applying insights
   from this framework. A theoretically renewed comparative capitalisms
   approach to emerging economies is therefore potentially going to provide
   a payoff to developing a global perspective on forms of capitalism and
   their trajectories.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Research by political economists typically highlights policymakers,
   regulators, economists and consultants as the makers of economies. This
   paper foregrounds a different actor entirely, what I call the
   `hacker-engineer' as an important protagonist in the making of
   decentralised digital network economies that are forged through the
   emerging field of `cryptoeconomics' and blockchain and other distributed
   ledger technologies. Responding to critical literature stating that
   blockchain and `cryptoeconomics' merely extend neoliberal processes of
   economisation, the paper recovers the neglected hacker culture of
   cypherpunk and histories of peer-to-peer decentralised networks in order
   to foreground concerns that depart from the continuation of economics
   and economies as usual. Hacker-engineers are dedicated to
   decentralisation as a `disruptive' response to network control and
   surveillance, and share a pragmatist sensibility that seeks to make
   decentralised networks `work' in order to provide informational security
   and privacy. While further broadening the range of agents that provide
   the focus for political economy research into the production of
   economies, the paper also draws attention to the technical decisions of
   hacker-engineers that attempt to reconfigure the material
   infrastructures of digital economies.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the use of skills in multinational companies
   compared to domestic firms. It thus assesses the contribution of foreign
   direct investment to skill development as well as the potential for
   spillovers from multinational to domestic firms. It analyzes demand for
   skilled labor in Slovakia, a country that is characterized by a high
   degree of dependence on inward foreign investment. Our framework
   distinguishes between demand for digital skills on two levels:
   occupational structure; and skill content within occupations. It is on
   the latter level that the limits of the foreign-led growth can be
   observed. Using a large dataset on vacancies from a leading job portal,
   we show that foreign-owned companies generally advertise for
   higher-skilled occupations than domestic firms, but their skill
   requirements for these jobs are lower than in similar jobs in domestic
   companies. Foreign companies have higher skill requirements only in some
   blue collar jobs linked to assembly and component manufacturing. For
   white collar occupations, domestic companies are more likely to require
   digital skills. Domestic firms thus have a key role in skill development
   also in an economy where foreign companies exhibit higher productivity
   and innovation intensity.},

Abstract = {Reviews of intelligence failures have recommended greater use of
   external expertise in challenging intelligence community assessments.
   External contributions were expected to augment covert collection and to
   provide open-source challenge to analysts, rather than to directly
   contribute to decision support. The structural limitations of the scope
   and machinery of intelligence have limited the value agencies can
   extract from external experts. Creating an Open-Source Intelligence
   Agency of commensurate size to primary intelligence organisations would
   enable decision support to be provided to all government departments. It
   would widen the pool of sources and experts, providing for greater
   extraction of value from experts who are only partially included in this
   government activity.},

Abstract = {While immigrant integration is increasingly important for policy-makers,
   governments of countries approach the challenge of integration
   differently. In this article, I frame the issue of migrant/refugee
   integration in the larger context of political debates and policies
   about the entry of refugees and migrants. I then go on to analytic
   comparison of refugee integration policies in eleven developed
   countries, focusing on the interrelated domains of citizenship, language
   acquisition, and employment. These three domains are interrelated:
   acquiring language skills facilitates employment and (for most
   countries) is required for citizenship. I find considerable variation
   across these countries, which reflects their different historical
   contexts, but also the different policy choices that have been made in
   the countries. Even within the European Union, there is considerable
   variation between Member States in the emphasis they place, for example,
   on employment of refugees. While the study focuses primarily on policies
   developed at the national level, I conclude by stressing the importance
   of local initiatives to support refugee integration.},

Abstract = {Whereas Australia has pursued askills-basedmigration policy, the United
   States has privilegedfamily-basedmigration. The key contrast between
   these migration regimes provides a rare test of how national immigration
   policy shapes immigrant selection and integration. Does a skills-based
   immigration regime result in a more select group of Asian immigrants in
   Australia compared to their counterparts in the United States? Are Asian
   immigrants more integrated into their host society in Australia compared
   to the United States? Focusing on four groups of Asian immigrants in
   both countries (Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, and Vietnamese), this
   article addresses these questions using a transpacific comparison.
   Despite Australia's skills-based immigration policy, we find that Asian
   immigrants in Australia arelesshyper-selected than their counterparts in
   the United States. Asian immigrants in Australia also report worse labor
   market outcomes than those in the United States, with the exception of
   Vietnamese-a refugee group. Altogether, these findings challenge the
   conventional wisdom that skills-based immigration policy not only
   results in more selected immigrants, but also positively influences
   their integration into the host society.},

Title = {Using a Feminist Paradigm (Intersectionality) to Study Conservative
   Women: The Case of Pro-life Activists in Italy},

Abstract = {This article builds on ethnographic research concerning the Italian
   pro-life movement and argues for the use of intersectionality theory in
   studying conservative women. The article suggests, first, that
   understanding conservative movements necessitates linking their
   political claims to the social identities of their activists, as would
   be the case for any other social movement (e.g., feminism). These social
   identities are as complex and intersectional as any other: a white,
   upper-class pro-life activist is no less intersectional than a black
   feminist from a poor background. Concomitantly, there is no unique
   feminism, but rather a plurality of feminisms, a diversity that
   intersectionality facilitates the identification of. The same is true
   for pro-life movements, but scholars tend to use the singular form to
   talk about conservatism; in this article, I explore the use of the
   plural to show that pro-life women do not constitute a monolithic group.
   On the contrary, these women are diverse in terms of their reproductive
   stories, their working status, and their class, race, and sexual
   practices, and this diversity translates into different ways of being
   pro-life. Second, recognizing this complexity does not suggest a natural
   link between feminism and conservatism. Alternatively, I suggest that a
   better understanding of conservative women can only be reached if they
   are studied on their own terms.},

Abstract = {This article examines how transnational labour mobility in uneven and
   combined Europe has emerged as a critical response to the problems of
   capitalist production and social reproduction. Analysing the
   interconnected mobilities of labour between Ukraine, Poland and the UK
   in the food production, care provision and housing construction sectors,
   the article examines how states benefit from lower unemployment and
   reduced labour shortages, employers profit from qualified and reliable
   workers, and households gain access to jobs and incomes. It argues that
   transnational labour mobility is constitutive of the inherently
   interdependent production-reproduction processes. In this constellation,
   transnational labour mobility becomes a form of mitigation of depletion
   through social reproduction. However, it further argues that such a
   mitigation strategy is unbalanced and unsustainable as its costs and
   benefits are unequally distributed, forestalling resource inflows that
   could attenuate outflows. Therefore, harms - in particular, the harm to
   citizenship entitlements - emerge despite labour mobility mitigating
   depletion.},

Abstract = {Independent oversight institutions are critical components of the
   accountability landscape in modern democracies. This paper presents a
   framework for assessing the accountability powers of these watchdogs.
   This watchdog accountability index is an empirical tool to assess the
   key accountability powers of accountability forums that operate in a
   democratic constitutional context. The aim is to provide a richer
   evidence base to assess evolving external accountability arrangements
   and their effectiveness. Our approach breaks down the concept of
   watchdog accountability power into three distinct, conceptually coherent
   dimensions. We apply the accountability index to assess the strength of
   one of the main watchdog institutions in the EU, the European Court of
   Auditors in 2017. Data were collected by means of a study of secondary
   sources and by an expert survey.},

Abstract = {Research has highlighted that social ties help poor people to survive,
   but has also shown that nonkin ties often only last a short time. In
   this article, I argue that organizations that serve the needs of poor
   people can help to create more sustainable supportive ties among them.
   Drawing on participant observation and ethnographic interviews with
   twenty-five members of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU) in
   Philadelphia-an organization of, by, and for poor people-I found that
   supportive ties among members of KWRU can last years or even decades. I
   show how this organization enabled poor people to create and maintain
   supportive ties. KWRU provided people living in desperate poverty space
   for frequent interaction, connection, and cooperation. The organization
   supported a sense of kinship among members, and group leaders often
   helped to mend rifts between members. While KWRU is distinctive, other
   organizations that serve the needs of poor people could use this model
   to be more responsive to the needs of those in poverty.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse a recent case of educational policymaking in
   the city of Oulu in Finland. The case concerns a ban on asylum seekers'
   visits to local schools and day-care centres. Our primary aim is to
   study the role that negative political emotions play in the decision
   making process of our case. We primarily utilise Martha Nussbaum's work
   on political emotions as our analytical framework. We propose that our
   case exemplifies a type of backlash politics, where policymaking is
   motivated by negative emotions and based on ethnic or racial group
   stigmatisation, with the result of abandoning collectively established
   democratic values and guidelines. Our case also illustrates how, by
   creating a culture of fear, the type of policymaking exemplified by our
   case can significantly diminish the possibilities of democratic
   institutions, such as the comprehensive school, to reinforce social
   cohesion and reduce social inequalities in society. Accordingly, we
   suggest that negative political emotions might have problematic
   consequences for democratic values and decision making processes.
   Finally, we propose an alternative course of action for addressing
   asylum seekers' visits to Finnish schools: we particularly emphasise the
   importance of following established democratic procedures in political
   decision making and also argue for the reinforcement of positive
   political emotions as a long-term educational objective.},

Abstract = {The issue of poor performance of the Russian federal bureaucracy is
   addressed by linking performance to type of official, through analysis
   of biographical data on deputy ministers and division (departament)
   heads in five federal ministries since 2012, supplemented by internet
   searches on behavior, particularly of a corrupt nature. Education,
   previous career experience, and recruitment, including its timing
   relative to superiors and subordinates, are analyzed, in order to
   determine whether officials behave primarily as members of patrimonial
   teams, as members of problem-solving organizations, as self-serving
   individuals, as the instruments of capture by commercial organizations,
   or as servants of bureaucratic agency interests. The data do not
   strongly support any one conclusion, but problem-solving officials have
   the strongest presence.},

Abstract = {The United Nations (UN) system comprises several intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs) that were established to contribute to the
   functioning of the overall transnational system of delivering global
   public goods. However, many IGOs under the UN system are criticized for
   their failure to accomplish their mandates. Research argues that IGO
   boards serve as a governance mechanism that should be designed in order
   to effectively perform the monitoring function to ensure fulfillment of
   IGO mandates. Thus, using an inductive fuzzy set qualitative comparative
   analysis, this study explores 13 IGO boards under the UN system to
   identify the board designs that are associated with highly effective
   monitoring. Our findings reveal a board design typology reflecting the
   interplay of the level of organizational complexity and the extent of
   the distribution problem in IGOs. This research contributes to our
   understanding of IGO governance by underscoring the relationship between
   board designs and highly effective monitoring to help researchers and
   practitioners improve IGO performance.},

   Commission. This report was never released with the main conclusions
   forming the basis of a statement by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
   published in May 1982. But the 1981 report is significant for a number
   of reasons. It was the first major review of government security since
   the Radcliffe Report of 1961, resulting in a number of recommendations
   that changed government vetting for the rest of the 1980s. The report
   also recommended the avowal of Britain's foreign intelligence agency - a
   recommendation that proved especially controversial.},

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners of transitional justice have begun to seek
   alternative approaches in the arts and culture as a means to pursue core
   goals of peace and reconciliation. This Special Issue asks what creative
   approaches can do that conventional transitional justice mechanisms
   cannot, and invites us to reflect on the possibilities, and the
   potential challenges, risks and constraints. In response, this article
   discusses two arts-based initiatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one
   involving a national museum, the History Museum of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, and one with a Bosnian peacebuilding organization, the Post
   Conflict Research Centre, that provided opportunities for plural,
   dialogical and localized forms of transitional justice. Analyzing the
   question of what worked in these two distinct initiatives, we highlight
   four common qualities and offer them as non-prescriptive ` good-practice
   principles' in strategic arts-based peacebuilding practice: iterative
   working over time; carving space for plural, locally driven narratives;
   amplifying the capacities and networks of local actors; and
   context-driven project design.},

Abstract = {This article intervenes in discussions about the circulation of policing
   knowledge and the politics of expertise. As part of a broader
   conversation about transnational reconfigurations of state power,
   critical scholars have drawn attention to the influence of global
   policing ``models{''} and ``private{''} experts in shaping policy. They
   show how such figures and forms of knowhow symbolically enforce urban
   order and dispossess marginalized communities under conditions of
   neoliberal crisis. While incisive, these approaches can unduly portray
   expert authority as boundless and unassailable. This article argues that
   a sustained theoretical engagement with questions about controversies
   and failure opens up fruitful avenues to unsettle the perceived
   smoothness, inevitability, and omnipotence of experts in relation to
   politics and governing. Drawing on insights from actor-network theory
   (ANT), it situates deference to global experts as interventions that
   seek to enact and police the terms of ``reality{''} concerning urban
   order. This approach allows us to better understand how such
   interventions work but also how they misfire and come undone. These
   claims are developed through a close reading of UK Prime Minister David
   Cameron's attempt to solicit policy advice from renowned global
   ``supercop{''} William Bratton in the aftermath of the 2011 England
   riots.},

Abstract = {It is the state to whom the supranational body directs its decision on a
   human rights violation, and it is the state who is found in violation
   and must provide the appropriate remedies. The state, however, is not a
   single entity: it is composed of the executive (and a web of different
   ministries and departments), the legislature, and the judiciary,
   including administrative bodies and tribunals. Depending on the type of
   reparations ordered, one, several, or all of these actors may be
   implicated. By tracking the mechanics of what happens in practical terms
   at the national level after decisions from UN treaty bodies and the
   regional human rights commissions and courts are adopted, findings from
   a three-year research project underscore that implementation is a
   multi-faceted process and whether implementation and ultimately
   compliance occurs can be explained, in part at least, by the regulatory,
   practical and technical processes in place to respond to those
   supranational decisions. By examining the role of these state actors and
   the procedures by which reparations are implemented and complied with at
   the national level, this article attempts to dissect the concept of
   `political will'. We conclude by providing some further thoughts on how
   litigators, states and supranational bodies themselves can adjust their
   methods accordingly.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long debated whether welfare policymaking in
   industrialized democra-cies is responsive to citizen preferences and
   whether such policymaking is more responsive to rich than to poor
   citizens. Debate has been hampered, however, by difficulties in matching
   data on attitudes toward particular policies to data on changes in the
   generosity of actual policies. This article uses better, more targeted
   measures of policy change that allow more valid exploration of
   responsiveness for a significant range of democracies. It does so by
   linking multicountry and multiwave survey data on attitudes toward
   health, pension, and unemployment policies and data on actual policy
   generosity, not just spending, in these domains. The analysis reveal
   that attitudes correlate strongly with subsequent changes in welfare
   generosity in the three policy areas and that such responsiveness is
   much stronger for richer than for poorer citizens. Representation is
   likely real but also vastly unequal in the welfare politics of
   industrialized democracies.},

Abstract = {The threat of climate catastrophes has been shown to radically change
   optimal climate policy and prospects for international climate
   agreements. We characterize the strategic behavior in emissions
   mitigation and agreement participation with a potential climate
   catastrophe happening at a temperature threshold. Players are
   heterogeneous in a conceptual and two numerical models. We confirm that
   thresholds can induce large, stable coalitions. The relationship between
   the location of the threshold and the potential for cooperation is
   non-linear, with the highest potential for cooperation at intermediate
   temperature thresholds located between 2.5 and 3 degrees of global
   warming. We find that some regions such as Europe, the USA and China are
   often pivotal to keeping the threshold because the rest of the world
   abandons ambitious mitigation and the threshold is crossed without their
   participation. As a result, their incentives to cooperate can be
   amplified at the threshold. This behavior critically depends on the
   characteristics of the threshold as well as the numerical model
   structure. Conversely, non-pivotal regions are more likely to free-ride
   as the threshold inverts the strategic response of the remaining
   coalition. Moreover, we find that our results depend on which
   equilibrium concepts is applied to analyze coalition formation as well
   as the introduction of uncertainty about the threshold.},

Abstract = {In 1567, Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence, learned that he was
   related to the late-medieval dukes of Athens, a surprise to him, and to
   modern-day historians. Cosimo and his advisers knew well that the
   disadvantages of this unsuspected connection outweighed its advantages.
   In 1342, Walter de Brienne, Duke of Athens, had been popularly acclaimed
   as Florence's signore a vita, only to be ignominiously ejected by the
   Florentines in 1343, in response to his oppression, divisiveness, greed,
   cruelty and uncouth behaviour; in Florence, a city whose byword was
   liberty, Walter's rule remained a touchstone for tyranny. It is
   striking, then, that Cosimo's manner of occupying and controlling
   Florence, throughout his long rule (1537-1574), often recalled Walter's,
   and that he cannot have failed to know it. One must ask, then, whether
   he consciously accentuated the similarities, hoped they would pass
   unnoticed, or strove to emphasize the differences. Did the 1567 news
   come as a blessing or a curse? Effective rulers are good at playing the
   long game, and Cosimo did just that. As a Florentine, unlike Walter who
   was French, he knew that his subjects were adept at drawing parallels,
   reading between the lines, and imagining complicated political motives
   behind apparently simple connections and deeds. This enabled Cosimo,
   from the start of his rule, to pre-empt their interpretations of his
   more antagonistic actions by offering explanations and solutions of his
   own devising, while tightening his control over his subjects' behaviour
   and transforming the fabric of his capital in ways likely to guarantee
   his own security and dynastic future. By these means, and others, Cosimo
   was able to vitiate the odious comparisons between the duke of Athens
   and himself, and, when it suited him, exploit them to his advantage.},

Abstract = {The global problem of fatal encounters between police and citizens is a
   massive challenge for both public health and public safety. This volume
   focuses on a wide range of ideas and evidence about what might be done
   to save lives in police-citizen encounters, at least in the United
   States. I focus on three ideas that could make the most difference, most
   quickly. Each of the ideas is supported by both substantial research
   evidence and a feasibility assessment of which ideas might be adopted.
   Three ideas that can transcend political gridlock, appeal to both
   supporters and critics of the American police, and appeal to police
   officers themselves are presented: (1) empowering police to take away
   legally possessed guns from manifestly dangerous people, (2) supporting
   police in emergency first aid and medical treatment of anyone who is
   injured by gunfire, and (3) developing implementation strategies based
   on research on the interactional tactics associated with fatalities and
   their prevention.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan. It uses a
   survey to investigate the general Jordanian perception of the Syrian
   refugee presence in the kingdom and sheds light on the current dynamics
   and future prospects of the crisis. It concludes that the crisis has had
   material effects on the labour market and housing. Thus, social
   discontent has emerged between the host and hosted communities. The
   chapter shows, however, that the crisis has not led to serious tensions
   between the two communities. Nevertheless, relations between Syrian
   refugees and Jordanians seem far from being completely settled as far as
   inclusion is concerned, at least in the short term.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Addressing ecological crises such as climate change within the current
   International Monetary System (IMS) will likely be impossible.
   International monetary relations are built upon a hierarchy between
   currencies, which generates structural Core-Periphery imbalances and
   prevents Peripheral countries from attracting the long-term investments
   necessary for an ecological transition. While propositions have emerged
   to reform the IMS in order to address both global imbalances and
   ecological crises, they typically approach these issues as separate
   phenomena. In contrast, this paper develops a political ecology of
   global imbalances to explore how currency hierarchies are constituted
   and maintained through ecological hierarchies: monetary dominance
   depends upon the continuous and uneven flow of resources from Peripheral
   to Core countries. This connection between monetary and ecological
   hierarchies is particularly visible through the Chimerica relationship,
   which linked the international dominance of the US dollar to China's
   coal-powered development. While China is now transitioning away from its
   Peripheral status by seeking to reconfigure currency and ecological
   hierarchies to support its own resource-intensive growth, this trend
   also increases the likelihood of systemic ecological crises. This
   suggests that the quest for a balanced and green IMS requires a dramatic
   shift away from the Core-driven imperial modes of production,
   consumption and living.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the repurposing of Palestinian rural lands for real
   estate investment. Focusing on Rawabi, the celebrated first Palestinian
   planned city, this study unsettles the city's narrative of triumphant
   urban development within an empty rural landscape by centering the
   experiences of the three villages on whose land this real estate scheme
   was built. Arguing that this project constitutes a neoliberal mode of
   capitalist accumulation that is based on seizing the assets of
   marginalized communities and classes, the paper analyzes how these
   processes are exposing communities to further precarity. Examining the
   land grab upon which this city is based, we detail the repercussions of
   the asset stripping for the peasant communities in question and shed new
   light on how predatory accumulation is transforming rural spaces, life
   and class relations in Palestine. In doing so, this paper situates
   global capitalist dynamics within the settler colonial realities in
   Palestine and begins to examine their implications for Palestinians
   struggling to remain on their land.},

Abstract = {Consistency' has a range of meanings in the context of human protection
   practice. This article conceptualises consistency - a basic premise for
   the legitimacy of norms, both procedurally as well as substantively.
   First, `consistency' can refer to the coherence of the human protection
   framework. Second, consistency can refer to the degree to which
   protection responses adhere to international law and conform with
   international norms. Third, `consistency' can mean the absence of
   variability and unevenness in the application of norms. I argue that
   consistency understood as coherence facilitates protection responses in
   line with international law, and, second, that a coherent protection
   framework encourages the even and invariable application of norms of
   protection by assigning responsibilities to individual protection
   agents. However, the international human protection regime remains
   incoherent: it is ambiguous and it is insufficiently integrated with
   other regimes and across institutions.},

Abstract = {This article responds to earlier research on the role of Islam as a
   barrier to women's political nominations by assessing and comparing
   parties' efforts to meet institutionally required gender quotas in
   Indonesia. With the provision of 30\% candidate gender quotas
   implemented since the 2004 elections, how have parties responded? Do
   Islamist and pluralist parties differ systematically in this regard?
   More specifically, does religious ideology influence how parties go
   about meeting quotas, recruiting female candidates, and getting them
   elected? Or do all parties face the same challenges when it comes to
   getting women into parliament? Drawing on a unique dataset collected
   from 2004 to 2019 legislative elections and in-depth interviews with
   central party officers, faction leaders, and members of parliament, this
   article investigates these questions. The results indicate that Islamic
   ideology plays no obvious role in limiting female participation in
   legislative elections; Islamist and pluralist parties are equally good
   at achieving the percentage quotas of female nominees. Both groups are
   also similarly poor at putting female candidates first on the party
   lists. Indonesia's open-list proportional representation (PR) system is
   prohibitively expensive, and this hurts women candidates more than it
   does male candidates because women generally have less access to the
   capital necessary to purchase the top position on party lists.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to both the scholarly debates on the
   controversies over gender quotas and the body of knowledge on framing
   effects through an investigation of whether national elites, individuals
   in top positions across 10 sectors of Norwegian society, are susceptible
   to positive framing of corporate board gender quotas (CBQs). Elites are
   thought to be more resistant to framing, and their predispositions are
   found to be stronger and more consistent than those of the general
   public. However, few, if any, studies have empirically investigated
   framing effects on national elites. We report on an experiment embedded
   in a comprehensive survey of Norwegian national elites. The results
   clearly indicate that elites are susceptible to framing. When exposed to
   frames highlighting both male dominance among the business elite and the
   success of CBQs in achieving gender balance on corporate boards, elites
   were significantly more likely to support gender quotas. Framing effects
   were primarily found among men, not women, and contrary to expectation,
   effects were stronger among the business elite. Thus, we should direct
   our attention to how the framing of issues also influences key
   stakeholders, and policy makers should consider opposition to gender
   equality measures as something that has the propensity to change.},

Abstract = {The last three decades have witnessed rising inequality and deepening
   financialization in post-industrial democracies. A rapidly growing
   literature has linked these two phenomena. We go beyond existing
   scholarship by specifying which aspects of financialization can be
   expected to increase inequality and where in the income distribution
   this effect will occur. We also show that this effect is contingent on
   institutional context. We posit that the shareholder model of corporate
   governance and the growing demand for financial professionals are the
   two dimensions of financialization that drive up pre-tax income
   inequality. Nevertheless, the spread of the shareholder value model only
   benefits the very top income earners. We further argue that the
   institutional strength of labor shapes the relationship between
   financialization and inequality. We analyze effects of indicators of
   these two dimensions of financialization on the top 1\% and the next 9\%
   income shares and on the 90:50 earnings ratio. We test our hypotheses
   with data on 18 post-industrial democracies between 1960 and 2015.},

Abstract = {Much of the existing business and management research on how `state
   capitalism' influences industry outcomes focuses on the state as 1) the
   owner of companies, 2) a provider of key resources, such as financial
   support, to favoured companies and/or 3) a unitary actor. Whilst some of
   this literature highlights links between politicians and officials, on
   the one hand, and individual companies, on the other, it downplays how
   other political-economic factors, such as the relative importance of
   existing industries in terms of employment and links between state banks
   and state-owned companies impact developments within those emerging
   sectors that the state wishes to promote. Drawing on the
   `state-permeated model' of capitalism, we undertake a comparative
   institutional analysis of the development of the solar photovoltaic (PV)
   industry in China and India. Both states prioritised domestic solar PV
   manufacturing and innovation; however, China's industry is much stronger
   than India's, reflecting, we argue, 1) the greater ability of China's
   central state to co-ordinate other actors and 2) the greater importance
   of India's coal industry compared to China's. We discuss the
   implications of our work for policy makers and for research,
   highlighting the need to assess whether state-permeated capitalism is
   functional or dysfunctional in nuanced ways.},

Abstract = {William Albertson, who was executive secretary of the New York Communist
   Party and a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA
   (CPUSA), was framed as an informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of
   Investigation (FBI) in 1964. Only in recent years have newly released
   FBI records enabled scholars to understand why the FBI undertook the
   operation and how much damage it did to the CPUSA. In 1964 two leaks
   from the FBI hinted that the bureau had a high-level informant in the
   CPUSA who was providing information about secret Soviet subsidies. The
   leaks were accurate and endangered one of the FBI's most successful
   intelligence operations, Operation Solo, which involved the use of two
   brothers, Morris Childs and Jack Childs, who were confidants of CPUSA
   General Secretary Gus Hall, as key informants. The framing of Albertson
   was intended to deflect CPUSA and Soviet attention from the real FBI
   informants to a bogus one. The ploy succeeded. The forged documents the
   FBI planted convinced Hall and other senior CPUSA officials that
   Albertson was the FBI informant. Despite Albertson's vehement denials
   and energetic defense, he was expelled. The CPUSA thought it had
   eliminated the informant, and the Childs brothers were able to continue
   in their role until old age forced their retirement in 1977.},

Abstract = {This article offers a critical engagement with the literature on
   contemporary global power shifts and the phenomenon of `regime
   complexity'. It does so by focusing on South Africa's role in the
   governance of cross-border investment, and using this case to explore
   the strategies used by rising powers to pursue their strategic aims in
   institutionally complex and fragmented global governance regimes. This
   article situates an understanding of regime complexity within a critical
   constructivist literature that highlights the ambiguity of international
   norms and the relationship between power and strategic rhetorical
   action. It argues that complex regimes create space for agency and
   strategic action by states and highlights one specific strategy - norm
   shopping - that rising powers can use to legitimate their actions and
   challenge dominant norms in complex regimes.},

Title = {Do exemptions undermine environmental policy support? An experimental
   stress test on the odd-even road space rationing policy in India},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Policies sometimes exempt particular categories of regulatees for
   reasons of equity and political feasibility. Will the non-exempt oppose
   the policy because they shoulder all of the policy costs? We outline an
   analytic framework for ``stress testing{''} public support among the
   non-exempt when they are provided negative information about exemptions
   and reduced policy effectiveness. Empirically, we study public support
   for the odd-even road space rationing policy in India. Using a survey
   experiment with 2,182 car owners in Bangalore, we find considerable
   baseline support for this policy. While support among the non-exempt
   erodes when they are told about exemptions, there is no additional
   erosion when they are told that exemptions reduce policy effectiveness.
   This suggests that the perception of fairness, not policy efficacy,
   drives the erosion of support among the non-exempt. Yet the policy
   survives the stress test because the majority of respondents continue to
   support it, in spite of support erosion among the non-exempt.},

Abstract = {From the mid-1960s, Brazilian and European activists collaborated to
   raise awareness about human rights violations in Brazil, which at the
   time was under an authoritarian military regime. From reports on
   torture, to week-long conferences, cultural events, boycotts, petitions
   and protests, a wide range of activities contributed to the emerging
   transnational human rights movement. For the most part, activists
   focused on the themes of political repression, torture, inequality and
   development. However, at some point during the dictatorship, the
   discourse of Brazilians-and, by association, of their solidarity
   networks-began to address the indigenous question, raising indigenous
   peoples' struggles as a matter of human rights, as valid as any other,
   and contributing to their salience within the domains of international
   human rights organizations and institutions. Given the Brazilian Left's
   failures to cohesively mobilize for indigenous rights thus far, this
   change in discourse is deserving of further attention. In this article,
   I address the emergence of indigenous rights within the Western European
   network of solidarity movements comprising resistance to Brazil's
   military regime. These debates, as components of the transnational human
   rights movement of the 1970s, can be used to better understand the
   behaviour of Brazil's Left in this international setting, as well as the
   wider movement itself. Furthermore, it will be shown that indigenous
   rights were portrayed through the conceptual framework of `Latin
   American Theory', as opposed to more commonly cited concepts of minority
   rights or multicultural citizenship.},

Abstract = {Although women and men enjoy formally equal political rights in today's
   democracies, there are ongoing gaps in the extent to which they make use
   of these rights, with women underrepresented in many political
   practices. The gender gap in democratic participation is problematic
   because gendered asymmetries in participation entail collective outcomes
   that are less attentive to women's needs, interests, and preferences.
   Existing studies consider gender gaps in voting behavior and in certain
   forms of nonelectoral politics such as boycotting, signings a petition,
   or joining a protest. However, almost no work considers gendered
   variation in discursive politics. Do women participate in small,
   face-to-face political discussion groups at the same rate as men? And
   does gender intersect with other identities-such as ethnicity-to impact
   attendance at political discussion groups? I use data from the Canadian
   Election Study 2015 Web Survey to answer these questions. I find that
   women are significantly less likely to attend small-group discussions
   than men and that ethnicity intersects with gender in some important
   ways. However, I find no evidence that other social attributes-poverty
   or the presence of young children in the home-suppress women's
   participation in political discussion groups more than men's.},

Abstract = {This article examines the discourse-technical means through which
   illiberal political logics are legitimised in constructions of
   xenophobic populism by a `prominent' Norwegian extremeright
   organisation, Human Rights Service (HRS). I argue that recent HRS
   publications featuring six secretly shot photos of Muslims in the
   Norwegian public sphere engender a moral economy of exclusion in which
   Muslims consistently are produced as an anonymous yet ubiquitously
   present threat to liberal democratic and human rights values. Within
   this framework, micro-humiliating performances against the `Muslim
   other' are constituted and encouraged as a necessary, morally justified
   defence of democratic virtues to ensure the existence of a vulnerable
   majority self. I claim that the HRS circulation of constructions of
   faceless, yet easily recognisable, categories of designated `enemy
   others' as a threat to the liberal democratic ethos can ultimately be
   understood as a hegemonic intervention to push anti-Muslim illiberalism
   from the fringes towards the dominant cultural outlook.
   He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a
   monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze
   into thee. (Nietzsche, 1989{[}1886]: 157)},

Abstract = {Konrad Adenauer's government in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
   engaged in a large-scale media campaign to create political consent for
   the FRG's integration into the West, a policy that rested to a large
   extent on rearmament and entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization. To counter public criticism of rearmament, the West German
   authorities used Mobilwerbung, a company that maintained a fleet of
   mobile film screening vans. Clandestinely financed by the government,
   Mobilwerbung brought government-commissioned films and political
   speakers into the FRG's remotest areas. Based on archival records on
   deployments in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, this article
   traces Mobilwerbung's role as a government unit that reacted dynamically
   to competing events. Through highly detailed reporting on audience
   reactions, Mobilwerbung served both as a public relations vehicle to
   foster consent and as an analytical tool that allowed the mapping of
   public sentiment regarding rearmament.},

Abstract = {Gender bias in political discourse has been demonstrated in many
   settings, including the US Supreme Court. We investigate the effects of
   ideology and gender in verbal interactions during Supreme Court oral
   arguments. We theorize that all justices possess unconscious gender
   schemas that lead them to speak more during presentations by women but
   that liberal and female justices likely have conscious egalitarian
   values that diminish the manifestation of gender schemas. We find that
   conservative justices speak more when female lawyers are arguing but
   that liberal justices show no such effect, suggesting that consciously
   held attitudes can mitigate the expression of unconscious gender
   schemas.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the notion of governed interdependence to examine
   the knowledge practices that have underpinned the expansion of debt
   capital markets in Southeast Asia, with a focus on Indonesia and
   Malaysia. It identifies two types of communities of practice - one of
   planners/policymakers, one of market practitioners - as central to the
   production of capital market knowledge and traces the emphasis placed on
   them by state actors through consecutive capital market development
   plans. The article then moves on to examining how both countries have
   sought to implement regimes for the training and licensing of capital
   market professionals in the wake of the financial crisis of the late
   1990s. It argues that these knowledge practices bestow capital markets
   with legitimacy which makes the practices of investing in and borrowing
   from debt capital markets socially acceptable, if not even a key
   developmental objective. This is in the context of both the Asian crisis
   and more recent crises repeatedly showing the dangers of speculative
   portfolio investment as well as Islamic stipulations against speculative
   finance in these two Muslim-majority countries.},

Abstract = {Both the discipline of strategic intelligence at the governmental level
   and the competitive intelligence discipline constitute accepted methods
   of supporting decision in order to avert mistakes and prevent strategic
   surprise. So far, research has focused on national intelligence and
   intelligence in business separately however, it is possible to use
   experience accumulated in the business field to improve intelligence
   practice in national security and vice versa . The central innovation of
   this article is that mutual learning can be utilized in the context of a
   model that makes a distinction between a `concentrated surprise' and a
   `diffused surprise' to provide a breakthrough in the intelligence field
   for better prediction of the development of surprises.},

Abstract = {The article explores the potential of theatre art in transitional
   justice, particularly in the field of reconciliation and healing.
   Presenting the context of reconciliation in Nepal 10 years after the end
   of the armed conflict, the authors argue for complementary processes of
   top-down and community-based, bottom-up approaches by introducing the
   concept of `theatre-facilitated dialogue' as a way to strategically
   integrate Playback Theatre in peacebuilding. Analyzing the project
   `EnActing Dialogue,' the article elaborates on the learnings from
   theatre-facilitated dialogue work in communities where ex-combatants of
   the Nepali People's Liberation Army have settled. Based on the
   theoretical overview of secondary resources, the authors' participatory
   observations, on informal interviews and quantitative data, the study
   explores how artistically enacted storytelling supports bottom-up
   reconciliation. By staging a noncognitive dialogue through storytelling,
   music and theatre, Playback Theatre contributes to the deconstruction of
   war-related identities, an understanding of root causes, as well as
   personal healing and relationship building at community level.},

Abstract = {Several recent crises and the increasing populism and Euroscepticism
   across member states have intensified debates on the nature of the EU.
   While researchers have looked to US federal experience and theory, a
   bias remains towards the federalism of the Federalists and `Madisonian'
   lessons for the EU. In contrast, we argue that the federalism of the
   Antifederalists provides an alternative, more appropriate frame for
   assessing the EU's federal challenges. First, we revisited their
   political thought on democratic federalism and their opposition to the
   US Constitution. We derived three basic lines of federal-democratic
   critique of the power of elites, and losses to state sovereignty and to
   democracy and popular control. Subsequently, we transferred them to the
   EU to analyse the corresponding challenges. Finally, we drew
   Antifederalist lessons for the EU. They may inform not only research on
   multilevel governments but also the search for a balance between
   governance, integration and popular rule in a compound polity.},

Abstract = {This project transforms international financial statistics into a form
   useful for global political analysis. The authors first theorise four
   distinct faces of a sovereign state's monetary and financial power
   resources: its international Creditor, Network, Currency, and Governance
   Capabilities. Each of these capabilities implies resources that
   incumbent political leaders potentially may employ to persuade, induce,
   or coerce others in pursuit of their larger foreign policy goals. They
   thus provide the means of international financial statecraft. The paper
   next summarises a new dataset, the Global Monetary and Financial
   Profiles of States (GMFPS), which creates measures for each of these
   concepts. Covering 180 countries from 1995-2013, the GMFPS dataset
   reports each state's annual shares of global totals for 25 indicators
   and 5 composites, each corresponding to a national financial
   characteristic that leaders may choose to manipulate politically -
   albeit not without paying some costs, economic and/or political. The
   paper concludes with an initial analysis of global trends, which tend to
   confirm the slow relative decline of the reigning financial hegemon, the
   United States. The data also provide suggestive evidence of a typical
   financial life-cycle for major states, although one that is
   voluntaristic, not inevitable.},

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterised by the fusion of
   physical, digital, and biological technologies, will have profound
   social and economic consequences. But what impact will it have on human
   rights? This article critically interrogates key writings and speeches
   about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which requires reading between
   the lines of technical, business, and policy-orientated materials that
   rarely address human rights explicitly. The findings are a mix of good
   and bad news. First, the traditional linkage between economic
   competition and violations of bodily integrity is weakening as new forms
   of profitability in tomorrow's digital ecosystems require empowered and
   creative individuals. However, these celebratory visions of the
   profitable interpenetration of our bodies, hardware and virtual worlds
   has a dark side. The next-generation of human rights violations arising
   from transnational business activities will be increasingly subtle,
   diffuse, and sophisticated.},

Abstract = {This article draws together existing data and research on the
   organisation and structure of the Myanmar military ('Tatmadaw') and its
   use of sexual violence in military operations. It argues that from this
   data, a pattern emerges of rape-permissive military doctrines being
   employed by the same type of Tatmadaw units across multiple military
   operations, over many decades and sites. Unpacking each aspect of this
   posited pattern reveals an endemic rape culture within the Myanmar
   military that seems to be repeatedly utilised for strategic purposes in
   counter-insurgency operations. Investigating the potential origins of
   this rape-permissive culture, the article argues that Tatmadaw
   recruiting, training and deployment processes cultivate sexual violence
   as a permissible form of violence that is then tolerated by the Tatmadaw
   high command, most likely due to its efficacy in achieving its military
   strategies.},
