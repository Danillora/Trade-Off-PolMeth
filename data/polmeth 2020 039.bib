Title = {Striving for greatness: status aspirations, rhetorical entrapment, and
   domestic reforms},

Abstract = {How do leaders use external events or pressures as political levers to
   facilitate domestic reforms? In this article, we build a theory of
   aspirational politics to address this question. We show that aspirations
   to improve a country's international status can help leaders justify the
   implementation of their preferred domestic policies. For instance, the
   aspiration of wanting to join prestigious international organizations or
   agreements creates focal narratives that reformers can use to highlight
   the need to catch up and rhetorically constrain domestic actors who
   oppose reforms. We illustrate this mechanism through the Chinese
   leaders' counterintuitively positive statements towards the
   Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from 2013 to 2016. By framing the TPP as
   an aspiration through which China can enhance its international status,
   Chinese leaders were able to justify domestic economic reforms. Unlike
   conventional explanations, this was done without the onset of crises or
   actually signing the TPP. We substantiate this claim using evidence from
   computer-assisted text analysis of Chinese news coverage of the TPP from
   2008-2018 (N = 10189) and process-tracing of the establishment of the
   Shanghai Free Trade Zone.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the (de)gendering of child benefits in Canadian
   print media, using an automated analysis of coverage of two governments'
   child benefits policies. The analysis finds that gender and women's
   equality are deprioritized in the framing of the policies' beneficiaries
   and goals, even when the party in power shifts from the right wing of
   the spectrum to center-left. There is some variation in coverage across
   newspapers and across journalists. Notably, women journalists' coverage
   of child benefits policies is more attentive to gender and women's
   equality, suggesting that they may serve as agents of change in bringing
   gender back into the national conversation.},

Title = {Why Political Appointments to Truth Commissions Cause Difficulties for
   these Institutions: Using the Crisis in the Transitional Justice Process
   in Nepal to Understand How Matters of Legitimacy and Credibility
   Undermine Such Commissions},

Abstract = {Over five decades and with dozens of examples of truth commissions to
   look back on, an undeniable aspect of their legacy is that the world has
   become far more focused on dealing with the past and uncovering the
   truth about past atrocities. While there is typically a focus in the
   literature on the more widely publicized and famous truth commissions,
   scores of other processes have taken place, especially since the 1990s.
   Post-conflict or divided societies have designed institutions in ways
   that achieve specific objectives but at the same time conform to
   international standards, creating a reputation of being both democratic
   and accountable. Using the prism of Nepal, this article examines why the
   process to establish transitional justice mechanisms, and specifically
   truth commissions, needs to be legitimate and credible for them to be
   effective and be impactful. It specifically examines issues relating to
   appointments to such institutions and why such appointments need to be
   done independently and not overtly politically. It scrutinizes why
   appointment mechanisms and processes are so important to enhancing the
   legitimacy and independence of such bodies. The case of Nepal is used as
   an example to extrapolate conclusions about the problems that affected
   its processes, and the various crises that have emerged in those
   processes. The article argues that commissioners ought to be chosen on
   the basis of their impartiality, moral integrity, and known commitment
   to human rights and disclosure of the truth. This is essential to ensure
   that the process is seen to be independent and credible.},

Abstract = {This article compares resistance movements along the western borderlands
   of the Soviet Union between 1944 and 1952. Despite similar levels of
   state repression and local grievances, Moldova's opposition movement did
   not escalate to the level of civil war, whereas civil wars emerged
   across the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine. Through theory
   development and testing, the article compares Lithuania and Moldova,
   identifying the role of previous regime behaviour, the speed of Soviet
   takeover, and the availability of safe havens within Moldova and
   Lithuania as the key causal factors explaining the difference.},

Abstract = {The CIA is a popular topic of study for intelligence historians.
   Renowned for covert action and human intelligence operations, we know a
   lot about how they became woven into the tapestry of world history. More
   recently, scientific and technical intelligence emerged as a central
   theme, uncovering the work of the `Wizards of Langley'. This article
   suggests we still have much to leam. Exploring CIA's historic interest
   in communications intelligence, it uncovers ways they controlled a
   significant proportion of the world's communications systems. Working
   internationally, and disagreeing with NSA, the CIA influenced important
   systems well into the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {The emergence of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) is increasingly in the
   academic and public focus. Research largely focuses on the legal and
   ethical implications of AWS as a new weapons category set to
   revolutionize the use of force. However, the debate on AWS neglects the
   question of what introducing these weapons systems could mean for how
   decisions are made. Pursuing this from a theoretical-conceptual
   perspective, the article critically analyzes what impact AWS can have on
   norms as standards of appropriate action. The article draws on the
   Foucauldian ``apparatus of security{''} to develop a concept that
   accommodates the role of security technologies for the conceptualization
   of norms guiding the use of force. It discusses to what extent a
   technologically mediated construction of a normal reality emerges in the
   interplay of machinic and human agency and how this leads to the
   development of norms. The article argues that AWS provide a specific
   construction of reality in their operation and thereby define procedural
   norms that tend to replace the deliberative, normative-political
   decision on when, how, and why to use force. The article is a
   theoretical-conceptual contribution to the question of why AWS matter
   and why we should further consider the implications of new arrangements
   of human-machine interactions in IR.},

Abstract = {There is an established tradition in social movement research to study
   protests through event datasets constructed from newspaper data.
   However, studies evaluating the magnitude of bias in newspaper reporting
   on protests have been largely confined to Western Europe and North
   America and have predominantly focused on time-invariant bias. I extend
   the past scholarship by analyzing the bias in online newspapers' reports
   on protest events in Ukraine prior to and following the Maidan protests,
   focusing on issue attention cycles. I find that the number of mentions
   per protest event in the national media dropped after Maidan, while the
   coverage of ideological protests increased, indicating an issue
   attention cycle. The regional sources displayed less bias; however, they
   over-reported protests against separatism and Russian intervention. This
   presents researchers with a trade-off between using selective national
   outlets which adhere more to journalism standards and less selective
   regional outlets featuring more unpredictable patterns of bias.},

Abstract = {England's National Health Service, the fifth largest employer in the
   world, has become heavily influenced by expert authority and the market
   economy, which has had implications for accountability and the
   receptiveness of health decisions to stakeholder needs. One response has
   been the introduction of a range of regulatory provisions designed to
   facilitate effective governance and stakeholder engagement. These
   provisions are scrutinized using three conceptual devices: core
   accountability, social reporting and social learning. These devices have
   significant implications, as they enable technical experts to form
   closed communities, communicate among themselves mainly about economic
   and financial matters, and make decisions that aid the market without
   meaningful recourse to citizens. While technical experts are necessary
   to help manage complex areas, current arrangements reinforce an existing
   gap between economic and democratic values through hardened technocratic
   approaches to health care governance.},

   United Nations mediation narratives},

Abstract = {This article was selected as the runner-up for the 2018 Enloe Award. The
   committee commented: ``This article provides a solid and nuanced account
   of UN mediation processes around the WPS agenda, drawing on Annick
   Wibben's narrative approach to document how the notion that mediation is
   a science rather than an art leaves little room for complexity. It is a
   very well-researched piece with a clear, polished, and coherent
   argument.{''} ``The article's meticulous engagement with a bureaucratic
   procedure reminds the reader of its life-and-death consequences, all the
   while providing a sophisticated and solid gender analysis. It is also
   important for revealing the complexities - how masculine-feminine
   assumptions and expectations work, or that one method is not necessarily
   better than another for gender inclusiveness. The author's conclusion is
   a generative one: it recognizes the need to explore the question in
   other settings and points to a future research agenda.{''} ABSTRACT The
   Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda has not yet had a large or
   lasting impact on United Nations (UN)-brokered peace processes. I argue
   that we can understand the challenges to incorporating the WPS agenda by
   examining the changes that UN mediation has undergone in the post-Cold
   War era. UN mediation has moved from being seen as a diplomatic art to
   being seen as a professionalized science. Narratives about mediation as
   an ``art{''} or as a ``science{''} have distinct implications for how
   the UN has incorporated the WPS agenda in mediation. To examine these
   narratives, I adopt Wibben's feminist narrative approach. I analyze
   texts including UN guidance documents on mediation, notes from
   participant observation of training sessions on mediation and gender,
   and 37 interviews with UN mediation personnel. I find that the narrative
   of mediation as a science constructs a linear process with little room
   for complexity. In doing so, it depoliticizes gender relations and
   constrains the participation of women. The narrative of mediation as an
   art privileges experience, consent, and trusting relationships.
   Including women and gender issues appears risky because it endangers
   consent. Meanwhile, building trust may rely upon excluding certain
   groups of people. These findings contribute to our understanding of how
   institutional contexts affect the implementation of the WPS agenda.},

Abstract = {Relatives of the disappeared during the last civic-military dictatorship
   in Argentina who were able to recover the human remains of their family
   members through the work of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team
   (Equipo Argentino de Antropologi ` a Forense, or EAAF), painted a mural
   in March 2014. `The Disappeared Are Appearing' is a collaborative and
   community-based mural project designed, rendered and completed by the
   relatives of victims of state terror in Argentina. The participating
   family members of the disappeared had recovered the human remains of
   their beloved relatives through the tenacious and constant work of the
   EAAF, a nongovernmental, not-for-profit, scientific organization. It was
   established in 1984 to investigate the cases of at least 9,000
   disappeared people in Argentina under the military government that ruled
   from 1976 to 1983.},

   Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - also known as the

Abstract = {In this study, we use postcolonial and migration literature to discuss
   the differences in the labor market participation of the local-born and
   migrant youth populations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a British colony
   until it was returned to China in 1997. Drawing on the 1996, 2006, and
   2016 Hong Kong Census data, we use the ``double cohort{''} method to
   compare how the birth and migration cohorts are related to the patterns
   of unemployment in Hong Kong. We find that the birth and migration
   cohorts are independently related to the unemployment rate, that they
   strongly interact with the likelihood of youth unemployment, and that
   migrant youths have benefited from the postcolonial environment and have
   lower rates of unemployment. Specifically, those who are younger and who
   arrived in Hong Kong after 1997 are less likely to be unemployed than
   those who are older and resided in Hong Kong before 1997.},

   of the European Union (EU) legal framework for the posting of workers.
   This article uses an original case study of workers posted from Serbia
   via Hungary to Slovakia as a basis on which to assess the practical
   impact of this latest Directive. We recognize the capacity for EU Member
   States to do more to protect posted workers than was possible
   previously. However, we also note significant regulatory omissions
   relating, in particular, to the manufactured uncertainty of employment
   and immigration status, limited supply chain regulation and obstacles to
   trade union representation. We identify the need to address in greater
   detail the complex operations of transnational temporary work agencies
   involving third country nationals which can produce legal uncertainty
   and foster unfree labour relations.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how the exploitation of tenants in Spain is boosting
   income for banks, hedge funds and pension funds. It does so by tracing
   the origins of the money invested in a Tres Cantos housing project in
   Madrid. The paper makes the following claims: First, the exploitation
   taking place in households -referred in this paper as secondary- is
   increasingly related to worker exploitation, and thus this particular
   type of exploitation is increasingly relevant to the dynamics of capital
   accumulation. Second, the key role of secondary exploitation of tenants
   in the revenue-making strategies of pension funds, hedge funds and banks
   is augmented and mediated by a myriad of regulations being implemented
   at the national and supranational scales. Theoretically, the paper
   contests the Marxian claim that household exploitation is `secondary' to
   the exploitation taking place in the production process.},

Abstract = {Despite that independent agencies are typically justified in terms of
   technical efficiency, they inevitably have to make political judgments.
   How can political reasoning be legitimate in such institutions? This
   paper starts by investigating the merits of two prominent models. The
   ``avoidance model{''} asks agency reasoning to stick to empirical facts
   and as far as possible stay clear of political values. By contrast, the
   ``specification model{''} recognizes the need for constructive normative
   work, but confines it to the refinement of given statutes. This paper
   challenges both models and defends a third alternative. The ``public
   reason model{''} requires agencies to ground their value judgments in a
   publicly accessible framework of reasoning, which is here interpreted as
   their overarching mandate. The paper argues that agency mandates should
   be conceived as distinct domains of reasoning, and it delineates three
   institutional virtues that enable agencies to track this domain.},

Abstract = {Two years since the arsa attacks and the military's clearing operations
   in Rakhine, violence and continuing atrocities are being committed by
   the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) against the Rohingya and Arakanese civilians
   in Myanmar. This article examines the developments since August 2017 and
   the continuing failure of the international community to adequately
   respond to human rights violations and humanitarian needs of
   conflict-affected communities inside and outside of Myanmar. The article
   argues that despite the strong international outrage against the
   Tatmadaw's atrocities, the international community's failure to act
   springs from three main factors. First, the United Nations remains
   divided in response to the crisis as a result of ongoing systemic and
   structural deficiencies. Second, there is a lack of political will on
   the part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to
   collectively impose sanctions against an erring member. Finally, the
   ongoing full autonomy of the Tatmadaw to operate above the law and
   remain unaccountable for continuing atrocities in the country. Their
   autonomy is facilitated by a precarious democratic transition led by
   Aung San Suu Kyi who appears more concerned about domestic repercussions
   of giving in to international pressure than about her tarnished
   reputation as a human rights defender. This article details the ongoing
   humanitarian needs of affected communities within and outside the
   country.},

Title = {Reconciling State's Sovereignty with Global Norms: Indonesia's Quiet
   Diplomacy in Myanmar and the Feasibility of the Implementation of
   Responsibility to Protect (R2P) in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In spite of optimistic views on the feasibility of the R2P
   operationalisation in Southeast Asia, reconciling global norms with
   regional principles is not an easy task given the cult of sovereignty
   that inhibits socialisation and implementation of R2P. Using the case
   study of Indonesia's foreign policy implementation in Myanmar, this
   article demonstrates that asean's (Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations) non-interference principle does not necessarily negate R2P
   norms. Indonesia's approach in Myanmar reflects Pillar 2 of R2P which
   underlines the importance of equal sovereignty and the greater role of
   trusted partners. Indonesia's preference to quiet diplomacy instead of
   naming and shaming or utilising sanctions is an effective way to open
   Myanmar's resistance. At the same time, the pledge of Indonesia's
   humanitarian aid to Rohingya refugees represents alternative instruments
   of Pillar3 aside from the use of force. This -argument implies that
   intervention does not always require coercion against authoritarian
   regimes, as employed by the West for decades.},

Abstract = {Traditional gender roles, gendered political institutions and resource
   inequities disincentivise women's participation in formal politics. This
   article analyses the Brazilian case - where women comprise 9.2 per cent
   of federal legislators elected since 1994 - to illustrate the centrality
   of resources in shaping candidate emergence. I examine how
   entrepreneurial elections, which incentivise intro-party competition and
   expensive campaigns, have sustained white men's dominance in Brazilian
   political institutions and deterred white and Afro-Brazilian women's
   political ambition. Using the latest data on campaign finance in
   Brazilian legislative elections, I explain how recent campaign finance
   reforms and a series of injustices provoking women's emotive power
   yielded important resources catalysing the candidacies of women,
   especially Black women. The findings suggest that defraying campaign
   costs offers a potent mechanism for levelling the playing field, and
   remind us that women's political ambition is shaped by their
   `relationally embedded' risk assessment, constrained in no small part by
   the masculinised ethos of party politics.},

Abstract = {The European Equality Law Network (EELN) was founded in 2014. It
   resulted from the merger of two gender equality and non-discrimination
   expert groups. The creation of the EELN may appear as a simple decision
   made to rationalize the landscape of EU expert groups. The objective of
   this article is to show that this merger indicates there have been
   important transformations in the role of expert groups and legal
   expertise in the field of EU equality policy. This seemingly small
   decision participates in a larger process of change. The legal experts
   and the Commission are no longer partners who are developing equality
   policy together: members of the EELN are seen merely as service
   providers. The article isolates three main explanations for this: the
   roles of the policy sector, the regulatory and enforcement politics of
   the Commission and policy instruments in the framework of the
   Commission's managerial turn during the 2010s.},

Abstract = {The relationship between inequality and financial instability has become
   a thriving topic of research in heterodox political economy. This
   article offers the first critical engagement with one framework within
   this wider literature: the Capital as Power (CasP) model of the stock
   market developed by Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan. Specifically,
   we extend the CasP model to other advanced capitalist countries,
   including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Our findings
   affirm the core prediction of the CasP model, showing that unequal power
   relations reliably predict future stock market performance. Yet when it
   comes to the CasP model's explanation of why power relations predict
   stock market returns, our findings are more ambiguous. We find little
   empirical support for the claims that capitalist power is dialectically
   intertwined with systemic fear, and that systemic fear and capitalised
   power are mediated through strategic sabotage. The main lesson of our
   analysis is that any model of the stock market must be attentive to the
   geographical unevenness and continued national diversity in capitalist
   development.},

Abstract = {With the progressive establishment of protected areas for conservation
   and communal indigenous land, market economy has been regulated in the
   Peruvian Amazon. Interlinked networks and institutions situate the
   agency of institutional entrepreneurs championing forest protection and
   indigenous peoples' rights over territory and resources. This paper
   shows how a critical integration of new institutionalisms in the social
   sciences provides a suitable theory frame to study the process of
   protectionist institutional change as envisioned by Karl Polanyi. The
   cumulative result of socially-embedded state activism -that is,
   regulatory activism that is embedded in society- is an institutional
   regime that strengthens the resources and capabilities of
   conservationist groups and Amazonian indigenous peoples' organisations
   as collective constructs while facing the social forces of
   commodification.},

Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical explanation for the timing of change
   in international institutions. It provides a rational choice response to
   key insights of historical institutionalist scholarship. Many existing
   theories-such as rational choice and sociological
   institutionalisms-explain the timing of change mainly by listing its
   causes. An analysis of the timing of change in many realms of
   institutional activity, however, demonstrates that incentives to alter
   institutions frequently accumulate, unaddressed for extended periods of
   time. The result is persistent institutional suboptimality, punctuated
   intermittently by phases of transformation. To account for divergence
   from the expectations of existing theories, I test two hypotheses
   concerning the role of transaction costs and temporal coordination
   dilemmas in hindering change. Introducing the concept of Temporal Focal
   Points, the article explains why temporal landmarks, such as
   international crises and prominent anniversaries, are frequently
   associated with non-linear, transformative change. To assess the
   explanatory potential of this framework, I analyze the record of change
   in United Nations environmental institutions. The case study supports
   the hypotheses advanced, leading to the conclusion that the when of
   institutional change can tell us a lot about the why of change.},

Abstract = {Do states with more guns have higher rates of fatal police shootings?
   This article uses a validated measure of firearm availability (the
   percentage of suicides committed with a firearm) to examine the
   relationship between gun proliferation and fatal police shootings. It
   expands on existing research to include (1) measures of access to Level
   I and II trauma centers, (2) interpretation of the findings from the
   lenses of ``statistical prediction,{''} and (3) tests for structural
   differences between models for black decedents versus nonblack
   decedents. Findings confirm the correlation between statewide prevalence
   of gun ownership and fatal police shootings for both all decedents and
   unarmed decedents. It provides partial support for ``statistical
   prediction{''} by police and finds that greater access to trauma centers
   is associated with lower rates of citizen deaths. The analysis suggests
   a far broader range of policy options for saving lives, such as better
   enforcement of legal restrictions on firearm possession, than focusing
   solely on policing systems.},

Title = {ANTI-COMMUNISM IN TURKISH EDUCATION AND CHILDHOOD IN THE 1950S},
Booktitle = {FACES OF REPUBLICAN TURKEY: Beyond the Modernization Hypothesis},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {101-127},
Abstract = {The roots of anti-communism and conservative family ideology are
   well-founded aspects of national education in Turkey as a reflection of
   the country's joining the U.S-led Western bloc during the Cold War and
   the ideological as well as educational policies of the bloc at the end
   of the 1940s. When the Democrat Party (DP) came to power in Turkey in
   1950, it pursued a program that synthesizes capitalist development,
   liberal economic rights and conservative values. In a context where
   anti-Communism became the state's official policy, the increasing role
   of religion in education and the tightening control in schools appeased
   the political and ideological concerns of the DP government. Looking at
   these measures was crucial not only to understand the major changes that
   took place in the Turkish education system but also to analyze the
   social and political dynamics of the entire period. This article aims to
   find answers to the following questions: ``How did Turkey's childhood
   policy evolve in the 1950s? Which ideological values and tools were used
   effectively in this process?{''} What were the differences and
   similarities between the U.S educational policies and the practices of
   the Turkish government with regards to education? In order to answer
   these questions, we will ponder the role of anti-Communism in education
   together with the role of experts from America in designing the
   education system in Turkey. Subjects such as religious education,
   schooling, educational institutions, and anti-Communism that played a
   role in the political construction of childhood will be analyzed.
   Debates in the Turkish parliament, comments in newspapers, and journals
   such as Yeni Okul, Forum, and Ilk Ogretim (New School, Forum and Primary
   Education), published for educators, are the main sources used in this
   research.},

Abstract = {This article tests functional and institutional explanations for the
   different levels of formal independence of regulatory agencies in Latin
   America. The analysis is grounded in an original database of the formal
   independence level of 104 regulators in 8 countries and 13 regulatory
   sectors. The results challenge a central claim of the credible
   commitment hypothesis as they indicate that privatization is not a
   significant determinant of agency independence nor are utility
   regulators more likely to be independent than other economic regulators.
   Veto players are positively correlated with formal independence,
   indicating that in developing countries they operate together as
   credibility-enhancing mechanisms, rather than as functional equivalents,
   as previous studies on developed countries have shown. Democratization
   is positively correlated with formal independence, whereas trade opening
   and vulnerability to international pressures has no significant impact.
   Hence, this article enhances the understanding of the delegation of
   regulatory powers to formally independent agencies in developing
   countries.},

Title = {Violence within Politics: The Classical View},
Booktitle = {POLITICS WITHOUT VIOLENCE?: TOWARDS A POST-WEBERIAN ENLIGHTENMENT},
Series = {Rethinking Political Violence},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {19-37},
Abstract = {The four opening chapters of this book concentrate on the meanings of
   violence within theories of politics (violence within politics) and on
   violence as a phenomenon with its own distinctions (violence without
   politics). This chapter explores the way classical political theory has
   constructed our understanding of politics, the political and the State
   as a response to its assumption of ontological human violence.
   Influenced by classical political theory, many political scientists
   continue to emphasize the centrality of disorder and violence to the way
   politics and institutions of governance are constructed. However, there
   is little discussion of violence as a problematic in its own right,
   contingently employed and requiring attention to its own distinctions.
   Political science is highly selective in terms of the violence(s) it
   considers matter to politics. Despite some important differences amongst
   classical theorists, fear of an ontological predisposition to violent
   competition continues to underpin much of our understanding of politics,
   the political and the State. There is little agreement, however, on
   whether it is human `passions' or human `evil' that drive violence. The
   difference matters. It is time, this chapter argues, to revisit the
   understandings of violence which appear to shape our systems of
   government and to justify the nature of our politics.},

Abstract = {Voluntary programs have rapidly become a means for the public, private,
   and third sectors to regulate and govern complex societal problems.
   Following the rapid and widespread emergence of these programs, scholars
   have been active in mapping, exploring, and interrogating their design
   and performance. Considerable advances have been made in describing
   program design and context conditions, and the actors involved in the
   voluntary program that relate to program performance. Less is known,
   however, about how these conditions affect program performance. Starting
   with one of the dominant theories on voluntary programs, the club theory
   perspective, this article seeks to understand how different program
   design conditions interact to affect the performance of 26 voluntary
   programs for low carbon building and city development in Australia, the
   Netherlands, and the United States. Applying qualitative comparative
   analysis, the study finds that the club theory perspective has limited
   explanatory power for this specific set of cases. Iterative rounds of
   analysis indicate that a diffusion network perspective is the best
   complementary perspective for explaining the performance of this set of
   programs. The article concludes that, in situations of a non-homogeneous
   market of voluntary program participants, a focus on the programs'
   diffusion networks helps to explain their performance. This has
   implications for the design and implementation of such programs.},

Abstract = {Removing so-called technical barriers to trade is a critical aspect of
   contemporary deep integration trade agreements. Yet, these barriers -
   standards, regulations, conformity assessment procedures - form a set of
   institutional complementarities, named technical infrastructure, which
   performs a central role for the functioning of integrated markets.
   Drawing on evidence from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) the paper illustrates that this contradiction reduced
   the negotiators' bargaining leeway. Changing a technical infrastructure
   comes at the risk of undermining its effectiveness. Therefore, each
   party could only offer an unacceptable compromise: Transforming the
   other's technical infrastructure towards one's own technical
   infrastructure.},

Abstract = {The development of Intelligence Studies has provided new and exciting
   insights into war, societies, ideologies, institutions, and even
   cultures and mindsets, even if the geographical reach of these studies
   has been largely limited to the West. One area that remains under- 10
   studied in general is that of insurgent intelligence, thereby
   underplaying the significance of a factor that can be pivotal in any
   armed conflict. This is particularly the case with regard to Africa. We
   still know very little about the role of insurgent intelligence
   apparatuses in this region, much less their perceptions 15 and mental
   models of the world at large. This article seeks to address this
   situation by providing a case study of the Sudan People's Liberation
   Army (SPLA). It draws on John Gentry's framework for analysing non-state
   actor intelligence to set out the characteristics of the SPLA as an
   intelligence actor and to better understand its 20 trajectory.},

Title = {Reevaluating the `externals' and `internals' of the 2007 Iran nuclear
   NIE},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the November 2007 Iran Nuclear NIE in light of the
   intense public criticism it received. It assesses the reaction to the
   NIE's ``externals{''} (factors unrelated to their substantive content).
   Then it evaluates the NIE's ``internals{''} (their substantive content)
   in terms of the data available to the U.S. at the time of the NIE, the
   impact of subsequent data on Iran's nuclear activities up to 2007, and
   the accuracy of NIE estimates of the future beyond 2007. Its main
   findings are: (1) NIE assessments of the past and present were extremely
   well-founded given the data available to the U.S. at the time. (2) Much
   of the data reported after the NIE's publication on Iran's pre-2007
   activities confirmed NIE assessments. (3) The areas where post-NIE data
   most challenged those assessments had been flagged as areas of
   uncertainty; although that data can reasonably be interpreted to be
   conclude that Iran resumed its nuclear weapons program, the very
   substantial activities halted in 2003 and the very limited contributions
   of post-2003 activities are more consistent with the NIE judgment that
   the program remained halted and Iran was keeping its options open to
   resume the program in the future. (4) The NIE's judgments of the future
   beyond 2007 seem to have held up very well. (5) The accusations made
   about the role of three former State Department officials, the alleged
   fabrication and manipulation of intelligence, and the putative skewing
   of the NIE to thwart U.S. policy were all egregiously false.},

Volume = {59},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although there has been much interest in British public opinion on
   Brexit, much less is known about how EU-27 Europeans view the Brexit
   negotiations. This is surprising, because Brexit confronts the EU-27
   with difficult choices. Whereas accommodating the UK carries the risk of
   encouraging further countriesto leave the EU, an uncompromising
   negotiation stance increases the economic and social costs of Brexit.
   Using original survey data from 39,000 respondents in all EU-27
   countries collected between the start of the Brexit negotiations and
   December 2018, this article shows that exposure to the economic risks of
   Brexit makes respondents more willing to accommodate the UK, whereas a
   positive opinion of the EU decreases their willingness to compromise.
   Moreover, many Europeans face an accommodation dilemma that moderates
   these preferences. Overall, the EU-27 public unsentimentally supports a
   Brexit negotiation line that safeguards their own interests best.},

Abstract = {The EU's external promotion of norms and the idea of normative power
   Europe itself are increasingly contested, which is especially true in
   the EU's southern neighbourhood. However, whereas scholars of EU foreign
   policy acknowledge the contestation of external norms, they find it
   difficult to understand why other normative frameworks could be equally
   or more appealing to Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries,
   as they entail norms that are less prominent in the Western catalogue of
   liberal values. To facilitate the detection and analysis of a wider set
   of norms, we situate them along several continua of norm orientations
   and apply this framework to the EU's southern neighbourhood. EU foreign
   policy scholars can then examine whether different norms overlap or
   compete or are complementary or even incompatible, and the extent to
   which values promoted by European actors are congruent with normative
   frameworks in the MENA region.},

Abstract = {This article explores `time' as a crucial category of analysis shaping
   and shaped by the dynamics of exploitation and social reproduction
   across the global assembly line. Focusing on the Indian garment
   industry, the article develops a feminist political economy of time
   stressing the productive and reproductive temporalities of exploitation,
   which give rise to multiple forms of labour circulation, including early
   exit from industrial work. Then, the study places this early exit under
   the microscope, and analyses the `afterlife' available to women workers
   outside the factory, which often involves a transition back to informal
   occupations. The narrative draws both on extensive knowledge of India's
   garment sweatshops, and on the detailed analysis of twenty life
   histories of women former factory workers in Bengaluru. The
   investigation of the feminist political economy of time of the global
   assembly line developed here suggests the presence of a revolving door
   between industrial and informal work in the lives of the working
   classes. It disproves linear global industrial development narratives
   constructing industrial work as `better work' and contributes to
   feminist IPE debates by illustrating how social reproduction - its
   rhythms, temporalities, and everyday necessities - concretely
   co-constitutes the world of work across the global economy.},

Abstract = {Even before the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic,
   prominent women mayors in the United States enacted proactive and
   innovative policies to prevent local outbreaks and soften the social and
   economic repercussions. Several Black women mayors, in particular, have
   led the way in local pandemic response efforts. This article identifies
   four major features of these and other women mayors' early responses.
   First, women mayors demonstrated proactive leadership even when faced
   with pushback. Second, these mayors advocated for transparent and
   evidence-based decision-making at all levels of government. Third, they
   enacted measures to protect vulnerable communities and reduce
   disparities. Fourth, they actively shared advice on best practices and
   lessons learned, and provided examples for other local leaders to
   follow. The article concludes by situating these responses in the larger
   research on gender and leadership and asks whether these women's actions
   are unique or part of a systematic trend of gendered responses to the
   pandemic.},

Title = {Structuring the Interstitial Space of Global Financing Partnerships for
   Sustainable Development: A Network Analysis},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {765-782},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {In this article, we theorise global financing partnerships as a `space
   between fields' that is generated and structured by the relationships
   between the actors mobilised into partnership boards from different
   fields. We investigate the structuring of the space of partnerships
   through a formal network analysis of a new dataset of 188 board members
   of 10 global financing partnerships across climate change, education,
   health and nutrition. Individual board members are analysed with
   reference to their home organisation and sector, the boards on which
   they serve, and salient issue areas. Centrality and ERGM analyses reveal
   that, in contrast to the policy narrative of inclusive and egalitarian
   partnering, donors (from states, international organisations and private
   sector) are systematically privileged in the structuring of this
   partnership space. We identify network mechanisms through which
   systematic biases in partnership relations perpetuate existing
   hierarchies, and introduce the concept of `relational practices' that
   could counter these mechanisms. Combining a theorisation of partnerships
   as spaces between fields with network concepts provides a distinct
   theoretical basis for elucidating the structuring of partnership spaces
   at the macro-level, through the analysis of individuals' connections at
   the micro-level and inter-organisational ties at the meso-level.},

Abstract = {External policy networks resolve two collective action problems in EU
   external relations: engaging nonstate actors from the EU and its partner
   countries in transnational policymaking and converting this engagement
   to feedback for policymakers. We use formal network analysis to
   understand the relationship between network structure and collective
   action by transnational nonstate actors. Our empirical focus is on the
   Transatlantic Business Council and the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue
   networks, which engage business and consumer advocacy organizations in
   transatlantic economic policymaking. We find that both are highly
   centralized around EU and US government institutions, with relatively
   low, but rising, levels of interaction among nonstate organizations.
   This structure helps increase engagement by giving organizations
   opportunities to interact with government institutions, learn from their
   peers, and, for some, to exercise power. It also helps EU and US
   institutions harness policy feedback, especially from nonstate actors
   that have frequent interactions with their peers.},

Abstract = {In 2020, hatred speech is one of the most frequently stated problems in
   relation to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Gulf States.
   Hatred speech has emerged in the social, political and media realms and
   has provoked racism against foreigners. This hatred is associated with
   increased unemployment among citizens in light of the economic
   transformations in the region. Within the hatred context, foreign
   workers have been framed as the main cause of drained national resources
   during the pandemic and the economic crises facing the Gulf countries.
   The study uses surveys to gain insights into the impacts of economic
   factors on the growing hatred towards expatriate workers with the
   outbreak of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Government efforts toward the prevention, detection, and investigation
   of child abuse and neglect are carried out through the United States'
   child welfare system-a complex web of programs that provide family
   assistance and promote child safety. Most funding for these activities
   is split among federal, state, and local governments and comprises
   specific child welfare-related funding (such as Titles IV-E and IV-B of
   the Social Security Act) and non-child welfare funding that is spent on
   programs that support poor and disadvantaged families (Medicaid and
   TANF). I provide an overview of these funding streams that finance the
   child welfare system, review the federal legislation since 1970 that has
   led to the current funding structure, and end with a discussion of how
   the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 has the potential to
   create better outcomes for children and families by promoting prevention
   activities and program support with strong evidence of success.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The growing interest in customer engagement (CE) has triggered a new
   wave of reforms, particularly in utility regulation. Within the water
   sector, there has been a shift from a focus on cost-reflective pricing
   toward customer-centric pricing processes designed to identify customer
   preferences and expectations. The Victorian water sector in Australia
   offers a unique opportunity to explore the outcomes of these CE trends
   given the recent first-time application of a novel Performance, Risk,
   Engagement, Management, and Outcomes (PREMO) framework. Based on
   in-depth interviews with senior industry representatives from a diverse
   sample of Victorian water utilities, this paper critically analyses the
   scope, design, and incentive mechanisms that underpin the new regulatory
   process. Findings indicate that CE has potentially beneficial aspects to
   both the regulator and the regulated utility, including more
   transparency in capital projects and a better understanding of customer
   preferences in service delivery.},

Abstract = {Despite growing concerns expressed by international organisations about
   the deterioration of democracy in Vucic's Serbia, the country has been
   neglected by the literature on the `crisis of democracy'. Using a
   combined qualitative/quantitative research strategy for detecting
   changes in regime types, including various V-DEM measures and over three
   dozen indicators provided by the competitive authoritarian framework,
   the analysis confirms the recent regression of Vucic's Serbia to
   competitive authoritarianism. The peculiar features of the Serbian
   case-a double transition to and from democracy in less than two
   decades-appear to support a pessimistic outlook for the future of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Why do junctures become critical in some cases but not in others?
   Building on the critical juncture framework and perspectives on the
   formation and diffusion of beliefs, we develop a theoretically
   parsimonious and empirically traceable account of divergence in
   institutional outcomes. By illuminating the role of agency and joint
   belief shifts we further open the ``black box{''} of critical junctures.
   In particular, we develop the argument that the role agents play is
   conditioned by conflict lines that structure an institutional field
   before a juncture sets in. Empirically, we trace political discourses
   around the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Canada, Germany, and Japan
   using discourse network analysis. Through comparative investigation, we
   empirically show that discursive interactions during potential critical
   junctures indicate institutional outcomes that are shaped by causally
   relevant historical legacies.},

Abstract = {Using historical context and brief case studies of hurricane risk
   science, this article illustrates the intimate relationship between the
   insurance industry and scientific researchers largely assumed to be
   external to the industry. This paper argues that the extent to which the
   insurance industry directs, funds, and validates the production and use
   of science for estimating risk is itself a full blown political
   enterprise that functions to prioritize industry interests in views of
   hurricane risk and potentially narrow the broader discussion of disaster
   losses to the single solution of insurance pricing. The situation
   presents what has recently been termed the ``governor's dilemma.{''}
   Regulators face losing control over industry's influence on
   understandings of society's hurricane risk; at the same time, greater
   control over the research effort may stymie advancement in knowledge
   needed for effective risk management.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the domestic drivers of regulatory state formation
   in India and Brazil and its consequences for the global rules governing
   pharmaceutical patents. We first analyze Indian and Brazilian politics
   of regulatory state formation; then, in light of the extent to which the
   two countries have built regulatory capacity and capability in the field
   of patent regulation, we explore whether and how they have been able to
   influence the existing intellectual property regime in health. We look
   into India's Section 3(d) and Brazil's prior consent requirement.
   Whereas India's Section 3(d) regulation has gained international
   regulatory influence by diffusing to other developing countries, the
   same cannot be said for Brazil's prior consent regulation, which has
   been caught by policy-reversals. The transition toward regulatory states
   in emerging countries is a bulky road and does not progress in linear
   ways. However, once regulatory capacity and capability have been
   solidified, domestic policy innovations can become internationally
   influential.},

Abstract = {This paper makes an important and unique contribution to the Special
   Issue by problematizing the neglected role of law in the governance of
   global supply chains and the hidden costs resulting from this neglect.
   In Part I we argue that existing efforts within domestic and
   international law are ineffectual in holding transnational corporations
   accountable along their supply chains. The turn to private transnational
   mechanisms of governance, such as arbitration, is a direct response to
   this governance gap. However, in Part II we criticize international
   investment law and arbitration for their one-sided nature that
   privileges corporations over states and civil society. Adopting a
   critical political economy approach, this paper examines how efforts to
   address corporate social responsibility through international investment
   law and arbitration do not substantively uproot dominant ontologies or
   restructure power relations between corporations, states, and civil
   societies. Instead, we argue that these reforms contain hidden costs to
   transparency, participation, and accountability by empowering private
   transnational governance through arbitration, while further locking-in
   states to the operations of foreign corporations and the dictates of
   transnational capitalism.},

Abstract = {Using discourse analysis, this research explores the representation of
   gender roles and identities in relation to counter-terrorism/countering
   violent extremism in 38 national action plans for the implementation of
   United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) and associated
   United Nations Security Council resolutions. Representations of gender
   in relation to counter-terrorism/countering violent extremism in the
   national action plans that we analyse fix women in subordinate and
   passive subject positions while presuming that men are inherently
   violent and extremist. These findings have implications not only for
   scholarship on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, but also for policy
   practice in this area.},

Abstract = {Most democracies fail to provide equal representation and tend to have
   an overrepresentation of men from the upper class and the majority
   racial or ethnic group. We investigate public support for increasing the
   number of women and indigenous Maori members of parliament (MPs) in the
   New Zealand Parliament, both in general and through specific mechanisms
   such as quotas and reserved seats. We offer three explanations:
   descriptive (group identity), substantive (issue alignment), and
   symbolic (socioeconomic and political equity concerns). Using data from
   the 2014 New Zealand Election Study, we found that shared identity
   (descriptive) matters for all measures of increased representation, but
   especially for Maori respondent support of increased Maori MPs. Support
   for increasing the proportion of Maori MPs is also strongly driven by
   substantive concerns, as measured by support for keeping the Treaty of
   Waitangi in law. Support for increasing the number of women MPs is
   driven most strongly by symbolic concerns (measured as increased
   government social spending and efforts to reduce income differences).
   Overall, respondents favor retaining the current number of reserved
   seats for Maori MP representation, whereas informal efforts (rather than
   quotas) are strongly preferred for increasing the number of women MPs.},

Abstract = {Roma of minority sexual and gender identities experience oppression and
   inequality as Roma and LGBTIQ. Moving past a frame of reference in
   Romani Studies that has often foregrounded ethnicity, this article
   utilises the lived experiences of LGBTIQ Roma in order to explore
   understandings of Romani identities as fluid but nonetheless informed by
   interlocking axes of inequality. Data were generated through participant
   observation, focus groups and interviews with LGBTIQ Roma, and were
   analysed using thematic analysis. Findings reveal that individuals who
   self-identify as Roma also make multiple identifications on other
   grounds, including sex/gender, sexuality, gender identity or class. In
   this article, I argue that reading intersectionality in conjunction with
   queer assemblages - `queer intersectionalities' - benefits queer
   (non-normative) intersectional understandings of Romani identities as
   not anchored in the notion of fixed `groupness' or essentialist
   difference while allowing us to identify and interrogate the inequitable
   workings of asymmetrical hegemonic power relations constitutive of
   binary social norm(ativitie)s.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring indirect
   governance at the global level. However, very little work has considered
   these relationships in the domain of energy. In fragmented global
   governance domains, such as energy, the G20 has frequently been
   identified as an actor capable of steering other actors via indirect
   forms of governance. Yet to date, we do not have answers to key
   questions including, what is the range of actors being enrolled by the
   G20? And what governance functions are these actors enrolled to perform?
   To answer these questions, I utilize a novel database of G20 enrollment
   since 2008, which shows that the G20 enrolls international organizations
   more frequently than any other actor, and that agenda setting is the
   most commonly performed governance function. These data are then matched
   with qualitative interview data to make descriptive inferences about the
   patterns of global energy governance, including the extent of
   fragmentation, the identity of focal actors, and the G20's steering
   role, and how these patterns have changed over time.},

Abstract = {The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda has recently started to gain
   traction in Central Europe, notwithstanding discussion in the region
   about the harms that the so-called ``gender ideology{''} allegedly
   causes. In 2017, the Czech Republic was the first Central European
   country to adopt its National Action Plan (NAP) on WPS. Through
   analyzing the Czech NAP, we explore what kinds of WPS policies can
   emerge in a seemingly hostile institutional environment, where the
   pursuit of gender equality is frequently ridiculed and the WPS agenda
   itself is nicknamed ``wine, women, and song.{''} By combining a feminist
   institutionalist approach with feminist discourse analysis, we uncover
   the interplay of formal and informal institutional practices and
   anti-{''}gender ideology{''} discourses during the creation, adoption,
   implementation, and review of the Czech NAP. We show that, due in part
   to this glocalized backlash against ``gender ideology,{''} the Czech NAP
   has been driven from the top down by a small group of femocrats who tend
   to focus on ``small victories{''} and are careful not to draw too much
   attention to gender-related agendas. The resulting NAP, however, becomes
   a declaratory instrument grounded in gender essentialism, a narrative of
   victimhood, and conventional assumptions about women's roles in peace
   and security.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to contribute to studies of women's human capital and
   fertility in post-Soviet societies. The post-Soviet regions are a
   particularly interesting setting to study this question because they
   have combined traditional family organization and rapid social change in
   recent decades. Based on evidence from Karachay-Cherkessia (Russia), we
   examine whether elements of a woman's human capital can account for her
   fertility behavior in the context of family traditionalism. Our analysis
   is based in a sample survey of women conducted in 2018. Using Poisson
   regressions, we analyze the relation of human capital and family
   traditionalism to the number of children born to women of different
   ages. We conclude that both human capital and cultural family
   traditionalism (the empowerment of elder relatives in a woman's family
   and a woman's observance of religious rituals) appear to be significant
   for fertility decisions, with their effects working in opposite
   directions.},

Abstract = {The essay assesses NATO's reaction to Russia's aggression against
   Ukraine in 2014. Building on a synthesis of recent advances in strategic
   studies and works looking at institutional adaptation of security
   organisations, it presents an analytical framework for assessing
   strategic adaptation based on innovativeness, scope and cohesiveness. It
   takes inspiration from two techniques established in the visual arts and
   music, applying the concepts of pastiche and sampling to the analysis.
   The analysis concludes that, despite some problems and remaining
   challenges, NATO's readjustment to Russian revisionism can be
   characterised as a moderately successful strategic sampling.},

Abstract = {The recent rise of populism has threatened to undermine the stability of
   international economic integration. Using the case of Britain's 2016
   vote to leave the European Union, we challenge prevailing accounts
   explaining populism as political response to neoliberalism's negative
   impact on voters. This conceptualisation does not sufficiently explain
   voter support for populist political actors advocating the further
   entrenchment of neoliberal policymaking. Using a descriptive analysis,
   we develop a constitutive theory explaining how the antagonistic
   `people' vs. `elite' relationship at the core of populism has been
   mobilised by opposing British political actors as a discursive frame to
   generate voter support for their own policies. We show how the Liberal
   Economic Nationalist and Democratic Socialist policy paradigms used the
   2016 referendum to challenge Britain's debt-driven neoliberal growth
   model by framing it as being detrimental to `the people' and benefiting
   `the elite'. Conversely, their respective export-oriented neoliberal
   growth model or socialist policies are framed as resolving these issues
   through their prospective benefits to `the people'. Therefore, we argue
   that focusing on the deployment of the populist frame offers a
   compelling means for the field of International Political Economy to
   conceptualise how global populism emerges to challenge the stability of
   international economic integration.},

Abstract = {Over the past fifteen years since the adoption of the Responsibility to
   Protect, all eyes have been on the UN Security Council and its ability
   to respond to situations at imminent risk of, or experiencing, atrocity
   crimes. To the contrary, little attention has been given to the
   Geneva-based Human Rights Council (hrc) and its procedures and
   mechanisms. This is interesting considering that the hrc has responded
   to emerging and protracted atrocity situations around the world, often
   at times when the Security Council remained silent. hrc response to
   atrocities in Myanmar, Venezuela, and elsewhere highlights the unique
   role it can play in implementing R2P and triggering follow-up action
   outside of Geneva; yet, much remains to be done to overcome both
   institutional and political challenges to fully utilise the hrc's
   potential to uphold our individual and shared responsibility to protect.},

Abstract = {Refugee integration is a complex process, realized differently by
   different groups at different times. This article examines the larger
   global and national context in which decisions about refugees are made
   and illustrates impacts of these decisions at the local level. A close
   look at refugee resettlement in Utica, New York, reveals that positive
   benefits have accrued to the community there over decades. Trump
   administration policies have cut in half the number of refugees arriving
   in that city, but the resultant advocacy for the Utica refugee
   resettlement office led to new income from the State of New York,
   preserving the city's ability to participate in the U.S. Refugee
   Admissions Program now and in the future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {268-275},

Abstract = {In response to the rise of `populism' and the perceived threat to human
   rights that it represents, human rights advocates have argued that NGOs
   must speak to the economic anxieties of majority populations by
   increasing work on economic and social rights. In this essay, I present
   a counter-argument to this proposal, drawing on insights from the
   COVID-19 pandemic and my experiences working at Amnesty International
   and monitoring emergency powers during the pandemic for Covid State
   Watch. I argue that international human rights NGOs should retain a
   focus on civil and political rights for three reasons. The COVID-19
   pandemic has (1) revealed and reinforced the vast repressive power of
   the state and consequent serious risks to civil and political rights in
   the global North and (2) demonstrated that human rights NGOs are often
   alone in challenging restrictions to civil and political rights,
   especially during crises. I further suggest that, in contrast to the
   civil and political rights sphere, (3) human rights NGOs offer little
   `value added' in the field of economic and social rights in the global
   North. I conclude by proposing that human rights serve their most useful
   function when they protect those who few others are willing to defend,
   such as the vector of disease, the terrorist and the criminal.},

Abstract = {The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has attracted many foreign
   fighters from all over the world. ISIS has disseminated voluminous
   propaganda in painting itself as the defender of Islam. The core of ISIS
   messages is designed to have a global religious appeal. At the same
   time, ISIS has incorporated local issues and grievances into its
   propaganda message. The analysis of Georgia's experiences with foreign
   fighters reveals that ISIS has exploited local issues to attract
   recruits, demonstrating that, even though foreign fighter recruitment
   seems global, it inevitably draws on local roots.},

Abstract = {`Factoryless manufacturing' describes the strategic decision by
   businesses to contract out part or all of their production, sometimes
   overseas. Although it has become widespread in some sectors of
   manufacturing, the phenomenon is not captured by existing economic
   statistics. This implies that the decline of manufacturing, often a
   focus of policy, may be overstated, while trade statistics fail to
   reflect globalized production. We present web-scraped evidence on the
   extent of factoryless manufacturing in the UK, finding that firms in
   sectors such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals are much more likely to
   use contract manufacturing, whereas in the US it is more prevalent
   within electronics. We also present case studies highlighting that firms
   can both use and provide contract manufacturing services. The
   limitations of the statistics imply that governments may believe their
   manufacturing sectors to be smaller than is the case and at the same
   time be unaware of the globalized character of much of that
   manufacturing production, adversely affecting their economic policies.},

Abstract = {Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) processes have
   become a standard component of international peace and security
   programming. Yet, in spite of increasing attention to the need for
   gender-sensitive DDR in policy and academic debates, the stereotypical
   ways in which female ex-combatants have traditionally been addressed
   have led to inadequate gendered reintegration policies. This article
   describes the effects of a gender-blind reintegration process on female
   ex-combatants' experiences of long-term social reintegration in
   Guatemala. Social reintegration is a profoundly gendered process, which
   involves the rebuilding of civilian identities, social relationships,
   and trust between social groups. Based on in-depth interviews with
   female ex-combatants, this article describes how the absence of
   gender-sensitive reintegration strategies produced various problems for
   women. They faced difficulties in their emotional and family
   relationships, leading to mental health struggles and even violence, as
   well as persistent stigma which produced anxiety and challenges in the
   labor market. The article concludes with suggestions for making
   reintegration a gender-transformative process, by crossing the
   private-public divide, increasing collective strategies, and better
   aligning with transitional justice processes.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of gender stereotypes in US politics is well documented,
   yet questions remain: do voters think of presidential candidates in
   gendered terms and, if so, is there a connection to support? To answer
   these questions, we analyze survey respondent descriptions of 2016
   primary and general election presidential candidates. We assess whether
   descriptions are gendered, if gender slurs are applied more to the
   female candidate, and whether these descriptions are associated with
   candidate support. We find that Hillary Clinton is described in more
   masculine than feminine terms, with a higher frequency of gendered slurs
   than other candidates. Bernie Sanders is described with more feminine
   than masculine traits, and Donald Trump is overwhelmingly described as
   masculine. As expected, Trump's support is associated with more
   masculine and less feminine trait attributions. However, masculine
   descriptions of Clinton are associated with lower levels of support,
   consistent with role congruity theory and the persistence of the double
   bind for female candidates.},

Abstract = {Economic globalization has pressured countries to compete with one
   another for firms' investment capital. Analyses of such competition draw
   heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics. In and of
   themselves, however, FDI statistics are merely a quantification of the
   value of firms' investment projects and tell us little about the
   heterogeneity of these projects and the distinct patterns of competitive
   dynamics between countries they generate. Here, we create a more
   sophisticated understanding of international competition for FDI by
   pointing out its variegated nature. To do so, we trace the `great
   fragmentation of the firm' to distinguish between five categories of
   FDI: manufacturing affiliates, shared service centers, R\&D facilities,
   intermediate holding companies, and top holding companies. Using a novel
   combination of firm-level and country-level data, we identify for each
   of these different categories which European Union member states are
   most successful in attracting it, what macro-institutional and tax
   arrangements are present in them, and what benefits they receive from it
   in terms of tax revenues and employment creation. In this way, we are
   able to identify five distinct `FDI attraction profiles' and show that
   competition increasingly appears to take place amongst subsets of
   countries that compete for similar categories of FDI.},

Abstract = {Abolish prisons; abolish police; abolish immigration enforcement:
   current ``abolition{''} movements have yet to receive the attention that
   international political economy has given to its social justice
   forerunners, e.g. World Social Forum and Occupy. I argue that to make
   the current abolition movement legible to the field first requires a
   retrieval of abolition's import for classical political economy. Towards
   this aim, I reassess the ways in which Adam Smith's ethical prospecting
   of the ``liberal reward of labor{''} referenced abolition. I then
   contextualize Smith's agonistic argument for commercial society within
   late seventeenth to early nineteenth century struggles over imperial
   commerce, especially Atlantic slavery. For this purpose, I take a prompt
   from the institutional framework of ``abolition democracy{''} provided
   by Angela Davis and WEB Du Bois. Specifically, I examine the ways in
   which the prospect of abolition challenged a) existing institutions that
   rendered enslaved labor in plantation economies as property; as well as
   b) the patriarchal institutions in England that rendered labor through a
   ``master/servant{''} relation. I conclude by arguing that current
   abolition movements prompt us to address the obfuscation in classical
   political economy of particular agents and sites through which struggles
   over freedom have been waged across capital's imperium.},

Title = {Decentering the Self, Seeing Like the Other: Toward a Postcolonial
   Approach to Ontological Security},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-56},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article advances a critical outlook on dominant interpretations of
   ontological security in international relations. It suggests that the
   preoccupation with state- and identity-centric analyses diminishes the
   value of the Other to an archetype of ontological insecurity and a
   source of ontological insecurity for the Self. It argues that seeing
   ontological security from the postcolonial perspective expands the
   self-referential understanding of ontological security to a Self-Other
   relation of mutual coexistence. To do so, the article proposes a
   framework that loosely intersects Giddens' work on late modernity with
   postcolonial notions of interstitiality and hybridity. Postcolonial
   ontological security foregrounds the emergence of a ``third hybrid
   Other{''} from an ontologically insecure status through three
   interrelated conditions of reflexivity, resourcefulness, and resistance.
   It aims to shed light on creative, nondestructive ways of confronting
   ontological insecurity and to encourage a view of the postcolonial Other
   as a learning source for the Self. These arguments are illustrated with
   the case of Okinawan ``Otherness{''} vis-a-vis the US and Japanese
   selves, with particular attention to antimilitary base movements.},

Abstract = {Generally, right-wing political parties tend to fall behind their
   left-wing counterparts on women's representation. Conservative parties
   emphasize individual merit rather than structural barriers as an
   explanation for low levels of women succeeding in candidate selection
   processes. Some right-wing parties have made more progress than others.
   Comparing parties within the conservative family, we aim to reveal what
   institutional factors may retard or promote women's representation. We
   find that the decentralization of the candidate selection process
   combined with electoral losses created opportunities for critical actors
   to act to increase women's representation to around 20\% in Australia,
   some 15 years earlier than in the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Drawing on 69 interviews and information from the World Values Surveys,
   we examine discursive understandings of social capital in Romania. We
   evidence two dominant explanatory metanarratives on the weakness of
   social capital ('communism' and `ethnocentric individualism') and
   dilemmas regarding generational and urban/rural differences, which our
   mixed-methods approach helps decode. Contemporary processes of
   institutionalisation and commodification have further weakened practices
   of social capital but such processes are socially approved for their
   potential of breaking with lingering practices of corruption, bribery
   and favouritism, and of achieving institutional fairness. Convergence
   with mature democracies is unlikely not because of passive legacies or
   ill-adapted actors but because people have different aspirations, well
   suited to the context of post-communist transformation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the leadership of women as chief justice
   or the majority opinion author, as well as an increased presence of
   women on the panel, should increase the likelihood of unanimous
   decisions and the size of majority coalitions in state supreme courts.
   Using an original dataset of cases in three policy areas from all state
   supreme courts from 1990-2015, we uncover some surprising results. In
   some issue areas, majority coalitions are larger when a woman serves as
   the majority opinion author, though we see smaller coalitions when more
   women are on the court and a man is assigned to write the majority
   opinion. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of gender
   diversity and women's leadership in the opinion-writing process may be
   more complex than previously understood.},

Title = {The Dynamics of Domestic Human Rights Implementation: Lessons from
   Qualitative Research in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-70},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the implementation of international human
   rights judgments is conditioned by domestic factors; yet the means by
   which judgments exert-or fail to exert-influence on domestic actors and
   processes is less well understood. This article presents qualitative
   research undertaken in three European states between 2016 and 2018 to
   trace the path between selected judgments involving structural or
   systemic violations and subsequent action by both state and nonstate
   actors. The rich account of the implementation process thereby
   constructed reveals, in some cases, a direct-and even immediate-causal
   path between a decision and actions leading to compliance and, in
   others, a more indirect or uncertain relationship. The article reveals
   the dynamic and iterative nature of the implementation process, which
   may at times stall and at other times accelerate and which may be
   punctuated by extraneous developments that cause the political space for
   implementation to widen or narrow. It proceeds to examine the strategies
   employed by actors who either advance or obstruct implementation, and
   concludes by advocating the formation of the broadest possible
   compliance `partnerships' in each case, supported by well-functioning
   domestic structures to coordinate the state's response.},

Journal = {GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {86-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The responsibility to protect norm has been associated with prevention
   activities such as national capacity building. There has also been
   recognition that social and economic development may have a relationship
   to this principle. Physical and social infrastructure is said to
   contribute to development and may be delivered by private actors,
   including via partnerships between the state and foreign investors,
   donors and institutions. However, the role that private investors play
   in relation to responsibility to protect activities remains unclear.
   This article explores the relationship between private actors,
   infrastructure and the responsibility to protect in the context of
   Myanmar. It argues that considering these topics together presents
   opportunities and risks, since infrastructure might help to prevent
   atrocities, but can also - as in Myanmar - contribute to their
   commission. Careful planning and consultation are crucial when funding
   and managing infrastructure projects, supported by laws, guidelines, and
   the concepts of responsibility and prevention.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the challenges that women face in their attempts
   to engage with peace processes. It first reviews the existing literature
   and then provides an analysis based on in-depth interviews with women
   members of peace networks in Thailand and in Myanmar and key
   stakeholders with relevant knowledge. The findings highlight the
   challenges that women's networks face in both countries: (1) the
   challenge of getting a seat at the table in the peace processes where
   women are increasingly visible in peace-building activism yet still lack
   power to influence formal frameworks; (2) the challenge of getting
   representation and the support of various local communities; and
   finally, (3) the challenge of getting the message right in terms of
   balancing gender advocacy with peace building in a context where gender
   advocacy is perceived as disrupting social relations. These key findings
   suggest that, to be effective, women's peace networks have to find the
   right balance between gender advocacy and addressing these key
   challenges. The article ends with a set of recommendations aimed at
   strengthening the impact of women's peace networks.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that mutually reinforcing relations between states and
   processes of investment, innovation and technological change are
   facilitating a global energy transition which is making a contribution
   to global climate challenge mitigation. This process challenges an
   existing theory of market-capitalism that argues such a change will be
   institutionally impeded, in part due to short-termist financial
   pressures on business. The paper argues instead that a pattern of
   mutually-reinforcing leads involving state and markets is underway, with
   markets and price changes likely to reduce the costs of climate
   mitigation and hopefully help embolden states and climate change policy.},

Abstract = {Tackling climate change and other environmental crises entails a
   critical reflection on processes and outcomes that are behind
   sustainability management by business. Sustainability has become a
   commodity itself, to be traded, bought, sold and managed like all
   others. How lead firms in global value chains (GVCs) address
   sustainability issues has become a key competitive element and a source
   of value creation and capture - facilitating a process of `green capital
   accumulation'. Sustainability management is emerging as a fourth key
   capitalist dynamic in addition to cost minimisation, flexibility and
   speed (Coe and Yeung 2015) - leading corporations to devise new spatial,
   organisational and technological `fixes' to ensure continued capital
   accumulation. Public actors and civil society groups can address this
   situation, but their strategies need to be informed by the daily
   practices, power relations and governance structures of GVCs.
   Sustainability orchestration by these actors is more likely to succeed
   when: it employs appropriate combinations of directive and facilitative
   instruments that reinforce each other; improves issue visibility;
   provides incentives that facilitate the alignment of private and public
   sector interests; and leverages specific pressure points at key nodes of
   GVCs.},

Abstract = {On August 24, 1543, at the end of three hours of vicious fighting, the
   army of Emperor Charles V stormed the heavily fortified town of Duren in
   modern North Rhine-Westphalia. The unexpected fall of Duren ('Dura' in
   Italian vernacular) - held by many to be impregnable by assault - marked
   the spectacular and sudden conclusion of the rebellion of Duke Wilhelm
   of Cleves against the Imperial authority, causing a sensation throughout
   Europe. Among the protagonists of that bloody day were the soldiers and
   officers of the regiment of Florentine infantry attached to the Imperial
   army. This essay will outline the history of the participation of the
   Medici troops in the 1543 campaign in Northern Europe - a conflict that
   was destined to be remembered for a long time in Italy as the `guerra di
   Dura'.},

Title = {The Liberal International Order and Peaceful Change: Spillover and the
   Importance of Values, Visions, and Passions},
Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-533},
Abstract = {As part of the roundtable ``International Institutions and Peaceful
   Change,{''} this essay focuses on the role of institutions as agents of
   peaceful change from a perspective that emphasizes the importance of a
   wide spectrum of human emotions to better understand the less
   quantifiable but nevertheless important conditions for being able to
   sustain initiatives for peaceful change. It aims to throw light on the
   often overlooked psychological and emotional hurdles standing in the way
   of agents' ability to undertake and sustain action designed to lead to
   peaceful change. To do so, the essay returns to the pioneering work of
   Ernst Haas and his important concept of ``spillover.{''} The essay shows
   that the neofunctional understanding of spillover was a theoretically
   important innovation, but that it was missing three essential elements:
   an understanding of the need for positive emotions and ontological
   security; an understanding of the link between values and identity; and
   a realization of the importance of a shared vision for the ``good
   life.{''} To illustrate the problems with Haas's version of spillover,
   but also to highlight the significant potential of the theory, the essay
   turns to the crisis of the liberal international order as an example of
   a forum where the agency to undertake peaceful change seems to be
   faltering. The essay concludes that the ability of the liberal order to
   effect peaceful change is currently hampered because the order is
   characterized by negative emotions, contested values, and a vision of
   the good life that is seen as mainly a benefit for the cosmopolitan
   elite.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {267-277},
Abstract = {This essay explores the possibility of universal values. Universal
   values do not exist as Platonic ideals nor do they exist in clearly
   defined lists of rules or laws. Rather, universal ethical claims are
   constructed through the actions of individual political leaders,
   scholars, and activists. This essay explores how such normative
   constructions take place. It uses an initiative undertaken by the UN
   Office of Drugs and Crime to further education around corruption as an
   example of how such universal values come into existence. The initiative
   focused on developing teaching materials for higher education. The essay
   focuses on two particular modules, both their content and the process by
   which they were written.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {285-295},
Abstract = {Over the past seventy-five years, the UN has evolved significantly,
   often in response to geopolitical dynamics and new waves of thinking. In
   some respects, the UN has registered remarkable achievements,
   stimulating a wide range of multilateral treaties, promoting significant
   growth of human rights, and at times playing a central role in
   containing and preventing large-scale armed conflict. As part of the
   special issue on ``The United Nations at Seventy-Five: Looking Back to
   Look Forward,{''} this essay argues that the organization has been the
   most impactful in three areas: producing, shaping, and driving key
   ideas, particularly on development and rights; generating such effective
   operational agencies as UNICEF and the World Food Program; and,
   especially in the immediate post-Cold War period, addressing major
   conflict risks through the Security Council. Since then, however, the UN
   has struggled to meet emerging challenges on many fronts and been
   increasingly hampered by internal ossification and institutional sprawl
   as well as internecine dysfunction. The twenty-first century has
   confronted the UN with further challenges relating most notably to
   climate change; to risks arising from new technologies; and to the
   increasingly fraught relationships between China, Russia, and the United
   States. If the past seventy-five years can offer one lesson, it is that
   new thinking and new ideas will need to drive the organization to evolve
   still further and faster, or else risk irrelevance.},

Abstract = {A populist backlash has seized a number of Western democracies. Two
   broad sets of explanations have emerged to address the sources of this
   backlash, with credible empirical evidence for each. The first focuses
   on economic drivers, and specifically on global economic integration,
   and exposure to trade competition. The second turns instead to cultural
   explanations, arguing that the shifting political winds are due to
   strictly nonmaterial considerations, like status threat and racial
   beliefs. How might we reconcile two apparently conflicting conclusions
   in the scholarly work examining this backlash? The question comes down
   to the particular interplay of these factors. I argue that the most
   promising approach may lie in tweaking our ideas about the relevant
   group that individuals use to make assessments about general welfare and
   the role of political entrepreneurs in manipulating these relevant
   groups. This, in turn, might explain why right-wing political parties
   appear to consistently gain from the ongoing backlash. I end with a
   consideration of the policy means that governments have to curb the
   political effects of economic grievances, and what explains the success
   or failure of such efforts. An economic recipe for backlash suggests the
   existence of an antidote.},

Abstract = {The global financial crisis triggered a revolution in the central
   banking world. The development of `extraordinary' monetary policies has
   been a central feature of the crisis response across the US, UK and
   Europe and has been portrayed as the most significant policy shift since
   the crisis. In contrast, we present the case that extraordinary monetary
   policies are characterised by an intensification of rather than a
   departure from previous monetary strategies. By foregrounding labour in
   our analysis, we show how the extraordinary monetary policy of the Bank
   of England is an intensification of a long-standing strategy to
   discipline labour through wage restraint and increased personal and
   household indebtedness. The result is that labour must navigate its
   conflicting roles a worker, consumer, and debtor. We argue that this
   strategy is now reaching its limits as the rising cost of household debt
   is driving up the effective minimum price of labour while the focus on
   inflation targeting seeks to suppress wage demands. The result is to
   destabilise the conditions necessary for the continuous renewal of
   British-based capitalist accumulation.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses the implementation of China's Regulations on Open
   Government Information (ROGI), an important piece of legislation that
   establishes Chinese citizens' right to information. By international
   standards, the ROGI only offers relatively weak protection for this
   right, but Chinese citizens and civil society organisations have used
   the ROGI creatively to pursue a variety of goals from private rights
   protection to public interest advocacy. Strong civic activism has been a
   major driving force behind the gradual progress in public access to
   government information that has been achieved since the ROGI came into
   effect in 2008.},

Abstract = {Media outlets have reported that women leaders around the globe are
   managing the COVID-19 crisis better than their male counterparts,
   responding faster and communicating better about pandemic policies. In
   this article, we examine empirical data on the timing of policy
   responses from the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker to determine
   whether and how countries led by women reacted differently to the
   pandemic. Exploring the relationship between the gender of leaders and
   legislators and the timing of stay-at-home orders, school closures, and
   coordinated public information campaigns, we find no statistical
   evidence supporting popular claims in the media. However, we find some
   evidence that the level of gender equality in legislatures is related to
   school closures, a policy with clear gendered consequences. These
   conclusions are an important first step in understanding the potentially
   gendered nature of the crisis response and identifying new avenues for
   research.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed all aspects of American
   life, including, for many, how we vote. We explore the question of who
   supports unrestricted absentee ballots during a pandemic. We argue that
   women are more likely to support absentee ballots because they allow for
   greater flexibility and minimize the potential for exposure. We test
   this theory using the National Panel Study of COVID-19 (n = 1,892),
   which asked respondents about their preferences for absentee ballots,
   their worry about the coronavirus, and their household composition.
   Using multinomial logistic regressions, we find that women are more
   likely to support allowing absentee ballots compared with more
   restrictive voting options and are more likely to say they support
   absentee ballots for all if they know someone who has contracted
   COVID-19. The policy implications for these findings are discussed along
   with other sociodemographic indicators in our analysis.},

Title = {Interpreting the Uninterpretable: The Ethics of Opaqueness as an
   Approach to Moments of Inscrutability in Fieldwork},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {431-446},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper develops what I call ``the ethics of opaqueness{''} as a
   response to conceptual impasses concerning the uninterpretability of
   intersubjective knowledge production in narrative practice. The ethics
   of opaqueness sees the other as inscrutable and radically heterogenous,
   and confronts interpretations of the other by the self as suspicious
   projections. Thus, such an ethics addresses the self, not the other, as
   the object of the ``hermeneutics of suspicion.{''} In order to
   conceptualize the ethics of opaqueness, I look to relational
   psychoanalysis, which understands the unconscious as being inherently
   intersubjective. This results in a reformulation of the process of
   recognition, and deeper acknowledgment of countertransference-that is,
   the partly unconscious conflicts activated in the researcher through the
   research encounter, which may lead to imposing meaning on the other. The
   apparatus of relational psychoanalysis concretizes the limits of knowing
   either the other or the self and supplies a vocabulary to crystallize
   the double quality of ``uninterpretable moments{''} in narrative
   practice. They may trigger an imposition of a frame and therefore an
   interpretive closure; however, they also supply a potentially
   transformative space for the contentious co-construction of meaning,
   often in the form of metaphors, which subverts any claim to interpretive
   mastery.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the appeal to depoliticized expertise worked
   to legitimize increased supervisory and executive power to the European
   Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, after the 2015 refugee crisis.
   Frontex is an EU agency operating in a highly salient field, removed
   from hard-science ``gold standards{''} of evidence, where member states
   have been reluctant to delegate power and sovereignty. Through a
   process-tracing case study, this article finds that appeals to technical
   neutrality, quantification, and objective indicators nevertheless were
   central when a new mandate for the agency was negotiated, giving Frontex
   unprecedented supervisory and executive power. They were also important
   resources for member states concerned about Frontex's increased powers.
   By focusing on an agency at a remove from the natural-science archetype,
   this article contributes to the literature on knowledge use in
   independent agencies. It suggests that technical expertise can be a
   powerful source of legitimacy even in a field removed from ``hard{''}
   science.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the 1994 genocide, Rwanda's government created the Gacaca
   courts to hold suspected perpetrators accountable. Although much has
   been written about these courts, researchers know comparatively less
   about the 250,000 individuals who served as Gacaca court judges
   (inyangamugayo). We draw upon 135 interviews to explore how the
   inyangamugayo entered and adapted to their new public roles as moral
   arbiters, how these judges understood Gacaca's missions, and how their
   social identities evolved over the course of multiple status
   transitions. Building on Erving Goffman's sequential approach to moral
   careers, we trace the process of becoming a judge. In doing so, we
   highlight the two overarching missions that surfaced during the
   interviews - justice and reconciliation - and how the judges continued
   to view themselves as inyangamugayo even after the courts closed.},

Title = {The Politics of Apology and the Prospects for `Post-conflict'
   Reconciliation: The Case of the Provisional Irish Republican Movement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {524-543},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article analyses the Irish Provisional Republican movement and the
   evolution of its approach to the politics of apology. The first section
   analyses recent scholarship regarding `political apologies', and
   provides a challenge to the existing literature, which concentrates upon
   `official' or state apologies, rather than examples involving non-state
   armed groups (paramilitary or `terrorist' organisations). This section
   argues that it remains difficult to discern an adequate general model
   for establishing criteria for a `successful' or `sincere' political
   apology involving such groups. The second section considers a number of
   case studies, including the statements of the IRA in 2002, and after the
   Enniskillen bombing in 1987. It is argued that the Provisional
   movement's apologies have not generally proven helpful to its declared
   aim of post-conflict reconciliation. This article argues that attempted
   apologies or quasi-apologies by non-state groups may not ameliorate the
   sense of grievance experienced by victims/survivors, and may also serve
   to revivify social and political `framing battles' over the past.},

Abstract = {Child maltreatment calls for a broad range of preventative policies and
   practices, but limited governmental funding and leadership has been
   devoted to the problem. Effective strategies to prevent maltreatment
   exist, but they have had limited uptake in the child welfare system. In
   this article, we trace how government responsibility for the prevention
   of child maltreatment became centered within the nation's child
   protection response. Further, we discuss developments in prevention
   science, review the existing literature on the effectiveness of a range
   of prevention strategies, and present a public health approach to
   prevention. The article concludes with a set of recommendations to
   inform future efforts to prevent child maltreatment through approaches
   that seek to expand capacity for the implementation of evidence-based
   prevention programs, while addressing the adverse community experiences
   that exacerbate risk for child maltreatment.},

Abstract = {The main element of gender justice addressed in transitional justice
   processes has been sexual and gender-based violence against women
   (SGBVAW). This article explores if particular dimensions (core
   characteristics) of transitional justice processes are more likely to
   positively contribute toward measures taken by the state to address
   SGBVAW outcomes. Empirical evidence from 13 African cases suggested that
   transitional justice processes that had autonomous, gender-hinclusive,
   and reparative dimensions were more likely to see positive SGBVAW
   outcomes. Pending further research, the results suggest that using these
   dimensions of transitional justice to unpack the impact pathways of
   transitional justice helps to clarify the ways that transitional justice
   can benefit societies. The findings also suggest that impact pathways
   between transitional justice and SGBVAW outcomes exist, but the nature
   of these pathways is varied and often indirect.},

Title = {Recursive recognition in the international political economy},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {369-381},
Abstract = {How are the tools that govern the world economy legitimated? Here we
   discuss how governance tools - such as policy scripts, templates, and
   benchmarks - are developed to contain particular types of knowledge.
   Such tools contain blueprints of how the world economy should work.
   Understanding how they are produced and legitimated is important if we
   are to comprehend how they replicate particular bodies of knowledge,
   policy languages, and norms. We suggest that `recursive recognition' is
   an important trend in the international political economy, where
   different types of organizations legitimate particular governance tools;
   especially ones producing common metrics. For example: a private
   foundation releases a study on best practices in policy areaX, which is
   then referred to as best practice by an intergovernmental organization,
   an NGO, a firm, and a global professional service firm. Investigating
   the extent of this phenomenon requires addressing two blind spots. The
   first blind spot is conceptual in the reification of agency and
   authority based on organizational types. The second blind spot is
   empirical in identifying how pervasive recursive recognition has become,
   and how it affirms the reproduction of power asymmetries.},

Abstract = {Despite neorealism's predominance in the academic debate, it is too
   narrow a basis for the comprehensive understanding of present-day
   international intelligence cooperation. This approach is perfectly
   capable of explaining what is currentlynothappening in international
   intelligence cooperation and why this is the case. However, it is
   inadequate to understand whatdoeshappen in international intelligence
   cooperation. To explain international intelligence cooperation,
   especially in long-standing multilateral arrangements such as the EU and
   NATO, additional approaches are needed. This article advocates stepping
   beyond a state-centric approach of international intelligence
   cooperation, viewing it as a process and using a sociological
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Inspired by the concept of the regulatory welfare state, this article
   identifies four primary modes of governance in regulating contract
   processes and contract implementation (market-based, hierarchical,
   professional, and relational), and compares contract governance modes in
   Shanghai and Chongqing. We find that the governments in these two
   localities prioritize and integrate the hierarchical and relational
   modes, relying less on the market-based and professional modes of
   governance. The emphasis on the hierarchical-relational mode advances
   the values and mechanisms of trust, adaptation, and alignment with
   top-down priorities, but may hinder public and legal accountability. We
   argue that the dynamics of political context and market condition affect
   the formation and effectiveness of hybrid modes of contract governance,
   and we advise that regulators in different countries should factor in
   such dynamics when designing contract governance modes in the regulation
   of social services.},

Abstract = {In introducing this special section of New Political Economy, this paper
   explores the key themes that emerge from the three papers included in
   this special section presents a new generation of CC research in EMs
   which seeks to reconcile classical institutionalist approaches to
   capitalist variety with more recent attempts to shift back from
   supply-side to macroeconomic demand side factors, as well as brining the
   role of the state back in. This opening article summarises the key
   contributions we see emerging from this new generation of research and
   argues that it holds important lessons not just for the study of EMs but
   also advanced economies. We identify several important research
   questions for further research; but we also suggest that even the new
   approach that this new generation of CC research takes may not be enough
   to address the most pressing issue facing capitalist economies, namely
   the degradation of our natural environment.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether lending by the dominant Russian state bank,
   Sberbank, contributed to Vladimir Putin's ascent to power during the
   presidential elections of March2000. Our hypothesis is that Sberbank
   corporate loans were used as incentives for managers at private firms to
   mobilize employees to vote for Putin. In line with our proposed voter
   mobilization mechanism, we find that the growth of regional corporate
   Sberbank loans in the months before the presidential election is related
   to the regional increase in votes for Putin and to the regional increase
   in voter turnout between the Duma election of December1999 and the
   presidential election of March2000. The effect is pronounced in regions
   where the governor is affiliated with the regime and in regions with
   extensive private employment, and less apparent in regions bequeathed
   with single-company towns, where voter intimidation suffices to get the
   required result. The results are highly robust.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we build a theory that presents the process of succession
   at the subnational level as bargaining between the region and the
   center. The region should first be able to produce qualifying candidates
   for successor status, which requires incumbent control. If potential
   successors emerge and one is designated as such by the incumbent, the
   central authorities still need to accept such a candidate as the new
   leader. The center's strength (depending on the level of centralization)
   and the region's strength (depending on regional elite cohesion) shape
   this negotiation. Using biographical data on subnational political
   elites in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan in the 1990s and 2000s, we
   construct elite social networks and demonstrate how and why we observe
   leader succession in Tatarstan in 2010, but not in Bashkortostan.},

Abstract = {The problem of manterrupting, i.e. men interrupting women to take
   control of a conversation, claiming superior knowledge, or discrediting
   women's arguments, has garnered major attention in social and
   traditional media. Yet scholarly accounts of gendered speech
   interruption patterns in parliamentary debates are less common. In this
   article, I argue that manterrupting can be considered a form of
   resistance against women in politics and, in its worst iteration,
   prevent female representatives from representing women's interests. This
   article will analyze the problem of `manterrupting' regarding
   parliamentary debates in Germany by investigating the nature and extent
   of male interruptions during parliamentary debates in the 17th
   legislative period. Drawing on insights from social psychology and
   masculinity studies, this article finds that in the case of Germany,
   manterruptions are neither systemic and frequent enough to constitute a
   form of resistance against women in politics nor do they prevent female
   representatives from engaging in the substantive representation of
   women.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the discursive representations of a ``homophobic
   hate crime{''} case against gay US tourists in the small-island state of
   St Lucia, especially within the mainstream US media. Drawing on the
   interrelated concepts of homonationalism, pinkwashing, and racialized
   homophobia, the study opens up the complexities of race, sexuality, and
   neoliberal globalization, and aims to transcend a
   ``perpetrator/victim{''} mode of analysis. I argue that media
   representations of the case serve to ``characterize{''} St Lucia as
   innately homophobic, as a sign of its incapacity for gender and sexual
   tolerance and therefore of its failed/misguided sovereignty. In doing
   so, these representations shore up claims about US exceptionalism
   through the racialization of homophobia and the production of white gay
   US subjects as exceptional global citizens.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the drivers of the rise of third-party funding
   (TPF) in investor-state arbitration. TPF involves financiers shouldering
   the legal fees of an investment treaty claim against a sovereign state
   in exchange for a share of any eventual award. Existing research has
   highlighted how TPF may exacerbate the inequities inherent to a legal
   regime that is already weighted in favor of private interests by
   increasing investors' access to funding of their legal claims, but the
   factors which gave rise to TPF are little understood. We argue that
   financialization helps to explain both the spread and the
   characteristics of TPF. In particular, the evidence presented in this
   paper suggests that the large supply of investable capital that is
   searching for profitable investment opportunities helps to account for
   the rise of TPF. The analysis provides the basis for broader
   propositions and a research agenda about the ways in which
   financialization alters the logics of an international legal regime and
   aligns the interests of different private agents, both of which may
   change the public-private balance in investor-state arbitration and
   affect its legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Financially vulnerable, low-income individuals are more likely to
   experience financial exclusion as they are unable to access financial
   services that meet their needs. How do they cope with economic
   instability, and what is the role of social networks in their coping
   strategies? Using financial diaries, we explore the day-to-day monetary
   transactions (n = 16,889) of forty-five low-to-moderate income
   individuals with restricted access to mainstream lending in Glasgow, UK,
   over a six-month period. Our sample includes users of microcredit and
   financial advice, as well as nonusers of these services. Findings reveal
   that informal lending to avoid the pernicious effects of short-term
   illiquidity was pervasive among these individuals. However, taking
   informal loans often strains valuable social capital and keeps people
   from building up a formal credit footprint. Our findings suggest that
   financially vulnerable populations would benefit from policies that
   focus on alternative financial mechanisms to help stabilize
   income-insecure individuals in the short-term.},

   in order to explain the failure of European countries to provide
   humanitarian protection to refugees. A sequential game-theoretical model
   serves to demonstrate the strategic interaction between states and
   refugees in European asylum policy. The analysis demonstrates that
   although both groups of actors benefit from a functioning European
   asylum system, they also have few incentives to contribute to the public
   good. States aim to reduce their individual refugee burden and refugees
   seek protection in their preferred destination country. The findings
   suggest that an effective provision of refugee protection requires both
   member states and refugees to contribute mutually to the public good.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Congress established the foundation of today's surveillance
   state nearly a half century ago as it sought to regulate and prevent
   criminal activity: the Banking Secrecy Act to target tax evasion by
   individuals and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to create
   oversight of wiretapping activities by law enforcement. Over time,
   additional functions were layered onto the existing institutional
   infrastructure, such as combating illicit drugs. September 11(th), 2001
   served as a critical juncture, reorienting the regime yet again to
   support the counter terror mission, despite persistent inefficiency and
   simultaneous risks to the civil liberties of Americans.},

Abstract = {In this article we explore the potential applications for Human
   Intelligence (HUMINT) operations in Public Health Emergencies of
   International Concern (PHEICs) and epidemics. We examine the complex
   circumstances surrounding outbreaks and how these require the synthesis
   and analysis of new sources of information and intelligence. We explore
   the benefits from these tactics by examining intelligence gaps and their
   consequences during the initial stages of the Ebola outbreak of
   2014-2016. Finally, we look at what parameters and circumstances would
   be needed for the application of HUMINT operations in PHEICs and attempt
   to understand some of the constraints to its use.},

Abstract = {High levels of women in politics and paid work, together with the
   availability of paid parental leave and public child care, make the
   gender imbalance in business leadership in Iceland all the more
   confounding. This study analyzes business leaders' attitudes toward
   gender and leadership positions after a gender quota law for company
   boards was implemented in 2013. We explore support for gender quotas and
   whether it is related to how respondents explain women's
   underrepresentation in leadership positions. A questionnaire was sent to
   1,349 managers in the 250 largest companies in Iceland. Our findings
   indicate that women are more supportive of gender quotas than men. The
   way in which the respondents explain the underrepresentation of women as
   top managers is strongly related to their support for gender quotas.
   Those who believe that women are structurally disadvantaged are more
   likely to support gender quotas than those who adhere to individual
   explanations. Furthermore, male dominance at higher company levels is
   related to negative views on gender quotas, whereas this does not apply
   at lower levels. The research emphasizes the impact of business leaders
   on the recruitment of women to business leadership positions and, at the
   same time, has implications for policy interventions.},

Title = {Neoliberalism as Religion: Sacralization of the Market and Post-truth
   Politics},

Abstract = {Since the 2008 financial crisis, depictions of neoliberalism as a
   religion, system of belief, and ``kind of faith{''} have multiplied in
   an attempt to explain neoliberalism's remarkable power and resilience.
   These accounts, however, have remained largely impressionistic. In this
   article, I interrogate the meanings, implications, and value of
   conceptualizing neoliberalism as religion and advance two main claims.
   First, the power of neoliberalism stems from being a rationality of
   government that continuously evokes religious meanings and
   significations. Neoliberalism displaces and redraws the boundary between
   secular and religious and appropriates an aura of sacredness while
   concealing itself behind an authoritative secular rational facade.
   Second, one of the outcomes of the neoliberal ``sacralization{''} of the
   market has been the emergence of so-called ``post-truth politics.{''}
   The latter, I contend, can be conceptualized as a neoliberal ``truth
   market{''} of news production, circulation, and consumption that is
   governed simultaneously by logics of commodification and belief. This
   analysis aims to contribute to existing debates on secularization, on
   neoliberalism's resilience, and on post-truth politics. It shows their
   interconnectedness through a critical approach that focuses on the
   disarticulation, rearticulation, and deployment of the categories of the
   secular/profane and religious/sacred in neoliberal regimes of power and
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Debates about the economy are central to political exchange and
   political choice is typically presented as a matter of selecting among
   rival economic competence claims. The capacity to speak with authority
   about the economy or to draw upon accredited economic expertise is an
   important source of political advantage. However, the Brexit process is
   a form of politicized market contestation that has taken place against
   the backdrop of significant challenges to expert authority. This article
   shows how key parts of the Leave campaign developed three strategies
   within the discursive politics of Brexit: setting aside the economy as a
   central issue in Brexit; advancing alternative economic knowledge to
   that of institutionally advantaged professionals; and creating a cadre
   of alternative economic experts. The article suggests that attempts to
   use the inherently depoliticizing logic of causal ideas derived from
   authorized economic knowledge has not prevailed over the central
   normative beliefs that drive `Brexitism'.},

Title = {PPPs in China: Does the Growth in Chinese PPPs Signal a Liberalising
   Economy?},

Abstract = {This study provides insight into the nature of public-private
   partnerships (PPPs) in China, a country that has invested more in PPPs
   than any other over the last two decades. It is puzzling that China, as
   a state-led economy, has turned to embrace PPPs. Pundits have taken this
   as evidence of a liberalising Chinese economy. However, our findings
   suggest that PPPs in China do not reflect a break from earlier,
   state-centric modes of governance; rather, the state essentially uses
   such partnerships as a mechanism to strengthen its own hand. We argue
   that the difference between how PPPs are being implemented in China
   compared to the West reflects differences in political economic
   contexts, both materially and ideologically. In both cases, the
   ambiguity surrounding the PPP model has been used to advance particular
   interests, serving as a reminder of both the ways in which power shapes
   the character of such policy tools and the differences in the relative
   power underpinning state-market relations in each context. By
   challenging mainstream interpretations of what PPPs are and what their
   proliferation means, studying the political economy of PPPs in a rising
   China further exposes the Western-centric nature of prevailing wisdom in
   political economy scholarship.},

Abstract = {Scholars of political economy have criticised the Baltic states'
   transition to capitalism as socially `disembedded' and shaped by a
   zealous form of neoliberalism. This article argues that the Baltic
   welfare states have experienced a more complex post-socialist
   transformation than suggested by the `neoliberal retrenchment'
   narrative, which relies on the traditional definition of the welfare
   state and focuses solely on cash compensation for the `losers' of
   transition. By uncovering higher investment in education, more generous
   labour market policies and a larger expansion of public sector
   employment than in the Visegrad countries, the article uncovers social
   investment oriented welfare states in the Baltic.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {237-243},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The North Caucasus region of Russia is known for spawning the highest
   number of adverse judgments from the European Court of Human Rights
   compared to any other Russian region-over 500 as of mid-2020. Since
   2005, the Court has found Russia responsible for enforced
   disappearances, extrajudicial killings and torture carried out on a mass
   scale during the second Chechen war and in its aftermath. The Head of
   the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, has become internationally
   infamous for the brutal repression of even his mildest critics, ensuring
   that most Chechens will be too afraid to claim their rights in any
   forum. Domestically, the Russian federal authorities have either ignored
   or tacitly condoned the increasing subversion of state law in the region
   in favour of de facto customary norms-adat-and elements of sharia law
   that have had a devastating effect mainly on women's and girls' rights.
   Harmful traditional practices such as `honour killings', child marriage,
   bride-kidnapping, and-in certain remote mountain regions of
   Dagestan-female genital mutilation take place on a regular basis. Yet
   such violations, however grave, do not easily lend themselves to
   litigation. This practice note focuses on one of the few areas in the
   region in which systematic focused litigation is being carried out in
   domestic courts, often against enormous odds: the systematic denial of
   women's right to family life after divorce or the death of their
   children's biological father.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the citizenship experiences of internally displaced
   persons (IDPs) in Ukraine. Since 2014, conflict in eastern Ukraine has
   forced over 1.7 million people to leave their homes. Unlike refugees,
   who are protected by international law, IDPs rely primarily on state
   support. Based on ethnographic research and analysis of secondary
   sources, the essay focuses on IDPs' interactions with the state to
   highlight how displacement affects the provision of social guarantees.
   The discussion questions the distinctions between categories of migrants
   and citizens by offering insights into new modalities of controlled
   citizenship that displaced people live through.},

Abstract = {Women's political underrepresentation in right-wing parties remains a
   global phenomenon. Despite their rejection of ``identity politics,{''}
   the United Kingdom's Conservative Party and the United States'
   Republican Party have launched formal initiatives to recruit women
   legislative candidates. In this article, we ask: How do right-wing women
   advocate for increasing women's representation within parties that
   explicitly reject group identity politics? More specifically, we examine
   1) how party elites frame the UK's Women2Win and the US's Project GROW
   campaigns, and 2) the role that women play in each of these initiatives.
   Through interviews with party elites and content analyses of news
   articles and campaign materials, we show that right-wing women in both
   countries function as strategic party actors, advocating for women's
   representation tactically within the specific ideological and electoral
   context of their party.},

Abstract = {The notion that through increased state cooperation and dependency,
   national divisions can be overcome and peace can be secured, is at the
   core of European integration. Political elites often refer to the
   devastations of the Second World War (WWII) as a way to convey the added
   value of European cooperation today. Do references to the devastations
   of WWII enhance public support for European cooperation today? By
   presenting evidence from survey experiments conducted in the six largest
   member states (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the Great
   Britain) in July 2017, this study suggest that they do, albeit only when
   it comes to financial assistance for other member states in dire
   economic need. References to the devastations of WWII do not make
   respondents more willing to support free movement of people or the
   establishment of a European army. These findings suggest that reminding
   people of the devastations of WWII triggers a largely transactional
   response among the public: a willingness to provide financial support,
   but nothing more. This evidence suggests that securing public support
   for free movement of people or European security cooperation through
   historical rhetoric might be difficult to achieve.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyses the Jordanian governmental response(s) to the
   Syrian refugee crisis. It argues that, because of the uncertainty of the
   Syrian civil war, the kingdom relied on temporary and reactive policies
   in accordance with (1) the course of the war in Syria and (2) Jordan's
   involvement in the Syrian civil war. In other words, Jordan lacked a
   strategic outlook to mitigate the impact of the sharp increase of its
   population.},

   application to the EEC in 1987 to postcolonial nationalism that comes

   tried to nullify the impacts of French Protectorate and colonialism
   through Moroccan-ness and African-ness compatible with the first two
   subthemes. The chapter is a prerequisite for King Hassan II's
   application to the EEC, as an implementation of the admiration of

Abstract = {The puzzle of Machiavelli's Art of War (1519-1520) is that he gave the
   name of the famous mercenary captain Fabrizio Colonna to the speaker in
   the dialogue who condemns mercenaries and praises citizen armies, ideas
   Machiavelli regularly espoused but which were certainly not shared by
   the historical Fabrizio Colonna. Answers have generally sought political
   motives. Was Machiavelli reaffirming old loyalties to Piero Soderini,
   who had established ties to the Colonna family and twice tried to hire
   Fabrizio as captain of Florence's armies? Or was he currying favor with
   the Medici, who had been restored to power by the Spanish-Swiss-papal
   league in which Fabrizio was governor-general of the papal armies? This
   essay attempts a different approach that explores Machiavelli's
   construction of the figure of Fabrizio in the dialogue. At the beginning
   Fabrizio confidently preaches the emulation of antiquity's military
   practices, including citizen armies, and condemns captains who make war
   a full-time profession (an arte) as corrupt, fraudulent, rapacious and
   dangerous to the states and princes who employ them. But his
   interlocutor Cosimo Rucellai asks why Fabrizio has never implemented any
   of the ancient practices he so admires. Fabrizio's awkward defence of
   himself insists, first, that the occasione has never arisen,
   subsequently that he has never practiced war as an arte - a denial that
   contradicts the reality of the historical Fabrizio - and finally that
   military reforms are possible only for kings with large armies. Only
   very reluctantly and incompletely does Fabrizio acknowledge his own
   complicity in the mercenary system he condemns. Through the fictional
   Fabrizio Machiavelli unmasks the delusions of Italy's warrior nobles,
   their pursuit of private profit over public good, and their part in
   Italy's subjugation to foreigners.},

Booktitle = {FACES OF REPUBLICAN TURKEY: Beyond the Modernization Hypothesis},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {129-147},
Abstract = {An important pillar of Ottoman and Turkish capitalist modernization has
   been the constitution of a legal-rational authority, which is strictly
   tied to the formation of a modern bureaucracy. The bureaucracy has
   attained a very special attention in academic writing, getting far
   beyond considering this category as one of the elements of Turkish
   modernization. Rather, the bureaucracy was declared as the very subject
   of this history, which acts according to a special blueprint designed to
   shape the society and politics. The objective of this chapter is to
   challenge this presumption by discussing the linkage between the
   thickening anti-intellectualism especially at the time of changes in the
   mode of accumulation and the negative approach adopted against the
   bureaucracy by the political authorities, which tend to establish an
   arbitrary rule. In this regard, it is asserted that the negative
   treatment of the traditional Republican bureaucracy, which made a peak
   in the 1950s and, later, in the 1980s, cannot be explained in a
   superficial manner with only a reaction to the bureaucratization and the
   rise in bureaucratic formalities. These two waves of anti-bureaucratism
   require special attention also because of their legacy that contributed
   to the vital erosion in the institutional framework of the state
   administration in the 2000s.},

Abstract = {This chapter challenges the critiques of online learning by authors who
   see it as a negative sign of the corporatization of the university, a
   drift to substandard learning and a threat to democracy. Drawing on my
   experience teaching online, I argue teaching theory in an online format
   is an effective way to explore a variety of political perspectives,
   foster critical thinking, empower students to find their critical voice
   and employ experiential/service learning. Teaching political theory
   online is also a way to give access to first-generation and
   non-traditional students who may not be able to attend face-to-face
   (F2F) classes because of work and family obligations. Finally, teaching
   political theory online can shatter the authority, hierarchy and
   knowledge nexus and open pedagogy to the practice of equality.},

Abstract = {Climate change and environmental protection have become increasingly
   important in China. The country has formulated and strictly enforced a
   series of policies to address climate change directly. This article
   argues for the importance of studying China's climate change policies
   from a gender perspective, particularly given the speed and import of
   action. It does so in three steps. First, it examines gendered
   differences in perceptions of climate change and in the impacts of
   climate change policies. Second, it examines the environment-related
   content in China's gender policies and the gender-related content in its
   climate change policies. Through the comparison between these two, we
   argue that it is easier to include climate change in gender policies in
   China than to include gender in climate change policies and that the
   integration of these two is anything but robust. Third, we analyze the
   multiple and varied roles played by women in climate change policy
   making, as well as women's conspicuous absence from some key high-level
   political conversations. The article concludes that gender awareness in
   Chinese climate change policy needs to be supplemented by gender
   sensitivity and we suggest some measures to move toward this goal.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the history of the German-Greek relationship
   in the context of European integration and demonstrates that West
   Germany and German-Greek business networks played a crucial role in the
   shaping of Greece's post-war growth model. The article challenges the
   assumption that the relationship between the two countries is
   overshadowed by the past. In contrast, it shows that post-war
   German-Greek relations were forged around European integration with an
   eye to the future and that it was the two countries' early rapprochement
   and the mutual accommodation of their respective aims that laid the
   foundations of their asymmetrical interdependence. In doing so, the
   article argues that it was the success of Greece's European strategy,
   rather than its failure, that lies at the heart of its recurring
   balance-of-payments problems: a lingering trade deficit with Germany,
   the country's major trading partner, proved to be, as I will show, the
   price for growth and modernization.},

Abstract = {A central function of democratic institutions is to protect vulnerable
   populations. The stability and success of these institutions depends, in
   part, on popular support. Times of crisis can introduce novel dynamics
   that alter popular support for protective institutions, particularly
   among those who do not benefit from those protections. We explore this
   possibility in the context of Title IX's gender equality requirements
   and infrastructure to address sexual harassment in college sports. We
   conduct a large survey of college student-athletes to study their
   attitudes on these issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
   concomitant financial challenges affecting college sports. We find that
   male student-athletes and those with sexist attitudes exhibit alarmingly
   low levels of support for ensuring the maintenance of equality and
   sexual harassment policy under Title IX during the COVID-19 crisis and
   eventual recovery. The results accentuate the vulnerability of certain
   populations during crises and the importance of maintaining strong
   institutional policy support during such times.},

Abstract = {This essay, written in memory of Erik Olin Wright (1947-2019), explores
   the possibility of liberal socialism. Wright sought to rescue both
   liberalism and socialism from their demonstrated capacity for
   depredation. His legacy challenges reformers to proceed with the
   audacity of real, and realistic, utopianism together with an awareness
   that, unfortunately, the obverse of an appealing utopianism always
   beckons.},

Journal = {GLOBAL DISCOURSE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {475-480},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For the Gulf states, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as an accelerant to
   systemic fiscal challenges the states were projected to face. These
   longer-term fiscal challenges were a result of fundamental shifts in the
   global energy market towards lacklustre demand, oversupply of oil and
   gas, and depressed prices. Moreover, the shift towards carbon
   -neutrality and investment in renewables by key regions such as the
   European Union and China, have added to the longterm outlook on fossil
   fuel demand. This article examines such trends and concludes that the
   Gulf region is facing a looming fiscal cliff, whereby public policy
   within the Gulf states will necessarily reflect the three main areas of
   taxation, austerity and increased activity in the bond market to raise
   liquidity. Such trends have been made more pronounced by the pandemic.
   It is argued that in the context of rising debt, the immediate challenge
   identified for these states will be their peg to the United States
   Dollar. Such fiscal conditions will necessitate a drive by these states
   to attract foreign direct investment, and greater engagement with China
   through the Belt and Road Initiative is identified as a likely outcome.
   Therefore, this article concludes that the impact of the pandemic will
   hasten a shift in both public policy, statesociety-relations, and in the
   international relations of the region.},

Title = {The political economy of inclusion and exclusion: state, labour and the
   costs of supply chain integration in the Eastern Caribbean},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {749-767},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {The dual emphasis on the benefits of global supply chain integration and
   private governance to address its ethical gaps have given prominence to
   an inclusive vision of chains which, this paper argues, drawing on the
   case of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), has been greatly
   exaggerated. In the post-war era, SVG built a successful banana industry
   under a preferential agreement with the EU. When the agreement collapsed
   under free trade reforms, the burden of finding new forms of
   reintegration fell on the state and laboring classes. The paper argues
   that conventional supply chain approaches have adopted a static
   understanding of the relationship between inclusion and exclusion,
   overlooking the exclusionary nature of supply chains and placing too
   much emphasis on assessing the possibilities for private supply chain
   initiatives to address their negative social and environmental impacts.
   The effect has been to obscure the centrality of the state and laboring
   classes in continuing, out of necessity, to confront, manage, and
   address the many costs that corporations are not willing to pay. It is
   their centrality to managing the uneven and unpredictable nature of
   supply chain integration/reintegration, that is often the most hidden of
   all.},

   deeply embedded in policy practice. Furthermore, in order to examine the
   local effects of national trends in welfare restructuring since 2012, we
   present a case study of maternity care services in two Russian regions.},

Abstract = {Most governance is indirect, carried out through intermediaries.
   Principal-agent theory views indirect governance primarily as a problem
   of information: the agent has an informational advantage over the
   principal, which it can exploit to evade principal control. But indirect
   governance creates a more fundamental problem of power. Competent
   intermediaries with needed expertise, credibility, legitimacy, and/or
   operational capacity are inherently difficult to control because the
   policy benefits they can create (or the trouble they can cause) give
   them leverage. Conversely, tight governor control constrains
   intermediaries. The governor thus faces a dilemma: emphasizing control
   limits intermediary competence and risks policy failure; emphasizing
   intermediary competence risks control failure. This ``governor's
   dilemma{''} helps to explain puzzling features of indirect governance:
   why it is not limited to principal-agent delegation but takes multiple
   forms; why governors choose forms that appear counterproductive in an
   informational perspective; and why arrangements are frequently unstable.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes how patterns of international cooperation are
   affected if a group of states, led by a major power, pursues a strategy
   of ``contested multilateralism{''} (CM). We conceptualize CM as a
   reaction to deadlock in institutional adjustment bargaining where CM
   lowers the gains actors can reap from cooperation in the short run. We
   demonstrate that, in the long run, CM nevertheless can have positive
   effects on international cooperation and specify when this is the case.
   Because of the costs associated with it, CM conveys a credible signal of
   the resolve of a dissatisfied group of states to contest the
   institutional status quo. Due to this capacity, CM alters the
   institutional and strategic environment within which institutional
   adjustment bargaining takes place. As a result, CM opens up the
   possibility for inter-institutional accommodation that increases
   realized cooperation gains. We probe the plausibility of our theoretical
   reasoning with empirical case studies on competitive regime creation in
   multilateral development finance and on regime-shifting in the
   governance of international trade in genetically modified organisms.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show that domestic violence public policies are
   implemented inconsistently across states under federalism. Using
   original survey data of public defenders across 16 states, with data on
   domestic violence laws, we demonstrate that there are differing policies
   and implementation practices regarding domestic violence cases depending
   on where they are adjudicated. State level domestic violence laws, such
   as mandatory arrest and firearm access restrictions, combined with
   structural elements of the judicial system, and public defender personal
   characteristics, exert significant influence in determining the outcomes
   of domestic violence cases. Overall, our analysis shows that the lack of
   uniformity in the implementation of domestic violence policy creates
   inequality in the criminal justice system's treatment of domestic
   violence and makes personal security for women contingent on where they
   live.},

Abstract = {What explains the nature of a dominant state's systemic crisis response?
   In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, the U.S. acted as
   the hegemon for the world economy, showing `benign' leadership by
   serving as consumer, investor, and lender of last resort. During the
   euro crisis two years later, Germany played a rather different role,
   practicing a more `coercive' form of rules-based leadership within
   Europe's regional context. In this paper, I explain how ideas and crisis
   narratives, informed by national economic traditions, shaped how the
   leading states behaved. By rescuing Charles Kindleberger's original
   version of hegemonic stability theory from both its realist and liberal
   institutionalist interpreters, the paper clarifies why elites in the
   U.S. followed a hardheaded path of soft Keynesian ideas resulting in
   global public goods provision while their counterparts in Germany, be it
   more constrained, opted for a more principled road of rule enforcing
   ordo-liberal ideas avoiding public goods provision. The crucial role of
   ideas - in addition to structural and institutional factors - in
   defining the national interest during periods of crisis helps us better
   understand ``why hegemonic leadership is what states make of it.{''}
   This led American and German elites to interpret Kindleberger in very
   different ways.},

Abstract = {Much more so than previous works in the field of U.S. foreign relations,
   this article explores the relationship between the Helsinki Accords and
   peace activism in the United States. The article explains how well-known
   groups such as U.S. Helsinki Watch and lesser-known ones such as
   Campaign for Peace and Democracy West/East used the Helsinki Final Act
   when they challenged U.S. peace activists to defend the rights of
   imprisoned anti-nuclear activists in the Soviet bloc and to link the
   causes of peace and human rights. The article also demonstrates how the
   exchanges between U.S. human rights and anti-nuclear activists fit into
   transnational debates about linkages between the issues of human rights,
   peace, detente, and the ``Helsinki process.{''}},

Abstract = {This article contributes to debates on algorithmic regulation by
   focusing on the domain of security. It develops
   aninfrastructuralperspective, by analyzing how algorithmic regulation is
   enacted through the custom-built transatlantic data infrastructures of
   the EU-U.S. Passenger Name Records and Terrorism Financing Tracking
   Program programs. Concerning regulationthroughalgorithms, this approach
   analyzes how specific, commercial data are rendered transferable and
   meaningful in a security context. Concerning the regulationofalgorithms,
   an infrastructural perspective examines how public values like privacy
   and accountability are built into international data infrastructures.
   The creation of data infrastructures affects existing modes of
   governance and fosters novel power relations among public and private
   actors. We highlightemergentmodes of standard setting, thus enriching
   Yeung's (2018) taxonomy, and question the practical effects of
   operationalizing public values through infrastructural choices.
   Ultimately, the article offers a critical reading of algorithmic
   security, and how it materially, legally, and politically supports
   specific ways of doing security.},

Abstract = {This exploratory study represents the first attempt at examining the
   politics of exporting Russian higher education to the former Soviet
   countries. The existing numeric and narrative evidence on Russian
   universities' international branch campuses (IBCs) was gathered and
   systematically organized in a new dataset. The study finds that the
   majority of IBCs operating in former Soviet countries are branches of
   Russian universities. While the effectiveness of these IBCs is difficult
   to demonstrate, the study suggests that the Russian Federation uses IBCs
   as a tool to retain and strengthen its political power and influence in
   the region. This is done through a nuanced exploration of the niche of
   Russian IBCs within the differentiated higher educational landscape and
   through the analysis of the Russian state's political rationale for
   establishing and supporting Russian IBCs. The study proposes to
   interpret the politics of exporting Russian higher education using the
   frameworks of neo-imperialism and internationalization.},

Abstract = {The repertoire of policy instruments within a particular policy sector
   varies by jurisdiction; some ``tools of government{''} are associated
   with particular administrative and regulatory traditions and political
   cultures. It is less clear how the instruments associated with a
   particular policy sector may change over time, as economic, social, and
   technological conditions evolve. In the early 2000s, we surveyed and
   analyzed the global repertoire of policy instruments deployed to protect
   personal data. In this article, we explore how those instruments have
   changed as a result of 15 years of social, economic and technological
   transformations, during which the issue has assumed a far higher global
   profile, as one of the central policy questions associated with modern
   networked communications. We review the contemporary range of
   transnational, regulatory, self-regulatory, and technical instruments
   according to the same framework, and conclude that the types of policy
   instrument have remained relatively stable, even though they are now
   deployed on a global scale. While the labels remain the same, however,
   the conceptual foundations for their legitimation and justification are
   shifting as greater emphases on accountability, risk, ethics, and the
   social/political value of privacy have gained purchase. Our analysis
   demonstrates both continuity and change within the governance of
   privacy, and displays how we would have tackled the same research
   project today. As a broader case study of regulation, it highlights the
   importance of going beyond technical and instrumental labels. Change or
   stability of policy instruments does not take place in isolation from
   the wider conceptualizations that shape their meaning, purpose, and
   effect.},

Abstract = {Faith communities play important roles in welcoming migrants into their
   new home societies. This article examines the history of the Roman
   Catholic community's role in integrating immigrants into U.S. society,
   showing how the Church has created a large network of parishes, schools,
   healthcare facilities, and social service agencies that have helped
   immigrants to integrate into U.S. social life. It presents the normative
   stance of Catholicism concerning refugees and migrants, which stresses
   that respect for the dignity of persons requires enabling them to
   participate in a community they can call home, thus facilitating the
   integration of refugees and migrants. Survey data highlight some
   contemporary challenges to the continuing Catholic role in immigrant
   integration, suggesting new ways to strengthen Catholic contributions to
   the integration of immigrants by recalling both the Catholic community's
   memory of its immigrant past and the values of its normative tradition.
   The article sketches several areas where further research could help to
   strengthen the Catholic contribution.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-427},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Debt presents a dilemma to societies: successful societies benefit from
   a substantial infrastructure of consumer, commercial, corporate, and
   sovereign debt but debt can cause substantial private and social harm.
   Pre-crisis and post-crisis solutions have seesawed between subsidizing
   and restricting debt, between leveraging and deleveraging. A consensus
   exists among governments and international financial institutions that
   financial stability is the fundamental normative principle underlying
   financial regulation. Financial stability, however, is insensitive to
   equality concerns and can produce morally impermissible aggregations in
   which the least advantaged in a society are made worse off. Solutions
   based only on financial stability can restrict debt without accounting
   for the risk of harm to persons least able to bear the risk, worsen
   preexisting inequalities, destroy or impair the net worth of households,
   and impose unfavorable distributive consequences. This article offers a
   new approach to assist policymakers in developing and evaluating
   regulation to take criteria in addition to financial stability into
   account, but which do not undermine the aim of financial stability. It
   calls for a luck egalitarian approach, offering policymakers options to
   take the debtor's choices into account while still accounting for
   cognitive mistakes people often make in debt decisionmaking. It offers
   ageneralframework for the underlying principles for the regulation of
   debt: its focus is not on any particular forms of debt or its regulation
   but in structuring debt regulation more generally. It offers a set of
   recommendations on how regulators can take concerns about luck and
   equality into account in regulatory design.},

Abstract = {In recent years, as the number of migrants arriving in Europe has grown,
   faith-based organizations have become intimately involved in assisting
   migrants' short- and long-term integration. This article describes an
   innovative cooperative project between minority (mosque) and majority
   (church) religious institutions designed to enhance integration between
   Muslim migrants and their predominantly Christian host community. Using
   survey and interview data, this study finds that participants reported
   enhanced feelings of welcoming, larger networks of friends and
   acquaintances, and more engagement in activities after participating in
   the project.},

Abstract = {Disasters challenge the equilibrium of regulatory regimes and make
   policy shifts more likely. Using an institutional theory of cultural
   biases and the concept of cultural ``surprise{''}, this article analyses
   the direction and intensity of media argumentation in respect of policy
   shifts. Instead of assuming a demand for greater State intervention
   after dramatic focusing events, as suggested by other theoretical
   frames, cultural theory opens a variety of options that range from
   embracing regulatory responses from different cultural biases to the
   radicalization of current, but failing, instruments. The analysis of
   media reaction to the environmental disasters caused by the oil spills
   of Exxon Valdez (United States), Erika (France) and Prestige (Spain)
   shows that the demand for more hierarchy does not monopolize the overall
   argumentation. The change demanded often implies a radicalization of a
   particular prevalent view where the associated institutional setting is
   failing its supporters.},

Title = {``Drawing the line{''} and other small-scale resistances: exploring
   agency and ambiguity in transnational feminist and queer NGOs},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This article explores the discourses, actors, and cross-border exchanges
   that shape the broader landscape of contemporary transnational feminist
   and queer non-governmental organizations (NGOs). While several studies
   have pointed to the co-opted role of NGOs, fewer have explored the
   potential for NGOs to influence the conditions under which they operate.
   That is what this article sets out to do, with the goal of highlighting
   the potential for feminist and queer NGOs to engage in oppositional
   politics within contexts of neoliberalism. Based on material collected
   during ethnographic fieldwork with transnational feminist and queer
   NGOs, this article examines how NGOs position themselves in relation to
   the political and financial structures that condition their work; how
   and to what effect the emerging professional class of NGO activists
   navigate the contradictory landscapes within which they are located; and
   the ambiguities of cross-border exchanges among NGOs. The article shows
   examples of agency and small-scale resistance, but also illuminates the
   palpable risks of existing neoliberal tendencies among funders and NGOs.
   I conclude that transnational feminist and queer NGOs have much to gain
   from intervening more decisively in such ambiguities as those examined
   in this article.},

Abstract = {We compare three countries where public policy has explicitly sought to
   align incentives of employers and educational institutions around
   closing the gap between skill formation and labor market demand. In
   large, heterogeneous countries such as the United States, Russia and
   China, collaborative arrangements such apprenticeships and other forms
   of public-private partnerships can be constructed at the subnational
   level by building on direct, face-to-face ties across educational,
   business, government, and civic sectors. Drawing on existing literature
   as well as fieldwork studying a number of specific cases in the three
   countries, the paper develops a typology of such arrangements and
   proposes an explanation for the observed variation. It emphasizes the
   importance of two sets of factors: those that induce cooperation on the
   part of firms and schools, and those that influence the character of
   such partnerships.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of European Union (EU) agencies, known as
   `agencification', has been widely studied by scholars of EU governance.
   In spite of the success in explaining the roots of agencies'
   establishment, evidence is lacking about their development over time:
   have they been empowered through new resources, or have their
   capabilities remained the same? Which EU agencies grew the most, and
   why? Ultimately, how much do policymakers value these bodies? Through a
   newly collected longitudinal dataset, the analysis covers EU agencies'
   budgetary trends in the past three decades and assesses the determinants
   of their variation through a cross-sectional time series regression
   analysis and a Traj group-based model. The results show that trends in
   agencies' budgetary allocation follow a punctuated equilibrium pattern.
   The observed variation is explained by EU-level crisis response, by the
   expansion of agencies' tasks and by the type of agency under analysis.},

Abstract = {Departing from the canons of the cultural and material turns, this paper
   emphasizes the shortcomings that each body of work has shown in
   addressing political transformations. So doing, it argues that shifting
   relations between materiality and language occasion different kinds of
   politics. Specifically, the paper offers a new interpretation of one of
   the most critical epochs in the political history of modern Iran, by
   illustrating that the confluence of the material and linguistic worlds
   in the Islamic Republic during the 1980s, brought about a distinct
   political field in which relations between words and their material
   referents became fixed at the level of multitudes. This blocked public
   processes of performativity and resignification of signs in ways that
   might have threatened the centrality of the revolutionary leader, Imam
   Khomeini. What developed was a social milieu in which Khomeini never
   faced the possibility of defeat in politics.},

Abstract = {Although it is no longer a symbol of socially degenerate behavior in
   many societies, single motherhood remains associated with numerous risks
   and disadvantages. In addition to their disadvantages in the labor
   market and their greater risk of poverty, single mothers also tend to be
   less politically active. This article explores the patterns of single
   mothers' electoral participation across 25 European countries. In
   addition to the individual-level characteristics that shape the
   likelihood of taking part in an election, public policies can also do a
   great deal to encourage political involvement. Drawing on data from the
   European Social Survey combined with national family and labor market
   policies, I examine the ways in which policies aiming to reconcile the
   responsibilities at work and home can draw single mothers into political
   engagement. I find that early childhood expenditures and cash benefits
   to families are positively related to single mothers' political
   participation.},

Abstract = {Why do some Chinese local governments include informal workers in their
   welfare systems while others exclude them? This article argues that
   local officials attempt to balance multiple, conflicting, top-down
   career-evaluation criteria by developing different inclusion mechanisms.
   The central mandate to build an inclusive welfare regime incentivizes
   local officials to embrace welfare ``outsiders{''} (informal workers and
   nonlocal workers). However, other top-down policy goals and the locally
   defined citizenship (hukou) system disincentivize the full integration
   of outsiders. Faced with this political dilemma, local officials have
   strategically incorporated different types of outsiders into their
   welfare regimes. Their strategies depend on local labor market
   structures-specifically, the extent to which informal workers overlap
   with nonlocal workers. This hypothesis is tested using an original data
   set derived from thirty-one Chinese provinces, covering the period
   between 2005 and 2015, as well as two rounds of national-level survey
   data. Findings suggest that recent Chinese welfare expansion has
   ironically consolidated, even exacerbated, regional inequality.},

Abstract = {Immigration is envisaged as part of an `emergent cultural cleavage'
   across Western Europe. Within this context, this article explores the
   politicization of immigration in Portugal between 1995 and 2014.
   Politicization is interpreted as being formed by two distinct
   dimensions: salience and polarization of the political claims found
   within news articles extracted from newspapers. Notwithstanding the
   doubling of the foreign population settled in the country in the early
   2000s, the diminished salience and the absence of significant political
   conflict suggest that immigration failed to become politicized in
   Portugal. Drawing on a comparative analysis with seven other European
   states between 1995 and 2009, Portugal observed the lowest rate of
   politicization. Rather than being related with socio-economic factors,
   the lack of politicization of immigration was associated with the
   strategies of the mainstream parties, which successfully prevented the
   emergence of this topic as a significant political cleavage.},

Abstract = {The potential of transnational private governance initiatives to
   constitute effective alternatives to state-led regulation of global
   value chains rests on their ability to scale up and become
   institutionalized in a given sector. This study examines whether such
   institutionalization has occurred in the coffee sector, the commodity
   with the most widespread adoption of certified products and over 30
   years' experience of private governance, and tests hypotheses on
   facilitating and inhibiting conditions. It finds that while norm
   generation around responsible supply chain management and the
   organizational institutionalization of standard-setting bodies is well
   advanced, the practice of internalizing social and environmental
   externalities through the routinized production and purchase of higher
   priced certified goods continues to be questioned by industry actors.
   Indeed, conditions that favored normative and organizational
   institutionalization, such as high levels of industry concentration,
   product differentiation, and deliberative interaction, are shown to
   represent barriers to the practice-oriented institutionalization of
   market-driven regulatory governance.},

Abstract = {Previous research demonstrates that long-standing gender gaps in
   political knowledge are often a function of measurement artifacts. This
   article examines two potential measurement issues - question content and
   format - to determine whether gender differences in knowledge are
   sensitive to decisions we make when choosing and constructing knowledge
   measures. Using an original survey from the 2014 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study (CCES), we demonstrate that, while expected
   gender differences exist when we ask traditional knowledge questions,
   these gender gaps are ameliorated when we employ items that measure
   knowledge about women in politics. We also examine gendered response
   patterns regarding ``don't know{''} responses, which can deflate women's
   knowledge levels. Finally, we examine the determinants of political
   knowledge for women and men, and uncover an important role for political
   interest in shaping women's knowledge levels. These results suggest that
   scholars should take steps to create political knowledge measures that
   can most accurately gauge the political capacities of women and men.},

Abstract = {The United States has turned periodically to a Third Option in the
   pursuit of foreign policy objectives, a pathway between diplomacy and
   war-fighting. This option is known more widely as covert action (CA) or
   ``special activities,{''} meaning hidden interventions into the affairs
   of other nations. Within this rubric are a range of aggressive
   initiatives, from secret propaganda operations to political and economic
   activities, as well as (at the extreme) paramilitary attacks and
   assassinations. This chapter explores the legal foundations of covert
   action, along with the degree to which these methods are subjected to
   accountability; its successes and failures around the world; and,
   central throughout the analysis, the ethical issues posed by use of the
   Third Option.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of a hitherto under-researched set of
   actors - European social partners - in shaping the EU's gender equality
   policies and the conditions in which these policies are adopted and
   implemented. The positions of the social partners are analysed using
   three key policy issues of importance to gender equality: the initiative
   on work-life balance; the European Pillar of Social Rights and the
   European Semester. We argue that social partners play a crucial role in
   shaping EU gender policy both within and outside social dialogues. They
   influence the form and instruments of the EU's gender equality policy;
   shape the meaning of gender equality and participate in the broader
   conflict between the EU's economic and social goals which is crucial for
   the future of the EU's gender policies.},

Abstract = {In the coming century, average temperatures are predicted to increase by
   2.5 to ten degrees Fahrenheit as a result of climate change. Yet
   citizens around the world vary in their perceptions of how serious the
   threat of rising temperatures is. I argue that variation in the
   perceived seriousness of climate change reflects the degree to which
   individuals internalize the welfare of others in society besides
   themselves. I describe and two models of ``other-regarding{''}
   preferences - social welfare maximization and inequity aversion - and
   test their predictions using data from the World Values Survey. I employ
   genetic matching and a difference-in-difference design in order to
   mitigate potential endogeneity. I also explore behavioral implications
   of the theory using original data on climate change-related web
   searches. The empirical tests support the argument: individuals who
   exhibit high levels of other-regarding preferences are more likely to
   express serious concern - and seek out new information - about global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Amid the voluminous documentary record of the Alger Hiss case, one
   document is especially noteworthy: a short memorandum Hiss drafted
   during the Yalta conference in early 1945 setting forth ``Arguments
   against Inclusion of Any of the Soviet Republics among Initial
   Members{''} of the proposed postwar United Nations (UN) organization.
   Drafted when the Soviet Union was pressing for UN membership for two or
   three Soviet republics, the memorandum has been cited to challenge
   claims that Hiss acted as a Soviet agent at Yalta (or at any time) while
   constituting a ``puzzling anomaly{''} for those who believe that Hiss
   was indeed a spy (as indicated in Soviet intelligence documents). By
   considering the circumstances of the memorandum's preparation and
   closely examining its text, this article demonstrates that the
   memorandum does not contravene the notion that Hiss was a Soviet agent
   at the time of the Yalta conference.},

Abstract = {Analytic objectivity as a standard for the US Intelligence Community
   appears to have been drawn from idealized conceptualizations of the
   scientific method as a kind of value-neutral epistemological framework
   used to develop knowledge ``objectively.{''} But this embrace of
   objectivity provides a poor foundation for contemporary
   conceptualizations of the applied epistemology of intelligence analysis,
   as well as performance standards. Instead, intelligence analysts should
   embrace a more realistic goal of aspiring to but never actually
   achieving analytic objectivity through the reduction of subjectivity
   while embracing the values of honesty, neutrality, and integrity
   encapsulated in the phrase ``calling it as you see it{''}.},

Abstract = {Jordan is a small country situated in a turbulent region. It has been
   facing a population pressure due to the influx of refugees from
   neighbouring countries since its establishment in 1921. The latest wave
   of refugees from Syria put extra pressure on the Jordanian population.
   This chapter discusses the potential drivers of population pressure in
   Jordan by reviewing the increase of demand on limited resources and
   pressure on public services and infrastructure. It presents the
   demographic structure of Syrian refugees in comparison to Jordan's
   demographic structure. This chapter shows that Syrian refugees-more than
   1,200,000 in the kingdom-are concentrated in Amman and the northern
   governorates, and the majority of them are under age 15 and women. It
   recommends to the Jordanian government to expand the provision of public
   education and healthcare services in response to the requirements of the
   dominant age category. It also prescribes that the formulation of
   gender-development projects to empower Syrian women who bear the
   household responsibility is an imperative.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how national economic regulation shape the
   impacts of reducing external barriers to services trade for a sample of
   European countries. Notwithstanding far-reaching integration of services
   markets there is significant heterogeneity in domestic regulation and
   governance across European economies. We show this affects the potential
   downstream productivity effects of external services trade policy. In
   some cases, liberalization can substitute for weak regulation; in others
   there is a complementary relationship. Thus, the productivity effects
   associated with services market access liberalization depend on the
   quality of domestic economic regulation. EU-specific measures to promote
   internal trade in services - proxied by implementation of the Services
   Directive - are found not to have such moderating effects. An
   implication of our findings is that EU governments should do more to
   assess how specific dimensions of domestic regulatory regimes influence
   the size and distribution of the effects of services trade reforms.},

Abstract = {Despite an increase in research relating to racial disparities in
   policing-particularly in the area of deadly force-there have been
   comparatively few attempts to theorize which factors predict disparate
   policing. We fill this gap by combining routine activity theory from
   criminology with situationist approaches to discrimination from social
   psychology. We propose that disparate policing is most likely to occur
   when officers who are vulnerable to situational risk factors for bias
   encounter citizens who are members of vulnerable out-groups. We argue
   that situational risk factors for bias and aggression among police
   provoke feelings of threat and motivate self-protection and/or feelings
   of disgust and out-group derogation. We present social psychological
   laboratory research and, where available, field research specific to
   policing as a way of exploring and bolstering the proposed framework.
   This work supports an agenda for future scientific research that may
   assist practitioners in identifying likely opportunities for reform even
   as we await further field research that tests these hypothesized
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Although regions are becoming increasingly important in the
   liberalization of international trade, the academic literature has only
   explored the issue extensively in the case of the European Union (EU).
   With respect to other regions, little is known of the internal factors
   that enhance their external performance. This paper uses EU
   interregional trade negotiations to examine the factors within the EU's
   counterpart region that contribute to regional cohesiveness and
   facilitate the conclusion of an agreement. By applying the crisp-set
   qualitative comparative analysis method to the 13 available cases, this
   paper finds that the external performance of other regions is not
   achieved through a combination of homogeneity of state preferences and
   strong institutions, as the EU literature suggests. While one or other
   of these factors may be necessary, they only work in conjunction with a
   favourable power distribution, that is, regional systems formed by a
   large hegemon and/or small open economies.},

Abstract = {Global governance is widely perceived to be `gridlocked', `unravelling',
   and `unfit for purpose'. The legitimacy of old institutions is breaking
   down, yet new institutions struggle to establish themselves as viable
   alternatives. Though overlooked, global development governance is no
   exception. Heterogeneous development actors, approaches, and
   understandings increasingly characterize the field. However, attempts to
   create a common platform have foundered. This article contributes to a
   growing body of literature that depicts world order as a Gramscian
   `interregnum' to account for the crisis facing global development. Its
   primary contribution lies in the examination of the Global Partnership
   for Effective Development Cooperation as a vantage point to explore the
   politics, dynamics and struggles over the means and ends of
   `development' in the current conjuncture. Here, competing projects vie
   for influence, yet none command the support necessary to supplant the
   `old' order. Although this article finds that the condition of
   `interregnum' will likely persist, it also explores what transformative
   elements of a possible future exist within present practices.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore the factors that determine delegation of
   implementation in project aid. In particular, focusing on the importance
   of informational asymmetry between levels of government, we empirically
   assess whether this choice is influenced by the relative importance of
   the local information at the recipient country level. Moreover, we test
   whether this choice can in turn influence project performance. Using
   information on more than 5800 World Bank projects for the period
   1995-2014, and controlling for characteristics at both country and
   project level, we find that transparency does influence the probability
   that a project is implemented locally rather than nationally. More
   specifically, a one standard deviation decline in transparency increases
   the probability of a locally implemented project by three percentage
   points. We also find that a local implementing agency may increase the
   probability of a successful project only up to a certain level of a
   country's transparency.},

Abstract = {We examine the global ownership structure of firms in the context of the
   investment regime. Investment agreements extend valuable privileges to
   firms invested abroad. But, these privileges only apply to firms whose
   assets are owned in a country that has signed an agreement with their
   host market; firms lack protections under investment agreements for many
   of their target markets. We argue that, by strategically locating
   subsidiaries in `transit' countries, firms systematically expand their
   access to investment agreements. This firm-specific access to investment
   agreements through transit countries also has implications for
   investment flows: Transit countries receive more inflows and outflows of
   investment. Moreover, the impact of agreements declines over time and
   treaty partners, as seemingly newly protected firms have previously
   gained coverage through subsidiaries. Drawing on subsidiary location
   choices of the world's largest firms, as well as data on firm ownership
   structures and aggregate investment flows, we present systematic
   evidence consistent with this argument. The paper highlights the
   importance of the global ownership structure of firms in an environment
   of heterogeneous international rules and discusses new distributional
   consequences of the investment regime.},

Abstract = {The International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted three militia
   commanders - Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda -
   for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ituri, in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo. However, none of these convictions have
   resulted in a cessation of violence in the region, as recent events have
   illustrated. Although the ICC is one initiative aimed at securing peace
   in Ituri, the extent of the ICC's engagement with this particular
   context presents a good opportunity to reflect on its limited
   contribution and to illustrate the structural violence problems that
   underlie most, if not all, ICC situations and cases in Africa.
   Furthermore, it will be argued that the ICC can redeem itself from its
   embeddedness within the liberal peacebuilding paradigm by judicialising
   the economic realities of violence, thereby combating some of the worst
   effects of structural violence.},

Abstract = {To understand what placement outside of one's home means to the young
   people involved, we must understand foster care from a life course
   perspective. I analyze young people's experiences in foster care from
   this perspective, accounting for when foster care happens, how long it
   lasts, and what happens when foster care placements end. I show that the
   population of children coming into foster care is younger and less urban
   than it was 20 years ago. I also show reliable measures of exposure to
   foster care over the life course. Children who enter care early in life
   are the children who spend the largest proportion of their childhood in
   foster care-a fact that rarely weighs on the policymaking process. We
   know very little about state and local variation in foster care
   placement rates, not to mention the influence of social services, the
   courts, foster parents, and caseworkers over foster children, so I close
   by arguing investment in research should be a clear policy priority.},

Abstract = {This article starts from the premise that International Political
   Economy (IPE) literature - with some notable exceptions - has a blind
   spot for the colonial and contested histories of financial
   infrastructures. Often considered to be the mere `plumbing' of
   international finance, financial infrastructures instead are profoundly
   political and rooted in long-term colonial histories. To start
   addressing these blind spots, the article draws on literatures in
   critical infrastructure studies, that offer understandings of
   infrastructure as lively, contested and profoundly political. The
   argument is that attending to infrastructure inevitably brings into view
   the postcolonial nature of contemporary capitalism and finance. The
   article draws a parallel between the ways in which inequities and
   dis/connectivities became hard-wired into early modern financial
   infrastructures, and the ways in which new inequities and disconnections
   are hard-wired into present-day financial infrastructures through
   security sanctions. It uses the case of the contemporary payment
   infrastructure wars, whereby the SWIFT infrastructure is used to enforce
   sanctions policies, as example to develop the arguments.},

Abstract = {In the present study, a GTAP CGE model is used to assess three proposed
   scenarios for the DCFTA between the EU and Ukraine, one for unilateral
   trade liberalisation, another for bilateral trade liberalisation with
   exemptions from free trade and a third for bilateral trade
   liberalisation without exemptions from free trade. The main point of
   distinction of this study is the inclusion of exemptions from free trade
   in the first two simulated scenarios and the possibility of a
   quantitative evaluation of exemptions from free trade through the
   differences between scenarios 3 and 2.},

Abstract = {Given the growing importance of state subsidies as a source of party
   income, several countries have introduced policies that link the
   provision of party funding to the promotion of gender equality in
   political representation. Variations in the assignment of public
   funding-that is, financial incentives and cuts-are increasingly employed
   to promote equal gender participation in intraparty politics and in
   public office. However, we know little about why and how these equality
   promotion policies have been adopted in different countries, how they
   work in practice, and, most importantly, what effects they have on
   women's representation. To contribute to this debate, after embedding
   gender-targeted public funding regulations in the broader set of
   political representation policies and presenting a comparative overview
   of existing rules in the European Union, the article concentrates on the
   Italian case. We examine the evolution of Italian regulation of gender
   electoral financing and the extent to which the Italian parties have
   complied with the rules over time. The results show that this set of
   policy instruments, when poorly designed, is nothing more than symbolic
   policy. The lack of appropriate mechanisms for sanctions and rewards,
   which can induce parties to change their behavior, has hampered the
   effectiveness of these policy measures.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {711-737},

Abstract = {Previous research shows that candidate sex serves as a heuristic that
   lessens the informational burden of political decision making. Building
   upon this research, we investigate the heuristic effects of candidate
   sex on the decision to turnout to vote in an election. We posit that by
   providing ideological and nonideological information about the
   candidates, candidate sex serves as an informational shortcut that
   reduces the costs associated with voting and enhances the likelihood of
   voting in elections when a female candidate is present. Our expectations
   are supported, even after controlling for a variety of individual-,
   candidate- and district-level characteristics that are correlated with
   turnout. Individuals are more likely to turnout in elections featuring a
   woman candidate, and consistent with our expectations, these effects are
   especially strong for female Democrats, whose sex and party heuristics
   convey a consistent ``liberal{''} cue. Our research offers theoretical
   and empirical contributions to the literature on gender, candidate
   heuristics, and voter turnout.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes recent attempts to integrate the value of
   knowledge into global economic statistics. It outlines how emerging
   human capital accounting (HCA) standards apply concepts developed to
   value physical capital goods to the skills embodied in national
   populations, making its value dependent on lifetime labor market
   incomes. The intellectual legacy of neoclassical capital theory thereby
   frames the way in which the value of knowledge is understood in
   contemporary global governance in politically consequential ways.
   Drawing upon Karl Polanyi and recent literature on the political economy
   of measurement, it argues these methodologies reproduce the `economistic
   fallacy', as they assume the exchange value of educational investment
   can be meaningfully isolated from its broader economic, cultural and
   social functions. Such metrics consequently naturalize politically
   contestable assumptions, reflecting comparative institutional factors
   rather than the substantive contribution of education to human welfare.
   A case study of the influence of HCA on the World Bank's Human Capital
   Project demonstrates how the diffusion of these valuation methods has
   implications for which national policy agendas are deemed `sustainable',
   particularly within debates on the future of welfare policy. This case
   illustrates the wider importance of global accounting practices in
   constructing national economic policy space.},

Abstract = {During the sovereign debt crisis the ECB and ECJ were constrained by two
   main factors: pressures from the Crisis Management Mechanism and the
   sovereign debt markets. Contributions claiming that the European
   Economic Constitution was transformed did not recognize that European
   policy makers managed to preserve its main features by reinforcing the
   role of the market. Other contributions, which claim that the sovereign
   debt crisis was solved only because of the active role assumed by
   independent institutions like the ECB and the ECJ, are also devoid of
   analysis of the underlying causes, which implicitly incentivized or
   hindered the responses from independent institutions. A unified
   synthetic approach could provide a better explanation for the trade-offs
   faced by independent institutions during four peak moments of the
   sovereign debt crisis: the ECJ's decisions on the ESM and the OMT, and
   the ECB's decisions to start the OMT and emergency liquidity provision
   for Greek banks.},

Abstract = {Recent reforms in the reporting and monitoring process, in particular
   enabled by advances in digital technology, have made three main
   contributions to the European Commission's capacity to monitor member
   states' compliance with EU environmental law. First, quicker access to
   data has been achieved by increased levels of publicly available
   electronic data, data processing by the European Environmental Agency,
   and data harvesting at EU level. Second, comparability of data has been
   improved by a change to indicator reporting from textual-based
   reporting. Finally, improved data from the EU's Earth observation
   programme, Copernicus, allows better real-time access to data and
   double-check the information provided by the member states. These
   findings suggest that the digital transformation opens new opportunities
   for strengthening the Commission's role as enforcer of EU law. However,
   the improvements in the Commission's monitoring capacity are recent, and
   quicker access to better data is only one among a number of factors
   influencing its monitoring capacity.},

Title = {Provincializing economics: Jevons, Marshall and the colonial imaginaries
   of free trade},

Abstract = {Contemporary economics speaks about trade in the familiar abstractions
   of comparative advantage, tracing the modern formulation of the case for
   free trade made in terms of welfare maximization to late-Victorian
   economists like W. Stanley Jevons and Alfred Marshall. Though Jevons and
   Marshall did formalize theories that treat countries as if they are
   abstract individuals, a closer reading suggests that their thinking on
   trade was informed by colonial imaginaries of civilization and race. The
   economics invented by Jevons and Marshall manages claims about human
   sameness and difference in a particularly colonial fashion. They both
   slide readily and uncertainly between the idea that parts of humanity
   are permanently lesser races and explaining lesser humans as simply
   developmentally backward. The latter might achieve full physiological
   and moral humanity over time through the improvements (and attendant but
   necessary suffering) administered by Empireviamarket competition. They
   sometimes point to a common set of desires and calculating capacities,
   but never so decisively as contemporary economics. Jevons takes these
   commonalities as the basis of a quantitative science of economics, but
   doubts their empirical universality. Marshall sees these traits as
   distinctively modern and achieved onlyviathe rise of modern
   institutions. By contrast, contemporary economics insists on the
   universality of these traits, claiming for economics a distinctive
   ``analytical egalitarianism.{''} But difference is only defined away by
   fiat in contemporary textbooks and where difference arises, as in the
   problem of uneven development, the colonial impulse of economics
   remains. The connection to Jevons' and Marshall's own colonial
   management of difference becomes sharply visible. To return to Jevons
   and Marshall allows us to provincialize economics.},

Abstract = {The essay investigates the revisionism of great powers, namely Russia,
   the United States and China. We study intermestic configurations,
   linking domestic populism, the presidential power of national leaders as
   expressed by their strategic narratives, and each state's international
   revisionist posture. In each case, we identify a different style of
   revisionism: Russia's `guerrilla' great power revisionism, the Trumpian
   anti-doctrine revisionism, and China's revisionist quest for power and
   status. We argue that the different revisionist trajectories of these
   great powers contribute to the multifaceted and uneven unmaking of
   global liberal internationalism and liberal norms rather than to a
   coherent revisionist challenge.},

Abstract = {How does the prospect of accession to an international union affect a
   non-member-state government's incentives to implement political and
   economic liberalization reforms? To answer this question, we propose an
   informational mechanism of international union accession conditionality
   drawing on Benabou and Tirole's (The Review of Economic Studies, 70,
   489-520,2003) formalization of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In a
   Bayesian game of union accession between asupranationalprincipal (e.g.,
   EU Commission) and anationalagent (e.g., the government of the target
   country), we find that the extrinsic bonus of post-accession transfers
   may on the one hand reinforce the agent's short-term incentives to meet
   the accession criteria but on the other hand can also ``crowd out{''}
   its intrinsic motivation to liberalize and comply with the
   union'sacquisin the long run. As a result, we expect that (i)
   net-recipient countries' post-accession pace of reform may decline or
   even turn negative over time (temporaleffect), (ii) the crowding-out
   effect will be stronger for countries that enjoy higher levels of
   distributive net transfers and those that go through a lengthier
   negotiation period (spatialeffect), and (iii) early liberalizers areex
   antemore likely to be officially selected as union candidate members,
   accept the accession contract, and implement the required reforms. We
   illustrate the theoretical mechanism and dynamics of the model with
   anecdotal evidence from two paired comparisons in respect to the effects
   ofeconomicconditionality attached to EMU accession (Greece vs. Spain)
   andpoliticalconditionality attached to EU accession (Hungary vs.
   Estonia).},

Title = {China's Engagement with R2P: Pluralist Shaper?},
Journal = {GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-298},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recently, the behaviour of emerging powers in relation to R2P has been
   understood as that of norm-shapers: states that seek to adjust the norm
   so that it conforms to their particular understandings. In this
   behaviour, respect for sovereignty is seen as a central concern. In the
   English School of International Relations, identification with the
   institution of sovereignty reflects an approach called pluralism.
   China's behaviour is consistent with a pluralist approach to
   international relations. This paper aims to examine the Chinese
   positions regarding R2P, in order to identify pluralist traits in them.
   The procedure was to raise, inductively, prescriptions made by China,
   associating them with theoretical categories. From an analysis of the
   Chinese positions, it can be demonstrated that China's behaviour reveals
   a paradigmatic case of a pluralist normshaper. Qualitative Content
   Analysis techniques were used as a methodological approach, while
   MAXQDAplus software was applied as a tool to aid in the coding of
   declarations.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the debate about the centrality of home
   ownership in conceptualising and understanding the contemporary
   political economy through the introduction of a social harm framework.
   It demonstrates how the focus on social harm offers a more holistic view
   of the harmful consequences of the privileging of home ownership within
   the context of political economy. It does so, firstly, by demonstrating
   the negative medium- and long-term social harms of current housing
   policies in the UK, namely financial/economic harm, cultural safety and
   physical, emotional and psychological harms. Secondly, it is possible to
   draw attention to these harms for individuals or groups that seemingly
   believe, or are commonly seen to have, benefited from the current
   structure of home ownership in the UK. And thirdly, it highlights the
   transformative potential of the social harm approach in terms of
   developing an alternative to the current variety of residential
   capitalism in the UK.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance technology in
   intelligence agencies and oversight bodies is notably lacking.
   Assessments of surveillance technology concerning legal compliance,
   cost, and matters of privacy occupy a solid place, but effectiveness is
   rarely considered. Bureaucracy may explain this absence. Applying James
   Q. Wilson's observations on bureaucracy reveals that effectiveness is
   minimally treated because it is more difficult to evaluate than budget
   assessments and legal compliance, and because intelligence outcomes are
   unobservable and difficult to oversee. Effectiveness evaluation is thus
   fettered by bureaucracy. Considerations of bringing in effectiveness
   assessment must appreciate the realities of bureaucratic constraints to
   be successful.},

Abstract = {International norms and rules are created in international negotiations.
   A comprehensive survey shows that the satisfaction with negotiation
   outcomes varies between delegates, states and International
   Organizations (IOs), which is important as it has potential
   ramifications for state compliance and the effectiveness of the
   international rules and norms. This paper investigates which role
   individual, country and IO features and their interactions play for
   satisfaction with international negotiation outcomes. Drawing on
   approaches of international negotiation and cooperation, hypotheses on
   individual, country and IO features are specified and examined
   empirically with a multilevel analysis. This reveals that especially
   individual and IO level features impact outcome satisfaction. Outcome
   satisfaction increases if delegates put in much work in negotiations and
   can conduct them flexibly and if IOs are small in size, and have
   institutional designs that seek to foster debates. The paper also shows
   that there are cross-level interaction effects. Most notably, the
   positive effect of flexibility on high outcome satisfaction is less
   pronounced when negotiations are more strongly characterized by
   bargaining dynamics. Vice-versa, when IOs are prone to arguing dynamics
   all actors become more satisfied.},

Abstract = {This article examines alleged Czechoslovak assistance to the Italian
   extreme-left terrorist organisation, the Red Brigades, and how the case
   has been investigated in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic. The
   authors present the sources of information on the issue and analyse the
   course of the investigation undertaken by the Office for the
   Documentation and Investigation of the Crimes of Communism. In the
   absence of a complete archival record, given that important documents
   were shredded, the full truth about the fact and nature of any
   Czechoslovak assistance may never be known. Yet there are some grounds
   for speculation that assistance was granted by elements within the
   Czechoslovak secret services, and that these elements failed to inform
   the Communist Party leadership about their actions. However, it is not
   possible to confirm this on the basis of available documents.},

Abstract = {Although the populist radical right is generally seen as a particularly
   masculine and misogynist phenomenon, several of its parties have female
   leaders. The most prominent is Marine Le Pen, president of the French
   National Rally (formerly the National Front) and unofficial leader of
   the European populist radical right. Using insights from
   intersectionality theory, we posit that Marine Le Pen, as a female
   populist radical right politician, faces qualitatively different media
   coverage than both her female and her radical right counterparts. In
   this study, we analyze her media framing in two French (Le Figaro and Le
   Monde) and two U.S. (New York Times and Wall Street Journal) newspapers,
   focusing on the application of gender and populist radical right frames.
   We find that the ``harder{''} populist radical right frame dominates the
   ``softer{''} gender frame in all four newspapers, but, paradoxically,
   the combination of the two frames leads to overall less biased coverage
   of Marine Le Pen compared with both other female and other populist
   radical right politicians. In the conclusion, we discuss some of the
   consequences of the findings for the broader study of female
   politicians, most notably, theories of intersectionality and the double
   bind for women in leadership.},

Title = {Eurovisions: An Exploration and Explanation of Public Preferences for

Abstract = {Public opinion on the EU has received growing attention in the last
   decades, with an ever-increasing number of studies examining various
   aspects of it. Surprisingly, most studies focus on attitudes towards the
   past and present of the EU, yet we know very little about public
   attitudes towards the future of the EU. This study helps to fill this
   research gap by examining attitudes towards the EU's long-term future
   using a novel approach. We developed eight concrete future EU scenarios
   based on an inductive analysis of qualitative survey data. Subsequently,
   respondents (in an independent survey) ranked their top three scenarios
   according to individual preferences. Using multidimensional unfolding,
   we show that these preferences form three clusters ordered along a more
   versus less EU dimension. In a second step, we used multinomial logistic
   regression to examine not only who supports which scenario
   (socio-demographics) but also which EU attitudes lead to which future
   preferences. The analyses identify distinct characteristics and
   attitudes that drive people's preference for a given scenario. Overall,
   we find that factors such as occupational levels or left-right attitudes
   are strong determinants of preferences for the future of the EU, and
   that specific EU support (performance and utilitarian evaluations) is
   more important than diffuse EU support (identity and affect).},

Abstract = {Within the context of the debates on the worldwide rise of populism,
   this article aims to uncover factors that may reduce the vulnerability
   of a system to populist challenges. Based on existing theories, Hungary,
   Latvia and Romania are all susceptible to populism but authoritarian
   populism has emerged only in Hungary. This puzzle is addressed through
   examining the process of financial crisis management in the three cases
   and its impact on the political system. Comparative analysis shows that
   paternalistic expectations of the state and the government's willingness
   to accept Russian support distinguish Hungary from Latvia and Romania.},

Abstract = {In 2014-2016, the central Ukrainian city of Poltava witnessed the
   demolition of a Lenin monument and the construction of a monument
   dedicated to the Ukrainian Cossack hetman Ivan Mazepa. Taking this
   alteration of the cityscape as a case study, this article examines the
   change and continuity of political order in post-communist Ukraine in
   general, and in post-Maidan Ukraine specifically. By investigating the
   contested meanings of monuments in the city, the article uncovers
   various ethnonational, religious, political and gender-specific features
   of Ukrainian society. In so doing, it builds upon the scholarly
   literature that investigates the symbolic role of monuments in political
   transformation and draws on a range of data sources including the
   observation of monuments, policy documents and media coverage.},

Abstract = {The article suggests an exegesis of the conceptual tenets introduced by
   the EUGS. By focusing on the two disruptive concepts that have come
   forward in the document - principled pragmatism and resilience - it aims
   at unveiling the new role the EUGS allocates to the EU, especially in
   its neighbourhood. This recalls the Socratic maieutic method, blending
   the cognitive, aspirational and performative aspects suggested by
   principled pragmatism and resilience. Instead of spreading norms
   especially in its neighbourhood, the EU would rather engage selectively
   in a wider space, pragmatically supporting the others becoming
   resilient. While recognizing local agency and disowning the `one size
   fits all' principle, this new role still legitimates the EU to influence
   the outside, although not structurally. This shift tends to
   de-politicize external actions, with the risk of obfuscating the
   question of accountability and responsibility while maintaining the
   capability to influence.},

Abstract = {The realisation of some neoliberal reforms depends on the public's
   behaviour. Given that, how do neoliberal elites operate to advance
   behavioural changes in the public? This question is particularly acute
   for neoliberals, who concurrently emphasize individuals' `right to
   choose' and their obligation to `make the right choice'. While the
   literature commonly focuses on either ideational persuasion or on
   practice-based measures (nudge), this paper identifies an additional
   instrument: the construction of `model experiences' - experiences that
   provide common citizens with a model for their future behaviour. By
   constructing model experiences, neoliberal elites aim to influence mass
   behaviour on two interrelated levels: first, through the practical
   training offered by the experience itself, and second, through the wider
   lessons that can be conveyed to the participants who reflect on the
   experience. We illustrate this argument with a case study of a model
   experience of household financialisation: Israel's Saving for Every
   Child program.},

Abstract = {Foreign aid relationships are valuable to donors as a means of improving
   development outcomes and influencing recipient country policy. The
   emergence of new donors can lead to competition as donors vie for
   influence over recipient government policy and attention. How does such
   competition affect the behavior of traditional donors? I draw attention
   to how the rise of China as a provider of development finance is
   changing the type of development that traditional donors support.
   Chinese development finance is particularly targeted at large
   infrastructure projects, and this focus can exert pressure on
   traditional donors. I suggest traditional donors can either emulate
   China's approach to development, i.e. offer projects in
   infrastructure-intensive sectors, or differentiate themselves and
   specialize in alternative approaches to development, e.g. focus on
   governance and social sector interventions. I test this using data on
   the terms of World Bank and Chinese development finance in over 100
   countries. I find the World Bank responds to competitive pressure from
   China by emulating the Chinese emphasis on infrastructure, allocating a
   greater share of its development projects in infrastructure-intensive
   sectors when recipient countries receive more Chinese development
   finance. Furthermore, subnational data shows that the World Bank also
   emulates China's approach to development in response to competition at
   the regional level. China's growing role as a provider of development
   finance affects traditional donor behavior, shaping the type of
   development donors support by introducing bottom-up competitive
   pressure.},

Abstract = {Swiss trading houses enjoy 35\% of global market share in crude oil. How
   can we explain the importance of Swiss traders in the global oil market?
   This article argues that Swiss trading houses are part of the private
   governance arrangements that emerged in response to the wave of
   nationalization sweeping across the world's prime oil producers. As the
   global crude supply chains deverticalized following nationalization,
   companies created mechanisms to manage the problems of price-setting,
   and matching suppliers and consumers. By tracing state and private
   governance before and after the 1970 nationalizations, we show that the
   new model of oil market governance also aligned with the state goals of
   ensuring the reliable oil supply at adequate prices - energy security.
   The article contributes theoretically to the scholarly debate on private
   governance, and to an emerging literature on the political economy of
   commodities. It also challenges the dominant state-centered approaches
   in the international political economy of oil.},

Abstract = {Regulation increasingly mandates collaborative approaches to increase
   stakeholder input and streamline approval processes. However,
   understanding how to maintain stakeholder involvement over the course of
   a long collaborative process is vital to optimize effectiveness. This
   paper observes more than 700 stakeholders involved in developing and
   implementing a dam operating license over 16 years. We use text mining
   and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to observe meeting attendance and
   recorded actions in meeting minutes. We find that involvement decreased
   after the initial planning phase, but steadily increased through license
   development and implementation. After the regulatory mandate to consult
   with external stakeholders dissolved, overall attendance declined while
   attendance stability increased, meaning that the non-mandatory stage
   involved a smaller cadre of dedicated actors. This indicates that
   high-performing mandated stakeholder involvement processes rely on a
   constrained group of conveners to sustain interaction and have less
   turnover than what might be expected given existing evidence from
   grassroots involvement; assumptions about group dynamics based on
   involvement in grassroots processes may lead to improper predictions
   about who will participate, and how, in processes where stakeholder
   involvement is mandated.},

Abstract = {Scholars have recently shown renewed interest in the study of
   party-interest group ties. According to previous studies, traditional
   ties between parties and organized interest are a matter of the past.
   Globalization, deindustrialization, and neoliberalism have posed serious
   challenges to their survival. Recent contributions suggest that, while
   these ties are indeed weaker than before, they have not disappeared. How
   do parties and groups protect their ties? This paper attempts to provide
   a partial, though often neglected, answer: their relationship survives
   when both actors work together to protect it. While previous literature
   identified regulatory policies, such as ethics and transparency
   regulations, as detrimental to party-group ties, their introduction is
   erroneously treated as independent from these ties. Through a
   comparative case study of the introduction of lobbying laws in Austria,
   Australia, and Ireland, this paper suggests that parties and groups
   shape the content of lobbying regulations in such a way to protect their
   relationship.},

Abstract = {The Voices of Memory project started with a fairly simple premise: to
   highlight women's life experiences under dictatorship. What started as a
   one-week workshop in 2017 evolved into a collaborative process of
   co-creation - the Voices of Memory project using creative means of
   expression to help raise awareness of the impact of repression on
   Tunisian women. A formative principle, and primary contribution of this
   project, was a fully collaborative methodology. In this article, we
   reflect on and make explicit an approach we adopted intuitively and
   experimentally, drawing also on best practice in participatory action
   research and methods of co-creation.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the communication tools employed by the EU and
   the People's Republic of China to project themselves as normative actors
   and their construction of specific role conceptions in the context of
   global climate change negotiations. The empirical spine of the article
   consists of a discourse analysis of 134 documents released by the EU and
   China on the issue of climate change and climate change negotiations
   between the 2008 Copenhagen and the 2015 Paris climate summits. The
   findings are that both the EU and China go to great lengths to position
   themselves as responsible global citizens, employing relatively
   consistent framing devices. Not only are the findings interesting when
   it comes to EU and China identity-building as foreign policy actors;
   they also hint at more generic parameters along which the role of
   normative actor is constructed.},

Abstract = {Using materials from the Russian Foreign Ministry archive in Moscow
   (combined with previously obtained Brazilian and U.S. sources), this
   research note presents fresh evidence about Soviet-Brazilian relations
   and the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis, supplementing a detailed,
   two-part article published in the Journal of Cold War Studies in 2004
   exploring Brazil's secret mediation between John F. Kennedy and Fidel
   Castro at the height of the crisis. The new evidence illuminates a
   previously hidden ``double game{''} that Brazil's president, Joao
   Goulart, played during the crisis as he alternated between meetings with
   the U.S. ambassador and Nikita Khrushchev's recently arrived envoy
   (Brazil and the Soviet Union had just restored diplomatic relations
   after a fifteen-year break). The new evidence from Moscow suggests that
   Goulart, who vowed solidarity with Washington and even toasted Kennedy's
   ``victory{''} when talking to the U.S. ambassador, took a completely
   different approach when speaking to Soviet officials, expressing strong
   sympathy and even support for Khrushchev.},

Abstract = {This article explores the key issues in China's changing relations with
   the Arab countries and Israel from 1963 to 1975. Based on interviews,
   archival sources, and other materials, the article shows Beijing's
   attempts to justify its self-portrait as the only genuine patron of
   ``national liberation movements{''} and to help foster the conditions
   for revolution in the Middle East by supporting a ``people's war{''}
   against Israel. Although this radical design failed after the
   liquidation of Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan in the 1970s and the
   U.S.-Chinese rapprochement soon thereafter, the Sino-Soviet competition
   in the 1970s still gave enormous impetus to the visibility of the
   Palestine Liberation Organization in the international arena. The
   article discusses the roles of Chinese Communist leaders and diplomats
   in formulating Beijing's policy toward the Arab-Israeli conflict, which
   also served Mao Zedong's domestic mobilization before and during the
   Cultural Revolution. The article thus highlights a special connection
   across the international and domestic dimensions of China's Cold War
   experience.},

Abstract = {The article explores the Russia-Ukraine crisis of 2014 in the context of
   post-communist nationalism and the disintegration of the post-Soviet
   space. The focus is on the politicisation of the ethno-linguistic divide
   and historical narratives in the interplay between Russia's
   determination to control Ukraine's political future and Ukraine's
   resolve to free itself from Russian influence. In highlighting the
   incompatibility between Russian and Ukrainian nationalising projects, it
   is argued that while the Ukrainian crisis is not an ethnic conflict per
   se, nationalism was a significant contributory factor in fuelling the
   conflict and remains a relevant obstacle to its resolution.},

   newspapers, Uriadovyi Kurier and Rossiiskaya Gazeta, represent people
   displaced by the war in Donbas, analysing the political goals revealed
   by these publications' attitudes towards the displaced. While the
   Ukrainian publication delimits the nation by distinguishing `real'
   internally displaced people (IDPs) deserving help and `fake' IDPs guilty
   of siphoning Ukrainian taxpayers' money to rebel-held areas, the Russian
   paper foregrounds the Russian state's competence in managing
   displacement while silencing the displaced themselves.},
