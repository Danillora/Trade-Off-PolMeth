Abstract = {Peter Mair argued that political parties and society are withdrawing
   from each other, thus creating a `void' in the heart of representation
   in many established democracies. However, Members of Parliament (MPs)
   are increasing the time and resources devoted to constituency work. This
   article explores how MPs, as parties' representatives, engage with
   constituents, and whether this work takes the disconnected form expected
   in a political void. Interviews with 20 Australian state legislators
   show MPs building policy, service, symbolic and partisan connections
   with citizens. Though parties no longer definitively structure
   representation, these findings highlight the importance of understanding
   party-society relationships in the constituency.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Whether from a sincere belief in the ability of the body politic to
   arrive at optimal decisions, or in an instrumental attempt to generate
   legitimacy for policy choices, a large number of jurisdictions use the
   referendum to settle political questions. This practice relies on
   assumptions about voter interest and competence that merit empirical
   testing. We conduct a series of survey experiments that leverage
   variation in wording from a set of arcane ballot provisions from
   elections in Texas. We find that (1) voters are largely confused about
   the meaning of such ballot provisions; (2) efforts to improve the
   wording of such provisions and educate voters has minimal impact on
   their comprehension; (3) voters are easily persuaded to change their
   vote when given the chance; and (4) voters rely heavily on default
   answers (especially ``yes{''}) in casting their votes. On the whole, the
   evidence suggests that narrow referendum questions that lack clear
   ideological or informational cues overwhelm the limits of citizen
   competence, and are thus likely to result in unstable and unreliable
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on public opinion towards the face veiling of Muslim
   women and investigates the possibility of identifying different groups
   of citizens supporting distinct combinations of arguments regarding face
   veiling criticisms. Two groups are expected to argue for or against face
   veiling. Also, two other groups are expected to vary depending on their
   idea of liberalism inherent in face-veiling arguments: a specific way of
   life versus respect for different ways of life. Using latent class
   (regression) analysis, the findings show that different groups emerged
   and that the political leftists were more diverse regarding argument
   patterns than the political rightists. Following the debate of why many
   political leftists have negative attitudes towards religious practices,
   this study does not find empirical support that anti-Muslim and
   anti-Islam attitudes systematically differ between the observed groups.},

   Voters at the 2017 Bundestag Election},

Abstract = {Immigrants now constitute a sizeable and rapidly growing group among
   many Western countries' electorates, but analyses of their party
   preferences remain limited. Theoretically, immigrants' party preferences
   might be explained with both standard electoral theories and
   immigrant-specific approaches. In this article, we rigorously test both
   perspectives against each other using the most recent data from Germany.
   Applying the Michigan model, with its three central explanatory
   variables - party identification, issue orientations and candidate
   evaluations - to the party preferences of immigrant-origin and native
   voters, we find that this standard model can explain both groups well.
   In contrast, we find no direct effects of the most prominent
   immigrant-specific variables, and neither do these meaningfully moderate
   the Michigan variables. However, we find strong formative effects on the
   presence of political attitudes and beliefs: immigrants with a longer
   time spent in Germany, a stronger German identity and less experience of
   discrimination report significantly fewer item non-responses for the
   Michigan model's main explanatory variables.},

Abstract = {Why are high-income and low-income earners not significantly polarized
   in their support for progressive income taxation? This article posits
   that the affluent fail to recognize that they belong to the high-income
   income group and this misperception affects their preferences over
   progressive taxation. To explain this mechanism theoretically, I
   introduce a formal model of subjective income-group identification
   through self-comparison to an endogenous reference group. In making
   decisions about optimal tax rates, individuals then use these subjective
   evaluations of their own income group and earnings of other groups.
   Relying on ISSP data, I find strong evidence for the model's empirical
   implications: most high-income earners support progressive taxation when
   they identify themselves with a lower group. Additionally, individuals
   who overestimate the earnings of the rich are more likely to support
   progressive taxation.},

   Evidence from a survey experiment in Peru},

Abstract = {Two issue frames quickly emerged in policy and media communications
   about COVID-19 lockdown measures. Initially, a public health frame
   advocated for strong quarantine policies to slow the spread of the
   virus. As the economic costs associated with quarantine measures became
   clear, an economic frame pushed for an end to (or a relaxation of) these
   measures to alleviate the economic damage associated with lockdowns. We
   do not know much about how these competing communication frames affected
   lockdown support, especially in poor- and middle-income countries. To
   explore this question, we embedded a framing experiment in a nationally
   representative telephone survey in May 2020 in Peru, one of the world's
   hardest-hit countries by the coronavirus pandemic. The vignette
   experiment reveals that the economic frame produces a decrease in public
   support for quarantine measures in Peru. In contrast, respondents
   exposed to a health frame do not increase their approval of the same
   measures.},

   Relations and Fighting the New Cold War},
Journal = {RUSSIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {503-530},

Abstract = {The article challenges the view that Russia's goal in the post-Soviet
   space is to make the region an exclusive zone of Russian influence and
   keep other world powers out entirely. In fact, Russia has two policies
   towards the influence of other powers that are active in the region: a
   `business as usual' approach, applied to China and Turkey; and a
   securitized `New Cold War policy', applied to the US and West
   (especially towards their presence in Ukraine). Growing Chinese and
   Turkish influence has not been `securitized, although the presence of
   both powers creates clear obstacles to the reintegration of former
   Soviet countries around Russia. The article draws on three bodies of
   literature (Realism, Liberalism and Constructivism) to explain this
   variation. While Moscow perceives growing Western influence in Ukraine
   as a threat to its domestic regime and identity as a great power and
   regional leader, it finds common ground with Beijing and Ankara in its
   concerns about the Western liberal democracy promotion agenda and views
   both powers as potential allies in the construction of a `multipolar
   world'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strength of support for direct democracy among
   Australian citizens, both in general and, in a world-first, across
   different specific topics. Analysing data from the Australian
   Constitutional Values Survey, we investigate whether that support is
   higher among people who are more educated and politically interested (in
   line with a `cognitive mobilisation' hypothesis) or those who are
   dissatisfied with politics, with low levels of political trust
   ('political disaffection'). The article finds that Australians widely
   support the use of direct democracy, but especially with respect to
   constitutional issues and matters of principle that they feel they can
   readily engage with, whereas parliaments are still seen as best placed
   to decide more technical matters. The article also finds that support
   for direct democracy is strongest among politically disaffected
   citizens, in ways that suggest greater use of direct democracy may have
   a role to play in addressing decline in political trust in Australia.},

Abstract = {How does economic inequality affect support for redistribution to native
   citizens and immigrants? While prior studies have examined the separate
   effects of inequality and immigration on redistribution preferences, the
   interaction between inequality and communal identity has been largely
   overlooked. This article explains that inequality triggers selective
   solidarity. Individuals exposed to inequality become more supportive of
   redistribution - but only if the redistribution benefits native-born
   citizens. Inequality therefore reinforces the already popular opinion
   that native citizens deserve welfare priority and widens the gap between
   support for natives and support for immigrants. This study first
   provides cross-national evidence with survey data linked to contextual
   socio-economic indicators from advanced industrialized countries. To
   evaluate causally identified effects, it then presents the results of a
   survey experiment administered to a nationally representative sample of
   Italian citizens. The findings imply that economic inequality can
   increase support for populist radical right parties that advocate
   discrimination in access to welfare services based on native
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {Pedro P. Kuczynski (Peru 2018) and Evo Morales (Bolivia 2019) are the
   most recent cases in a long list of Latin American presidents who have
   been forced out of office. We seek to contribute to understanding why
   some presidents fail to fulfil their terms by analysing the role of an
   actor overlooked by the extant literature on presidential failures:
   political parties. We hypothesize a non-linear relation between party
   institutionalization and the risk of presidential failure. That is, when
   parties are weakly or highly institutionalized, the hazard of
   presidential failure is lower than when parties are moderately
   institutionalized. We test this and other hypotheses with a survival
   analysis of 157 Latin American administrations (1979-2018). We also
   qualitatively explore how the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of certain
   events affects the risk of failure in three countries with different

Abstract = {Given a perceived qualitative and quantitative shift in the use of
   nonviolent action by rightwing populist actors in recent years, this
   article based on case studies from Austria (the Identitarian movement)
   and Indonesia (the 2/12 movement) discusses the methods, legitimacy, and
   effectiveness of the use of nonviolent action by right-wing populist
   movements. It finds that the use of nonviolent action by those actors is
   largely pragmatic and tactical and that it often is borderline in terms
   of remaining nonviolent. It further identifies that in line with
   right-wing populist ideology, rather than only addressing state
   authorities and elites, the movements addressees of the nonviolent
   action are often minority groups or people supporting minority groups.
   Developing a classification of nonviolent action in democracies
   (dissent, civil disobedience, political disobedience) the article
   further finds that right-wing use of nonviolent action has a tendency
   towards transcending normal dissent towards political disobedience.},

Abstract = {How do social identities contribute to the formation of coalitions in a
   policy subsystem? Social identities help to understand the bundling of
   resources and common strategies for action. Thus, we argue that
   identification with a group and across groups discursively results in
   the formulation of shared and competing storylines. As coalitions are
   characterized by some kind of sameness of their actors which results in
   shared storylines, we thereby postulate that the link between storylines
   and social identities provides added value to the explanation of
   coalition formation. We test whether shared storylines can be traced
   back to social identities in the different discursive periods of traffic
   development on a local level in Germany. A media analysis of 110
   articles and 14 interviews shows that the assignment of certain group
   characteristics is discursively confirmed, renegotiated, or rejected.
   Social identities, therefore, matter for coalition formation.},

Abstract = {When can diplomatic communication facilitate military cooperation? I
   analyze a formal model in which states may form coalitions for war but
   are uncertain about a partner's willingness to fight. I demonstrate that
   incentives to lie are greatest when potential coalition partners agree
   on how to settle a dispute. Additionally, the audience of communication
   matters. Communication among military partners is only credible when it
   occurs in private, out of view of a shared enemy. Taken together, the
   results indicate that preference heterogeneity and secrecy are necessary
   for credible communication among military partners. In an extension, I
   show that the availability of side payments exacerbates the difficulty
   of communication. The theoretical results provide a framework to
   understand observed variation in the success of precrisis diplomacy
   among potential coalition members.},

Abstract = {Learning theories in political science can be difficult for students.
   This article describes a technique that helps students to understand how
   a theory about human characteristics may impact behavior. I use a
   mini-simulation in which two volunteers are asked to enact a gimmick in
   front of the classroom, demonstrating the theory of human territoriality
   (Asal et al. 2018). As the volunteers engage in small talk, I point out
   that they engage with one another at a certain distance and angle that
   reflects social space. As the exercise progresses, students easily
   relate to the theory of human territoriality, which is defined as the
   symbolic and physical connection to a space considered as their own.
   This mini-simulation achieves the following learning objectives:
   understanding (1) that theories are relevant and help to explain human
   behavior; (2) the workings of the individual level of analysis; and (3)
   that theories are not universal and have limits to their application
   across culture, time, and space. This teaching technique does not
   require preparation time or resources, and students easily comprehend
   the expected learning outcomes. Having received overwhelmingly positive
   feedback in evaluations, I offer this as a viable technique for teaching
   theory in general because it helps students to comprehend what a theory
   is supposed to do-that is, to understand, explain, and sometimes predict
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite the outpouring of scholarship on the motivations behind the 2016
   EU referendum result and the preliminary impact of Brexit on British
   politics, comparatively little time has been spent analysing the
   government(s) entrusted with implementation. This article aims to
   address this gap in the literature, examining government management of
   the Brexit process as a case study through which to illustrate the
   continued relevance of the British Political Tradition in British
   politics. It argues that through Brexit implementation, the May
   government initiated a process of centralisation of both policy-making
   influence and administrative resources within Whitehall. This process
   was shielded externally by appeals to the referendum result as an
   imperative mandate parliament was obliged to implement. Although the
   political landscape of May's premiership was characterised by flux,
   these internal shifts towards centralisation in the executive are
   proposed to have had a more sustained impact through the reassertion of
   aspects of Britain's `power-hoarding' constitutional settlement.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the growing divide between Scotland and England, a
   schism that was beginning to take form with Scottish devolution and
   which has grown exponentially since the Independence Referendum of 2014.
   The central argument presented in the paper is that renewed impetus for
   national distinction and self-determination in Scotland is best
   understood as one facet of a much wider popular disenchantment and
   growing restiveness with the trajectory of contemporary UK politics,
   culture and society that has found an outlet via a resurgent nationalist
   discourse and institutional framework. Analysis here is approached via
   the application of an original biosocial theory with the aim of
   presenting further insights into the underlying processes driving
   contemporary political instability. Moreover, it is argued that this
   scenario can be understood, and may shed light upon, the wider rise in
   nationalist and populist sentiment that is contributing to increasing
   political turbulence across Europe and beyond.},

Abstract = {Electoral stability has been viewed as an essential condition for the
   healthy functioning of representative democracy. However, there is
   little agreement in the literature about what shapes the stability of
   the electorate in general nor much attention paid to that of the Asian
   electorates in particular. We propose historical legacies, uniquely
   testable in Asia, as central determinants, but also test for
   conventional factors examined in other regions. By analyzing more than
   150 elections in 19 post-WWII Asian democracies, we find that certain
   types of authoritarian (military or personalist) and colonial
   (non-British) legacies have a detrimental impact on the stabilization of
   the electorate, while some of the findings from other regions apply also
   to Asia. Our additional finding that such effects of historical
   legacies, particularly authoritarian interludes, are attenuated and
   cease to be significant with sufficient maturation of democracy, has
   important implications for the way party systems develop and democracies

Abstract = {The `core executive' is conceived of as the collection of organisations
   and procedures that coordinate executive government. Two approaches to
   core executive studies are: the resource dependency approach, which
   focusses on how roles interact and resources are utilised; and the
   functional approach, which focusses on how roles change over time. Both
   approaches are applied to non-partisan advisors (private secretaries) in
   ministerial office settings, actors which to date core executive studies
   have ignored. It reveals the resources that non-partisan advisors apply
   to contribute to policy coordination and maintain political neutrality;
   and that their role has changed since the increased presence of partisan
   advisors in ministers' offices in the past 20 years. Six distinct roles
   describe how non-partisan advisors respond to and meet the needs of both
   minister and public service in the core executive. When compared with
   political advisory roles, five of the roles appear strongly aligned in
   function.},

Abstract = {How universal and effective is the left-right opposition? We use public
   opinion data collected in 83 societies between 2008 and 2014 through the
   World Values Survey and the European Values Study, to look at the
   relationships, in each society, between individual ideological
   self-positioning and attitudes towards a set of eleven issues that
   capture the standard dimensions of the left-right political distinction.
   We observe varying levels of national ideological reach - the predictive
   power of left-right self-positioning on other attitudes - and
   ideological density - an index of the strength of the relationships
   between all the survey questions that we examine. These different levels
   of ideological reach and density can be explained by economic
   development, secularization, and democratic experience. A lasting
   experience with democracy, in particular, accounts best for the
   variations. When citizens have the capabilities and the possibilities of
   making political choices, they respond better to the elites' tendency to
   structure political debates in left-right terms.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the justice of unconditional basic income (UBI)
   through the lens of the Hegel-inspired recognition-theory of justice. As
   explained in the first part of the paper, this theory takes everyday
   social roles to be the primary subject-matter of the theory of justice,
   and it takes justice in these roles to be a matter of the kind of
   freedom that is available through their performance, namely `social'
   freedom. The paper then identifies the key criteria of social freedom.
   The extent to which the introduction of an UBI would meet these criteria
   is then examined, with a focus on the social role that stands to be most
   affected by an UBI, namely that of the worker-earner. It is argued that
   while an UBI is likely to be only partially effective as an instrument
   of specifically social freedom, its main justification lies not here,
   but in securing a basis for the subjective freedom that social freedom
   presupposes.},

Abstract = {This article characterizes and analyses variations in Poland's foreign
   policy under the Law and Justice (PiS) government with a view to shed
   light on the distinctive influence of populism. I argue that this
   influence has mainly to do with the `politics of representation',
   understood both in the sense of meaning production and of theatrical
   performance. Building on the discursive and stylistic approaches to
   populism as well as on the post-structuralist literature in Foreign
   Policy Analysis, this article conceptualizes populism as a set of
   representational practices in domestic politics that spill over, and
   affect, foreign policy. By promoting distinct representations of Self
   and Other in international affairs and by investing foreign policy
   making as a site to perform a rupture with technocratic elites, populist
   practices contribute to enable or constrain certain policy choices and
   mode of diplomatic actions. In Poland, this has translated into a
   securitization of the EU, a partial de-Europeanization of the national
   interest and a re-shuffling of partnership prioritizations, as well as
   in disruptive and `undiplomatic' comments on the part of the PiS foreign
   policy executive.},

Abstract = {The study of voter competence has made significant contributions to our
   understanding of politics, but at this point there are diminishing
   returns to the endeavor. Voter competence is unlikely to improve
   dramatically enough to make much of a difference to our politics. By
   contrast, the competence of officials can and does vary substantially
   over short periods of time. To understand variations in government
   performance, therefore, we would do better to focus on the abilities and
   performance of officials, not ordinary citizens. We elaborate on this
   argument, emphasizing the ``incompetence multiplier{''}: the way that
   the properties of hierarchies can amplify the incompetence of those in
   powerful positions. We illustrate our argument with an extended
   discussion of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Partisans view their own candidates through rose-coloured glasses and
   see competing candidates much more negatively. However, recent advances
   in political behaviour reveal that such directional motivated reasoning
   is not simply about love and hate, but also about more nuanced shifts in
   preferences. Combining two insights from the psychological sciences -
   coalitional reasoning and a general dislike of self-interested leaders -
   we form the novel prediction that voters pay more attention to out-party
   than to in-party candidates' warmth. We show firm evidence for this
   prediction relying on election studies data with candidate warmth
   impressions from 27 elections from seven countries (Australia, Denmark,
   Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States)
   between 1984 and 2016; and a re-analysis of existing experimental data
   (total N = 140K). Our paper reveals sophisticated psychological
   mechanisms regulating the importance of candidate warmth and implies
   that candidates seeking to reduce the partisan gap should establish a
   warm image.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an application of the explanatory model aimed at
   formulation and institutional development in the field of the Croatian
   upper secondary vocational education. Data was collected via 17 in-depth
   semi-structured interviews with informants directly involved in
   formulating relevant policy documents from the independence onwards.
   Informants were affiliated with competent central state entities,
   counties, employers' associations, trade unions and relevant
   international organizations. The overall thesis that central state
   actors hold the greatest positional power over key institutional
   features such as financing, learning content and standards of delivery,
   is but partially validated. Indeed, central state actors represent the
   most powerful group. However, dynamics are predominantly structured
   around workings of two relatively stable and competitive coalitions:
   ``the educational{''} vs. ``the economic{''}, with the affiliation of
   central state actors commonly split between these two coalitions.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that military spending affects economic growth and other
   aspects of the economy has been under scrutiny over the last decades.
   However, the macroeconomic impact of defense outlays is still an open
   question for researchers and policymakers. Aiming to contribute to the
   existing debate, this paper combines Keynesian with monetary theory and
   develops a discrete-time model that allows for potential fiscal-monetary
   coordination for financing the military sector in order to examine the
   effects of defense outlays on income and inflation. The theoretical
   analysis suggests that military budget expansions can only have

Abstract = {Social media can be a valuable tool for improving governance. However,
   authoritarian regimes are currently exploiting social media for their
   own ends both within and outside of their borders. The United States and
   other democratic allies must work to tamp down on manipulation of social
   media platforms by authoritarian regimes and inoculate their publics
   against disinformation through enhanced social media literacy and civic
   education campaigns. Otherwise, the U.S. risks losing the proxy battle
   taking place on social media platforms to the Chinese Communist Party
   and Vladimir Putin's Russian regime in an era of great power

Abstract = {Cancel culture and wokeism are dangerous trends that are increasing in
   their intensity and the self-destruction of Western civilization is a
   matter of time as the underlying historical myths and value/normative
   philosophies that led to its global hegemony is destroyed by a messianic
   ideology that is engineering an exclusive homogenous worldview in the
   name of pluralism and inclusivity. In this world of Orwellian
   doublespeak, the current struggle for ideological hegemony is taking
   place in the information space for hearts and minds in the cognitive

   questions of Jacques Bidet's thought, in particular, his
   reinterpretation of Capital and his theory of modernity. Bidet's
   rethinking of economic-political modernity leads to the elaboration of a
   metastructural theory that produces a problematic divide between the
   epistemological level (transcendental Marxism) and the ontological level
   (empirical contractualism): a symptom of a Kantianism never explicitly

Abstract = {While attitudes toward women and gender equality are increasingly
   salient in Australian politics, little is known about how sexist
   attitudes shape political behaviour. Using the Australian Election
   Study, I assess the extent hostile sexism is present among Australian
   citizens and influenced vote choice in the 2019 Federal election. First,
   I find that women are less likely than men to hold hostile sexist
   attitudes, but gender differences vary by party identification. Second,
   I show that hostile sexism is not significantly related to the
   likelihood of voting for the Labor or Liberal parties. Hostile sexist
   attitudes, however, significantly increase the likelihood of voting for
   the National party and significantly decrease the likelihood of voting
   for the Greens. Finally, I find no gender difference in the role of
   hostile sexism in explaining vote choice.},

Abstract = {Since Black Lives Matter (BLM) rose to prominence, liberal democracies
   have been internally divided over their response to the movement. Whilst
   some politicians have supported BLM's struggle against anti-black
   racism, others have condemned it as unnecessary, or even harmful to
   democracy. China, by contrast, has displayed unwavering solidarity with
   BLM, by providing it with official coverage and support. In an attempt
   to discredit these efforts, liberals have portrayed China's solidarity
   statements as pragmatic gestures, designed to draw attention away from
   its alleged human rights violations. This article shows that these
   accusations are baseless. China's support for the black liberation
   struggle precedes BLM; and is rooted in the revolutionary
   internationalism of its founder, Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of the
   Communist Party of China, the Chinese state has developed Mao's Marxist
   analysis of the African American struggle. In doing so, China has helped
   BLM expose the racist core of US capitalism.},

Abstract = {Exclusionary nationalist movements' rise in recent years challenges
   liberal democracy's trust in political institutions' ability to
   neutralize and incorporate extremism. The crisis of liberal democracy
   likewise questions liberal civil society's emphasis on associational
   membership's intrinsic democratic side-effects. The study proposes a
   partisanship spectrum integrating attitudes to conflict into civil
   society theory, suggesting the centrality of cross-partisanship in
   mediating modern society's unavoidable conflicts, a question central to
   civil society theory and modern democracies. Germany's first school of
   public affairs serves as a historical case study to better understand
   how cross-partisanship addressed the extreme political polarization,
   radicalization of public discourse, and violence challenging interwar
   Germany's transition to democracy. While honouring political
   factionalism, cross-partisanship (uberparteilichkeit) countered
   extremism through a correct understanding of political facts and a
   common commitment to republican institutions. Relying on archival
   sources, I show that when cross-partisanship was equated to
   nonpartisanship, it favoured the penetration of extremism by emphasizing
   compromise and equal representation of all political parties, including
   the Nazi Party. The question of how to build a civil society is as
   crucial today as it was in interwar Germany.},

Abstract = {This study confirms the existence of a substantial gender gap in
   internal political efficacy in contemporary European democracies with
   survey evidence from the ESS08 and 09 waves. In the article it is argued
   that part of this gap is rooted in gendered patterns of socialisation
   according to which men are more likely than women to be socialised in
   ways that emphasise traits such as assertiveness, predisposition to
   risk, competition, self-promotion, or horizontal ellipsis It is found
   that those who perceive themselves as ready to take risks are more
   likely to feel able to play an active role in politics. Using mediation
   analysis, it is also shown that part of the gender gap in internal
   political efficacy is a result of the lower inclination of women to take
   risks in comparison to men. These findings suggest that the political
   realm is perceived by citizens to be more in line with gender
   stereotypes about men.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why Japan has been at the periphery of the
   international humanitarian system, at least for the past two decades.
   Based on a review of the main features of the country's historical
   involvement in humanitarian crisis response, I suggest two main reasons:
   1) the difficulty for Japan to adapt to the kind of institutions created
   after the end of the Cold War, mainly by Western actors, and 2) Japan's
   preference for an integral approach to crisis management, using multiple
   international cooperation means, which falls outside of the present
   humanitarian diplomacy paradigm. As this paradigm comes into question,
   Japan can influence the emerging humanitarian system, particularly
   through the promotion of crisis management ownership and long-term
   commitment backed by multiple financial means.},

Abstract = {Changes to conflicts involving the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and its
   design in the Gideon and Tnufa (Momentum) multi-year plans necessitate a
   profound examination of how army reserves will be employed in aspects
   such as order of battle, organisation, fighting and support equipment,
   training, competence, and readiness for fighting scenarios and
   situations. In practice, the IDF's operational concept for the reserves
   in emergency and war situations seems to have changed years ago, but it
   should be clearly defined and explained to all relevant entities, and in
   particular to the reserves themselves. Dotan Druck argues that the
   current concept is no longer `the regulars will hold, as it originally
   was, but now `the reserves will hold' or `the reserves will allow the
   regulars to decide'.},

Abstract = {Manual annotation of the policy content of political texts forms the
   basis for one of the most widely used empirical measures in comparative
   politics: left-right policy positions. Bridging automated ``text as
   data{''} approaches and qualitative content analysis, we apply
   statistical scaling to this data to learn more about the association of
   specific policy dimensions to the left-right super-dimension, in a way
   that minimizes ex ante assumptions about the substantive content of
   left-right policy. We apply a Bayesian negative binomial variant of
   Slapin and Proksch's (2008) ``wordfish{''} model to category counts from
   party manifestos coded by the Manifesto Project, providing a data-driven
   approach that offers new insights into the policy content of left and
   right. We demonstrate how this method also works with content not
   originally designed for measuring positions. In addition, we show how
   the approach can be extended to measure the policy content of two latent
   dimensions, with some categories contributing to both.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the contribution of education policies to the
   shaping of citizenship in France. We connect two inquiries. The first,
   about Moral and Civic Teaching, is a case of policy intentionally
   devoted to convey civic norms. The second, about the ordinary government
   of parents, concerns diffuse civic socialization at school. We ask how,
   and to what extent, the political order of school-composed of policy
   programs and institutional routines-builds civic behaviors throughout an
   intertwinement between school-related norms and citizenship standards.
   The analysis mainly relies on qualitative data-hundreds of interviews
   and ethnography-taking into account various contexts in France regarding
   the schools and the geographic situations. Education policies not only
   appear central in the definition of civic norms and the ``good{''} ways
   of acting politically in France, but may also be critical in other
   democratic systems where school plays a comparable role in the
   socialization to and by the state.},

Abstract = {Based on in-depth interviews with 24 former high-ranking North Korean
   officials, we investigate the ``hidden transcripts{''} of North Korean
   ruling elites. After discussing methodical issues in the first section,
   we analyze the hidden transcripts of the North Korean ruling class in
   the second section, including their questioning of Chuch'e ideology,
   rampant materialism, a ``revolution by mouth{''}, and the South Korean
   wave. If hidden transcripts of powerful officials contain thoughts
   identical to those of powerless individuals, for whose benefit are they
   hidden? In the third section, we revise the theory of hidden transcripts
   to answer this question. We conclude by discussing the implications of
   our findings for the future of North Korea.},

Abstract = {We contribute to research on the democratic role of middle classes. Our
   paper distinguishes between middle classes emerging autonomously during
   gradual capitalist development and those fabricated rapidly as part of
   state-led modernization. To make the case for a conceptual distinction
   between these groups within one national setting, we employ
   author-assembled historical district data, survey, and archival
   materials for pre-Revolutionary Russia and its feudal estates. Our
   analysis reveals that the bourgeois estate of meshchane covaries with
   post-communist democratic competitiveness and media freedoms, our
   proxies of regional democratic variations. We propose two causal
   pathways explaining the puzzling persistence of social structure despite
   the Bolsheviks' leveling ideology and post-communist autocratic
   consolidation: (a) processes at the juncture of familial channels of
   human capital transmission and the revolutionaries' modernization drive
   and (b) entrepreneurial value transmission outside of state policy. Our
   findings help refine recent work on political regime orientations of
   public-sector-dependent societies subjected to authoritarian
   modernization.},

Abstract = {This article answers why intra-executive conflict varies across
   semi-presidential democracies. The literature verifies that
   intra-executive competition tends to be higher when the president holds
   less power to dismiss the cabinet, coexists with a minority government,
   or the president's party is not represented in the cabinet. This paper,
   therefore, integrates these factors to construct an index of prime
   ministerial autonomy, proposing that its relationship with the
   probability of intra-executive conflict is represented by an inverted
   U-shaped curve. That is, when the prime minister is subordinated to an
   elected president, or conversely, enjoys greater room to manoeuvre in
   the executive affairs of the government, the likelihood of conflict is
   low. In contrast, significant confrontation emerges when the president
   claims constitutional legitimacy to rein in the cabinet, and controls
   the executive to a certain degree. This study verifies hypotheses using
   data on seventeen semi-presidential democracies in Europe between 1990
   and 2015.},

Abstract = {This analysis applies the energy-stability-area (ESA) model to the
   commercial and agricultural sectors during the Progressive Era. Using
   state-level counts of commercial and agricultural organizations derived
   from federal government reports, we find clear evidence that both
   sectors were density dependent-the number of commercial and agricultural
   organizations was bounded by the interested population. Additional
   analysis reveals that younger states had greater numbers of state and
   local commercial organizations than older states, and that greater
   government costs and constituent interest helped drive increases in
   agricultural organizations. The level of partisan competition and the
   partisan composition of the state government, however, did not
   systematically influence group formation in either economic sector. In
   total, this study provides new insights into the application of the ESA
   model and the development of the American interest group state.},

Abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests pedagogy research on simulations in
   political science is dominated by two subfields: International Relations
   and Comparative Politics. This belief may stem from the widespread use
   of things like Model United Nations and Model Arab League or the popular
   game Statecraft. While some other subfields, notably public law, embrace
   simulations, there is less research on simulations in other subfields.
   While many professors likely use simulations in their classes, the
   research does not seem to demonstrate this. In this paper, we review
   articles published in The Journal of Political Science Education and PS:
   Political Science \& Politics from 2005 to 2020 to determine which
   subfields are publishing the most pedagogy research on simulations. We
   find that the anecdotal perception is mostly accurate; International
   Relations accounts for a significant plurality of the simulations
   research. Other subfields trail behind. We end with an invitation for
   faculty from across the discipline to publish their simulations
   research. This will better encourage the use of simulations across more
   subfields of political science and make adopting those simulations
   easier for all faculty.},

Abstract = {Theories of party systems suggest that more restrictive rules should
   lead to fewer parties. According to this line of reasoning, parties and
   voters should strategically respond to reforms in electoral rules, such
   as changes in district magnitude. That is, a decrease in district
   magnitude should decrease the size of the party system, whereas an
   increase in magnitude should enlarge the party system. Using a series of
   difference-in-differences models based on data from Brazilian
   municipalities before and after an exogenous reform in magnitude, I
   study the effects of this electoral reform on both electoral
   coordination and legislative fragmentation. Contrary to the expectation,
   the number of lists did not change after a decrease in magnitude.
   However, parties formed more pre-electoral coalitions in municipalities
   that lost seats. Voters also coalesced around fewer lists. Lastly, as
   expected, the reform produced a decrease in legislative fragmentation.
   Both mechanical and psychological effects were responsible for this
   modification in fragmentation.},

Abstract = {Descriptive or ethnographic studies were once the stock-in-trade of the
   comparative politics of non-Western areas and illiberal states. The last
   few decades have seen a dramatic growth in quantitative-or at least
   systematic-studies of these systems. This marks real progress, but, in
   the process, some of the advantages of ethnographic and
   ``unit-contextual{''} studies have been lost. The contributors to this
   symposium have used ethnographic methods-often in combination with other
   methods-to examine and compare episodes of contentious politics in a
   number of these countries. Drawing on some of the ``classics{''} of
   comparative politics, this article emphasizes both the continuities and
   the departures of the new generation of ``ethnography plus{''} research
   efforts represented in this symposium.},

Abstract = {What are the behavioral consequences of municipal identity? A long
   tradition of public policy theory has emphasized how municipal
   policymaking is shaped by local residents' shared interest in the
   prestige, power, and economic growth of their cities. A separate
   tradition of social identity theory shows that perceived membership in
   politically salient groups, including place-based identities, shapes
   political behavior, particularly in the context of intergroup rivalry.
   This paper integrates insights from these two traditions, providing a
   novel analysis of municipalities as a source of meaningful group
   identity. Using two large Canadian surveys, we measure municipal
   identity as a social identity, demonstrating that municipalities provide
   a meaningful basis of social identity for many individuals. We then show
   that municipal identity has important political correlates: strong
   municipal identifiers have higher levels of interest in municipal
   politics, higher participation in municipal elections, and distinctive
   policy preferences on issues related to municipal status and
   intermunicipal competition. We discuss the implications of our findings
   for political behavior, municipal politics, and social identity

Abstract = {How do prime ministers manage investors' expectations during financial
   crises? We take a novel approach to this question by investigating
   ministerial appointments. When prime ministers appoint technocrats,
   defined as non-partisan experts, they forgo political benefits and can
   credibly signal their willingness to pay down their debt obligations.
   This reduces bond yields, but only at times when the market is sensitive
   to expected repayments-that is, during crises. To examine the theory, we
   develop an event study analysis that employs new data on the background
   of finance ministers in 21 Western and Eastern European democracies. We
   find that investors reward technocratic appointments by reducing a
   country's borrowing costs. Consistent with the theory, technocratic
   appointments under crises predict lower bond yields. Our findings
   contribute to the literature on the interplay of financial markets and
   domestic politics.},

   Republican and Democratic parties and the policies for which each
   advocate. This paper investigates the effect of this realignment on one
   policy area: LGBTQ+ issues, a policy area in which there is a
   significant difference in public opinion between college-educated and
   non-college-educated Americans. Using data on congressional activity on
   LGBTQ+ issues from 2005 to 2019, I test the effect of the education
   realignment in this policy area through both elite replacement and
   conversion. I find there is greater evidence for the realignment
   affecting party position taking through replacement, as a significant
   number of pro-LGBTQ+ Republicans and anti-LGBTQ+ Democrats were swept
   out of office in recent years. This furthers polarization on LGBTQ+
   issues.},

Abstract = {One of the purported effects of international integration is that voters
   are less able, or less willing, to punish or reward incumbents for
   economic performance: since governments are less able to influence
   economic outcomes, economic considerations weigh less for voters at the
   ballot box. This would have serious implications for democratic
   legitimacy. Yet the balancing demands hypothesis predicts that voters
   compensate for this by judging incumbents on non-economic performance
   instead. In this article, this theory is critiqued theoretically and
   empirically, putting it to the test for one of the first times at the
   individual level using the 2019 Belgian Election Study. Combining
   perceptions of policy performance across six issue areas with novel
   survey items which measure perceptions of economic constraints, it is
   shown that whilst performance voting does occur, there is no support for
   the balancing demands hypothesis. Voting based on performance in
   economic or non-economic areas remains largely unrelated to perceptions
   of international constraints. Supplemental data for this article can be

Abstract = {Where societies display sufficient resilience to global and diffuse
   risks they are able to avoid tipping-over into governance breakdown and
   violent conflict. Similarly, if external actors such as the EU wish to
   build resilience in Europe's volatile neighbourhood, they require a
   systematic understanding of global and diffuse risks and tipping-points
   in order to develop long-term resilience-building strategies. But how
   should global and diffuse risks and tipping-points be conceptualized and
   understood? How can policy-makers anticipate global and diffuse risks to
   avoid governance breakdown and violent conflict in areas of limited
   statehood? This article addresses these questions. First, it argues, it
   is only by systematically integrating global and diffuse risks into
   explanatory logics of governance breakdown and violent conflict that we
   can develop better predictive models and resilience-building strategies.
   Second, it articulates a six-cluster typology of global and diffuse
   risks. Lastly, it demonstrates that in areas of limited statehood
   societies confront three distinct types of tipping-points that can
   overwhelm societal resilience. EU early-warning and resilience-fostering
   policy ought to distinguish between them and prepare to address each
   type.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results from a comparative analysis of two sections
   of Introduction to International Politics, one of which used a
   traditional research paper as a supplemental assignment and one that
   used the Statecraft online simulation. Both sections were taught during
   the same semester and used common lecture notes, PowerPoint slides, exam
   reviews, and exams. The only difference was the nature of the
   supplemental assignment. The paper finds that the best predictor of
   student performance on exams is a student's GPA prior to taking the
   class. At the same time, the evidence suggests that time dedicated to
   the online simulation in class may have led to worse performance on at
   least one exam. Finally, the paper finds that students did enjoy the
   Statecraft simulation and generally believed that it was preferable to a
   traditional research paper in spite of its representing additional work
   relative to the more traditional research paper.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {617-638},

Abstract = {This article considers connections between two aspects of Brexit: the
   cultural divide exposed and amplified by the European Union (EU)
   referendum of 23 June 2016 and the prolonged and intense period of
   multiple and overlapping constitutional tensions that followed the
   referendum. The referendum revealed the existence of two contrasting
   cultural groupings. Each was defined by a cluster of values that
   extended beyond attitudes towards the particular question of EU
   membership, and to which issues of citizenship were central. The
   manifestation and crystallisation of this cultural divide through the
   direct democracy of the referendum led directly to constitutional
   turmoil. Parliamentarians as a group found themselves misaligned with
   those who voted in the referendum producing a conflict between the
   principles of direct and representative democracy. Brexit has generated
   tensions between and within different institutions of the constitution
   and arguments about what the rules were, and what they should be. Areas
   on which these conflicts and disagreements have focused included the
   Civil Service, the courts, the Cabinet, Parliament and even the
   monarchy. The political shock of Brexit, therefore, had inherently
   constitutional characteristics. They are likely to continue to manifest
   themselves, shaping the way the constitution operates and changes in
   future.},

Abstract = {Why do some wars end with an absolute outcome, with state death or
   regime change? I argue that we are more likely to see absolute outcomes
   when we have territorial disputes with the potential for credible
   commitment problems and asymmetric disputants. In the absence of
   credible commitment problems, disputes are less likely to recur, and
   states are unlikely to seek to absorb the opponent state or remove its
   government. Among more symmetric disputants, states cannot impose an
   absolute outcome, and we are more likely to see recurrent disputes in
   the face of credible commitment problems. Only in very asymmetric dyads
   are we likely to have both the required willingness and opportunity to
   impose absolute outcomes to attempt to solve a credible commitment
   problem over territorial conflict.},

Title = {Argentine Sociology of Mentalities from Ingenieros to Germani. Races,
   History and Scientific Discourse From the Perspective of a History of
   the Present from the South},
Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},
Year = {2021},
Number = {42},
Pages = {13-37},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents a review of the ways in which Argentine sociology
   analysed the relationship between mentalities, races and history. In
   particular, we are interested in proposing a perspective that, informed
   by the history of the present, constitutes a series that puts together
   (and contrasts) the ways in which these questions were treated at the
   dawn of sociology and in Gino Germani's scientific project. The outcome
   of such exercise will force us to critically return to the genealogy of
   racism proposed by Michel Foucault in his 1976 seminar at the College de
   France.
   The text is organized in four sections. In the first place, we will
   present the documents that we have analysed and look into the way in
   which the race struggle is built as a historical discourse. Then, we
   will relate our findings to some of the aforementioned Foucauldian
   thematization of the history of racism. Next, we review the ways in
   which the historical narrative of the race struggle was conjugated in
   the sociology of the early twentieth century in a language that claimed
   to be scientific. Then, we will give way to the relationship between
   those original texts and the scientific sociology of Gino Germani to,
   finally, rise some questions to take this research forward.},

Abstract = {This multidisciplinary pedagogy offers eight allegorical images in
   support of a visually contextual reading of The Prince. Responding to
   the pedagogical problem of students treating the text as an ahistorical
   manual for action addressed to them, our approach resituates The Prince
   in its visual cultural context. This allows us to specify Machiavelli's
   innovations as a theorist in terms of the importance of plurality and
   particularity in regard to political action. An online supplemental
   appendix provides access to databases and additional resources.
   Exploring Machiavelli's politicized moral concepts of prudence,
   parsimony, liberality, fortune, and impetuosity using these images, we
   show his masterful invocation and redeployment of the cultural codes of
   his time. In presenting a visual history of concepts, we hope to move
   students beyond common contemporary ideological biases and literal
   readings and to alert them to the complex stories and relationships
   evident in the visual history of civic humanism.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of Morena's main electoral advances in
   the 2021 elections. Through the comparison, we use some categories to
   measure electoral performance, both by percentage of votes, as well as
   the electoral performance coefficient (cde). It is based on specialized
   literature to maintain that Morena is the most successful new party in
   Mexican electoral history, this because it has exceeded the criteria
   that a party must meet to be considered relevant. With the data in this
   article, we can observe Morena's transition from an intermediate party
   to a large party and that the 2021 election placed the party of
   President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as the party to win in the next
   elections.},

Abstract = {Drawing on empirical evidence from history and anthropology, we aim to
   demonstrate that there is room for genealogical ideology critique within
   normative political theory. The test case is some libertarians' use of
   folk notions of private property rights in defense of the legitimacy of
   capitalist states. Our genealogy of the notion of private property shows
   that asking whether a capitalist state can emerge without violations of
   self-ownership cannot help settling the question of its legitimacy,
   because the notion of private property presupposed by that question is a
   product of the entity it is supposed to help legitimize: the state. We
   anchor our genealogical critique in recent work on ideology in
   epistemology and philosophy of language and in current debates on the
   methodology of political theory. But, unlike more traditional approaches
   that aim to debunk whole concepts or even belief systems, we propose a
   more targeted, argument-specific form of ideology critique.},

Funding-Text = {This paper's long gestation is intertwined with the illness and
   premature death of one of its authors, Carlo Argenton, and it is
   dedicated to his memory. Enzo Rossi should take responsibility for most
   of the text as it now reads, but some of the ideas stem from
   conversations between the authors dating as far back as 2014 and from
   some joint writing in 2015. The paper benefited from comments by
   audiences at the Dubrovnik InterUniversity Centre, Goethe University
   Frankfurt, the London School of Economics, SciencesPo, the University
   ofAmsterdam, the University of Lisbon, Sussex University, and Tulane
   University. Will Bosworth, Ed Hall, Rob Jubb, Naomi Goulder, Paul Sagar,
   Eric Schliesser, Nic Southwood, Matt Sleat, and Nicholas Vrousalis
   commented perceptively on various drafts. The Journal of Politics's
   political theory editors, Lisa Ellis and Jacob T. Levy, provided
   excellent feedback and guidance, as did their anonymous referees. Enzo
   Rossi's research was funded by his Dutch Research Council ``Vidi{''}
   project ``Legitimacy beyond Consent{''} (grant no. 016.164.351).},

Abstract = {Although Brexit had its short-term roots in economic and constitutional
   legitimation issues, it cannot be explained without considering the
   European geopolitical space, the EU's contrasting political formations
   in the security and economic spheres, and the fault lines these produce.
   Seen from a long-term geopolitical perspective, there have been
   recurrent problems in Britain's efforts to deal with the EU and its
   predecessors, and persistent patterns of crisis. The geopolitical
   environment, especially around NATO and energy security in the Middle
   East, first rendered non-membership of the EEC a problem, then made
   entry impossible for a decade, helped make EU membership politically
   very difficult for British governments to sustain, and then constrained
   the May governments' Article 50 negotiations. These problems have a
   singularly British shape, but they cannot be separated from more general
   fault lines in the European geopolitical space.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I demonstrate false consensus in Americans' perceptions
   of ordinary party members: the more a person agrees with a statement,
   the more they believe that in-party members would also agree. I find
   traces of false consensus for the out-party as well. This pattern in
   perceptions of ordinary partisans is very similar to the pattern I find
   in perceptions of politicians' positions. This suggests that false
   consensus is closely related to another phenomenon in political
   perceptions: assimilation. I also show that Americans' perceptions of
   their in-parties are more correlated with their own opinions than in
   reality. The results have implications for our understanding of
   affective polarization, of real-world cueing effects, and of
   representation.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-38},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A large body of scholarship shows that autocrats can use corruption
   strategically to strengthen their political hold, such as by
   distributing rents to their supporters. However, this scholarship often
   overlooks how corruption may also politically damage autocrats. I argue
   that corruption often brings substantial political costs alongside its
   advantages, resulting in a `corruption dilemma' for autocrats. I show
   that in recent years, public anger over corruption has led to numerous
   anti-government protests and has been a major cause of autocrats being
   ousted from power. How politically costly corruption is depends on
   factors such as the public's tolerance for corruption, whether the
   autocrat is accountable to quasi-democratic institutions and whether the
   autocrat can credibly claim to be fighting corruption. The case of
   Malaysia illustrates how relying on corrupt practices to stay in power
   can backfire even in a long-standing authoritarian regime. My analysis
   advances our understanding of corruption's mixed role in authoritarian
   durability and authoritarian strategies of rule.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of whether populist parties behave
   differently from other political parties in parliament. Building on the
   attention-based perspective of the study of policy agendas, we map issue
   emphasis in parliamentary questions in Italy over more than two decades
   (1996-2019). The paper is innovative as it compares populist and
   non-populist parties in government and in opposition. Using data from
   the Italian Policy Agendas Project and The PopuList, we find mixed
   evidence. Specifically, we show that populist parties behave differently
   from other parties only when they are in opposition (signalling that
   they are different from `elite' ones) but not when in government
   (signalling that they are `competent' policymakers). While the results
   are exploratory and drawn from the Italian context, this study
   contributes to deflate the myth of populists' exceptionalism, at least
   in terms of their behaviour in parliament. As such, it holds broader
   implications for the scholarly understanding of party government and the
   so-called `normalization' of populism in contemporary democracies.},

Abstract = {Analytic power has always been a key criterion for adjudicating between
   analytic frameworks, but the political effects of frameworks have never
   been unimportant to an assessment of their value. This paper engages the
   question of whether the dominant intellectual framework for
   understanding racial socio-political outcomes on the left - the
   framework of ``structural racism{''} - encourages a racial political
   pessimism that is disabling. Finding it at least plausible that this
   framework dampens democratic motivation, I then introduce an alternative
   framework for understanding racial stasis and change in the U.S. and
   elsewhere - a ``complex systems{''} framework. Even as it provides
   leverage on persistent racial inequality, I argue that this framework
   suggests the deep pessimism inspired by the structural racism framework
   is unwarranted. In ddition to being analytically powerful, then, the
   framework can potentially have the particular political benefit of
   stoking democratic motivation.},

Abstract = {Media portrayals of terrorism, particularly right-wing terrorism, have
   been understudied. In response, this study focuses on understanding how
   right-wing terrorism is portrayed by the New York Times and the
   Washington Post. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on five
   cases. Framing theory and thematic analysis were used to inform the
   research methods. Four main themes emerge: ``officially, we cannot be
   sure this was terrorism{''}; ``just a man - the obfuscation of
   motive{''}; ``on normalisation and humanisation{''}; and ``eventually we
   have to talk about gun policy.{''} The results show that the news
   providers did not label these cases as terrorism, and that the ideology
   of the attackers was minimised as a motive. By searching so extensively
   for ``other reasons{''} for the violence, the threat of right-wing
   violence was minimised. As a result of these incomplete or misleading
   portrayals, the threat from these individuals goes unchecked.},

Abstract = {This article aims to address the social and political role of political
   scientists in Greece, which has been at the centre of the Eurozone
   crisis, resulting in the most troubled period in the country's recent
   political history, namely the campaign week of the July 2015 bailout
   referendum. To that end, the article relies, on the one hand, on the
   PROSEPS survey data to identify the extent to which Greek political
   scientists engage in public debate in general and how they view the
   social role of their discipline. On the other hand, we used a content
   analysis of the leading national TV media during the aforementioned week
   to examine how much Greek political scientists participated in the
   public debate in comparison with other social scientists, and what were
   their stances on specific issues and dimensions, such as the framing of
   the European Union. In addition, we also delve into the stance of Greek
   political scientists who participated in the public debate regarding the
   referendum itself. The study results revealed a potential bias;
   political scientists who pronounce themselves in favour of the status
   quo seem to receive more invitations to participate in televised
   debates.},

Abstract = {This article has two main goals: to examine and classify the ways data
   can be used to advance normative theorizing in political theory, and to
   demonstrate such usages in the contested disciplinary field of
   religion-state relations and specifically regarding the hotly debated
   model of the separation of religion and state. Regarding the former, it
   is suggested here that the general observation that evaluation of
   political institutions must rely on proper understanding of such
   institutions and hence be data-sensitive, can be further detailed or
   classified, via the following categories: conversion, institutional
   clarity, theoretical clarity and finally, theory improvement. With
   regard to the latter we examine how data regarding religion-state
   relations enables a better understanding (via the noted novel
   classifications or categories) of two important debates: `delineation'
   (i.e. the argument that pure separation of religion and state does not
   exist) and `separation-establishment' (i.e. arguing that models other
   than separation are permissible in religion-state relations).},

Abstract = {This study investigates how processes of horizontal policy transfer can
   unfold in context of devolution, examining the development of
   legislation on minimum unit pricing (MUP) in Wales, following on from
   Scotland's earlier policy decision. The study draws on a range of
   sources, including primary documents, media coverage, and interviews
   with policy participants. Our analysis identifies the importance of the
   specific character of Welsh political institutions, particularly the
   emphasis given to participation and consultation in policymaking. In the
   case of MUP, we document a process of policy-oriented learning, where
   policymakers made a concerted effort to draw on an assortment of
   expertise and experiences, including but not limited to the Scottish
   model. We also find that the Welsh public health policy community was
   well placed to support the framing of MUP and to address limitations in
   policy capacity. The findings hold implications for future studies of
   learning, devolution, and alcohol policy more generally.},

Abstract = {Though the Chinese government has projected the BRI in economic terms,
   it has been viewed critically by Australia, Japan, and the U.S. Turkey
   has, as a geostrategic connector of Asia and Europe, registered its
   trade interest in the BRI along with projecting the Middle Corridor
   Initiative (MCI) as a means to realize regional market connectivity and
   commercial cooperation. In view of the aforesaid, this study aims to
   explain whether the BRI has factored into Turkey's Asia policy and to
   what extent the MCI can complement the BRI. Moreover, the study analyzed
   the existing scale of China-Turkey trade and proposed a set of
   opportunities offered by both the BRI and the MCI. Nonetheless, the
   stated opportunities are beset with multiple challenges ranging from
   transregional instability to socio-economic upheavals. In order to
   accrue trade dividends in terms of inter-initiative co-operation and
   connectivity, both China and Turkey will have to playa leading role in
   developing policy coordination and establishing cultural linkages among
   the BRI/MCI community. Thus, operationally, Turkey would carry immense
   influence in Asian affairs economically and strategically.},

Abstract = {This paper shows how an uneven electoral system in Japan shapes
   political parties' mobilization strategies by utilizing a majoritarian
   electoral system with heterogeneous district magnitudes, which in turn
   contributes to the gap in turnout across districts. Scholars have long
   debated the relationship between electoral systems and turnout; it is
   known that countries with proportional representation electoral systems
   - those with larger district magnitude - tend to have higher turnout
   rates than countries with majoritarian electoral systems, especially
   single-member district (SMD) systems. The current discussion on turnout
   and district magnitude of an electoral system assumes a monotonic
   relationship between these factors: the larger the district magnitude of
   the electoral system, the more (or less) participatory the electorate,
   due to competitiveness and mobilization efforts by political parties and
   other relevant groups. In contrast, this paper shows a mixed
   relationship between district magnitude of the electoral system and
   party mobilization and subsequent turnout, investigating a majoritarian
   electoral system with uneven district magnitude in the Japanese Upper
   House. During the survey period, the party system in Japan consisted of
   two major parties and a few smaller parties; consequently, the two major
   parties focused their efforts on SMDs in order to maximize their seat
   share, while smaller parties focused their resource on districts
   electing more than two members (where they have some chance to elect
   their party's candidates). In combination, these party strategies have
   resulted in the lowest mobilization and turnout rates in districts with
   two members.},

Abstract = {This article brings together two sets of insights about deliberative
   democracy and uses them to develop a novel epistemic justification for
   the importance of testimony. Some democratic theorists have argued
   persuasively that a deliberative process limited to formal argumentation
   is exclusionary and thus undermines democratic legitimacy; they have
   made a compelling case for testimony on grounds of democratic inclusion.
   Others have made the case that deliberation has important epistemic
   benefits. Those theorists emphasize the give and take of reasons as a
   means to arrive at well-informed collective decisions. The author's
   central claim is that there is an important epistemic value to the
   inclusion of testimony. It can introduce new information into the
   deliberative process. It can enable deliberators to grasp connections
   between the particular and the general. And it can invite them to
   imaginatively engage with the experiences of others. These epistemic
   benefits provide a new set of reasons for including testimony in
   democratic deliberation.},

Abstract = {Separation of powers with checks and balances (SP) is usually regarded
   as a key institution complementing elections in the control of elected
   officials. However, some analysts and many politicians also warn that
   excessive checks on the executive in the presence of polarization may
   lead to political inaction. We analyze the interaction between elections
   and SP, and study under what circumstances they complement each other.
   We first introduce a political agency model with ideological parties
   where citizens and politicians care about rents (a valence issue) and
   policy (a positional issue). Then, we analyze the impact of SP on the
   effectiveness of elections to discipline and select politicians. We
   demonstrate that SP unambiguously raises a majority of voters' welfare
   in highly polarized non-competitive political environments, because it
   strengthens both discipline and selection without causing political
   gridlock. SP also raises voters' welfare if elections are very effective
   at disciplining first period incumbents. Nevertheless, SP may reduce
   voters' welfare if most rents go undetected and reform is not a
   first-order issue.},

Abstract = {Collective action among public officials is necessary for the effective
   delivery of many social services, but relatively little is known about
   how it can be fostered through policy reforms. In this article, we
   compare cooperation among public officials within decentralized versus
   centrally-administered municipalities in Honduras. Leveraging a
   quasi-experiment in health sector reform, coupled with behavioral games
   and social network surveys, we find that decentralization is associated
   with greater cooperation. When they are able to communicate, health
   sector workers in decentralized municipalities contribute more to a
   public good than their centrally-administered counterparts. This
   increase in cooperative behavior results in part from the
   decentralization reform engendering greater numbers of interactions and
   stronger ties across different levels of government. These findings
   indicate that institutional reforms like decentralization can favorably
   reconfigure patterns of social interactions across public organizations,
   which is an important component of administrative capacity in developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {Using thermometer score data from the ANES, we show that while there may
   have been no clear-cut Condorcet winner among the 2016 US presidential
   candidates, there appears to have been a Condorcet loser: Donald Trump.
   Thus the surprise is that the electorate preferred not only Hillary
   Clinton, but also the two ``minor{''} candidates, Gary Johnson and Jill
   Stein, to Trump. Another surprise is that Johnson may have been the
   Condorcet winner. A minimal normative standard for evaluating voting
   systems is advanced, privileging those systems that select Condorcet
   winners if one exists, and critiquing systems that allow the selection
   of Condorcet losers. A variety of voting mechanisms are evaluated using
   the 2016 thermometer scores: Condorcet voting, plurality, Borda, (single
   winner) Hare, Coombs, range voting, and approval voting. We conclude
   that the essential problem with the existing voting procedure-Electoral
   College runoff of primary winners of two major parties-is that it
   (demonstrably) allows the selection of a Condorcet loser.},

Abstract = {In this essay Cass Ezeji, a singer and linguist from Glasgow, explores
   her experiences of Gaelic Medium Education (GME) as a child with no
   direct roots to a' Ghaidhealtachd. She challenges the limitations of
   Scottish history taught in schools as well as perspectives on the Gaelic
   language. She considers the historical context of Afro-Scottish
   identities as a means of broadening the way we think about Gaelic and
   its speakers, whilst shedding light on a neglected diaspora.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a unique panel data set of supporters of the Alternative for
   Germany (AfD), the study shows that programmatic differences between
   supporters of Frauke Petry and Bernd Lucke cannot sufficiently explain
   the crucial intraparty leadership contest of July 2015. Programmatic
   differences were minor in 2013 but became pronounced over time.
   Politically active supporters were disaffected with the old moderate
   leadership of Bernd Lucke, who pursued an organizational reform to
   reduce the influence of the rank-and-file. Social media also played a
   key role in the leadership turnover, as alternative news sources on
   social media were only politicized by the intraparty opposition. It is
   conceivable that the structure of social media networks influences
   opinion formation processes and internal affairs of right-wing populist
   parties in general, as their supporters tend to have low trust in
   mainstream news.},

Abstract = {As a country with a diversity of languages, religions, ethnicities and
   cultures, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to the hostile play of
   identity politics. Lies produced during the Post-Truth period exploit
   many emotional sentiments and provoke interest groups to act based on
   primordial impulses that support certain political interests. The
   negative turbulence related to identity politics due to the chaotic
   circulation of hoaxes and misinformation is feared to lead to a
   Post-Democratic situation. Taking the case study of the two most
   influential elections in Indonesia: the 2017 Jakarta provincial election
   and the 2019 presidential election, this paper will explore how the
   Post-Truth phenomenon incorporates the issue of identity politics to
   generate a Post-Democratic situation in Indonesia. Secondary data
   analysis from the news and social media will be employed to further
   explain how identity politics is distorted in the media, and how it can
   generate social and political turbulence.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the valuable consistency among Montesquieu's
   political and constitutional views. The great complexity of his
   constitutional thought reveals that between the political body's
   different parts there is an aller de concert, a real `concert' where
   social elements, heterogeneous forces, constitutional maxims and
   concrete rules of the nation combine themselves in order to generate its
   constitution. Though being legal motions, the organs of the
   constitutional order reflect the forces in the society, expressing as
   institutions social elements whose presence and action they warrant
   within the constitutional system and political space through their own
   political function. Here Montesquieu brilliantly updates the old
   principle of correspondence between the nation specific social structure
   and its political government form.},

Abstract = {State repression is a prominent feature of nondemocracies, but its
   effectiveness in quieting dissent and fostering regime survival remains
   unclear. We exploit the location of military bases before the coup that
   brought Augusto Pinochet to power in Chile in 1973, which is
   uncorrelated to precoup electoral outcomes, and show that counties near
   these bases experienced more killings and forced disappearances at the
   hands of the government during the dictatorship. Our main result is that
   residents of counties close to military bases both registered to vote
   and voted ``No{''} to Pinochet's continuation in power at higher rates
   in the crucial 1988 plebiscite that bolstered the democratic transition.
   Potential mechanisms include informational frictions on the intensity of
   repression in counties far from bases and shifts in preferences caused
   by increased proximity to the events. Election outcomes after
   democratization show no lasting change in political preferences.},

Abstract = {During the euro crisis, the sustainability of Spain's debt burden was
   called into question. By 2019, however, Spain had successfully navigated
   its own crisis and reduced its debt burden. What role did Spain's
   emerging fiscal federal system play in this recovery? We analyze the
   performance of Spain's fiscal federalist framework and how it affected
   the country's budgetary balance, with a special emphasis on its
   coordination and on political relationships within the autonomous
   regions. Contrary to what advocates of the benefits of fiscal
   coordination argue, we find that coordination does not prevent the
   erosion of fiscal discipline in regions. Our results show that politics,
   rather than fiscal rules and frameworks, play an important role and have
   led to differing fiscal performance. In regions where incumbents were
   re-elected, coordination is employed to ensure more positive budgetary
   balances. Conversely, in regions with changing incumbents, coordination
   serves as an indicator of future fiscal problems.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the intrinsic relation between institutions and
   social justice. Its starting point is that processes of
   institutionalization invoke societal groups to articulate justice
   demands which, in their turn, give rise to processes of institutional
   redesign. In liberal democracies, demands for justice are articulated as
   a pursuit for emancipation and empowerment of groups that feel excluded
   by dominant categorizations. The imminent presence of this twin pursuit
   for justice can be explained by the conceptual inconsistencies that
   characterize the distinction between the public and private sphere.
   These inconsistencies also explain why demands for emancipation and
   empowerment are intrinsically ambiguous and inconsistent. In order to
   reconsider the question how institutions are to be adapted to allow for
   social justice while acknowledging the plurality, ambiguity and
   volatility of justice demands, the paper will propose an empirical and
   normative research agenda.},

Abstract = {This article identifies two main perspectives on flood control: the
   traditional and the modern hydrological. The objective here is to look
   at the contest between them from the point of view of the politics of
   knowledge. The traditional perspective views floods as a part of life
   and focuses on people's wisdom or local knowledge of flood control. The
   hydrological approach, on the other hand, is mostly concerned with
   taming a river and views floods as a disaster that ought to be
   controlled and possibly eliminated. This perspective dominates the
   policy of the post-colonial state in India. There are five vantage
   points, such as historical context, state policy, political economy,
   collective action and epistemology, to understand the politics of
   knowledge around floods. In the first section, through history we
   discuss the transition from the colonial to post-colonial India on the
   issues of floods, dams and embankments. The second section of this
   article describes the flood policy and politics around it, from Patna
   Flood Conference (1937) to Disaster Management Act, 2005. In Political
   Economy section the article explores the link between land-holdings,
   tenancy and floods and also observes how agriculture has changed due to
   floods. The fourth section, Forms of Collective Action, explores the
   politics of collective action. Epistemology section presents the debate
   of lokvidyavs versus rajyavidya or living with floods versus
   hydrological knowledge.},

Abstract = {This article presents a study on the hegemony category to expand and
   update its conceptualization. The text is divided into three parts: the
   first one proposes a location of this category within the framework of
   the concept of power in order to study the established order and its
   relations of force; the second one, the concept of common sense and its
   fundamental elements in the configuration of social consensus are
   analyzed; the third one, some principles are postulated to analyze the
   configuration of the sectors of society and their internal and external
   relations in the struggle for hegemony.},

Abstract = {While the number of regional trade agreements has expanded rapidly over
   the last 20 years, very few studies have analyzed individual preferences
   towards regional and bilateral trade. It is important, however, to
   consider individual attitudes toward bilateral trade distinctly. First,
   much of the recent public opposition to trade has not focused on
   globalization in general but relationships with specific countries.
   Second, democratically elected officials have political incentives to
   initiate trade disputes with unpopular partners. This article examines
   US public support for bilateral trade with South Korea. It is found that
   misconceptions about the Republic of Korea reduce US public support for
   bilateral trade. Priming respondents to view South Korea as wealthy,
   political allies, or culturally similar, however, increases support for
   trade. These results highlight the importance of perceptions and
   national branding on foreign relations.},

Abstract = {Natural resource conflicts between corporations and local communities
   were quite common in Indonesia. In an area in Pandeglang-Banten, a giant
   corporation tried to control the natural resources, especially in this
   case is water resource, and the local religious based community fought
   against the corporation's agenda. This paper describes the formation of
   a religious-based community doing social movement against a big
   corporation in Pandeglang, Banten Indonesia. The research method uses
   qualitative with case study strategy. The research location was in
   Cadasari District, Pandeglang Regent, Banten Province, Indonesia. This
   paper shows that the social movement succeeded to defend their accesses
   to water resources through religious doctrine easily understood by local
   people under the leadership by the local religious leaders (Kyai) from
   local Islamic schools (Pesantren). They share collective identity, as
   victims of the company project and also a moslem. The collective
   identity as victims as well as moslems, linked by dense religious
   informal networks and corporation and local government as clear enemy
   made their movement successfully terminated the company project. As a
   main actor, Kyai played significant roles to mobilize people in this
   social movement. Using her charismatic character, Kyai was able to
   defeat legal-rational leadership such as local government and security
   forces.},

Abstract = {The study of microfoundations, especially individuals, is enjoying a
   renaissance in international relations (IR) scholarship. Yet, this rise
   is more difficult to find in publication data. Using the Teaching,
   Research, and International Policy (TRIP) journal-article database, we
   show that only 13.7\% of IR articles in 12 leading journals use the
   first image. This proportion remains approximately the same from 1980
   through 2018. Interrogating the data, we show that this distribution
   does not stem from epistemological or methodological commitments, such
   as positivism, quantitative analysis, or formal modeling. We suggest
   several reasons for this apparent disjuncture between qualitative
   assessments of the rebirth of first-image theorizing and the
   quantitative data that imply a slower or perhaps more limited return.},

Abstract = {Many studies of women's electability in the developing world focus on
   single traits such as gender, ethnicity, or religion. Employing an
   original survey experiment in Jordan, we examine the impacts of
   multiple, intersecting candidate identities on voter preferences. We
   show empirically that existing theories of electoral behavior alone
   cannot account for women's electability. An intersectional lens that
   considers how power structures shape electability and produce complex
   effects that must be empirically verified in different contexts is
   needed. Although less electable overall, female candidates fare as well
   as males from similar social identity groups. Our findings underscore
   the need to apply intersectionality to theories of electoral behavior in
   the developing world and lay the groundwork for a larger research agenda
   explaining women's electability in Arab elections.},

Abstract = {During the eurozone crisis, technocratic governments were appointed in
   several eurozone countries, becoming in the eyes of many the embodiment
   of the EU's democratic deficit. In spite of the central place that these
   technocratic governments occupy in the scholarly debate, however, we
   have remarkably little evidence on Europeans' attitudes towards
   technocracy, and technocratic governments are under-studied from an
   empirical standpoint. We contribute to the very limited empirical
   literature on this topic by using a novel natural experiment design, in
   the context of the 2011 Italian crisis that led to the appointment of
   the Monti technocratic cabinet. We hypothesize that the effect of
   technocratic appointments on citizens' satisfaction with democracy is a
   priori uncertain, and it depends on the balance of a trade-off between
   reduced input participation and increased output effectiveness. Overall,
   the results point to citizens' attitudes towards technocracy being more
   complex than often assumed in the debate.},

Abstract = {The article examines the migration policy implemented in the governments
   of Mauricio Macri, Jair Bolsonaro and Lenin Moreno. Reviewing the
   theoretical proposals of `state thinking' and `segmenting openness', and
   through a hermeneutics and socio-anthropological perspective and
   analysis of network of the set of migration regulations issued in the
   three countries between 2015 and 2020, we observe a setback in the
   promigrant and rights-based approach that was implemented at the
   beginning of the 21st century. At the same time, there is a strategic
   use of Venezuelan migration in the framework of foreign policy and
   internal struggles for power and ideological orientations and the
   process of decision making.},

Abstract = {Following a proposal submitted by the Argentine Socialist Party, the
   Amsterdam (1904) and Stuttgart (1907) congresses of the Second
   International discussed the question of international migrations. The
   Argentine draft resolution sparked an international debate that went far
   beyond the local concerns that had originated the initial proposal. The
   `migration question' proved to be a core concern that threaded together
   very important political problems for the International, for which
   socialist parties of different countries had divergent solutions,
   because the situations and contexts they faced at the local level were
   very different. As was the case with debates on militarism and
   colonialism, the migration question showed that, behind the principled
   positions and a practice of internationalist sociability, the Second
   International showed tensions that divided national parties. Drawing
   upon extensive secondary bibliography, socialist newspapers from
   different countries and archival materials of the Second International,
   this article presents some first conclusions on this important aspect of
   the international history of socialism, little explored in Spanish. It
   does so by reviewing the debates of the Amsterdam and, above all, the
   Stuttgart congresses, but also contextualizing them with the situation
   and the approaches of different national parties.},

Abstract = {This paper, using the case study method and qualitative approach,
   studies the series The Mechanism, produced and distributed by Netflix,
   whose first season was launched worldwide on March 23, 2018, will be
   analyzed. It's a fiction created from real events, but which
   nevertheless presents a questionable narrative, especially in the
   political moment in which it emerged. Thus, the context in which the
   series was launched, the year of the Brazilian presidential elections,
   and its potential to influence electoral choices in that period are
   questioned.},

Abstract = {This article examines the historical trajectory of Chilean mutualism
   using a historiographical approach. In addition, to support this
   objective, research on Latin America and Europe is reviewed. The
   investigation includes both the so-called ``golden age{''}, 1853-1924,
   and the period generally considered as one of decadence (1925-1990). The
   analysis stops at this last date due to the almost absolute lack of
   studies of subsequent decades. The evaluation is done through critical
   analysis and research proposals.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nature of the child ` s right to be loved. In
   particular, it argues that besides reasons for ensuring that children
   are affectively cared for by their parents, we have strong reasons for
   why children should be loved unconditionally -that is, loved
   independently of their morally irrelevant features. The article defends
   this claim by engaging closely with an argument recently formulated by
   Samantha Brennan and Colin Macleod, according to which the child ` s
   right to be loved would be violated by strongly homophobic parents. I
   argue that Brennan's and Macleod's argument needs to be revised because,
   while it generates a convincing conclusion in the case of homophobic
   parents, it fails to do so in other cases. This problem calls for a
   reconsideration of the nature of the right to be loved. Drawing on
   Philip Pettit's analysis of robust goods, I argue that this right is a
   right to be loved unconditionally and an appeal to unconditional love
   allows us to accommodate the conviction that strongly racist as well as
   homophobic parents wrong their children by failing to love them
   (unconditionally).},

Abstract = {The Scholarship on education and practice has recently encouraged the
   inclusion of writing assignments in the classroom.
   Writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) programmes have been implemented
   across universities and colleges, promoting structured writing
   assignments outside of language-based programmes and courses. The
   collective knowledge on the subject highlights the effectiveness of
   frequent short assignments as being better for achieving learning goals,
   in comparison with more traditional, longer term papers often assigned
   in upper-division and graduate political science courses. This paper
   outlines our efforts to revise the curriculum in two of the courses in
   our policy-focused master's program. In particular, we focus on two
   types of policy writing, policy memos and infographics. In this paper,
   we discuss the background of the program and courses, our choices of
   assignments, and their design and implementation. Further, we present
   evidence of how these assignments contributed to student learning in the
   courses.},

Abstract = {Drawing on his past work as an interpreter of Adam Smith, Hanley offers
   an account of Fenelon's social and political thought that emphasizes the
   role (and the dangers) of pride and self-love in human affairs. Fenelon
   does not join those, like Mandeville and La Rochefoucauld, who seek to
   understand and possibly to control self-love. Instead, he attempts to
   wed a far more rigorous and classical approach to the problem of
   pride-namely, the refinement of self-love through virtuous practices-to
   a modern view of the state and political economy.},

Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of
   Japan has tried to institutionalize contacts with the Chinese Communist
   Party (CCP). Until 2009, the Sino-Japanese Conference of Exchange
   Between the Ruling Parties did little to build ties of trust between
   both sides, but its revival in 2015 proved much more successful. This
   article argues that as the institutionalized channels were prone to
   disturbance caused by ideological leanings of party officials, they did
   not work as efficiently as sub-party level of exchange. The weakening of
   LDP factions and centralization of decision-making process under the
   Prime Minister, however, contributed to shortages of Japan's
   semi-official diplomacy towards China, which detrimentally influenced
   bilateral contacts, especially under the second Abe administration.
   Paradoxically, since 2015 the revived Conference started playing a more
   important role thanks to determination of LDP secretaries-general. This
   article examines the gravity of these personal factors in LDP-CCP
   relations.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-367},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Citizen exposure to political incivility is increasing. Studies have
   found heterogeneous responses to incivility, but we know little about
   what drives this variation. This study investigates whether emotional
   responses to both civility and incivility are driven by moral value
   commitments. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory, we argue that
   incivility should pose more of a threat to people who embrace an
   individualizing system of moral regulation than a binding system. To
   test this, we conduct a 3 x 3 between-subjects survey-embedded vignette
   experiment with a representative sample of 1,789 U.S. respondents. The
   vignettes describe interactions between two candidates in a debate. The
   findings show that respondents clearly distinguish between civil,
   neutral, and uncivil debate and that these conditions yield distinct
   emotional responses. Moreover, we show ``individualizers{''} have a
   stronger emotional response to incivility than ``binders.{''} Responses
   to civility, however, appear to be unaffected by moral value
   commitments.},

   city-making. It provides a political economy of the city's ``cultural
   reach{''} by connecting the dynamics of cultural production to value
   creating processes in and through urban regeneration to understand when,
   how, and which groups and sites become de- and re-valorized. It
   highlights the futility of nation state-city, state-civil society
   binaries in analysing the power geometry of multiscalar actors involved
   in the work, efficacy and the potency of cultural networks,
   institutions, and ``cultural diplomacy.{''}},

Abstract = {When looking for possible constraints on Differentiated Integration, the
   fundamental values of the European Union (EU) seem an obvious starting
   point. Both the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the values articulated
   in Art. 2 TEU are cross-cutting across EU states. However, while
   fundamental values have acted as centralising devices in other federal
   settings, in an EU context marked by extensive value disagreement, they
   may also act as pathways for differentiation. Insofar as national
   constitutional orders disagree on the scope of EU rights, attempts to
   ground EU law in fundamental values trigger inevitable interpretive
   conflicts across states. This paper will use the examples of asylum and
   the European Arrest Warrant to demonstrate this argument: while EU law
   may use fundamental values as a reason to harmonise EU law across
   states, such values may also be invoked to question the principle of
   mutual trust underlying the EU legal order, thereby causing rather than
   limiting differentiation.},

Title = {Drinking Alone: Local Socio-Cultural Degradation and Radical Right
   Support-The Case of British Pub Closures},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {54},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1653-1692},

Abstract = {Little is known about how local context influences radical right voting.
   This paper advances the theory that the degradation of local
   socio-cultural hubs is linked to radical right support by contributing
   to loss of community and cultural identity. I examine this thesis by
   exploiting an original dataset on British community pub closures. I
   argue that the disappearance of community pubs triggers social isolation
   and signals the decline of the British working class condition, which is
   associated with UKIP support. Combining district-level data with UK
   panel data (2013-2016), I show that individuals living in districts that
   experience one additional community pub closure (relative to the total
   number of pubs per district) are more likely to support UKIP than any
   other party by 4.3 percentage points. The effect is magnified under
   conditions of material deprivation. This paper highlights the
   significance of local socio-cultural degradation as a mechanism to
   explain radical right support.},

Title = {Populism and the Rule of Recognition Challenging the Foundations of
   Democratic Legal Systems},
Journal = {POPULISM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {By reference to legal positivism and Hart's Concept of Law, the paper
   argues that populism targets and aims to reconstruct the democratic rule
   of recognition. In particular, populism exploits the ambiguities in the
   nature of this social rule, by advocating the extension of the group
   whose consensus determines the criteria of legal validity from the
   restricted sphere of judges and officials, to the people at large.
   Populism instrumentalises the functions of the rule of recognition,
   aiming to provoke uncertainty in the system in order to accomplish a
   shift and, thus, alter the content of the rule. Infiltrating concepts
   with meanings that suit its ends and reordering the criteria of legal
   validity, populism prioritises an absolute form of popular sovereignty
   over a thin, dubious version of the rule of law. Nevertheless, the
   latter's ambiguity allows populism to claim that the rule of law still
   forms part of its rule of recognition.},

Abstract = {It has long been recognized that economic inequality may undermine the
   principle of equal responsiveness that lies at the core of democratic
   governance. A recent wave of scholarship has highlighted an acute degree
   of political inequality in contemporary democracies in North America and
   Europe. In contrast to the view that unequal responsiveness in favor of
   the affluent is nearly inevitable when income inequality is high, we
   argue that organized labor can be an effective source of political
   equality. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the U.S. House of
   Representatives, our novel dataset combines income-specific estimates of
   constituency preferences based on 223,000 survey respondents matched to
   roll-call votes with a measure of district-level union strength drawn
   from administrative records. We find that local unions significantly
   dampen unequal responsiveness to high incomes: a standard deviation
   increase in union membership increases legislative responsiveness
   towards the poor by about six to eight percentage points. As a result,
   in districts with relatively strong unions legislators are about equally
   responsive to rich and poor Americans. We rule out alternative
   explanations using flexible controls for policies, institutions, and
   economic structure, as well as a novel instrumental variable for
   unionization based on history and geography. We also show that the
   impact of unions operates via campaign contributions and partisan
   selection.},

Title = {Racial Isolation Drives Racial Voting: Evidence from the New South
   Africa},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {How does local demographic context shape political behavior? We
   investigate how racial isolation, one of the natural consequences of
   structural segregation, is related to racial voting in South Africa.
   Using a variety of new datasets, which include for the first time high
   resolution census data from before the end of apartheid, we leverage
   plausibly exogenous variation in the extent to which local segregation
   persisted after the end of apartheid to study this relationship. Whites
   who are more isolated engage in more racial voting, measured as the
   probability of voting along racial lines, against black political
   parties. Using geo-referenced survey data for over 39,000 people we then
   present individual level evidence consistent with our findings, and
   discuss potential mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the Strategic Culture Theory, this article analyzes Iran's
   evolving ballistic missile program (BMP), by focusing especially on the
   period of the Trump administration (January 2017-January 2021),
   including both Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shooting
   down a US surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz in June 2019 and
   Iran's attack on the US military bases following the assassination of
   IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, in January 2020. This work demonstrates
   the increasing reliance on the `revolutionary', more offensive
   narrative, which has become additionally reinforced after the
   assassination of General Qasem Soleimani and Professor Mohsen
   Fakhrizadeh. This has consolidated the retaliatory aspects in Iran's
   foreign and security policy, while it has also marginalized moderated
   actors willing to engage in negotiations with the US.},

Abstract = {I examined the use of Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic to find out
   how many Twitter users started to follow relevant Canadian political and
   health authorities, and I investigated their activity and interests. To
   this end, I analyzed 398,037 Twitter accounts. The results reveal that
   the Twitter accounts of relevant authorities gained a significant number
   of new Twitter followers during the pandemic. The Twitter users who
   joined during the pandemic were rather passive; they tweeted and liked
   fewer tweets than Twitter users who registered in the months prior to
   the pandemic. They also chose to follow Twitter accounts predominantly
   related to news, politics and governmental agencies. These findings
   suggest that during the pandemic, numerous information-seeking citizens
   joined Twitter for the purpose of obtaining information about public
   health matters, which in turn suggests that authorities should
   incorporate Twitter into their information dissemination tools,
   especially during emergencies, to meet the public demand for
   information.},

   European Terrorist Finance Tracking System (TFTS), and lastly, in the
   conclusion we will attempt to carry out a critical analysis of the
   current situation and how we believe this exchange of information will
   be developed within the framework of the TFTP and the TFTS in the near
   future.},

Abstract = {The United States, and the world, is in the grips of a coronavirus
   pandemic, and in the United States, we are facing a crisis of faith in
   the fairness of our political institutions, particularly the ability of
   Black Americans to live without the fear of dying at the hands of the
   police for going about their daily lives. Race has been and continues to
   be intertwined with American government and politics, in general, and
   how the United States approaches crises, in particular. Racial minority
   groups have been scapegoats for the failings of American policy makers
   to deal with numerous crises historically and at present. Race and
   racism are also at the foundation of the origins of American political
   science. The racism at the roots of our discipline's founding have
   created a blindness to the significance and importance of the field of
   Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (REP) to the study of politics, democracy,
   and how American society reacts during a crisis. Our discipline is also
   at an inflection point that requires us to acknowledge its racist
   origins, confront its continued influence on the present, and finally to
   move forward in recognizing the importance of REP to the health and
   future of the discipline.},

Abstract = {Although 4 July 2020 saw the coming into force of constitutional changes
   in Russia, this was far from the end of the story. Most clearly, these
   changes to the 1993 constitution required implementation, including
   through amendments to, and the writing of new pieces of, federal
   legislation. In part, this process was the mundane work of legal
   bureaucrats, tweaking and creating many pieces of legislation to reflect
   the new constitutional text. But the implementation process also reveals
   much more about the broader constitutional reform project. This article
   reviews the implementation process, discussing its complexity, the
   improvisation shown when fleshing out certain new constitutional
   details, its relationship with other political developments, and the
   chasm laid bare between Putin's promise of the rebalancing of power in
   his 15 January 2020 Address to the Federal Assembly versus the reality
   of reform in practice.},

Abstract = {The belief that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment is
   commonplace. Yet the punitive conception of individual responsibility
   commonly associated with `just deserts' exaggerates the moral meaning of
   criminal guilt, normalizes excessive punishment, and distracts from
   shared responsibility for social injustice. The problem is, many people
   who get caught up in the criminal justice system cannot reasonably be
   thought to deserve their fate. Mental illness, intellectual disability,
   addiction, trauma, and poverty are morally mitigating factors when it
   comes to assessing how blameworthy a person is for criminal behavior.
   But with the exception of extreme forms of mental illness that fall into
   the very narrow legal category of `insanity,' people who struggle with
   serious difficulties are not treated as less blameworthy by the criminal
   justice system. The criteria of legal guilt does not match up well with
   the moral concept of blameworthiness.
   The solution might seem to be somehow to refine legal practice to make
   blame more context-sensitive, but I argue that rather than try to revise
   our criminal justice practices to fit better with common notions of
   blame and desert, we should get out of the public blaming business
   altogether. A determination morally to condemn individual offenders is
   not helping us to resolve the disaster of mass incarceration or the
   problems faced by returning citizens. It does not help us to see clearly
   the connection between crime and other problems of social injustice,
   like poverty, lack of mental health care, drug addiction, racial
   discrimination, and violence. Were we to be less fixated on individual
   responsibility, and more cognizant of our shared responsibility to treat
   all members of society as equal persons, entitled to the same basic
   rights, liberties, and opportunities, we might be in a better position
   to work collectively to address problems of social injustice that
   contribute to the problem of crime.},

Abstract = {What factors shape attitudes toward immigration? Previous studies have
   typically debated whether citizens oppose immigration more for economic
   or cultural reasons. We broaden this debate by exploring how different
   segments of the citizenry feel about immigration. Our original surveys
   conducted in Japan reveal two separate axes along which many citizens
   view immigration: (1) its cultural and economic effects, and (2) its
   positive and negative effects. Even in Japan, whose relatively closed
   policy toward immigration is conventionally believed to reflect
   widespread public intolerance of outsiders, over 60 percent of our
   respondents favor widening the doors to immigrants for economic or
   cultural reasons or both.},

Abstract = {Widespread distrust in politicians is often attributed to the way elites
   portray politics to citizens: the media, competing candidates, and
   foreign governments are largely considered responsible for portraying
   politicians as self-interested actors pursuing personal electoral and
   economic interests. This article turns to the mass level and considers
   the active role of citizens in disseminating such information. We build
   on psychological research on human cooperation, holding that people
   exhibit an interpersonal transmission bias in favor of information on
   the self-interested, antisocial behavior of others to maintain group
   cooperation. We posit that this transmission bias extends to politics,
   causing citizens to disproportionally disseminate information on
   self-interested politicians through interpersonal communication and, in
   turn, contributes to distrust in politicians and policy disapproval. We
   support these predictions using novel experimental studies, allowing us
   to observe transmission rates and opinion effects in actual
   communication chains. The findings have implications for understanding
   and accommodating political distrust.},

Title = {Why do central states accept holding independence referendums? Analyzing
   the role of state peripheries},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Why do central states accept holding independence referendums if they
   could lose a part of their territory during this process? Several
   variables have been proposed to explain this contradiction, but the most
   robust one has proved to be the competition-proximity model formulated
   by Qvortrup (2014). This paper challenges this theory by stressing the
   role of state peripheries. According to our approach, central
   governments are more likely to risk losing poor and isolated territories
   if they represent a cost for the host state. Drawing on an updated
   version of the contested sovereignty data set (1776-2019) by Mendez and
   Germann (2018), this paper demonstrates statistically that the
   ``peripheriness{''} variables related to the economy and - especially -
   location are significant. Consequently, the competition-proximity model
   remains the best-fitted scheme for explaining central governments'
   decision-making, but it can be amended slightly by taking into account
   the peripheral nature of separatist regions.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive restrictions on public life. A
   survey of more than 1500 local councilors showed that councils at the
   local level are restricted in their capacity. After a total lockdown in
   March 2020 at the local level, the local central committee
   (Hauptausschuss) took over, substituting for and representing the full
   city council's local decision-making capacity. Later on, in some cities,
   councils were able to implement council meetings with half of the
   councilors. In this ``executive hour,{''} several local committees and
   commissions as well as political events organized by the civil society
   could not be implemented. Before the local elections on September 22 in
   North Rhine-Westphalia, the pandemic affected the registration of
   political parties, which became problematic. Appropriate space, as well
   as digital infrastructure, was lacking. With more mitigated COVID-19
   restrictions and new regulations for local elections by the province of
   North Rhine-Westphalia, electoral party registration was facilitated,
   and deadlines were extended. In particular, smaller political parties
   and new candidates for the mayoral direct election experienced problems
   in presenting themselves during electoral campaigns; new parties and
   candidates were often disadvantaged compared with the political
   incumbent and the established political parties. Furthermore, electoral
   street campaigning, panel discussions, and canvassing were extremely
   limited. In this time of ``forced digitization,{''} the established
   political parties in particular were able to focus on e-campaigning.
   Because of these disadvantages, smaller parties requested postponement
   of the local elections. The majority in all political parties refused
   postal voting.},

Abstract = {The working classes are underrepresented in nearly every legislature
   around the world. Here, we examine several understudied questions about
   working class representation in legislatures. We are interested in which
   parties nominate working class candidates, and whether voters or parties
   discriminate against legislative candidates from the working class.
   Using data on the occupational background of German state legislative
   candidates, we find extreme left and right parties nominate more working
   class candidates than traditional centre-left and centre-right parties.
   We also find working class candidates are less likely to win elections
   compared to candidates from other socio-economic classes.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that states have a duty of legitimacy to offer
   refugees membership in the form of citizenship. This argument builds on
   a popular normative approach to refugeehood put forward by David Owen,
   which characterises the refugee protection regime as a `legitimacy
   repair mechanism' for the international order of states. However, I
   argue that, because of the relationship between membership and the
   claimability of basic rights, the refugee protection regime only
   successfully fulfils this function when states are required to offer
   citizenship to refugees. This paper therefore offers an important
   extention to David Owen's view. I contend that the basic condition of
   refugeehood is the break-down of membership: a relationship which allows
   individuals to claim basic rights as a matter of standing. Therefore,
   the legitimacy repair function of refugee protection is only successful
   when such membership is re-established. This account demonstrates that
   states' duties to refugees go far beyond allowing entry and the
   protection of basic rights on a temporary basis. Instead, refugees are
   owed citizenship in their state of asylum.},

Title = {Authoritarian experience and electoral success: the fate of
   authoritarian diasporans in Kenya},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {502-520},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, many African countries have instituted multiparty
   elections and experienced electoral turnover. Despite this apparent
   change, politics in many places remains dominated by politicians who
   defected from the former authoritarian ruling party and won power on
   rival party tickets. Kenya is seen as a paradigmatic case of this kind
   of authoritarian ``diaspora{''}. After the defeat of the Kenya African
   National Union (KANU) in 2002, the party entered into fairly speedy
   decline, yet the country has yet to elect a president or deputy
   president who did not previously hold office in KANU. Former KANU
   office-holders also composed significant proportions of cabinet
   appointees after KANU's defeat in 2002. But how far down the ladder of
   political office does the prevalence of ``diasporans{''} extend? In the
   first multiparty elections of 1992, 1997, and 2002, we show that KANU
   diasporans compose a sizeable proportion of candidates in parliamentary
   elections, and both ``strong{''} and ``weak{''} diasporans were more
   successful in winning election than new political entrants. This
   suggests that, overall, Kenyan voters do not consistently sanction

Abstract = {As with the United States and Great Britain there has been a
   markedincrease in the prevalence of political sex scandal themed stories
   reported on by Irish media since the 1990s. This article considers the
   concept of the political sex scandal, and its relationship with media in
   the Irish case. It argues that political sex scandal was a frequent part
   of Irish journalism pre-independence but that, post-independence, this
   approach was replaced with a reticence to report such scandal until the
   1990s. It finds that,today, Irish media avoid reporting on the private
   lives of politicians and instead focus on incidents wherein politicians
   intervene in sex-related court cases, when politicians are caught acting
   inappropriately on camera and on when politicians engage in matters
   sexual on social media. Thus, unlike the US and Britain, the key
   structural characteristic of contemporary Irish political sex scandals
   is not media intrusion into the private lives of politicians but rather
   media oversight of when and how politicians engage in sex-related issues
   in public fora such as the judicial system and social media.},

Abstract = {Dominant normative theories of armed conflict orientate themselves
   around the ultimate goal of peace. Yet the deployment of these theories
   in the international sphere appears to have failed in advancing toward
   this goal. In this paper, we argue that one major reason for this
   failure is these theories' use of essentially contested concepts-that
   is, concepts whose internally complex character results in no principled
   way of adjudicating between rival interpretations of them. This renders
   the theories susceptible to manipulation by international actors who are
   able to pursue bellicose policies under the cover of nominally pacific
   frameworks, and we show how this happened historically in a case study
   of the Korean War of 1950-1953. In order to better serve the goals of
   peace, we suggest, the rules of war should be reframed to simpler, but
   more restrictive, normative principles.},

Abstract = {Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is a class of reforms increasingly used in
   the United States to replace plurality and runoff elections. We ask
   whether support for RCV taps a larger generational divide in politics.
   We consult five surveys, two of these from recent adoption campaigns,
   and all with different ways of asking about RCV support. Generation is a
   significant predictor in four of these samples, accounting for standard
   demographic factors and partisanship. This relationship also holds
   within black and Republican subgroups, two groups often thought to be
   less likely to support RCV. Finally, we find that dissatisfaction with
   ``the way that democracy works in America{''} is a plausible link
   between generation and reform support. For better or worse, RCV has
   potential to divide two important voting blocs in America. Our results
   suggest that, rather than turn away from electoral politics, a
   disaffected young generation may turn to reform.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on an analysis of an application of active learning
   in the international relations (IR) classroom. We present an experience
   of the so-called Challenge Game that allows the professor to explore
   analytical categories and basic assumptions of realist theory of IR. In
   addition, describing the operation of the game in its basic modality,
   several variations are also presented in order to help explore realism,
   both in its classic and structural version. We show that key concepts
   found in realist and neorealist theories, such as the elements that
   influence the behavior of states in the international system, different
   conceptions of power and interests, aspects of competition, the
   centrality of the rationality of the state, alliances building, balance
   of power, the anarchy of the system, and the idea of hegemony can be
   either introduced or revised in a dynamic fashion in an IR theory class.
   The game has been thought to provide means to promote active (instead of
   passive) learning. As a result, the class can become more dynamic, with
   the consequent increase of the students interest on the issue. Besides,
   the activity can provide an environment for discussion, boosting
   students' potential to think about the content.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on immigration news as driver of anti-immigrant party
   support. Predicting the poll results of the Dutch Freedom Party (PW), we
   distinguish between (a) general immigration news, news in which
   immigration is linked to (b) crime, (c) terrorism, or (d) the economy,
   and (e) immigration news in which the Freedom Party is mentioned
   explicitly. Focusing on the period 2004-2017, an extensive dataset has
   been generated using computer-assisted content analyses of media
   coverage (n =1,697,976), public opinion data, and real-world indicators.
   Time-series analyses demonstrate a positive impact of general
   immigration news on anti-immigrant party support - and not on the
   support for other parties. No media effects are found for the
   immigration sub-issues or the visibility of the Freedom Party in the
   news. However, the main competitor on the right side of the political
   spectrum - the Liberal Party (WD) - may also benefit from immigration
   news but only when it manages to be linked to the issue in the media
   coverage. Our results raise relevant questions about the preconditions
   of issue ownership effects, and show how issue ownership is a highly
   contested political asset in a fragmented and competitive multiparty
   system.},

Abstract = {While challenger parties are on the rise in Europe, there has been
   little attention paid so far to their organization. Even though new
   parties enjoying path-breaking electoral success soon after their
   foundation tend to lose votes at their second electoral contests, due
   among other things to their organizational structures, some parties
   stand as exceptions. Among them, the Five-star Movement is the most
   prominent such party in Europe. The party has undergone a number of
   major organizational changes in the last ten years, which have halted
   its institutionalization process, but whose impact on electoral success
   were at first sight less relevant. How did the party deal with the issue
   of internal reforms and how did these internal reforms change the party
   structure? This article retraces the party's transformations and tests
   hypotheses related to three competing interpretations of the Movement's
   organization: those that see it as a business-firm party, a franchise
   party and a party movement. Ten years after its foundation, I contend
   that the Movement should now be analysed as a `plebiscitarian' movement
   party.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the relation between the political situation in
   Mexico and the evolution of organized crime through an analysis of the
   rase of the state of Michoacan. It proposes that the failure of the
   policies implemented to combat crime in the country can largely be
   explained by the adoption of a police-military strategy that does not
   address the structural causes of violence. In terms of methodology,
   research was conducted from an ethnographic perspective based on a
   detailed examination of the anti-crime policies of recent Mexican
   presidential administrations and their impact on Michoacan; an analysis
   framed in the perspective of historical institutionalism. The study
   concludes that by taking advantage of the weakness of the state and
   broad gaps in its authority, power groups such as organized crime have
   successfully embedded themselves in the wider society and the specific,
   concrete dynamics of the Mexican political system, especially at the
   level of local governments, making the problem of criminality a
   political matter, not one that concerns only the police or the military.},

Abstract = {Due to the rate of transformations taking place in the modern world, a
   demand is being created amongst the public for political initiatives and
   innovations, although this poses the problem of creating a sustainable
   system for the younger generation. This demand is usually addressed to
   young people and their active part-youth political leaders. The article
   assesses the capacity of youth political leaders and the youth community
   within the Russian regions to act as innovators in the social and
   political sphere. The article mainly focuses on the research into young
   people's ideas about the innovative potential of youth leaders and the
   conditions for updating and actualizing this. The research has proved
   that young people have a pragmatic attitude towards their leaders, who
   are supposed, first of all, to solve problems of the young, acting
   innovatively if needs must. The main criterion for how effectiveness
   leaders' activities are in the minds of young people is their commitment
   and the presence of visible results. At the same time, the analysis of a
   mass youth survey in Altai Krai and Novosibirsk Oblast revealed low
   leadership and innovation potential of the young community. Only a small
   number of people in this socio-demographic group are ready to become
   active participants in political processes and take responsibility for
   making and implementing executive decisions. The authors emphasize that
   the majority of young people assess the current influence displayed by
   their leaders on the political process in the country and its regions
   negatively. Young people see this situation as being caused by both
   objective and subjective factors - the low political activity taken by
   the leaders themselves and the restrictions placed on implementing their
   innovative potential as imposed by political institutions and elites.
   Based on the survey of members of Youth Parliaments and leaders of youth
   socio-political organizations in the regions under discussion, the
   artucke concludes that, within modern Russian policy-making, the
   innovative potential of youth political leaders cannot be employed; this
   is because youth leaders have access only to the local government and
   youth policy, and also due to their lack of experience and resources as
   are necessary to overcome the longstanding ``game rules{''}.},

   conceptualization at individual and state levels between the years
   2000-2019. It was set out that water conflicts and water insecurity in
   Iraq, Syria and Turkey in the 20-year period after 2000 were caused by
   attacks to water resources and infrastructure at micro and mezzo levels,
   other than natural disasters such as climate change and reduced water
   resources. This research focuses on the water conflicts that have arisen
   in recent years, with some exceptions, not between states but by groups
   operating at regional levels. It has also been observed in recent years
   that terrorism-induced attacks have focused on waterways and threatens
   water security. The study focused on the conflicts occurring in Iraq,
   Syria and Turkey and the causes of these conflicts within the framework

Abstract = {During the French vote on same-sex marriage, small subgroups of students
   and young professionals have emerged alongside La Manif pour tous
   (LMPT). Among these small-scale organizations, ``Les Veilleurs{''} and
   ``Les Gavroches{''} crafted a rhetoric based on ``conquering the
   streets{''} and public space, developing an alternative playbook to
   LMPT's classic way of working. Invoking Gramscian ``cultural combat{''},
   they aimed to continue the mobilization efforts and ensure their
   visibility at a time when their decline was underway. Their search for
   ``new methods of action{''} sheds light on the concrete ways in which
   these conservative Catholics learn to protest publicly despite their
   relative dearth of experience in activism. Drawing on an ethnographic
   lens, this article seeks to identify what these tactical repertoires
   reveal about mobilized resources, internal targeting, and cultural
   motives. Transfers and borrowings, the initiatory function of these
   repertoires, their ideological roots, and their urban occupation
   patterns altogether reflect a learning process and a mobilization that
   seeks to politicize well beyond gender issues.},

Abstract = {The literature on social movements' policy outcomes agrees on the need
   for an intertemporal perspective that goes beyond a short-term
   action-reaction logic to account for the effects of mobilization on
   policies. However, little attention has been given to the causal
   mechanisms that link different waves of mobilization with related policy
   outcomes over time. To do so, we propose the concept of chaining
   mechanisms as a means to connect different iterations of protest,
   electoral cycles and policy responses within a mid-term perspective. We
   distinguish between two types of chaining mechanisms, strategic and
   inertial, and apply this conceptual framework to the Chilean student
   movement in the 2006 and 2018 period. We assert that its success in
   chaining different waves of protest is a crucial factor in accounting
   for the recent major education reform that took place under Bachelet's
   government (2014-2018). Beyond the case, the concept contributes to the
   understanding of the complex interactions between social mobilization
   and public policy.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, South American countries have forged an integration
   agenda that has provided a new sub-regional strategic vision, based on
   strategic infrastructure networks. Although this agenda has not shown a
   continuous implementation, the construction of the RILA (Latin American
   Integration Route), which will connect south-central Brazil, Paraguay,
   northern Argentina and northern Chile, has been an important subregional
   political link. Through linking the dynamic economic regions with
   Chilean ports, RILA will not only boost the flow of regional production
   to Asian and American markets, but will also stimulate trading,
   investment and people flows at the sub-regional level. However this
   route will also cross through less dynamic regions, such as the
   Brazilian Border Strip. Thereby the socioeconomic transformations
   derived from the implementation of RILA at different scales are
   identified. Using the scales analysis of power and management allow both
   to identify these transformations and to relate them to different agents
   and actors. In the case of the municipality of Porto Murtinho, in the
   state of Mato Grosso do Sul, located in the Brazilian Border Strip, the
   overlapping of interests from different agents and actors has imposed
   new uses on the territory. However, there is a little participation of
   the local scale in these new territorial dynamics.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Abstract = {How do statistics produced by an international economic organization
   become an ``obligatory passage point{''} of a ``social{''} sector such
   as health? This article seeks the answer to this question through a
   statistical analysis of the profiles of the agents who signed the OECD
   reports on health between 1990 and 2018. Borrowing from the sociology of
   intellectuals, it shows that the OECD initially sought the legitimacy
   conferred by recognized general economists whose prestige reflected on
   the institution and the conventions of equivalence that were produced.
   Once the OECD was legitimized, from the 2000s onward, the reports were
   signed by little-known experts in health economics, employed on a
   full-time basis by the international organization, whose work was
   reduced to aggregating and commenting on the statistics transmitted by
   the countries. Combined with archival analysis, interviews, and the
   observation of meetings at the OECD, the statistical analysis thus
   offers a sociological explanation of the success of a statistical
   nomenclature that has become an ``obligatory passage point{''} for
   health system reforms in industrialized countries.},

Abstract = {Voter representation based on votes cast and the degree of concentration
   of the party system are two variables correlated with the design of the
   electoral system. In general, there is an inverse relationship between
   proportionality and concentration: when the proportionality of the
   electoral system increases, the concentration of the party system
   decreases and vice versa. This paper investigates the performance of the
   electoral system used in local elections in Romania, by operationalizing
   and measuring the two variables: proportionality and concentration.
   Although the elections are held under the same rules, they do not
   involve a unitary electoral process, but 42 distinct electoral
   situations, related to as many local electoral districts. There are 42
   electoral competitions and basically the same number of elections. The
   analysis results indicate that the high magnitude PR system does not
   have an enhanced performance in providing both proportionality and
   concentration.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the evolving mobilizational strategies of robust
   unions in contemporary Latin America. The origins of these strategies
   are rooted in the neoliberal adjustment policies in the early 1990s that
   compensated and reshaped power relations in labor organizations. With
   union compensation, a dominant faction concentrated power and embraced
   instrumentalism; the union exchanged electoral support with various
   parties for particularistic benefits. When adjustment policies were
   adopted without compensation, power was dispersed in an archipelago of
   activists. Unions then relied on movementism, which centered on
   contentious demand making and resistance to partisan alliances.
   Comparing teachers in Mexico and Argentina, this article contributes to
   broader debates about the effects of democracy on contentious politics
   and the changing partisan identities of workers.},

Abstract = {Political theory today has expanded its scope to debate business
   corporations, conceiving of them as political actors, not (just) private
   actors in the market place. This article shows the continuing relevance
   of Thomas Hobbes's work for this debate. Hobbes is commonly treated as a
   defender of the so-called concession theory, which traces the legitimacy
   of corporations to their being chartered by sovereign state authorities
   for public purposes. This theory is widely judged to be anachronistic
   for contemporary business corporations, because these can now be freely
   formed, on the basis of private initiative. However, a close reading of
   the crucial passages in Hobbes's work reveals a more subtle view, which
   rejects this private/public dualism. Hobbes's reflections on the
   companies of merchants of his day provide room for business
   corporations' pursuit of private purposes, while keeping them embedded
   in a public framework of authority. Moreover, by criticizing the
   monopoly status of these companies, he opens up a way to integrate
   market failure arguments from modern economics into concession theory.
   The ``neo-Hobbesian concession theory{''} emerging from this analysis
   shows how concession theory can accommodate private initiative and
   economic analysis, and thus be a relevant position in the debate about
   the modern business corporation.},

Abstract = {For elections to produce accountable government, citizens must reward
   politicians who deliver benefits. Yet there is relatively limited causal
   evidence of changes in public opinion in direct response to specific
   government programs. This question is examined in Tanzania, which has
   implemented large health programs targeting diseases such as HIV/AIDS
   and malaria. Tanzania's 2010-11 antimalaria campaign took place
   concurrently with a national household survey. Exploiting
   discontinuities based on interview dates to estimate the effect of these
   programs on the popularity of local politicians, this article shows that
   a bed net distribution campaign resulted in large, statistically
   significant improvements in approval of political leaders, especially in
   malaria endemic areas. Effects were largest shortly after program
   implementation but persisted for up to six months. These findings
   suggest that citizens update their evaluation of politicians in response
   to programs, especially those that address important problems, and that
   the effects decay over time, but not completely.},

Abstract = {This article explores the trajectories of survival in the aftermath of
   state-led disaster. In particular, it considers how survivors have
   experienced and understood their survival from the 1989 Hillsborough
   disaster and its subsequent injustices. Drawing upon interviews and
   conversations with those who experienced the disaster, as well as with
   key professional informants, it critically examines the factors that
   assist or inhibit survival attempts. The article shows that survival
   significantly depends upon wider official and social responses to
   survivors. Survival is a continual process, and responses towards
   survivors can support quality of life but also cause re-victimization
   and retraumatization.},

Title = {PUTTING THE MARGINS AT THE CENTER: AT THE EDGES OF PROTEST IN MOROCCO

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Almost ten years have passed since the Arab uprisings of 2011 turned the
   social-political equilibrium of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   region upside down. Despite successful counter-revolutionary policies,
   protests continue to challenge the status quo. The main difference with
   the 2011 is that current and ongoing political and social protests are
   less ``visible{''} as they happen at the ``margins{''} of society. This
   paper investigates the role of marginality and marginalisation in the
   cycle of protests and the dynamic of revolution and counter-revolution
   in the MENA region. The continuous eruption of social contestations in
   the rural and urban margins of North Africa forces us to reconsider
   previous academic analyses which understood the so-called ``Arab
   Spring{''} as a predominantly urban youth movement, principally from a
   middle-class background. Protests at the margins not only constitute the
   hidden history of revolts of 2011, they also continue these revolts in a
   less visible, less concentrated, and less articulated manner. Putting
   the margins at the centre of analysis allows us to conceive of a cycle
   of protest not only in diachronic terms, as a temporal ebb and flow of
   contestation, but also a socio-spatial process of converging and
   refracting protests - from the margins to the centre and back again. We
   take a closer look at events in Egypt and Morocco. For the Egyptian case
   we investigate rural and urban protests against the new Law on Building
   Violations. Through the lens of marginalisation, we are able to reveal
   the contours of a socio-spatial hierarchy of protests, which has been
   shaping social movements in Egypt long before 2011. The second case
   deals with Morocco and presents a counter-story of the post-2011
   democratic transition which has led, to everyone's surprise, to the
   uprising of the Hirak du Rif and Jerada. This counter-story traces the
   reconfiguration of power relations in society, thanks to mobilisations
   that took place often underground and at the margins.},

Abstract = {Czech energy policy faces major challenges. Domestic lignite still plays
   a major role in the country's energy supply. In the search for
   alternatives before the final phaseout of coal in 2038, the Czech
   Republic is betting above all on nuclear energy. This reflects a broad
   social consensus. Behind this lies careful deliberations on such
   principles as security of supply, economic efficiency, and ecological
   sustainability. Renewable sources of energy have only limited potential
   in the Czech interior, and these have fallen into disrepute due to an
   expensive model of subsidies. Imported natural gas will gain in
   importance as a bridging technology, but its use should not grow unduly
   for reasons of security policy.},

Abstract = {Which institutional features do Latin American elites favor for local
   climate change policies? Climate change mitigation requires active
   local-level implementation, but it remains unclear which institutional
   arrangements maximize support for environmental rules. In this paper, we
   run a conjoint experiment with elite members of 10 Latin American
   countries and ask respondents to evaluate institutional designs drawn
   from a pool of 5,500 possible local climate governance arrangements. We
   find that Latin American elites prefer international organizations to
   formulate climate policies, support imposing increasing fines on
   violators, and favor renewing agreements every 5 years. We also find
   that elites support both international institutions and local courts to
   mediate conflicts, but they distrust non-governmental organizations and
   reject informal norms as a means of conflict resolution. Our results
   identify possible challenges in crafting local climate mitigation
   policies and offer new insights about how to integrate local and
   international levels in environmental agreements.},

Title = {Do Reelection Incentives Improve Policy Implementation? Accountability
   versus Political Targeting},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-69},
Abstract = {Although re-election prospects can improve policy implementation by
   incumbents, they can also create incentives for politically-motivated
   targeting, which might jeopardize distributional efficiency. While
   existing empirical tests typically focus on these potential
   countervailing incentives in isolation, this paper analyzes their net
   effect in the context of Bolsa Familia (BF) in Brazil, using a
   regression discontinuity design and data on seven million households
   from the program's registry. The evidence supports political targeting
   over accountability: mayors with re-election incentives are four times
   more likely to include nonpoor, ineligible households in the policy.
   These results cannot be explained by higher effort in indiscriminate
   program expansion. On the contrary, evidence from both a survey with
   11,000+ households and the heterogeneity in the estimates suggests that
   they reflect a breakdown on the information channels that lead the
   excluded poor to hold local administrations accountable. On the other
   hand, the included nonpoor are more likely to support incumbents in
   their re-election attempts, as they fear losing the benefit should the
   administration change. Finally, anomalous income reporting patterns also
   show that this electorally-driven targeting is more common for
   households enrolled by public servants politically connected to the
   mayor.},

Abstract = {For the first time in an Arab country, this article examines attitudes
   toward public opinion surveys and their effects on survey-taking
   behavior. The study uses original survey data from Qatar, the diverse
   population of which permits comparisons across cultural-geographical
   groupings within a single, non-democratic polity. The authors find that
   Qatari and expatriate Arabs hold positive views of surveys, both in
   absolute terms and relative to individuals from non-Arab countries.
   Factor analysis reveals that the underlying dimensions of survey
   attitudes in Qatar mostly mirror those identified in Western settings,
   but a new dimension is discovered that captures the perceived intentions
   of surveys. Two embedded experiments assess the impact of survey
   attitudes. The results show that generalized attitudes toward surveys
   affect respondents' willingness to participate both alone and in
   combination with surveys' objective attributes. The study also finds
   that negative views about survey reliability and intentions increase
   motivated under-reporting among Arab respondents, whereas non-Arabs are
   sensitive only to perceived cognitive and time costs. These findings
   have direct implications for consumers and producers of Arab survey
   data.},

Abstract = {Scholars have explored the rise of far-right reactionary political
   parties in Europe over the last decade. However, social movements
   reflecting similar political orientations have rarely been
   conceptualized as ``reactionary.{''} To better understand the political
   orientations of reactionary transnational social movements such as the
   Identitarians and the Defence Leagues, we explore how and why
   ethnonational symbols derived from the medieval period are utilized by
   adherents. This interdisciplinary investigation argues that, through
   processes of mediated political medievalism, ethnonational symbols are
   used as strategic framing devices to reimagine an idealized ``golden
   age{''} of distinct European nations, to assign blame for the erosion of
   ethnonational identity through multiculturalism, immigration and
   ``Islamization,{''} to establish an intergenerational struggle against
   the supposed incursion of Islam in Europe, and to proscribe and justify
   the use of violence as a means of re-establishing the primacy of
   European nations.},

Abstract = {To what extent do the material stakes of specific policies motivate
   political participation by affected interests? We address this question
   by examining physician participation in the annual process governing
   revisions to Medicare fee schedules. This setting permits us to identify
   the relevant universe of affected actors and to construct a novel
   measure of the annual financial consequences of proposed policy changes
   that varies idiosyncratically at the individual level. Employing text
   analysis to identify who participates in the notice-and-comment process
   between proposed and final rules, we find that while few providers
   comment, the odds of participation vary dramatically as a function of a
   rule's impact, with anticipated losses motivating comments substantially
   more than gains. This relationship persists in both individually
   tailored and mass comments and is largely independent of the behavior of
   physician specialty societies. Evidence of the effect of these stakes on
   campaign contribution behavior is more modest.},

Title = {MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE AND RESOURCE EXCHANGE: VOTES, BUDGETS, INFORMATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {169-181},
Abstract = {The paper reviews the most recent findings in multilevel governance and
   multilevel political systems. Multilevel governance is defined here as
   how major power resources are distributed (and the pattern of exchange
   thereof) amongst autonomous centers of power (governments) situated at
   different levels within the multilevel structure. Following the trend
   laid down by Tulia Falleti for research in federalism and
   decentralization, we distinguish between three types of resources:
   budgets (the monetary resources pertaining to fiscal financial flows),
   information (mostly provided from the lower levels of government to the
   upper ones), and legitimacy (mostly the electoral and clientelist
   support supplied by governments on different levels to each other during
   elections). The article reveals the general trends within this research
   stream and outlines existent gaps in our understanding of how particular
   types of resources are exchanged and distributed between different
   levels of government in multilevel governance. The first two sections
   provide a brief overview of the development of empirical research on
   federalism and multi-tiered systems, and explicate the rationale for
   studying the distribution of resources between governments at different
   levels of power. Researching such resource exchange in the short run and
   the patterns of such exchanges in the long term are two different
   research agendas. In particular, paying closer attention to the
   long-term sustainable patterns of resource exchange may serve as an
   explanation for higher or lower resilience in multilevel governance
   structures. Modeling such an exchange may therefore serve as grounds for
   an endogenous theory of multilevel and federal governance. The second
   part of the paper provides a more detailed review of the most recent
   research into particular types of resources and their exchange between
   levels of government. We describe the ``natural{''} asymmetries in such
   resource distributions between levels. Finally, the conclusion
   highlights the existent gaps and sets up the agenda for future research.},

Abstract = {The objective of the investigation was to analyze some international
   experience in assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in crime
   prevention. Methodologically, the dialectic method, typical of
   materialistic philosophy, was combined with scientific techniques of
   cognition. It is concluded that the basis for assessing the
   effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in different countries is
   based on a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria; sometimes such
   criteria conflict with each other, as some are beneficial for
   bureaucratic reporting, while others reflect the public's interests.
   Public opinion, as one of the main criteria, is becoming increasingly
   important in assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in
   some countries (e.g., the Slovak Republic), and in the US, France,
   Japan, Austria, and Italy, it is a traditional evaluation tool.
   Ambiguous is the use of statistics to assess the effectiveness of law
   enforcement in certain countries and Finally, there are countries where
   criminal statistics are a priority to determine the effectiveness of law
   enforcement and in others not.},

Abstract = {This article traces the development of the study of race and class in
   American political behavior. It starts by challenging the American
   exceptionalism thesis, particularly its premises regarding the
   diminutive role of social class and the absence of serious discussions
   about race. It then critically reviews the conventional scholarship on
   American political behavior and its reliance on objective indicators of
   social class as predictors of political preferences and participation.
   The article also highlights studies that have conceived of class as an
   important social identity and have thus measured it subjectively. It
   then discusses the surge of identity studies in the field of race,
   ethnicity, and politics (REP) and the turn toward an intersectional
   approach that rarely includes social class. The article ends with a
   discussion of the handful of studies that do consider the intersections
   of race and class, and underscores the need for more research of this
   type to advance our understanding of contemporary American political
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Out of the gusts of creative energy following the 2013 publication of
   Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams' ``\#Accelerate: Manifesto for an
   Accelerationist Politics,{''} the cyber-feminist collective, Laboria
   Cuboniks, published their own manifesto in 2015. Entitled ``The
   Xenofeminist Manifesto: A Politics for Alienation,{''} Laboria Cuboniks
   advocated, broadly speaking, the abolition of gender, increased
   technological intervention into the means of re-production, and, most
   controversially, an affirmation of alienation as intrinsically
   liberatory. Met with mostly positive responses, the Xenofeminist
   Manifesto spawned a series of workshops, talks, and accelerationist
   adjacent theorizing. That being said, residual issues of humanism and an
   open question about what ``more alienation{''} actually means festered
   just below the surface. In response to recent articles critiquing
   Xenofeminism as misunderstanding Marxist-Transhumanism at best, and
   reifying white feminism at worst, the following article seeks to do
   three things. First, I aim to examine the neohumanisms (be they trans-
   or post-humanism) that occupy our current era of technocapital
   acceleration while sketching out a critique that affirms the transhuman.
   Second, I attempt to trace the accelerationist lineage of Xenofeminism
   by looking at early Marx up to Deleuze and Guattari while noting that
   Xenofeminism can be read as a necessary outgrowth of accelerationism
   insofar as Xenofeminism seeks to deterritorialize gender as such. Third,
   I aim to respond to recent critiques levied against Xenofeminism that
   claim its affirmation of alienation is not only a naive mis-reading of
   Marx, but a reification of oppression. While certainly not the last
   word, I hope this article spawns deeper intellectual theorizing about
   Xenofeminism and its implications.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Photographers are often inspired by politics but can they influence it?
   Drawing on the study of public policy and the history of photography,
   this article considers three ways in which documentary photographers
   enter the policy process. It considers the photographer as: a bureaucrat
   working within government networks to achieve individual and
   institutional aims; an advocate working with like-minded actors to
   advance shared political beliefs; an expert working within an epistemic
   community driven by a shared policy enterprise. These roles highlight
   the institutional channels through which photographers seek and
   sometimes secure political change and the contradictions and constraints
   they face in so doing. These contrasting perspectives are discussed with
   reference to the work of canonical and contemporary photographers
   engaged in national and international politics from 1890 to today.},

Abstract = {The main directions of further development of e-justice are identified
   and analysed. Particular attention is paid to the current situation in
   this area in developed and democratic countries. Considering practical
   experience in the implementation of e-justice, possible ways of
   implementing progressive forms and methods of e-justice emerged. At
   present, the development of the judicial system has undergone
   significant and, first, positive changes in the direction of conducting
   proceedings in electronic mode. That is, it is commonly spoken of the
   so-called ``electronic litigation{''}, in one way or another it exists
   in most countries. It is concluded that, even though the international
   community has implemented measures in which electronic judicial
   procedures must be carried out, their applicability has been problematic
   in Ukraine, which has affected the judicial system. Processes related to
   the administration of justice are one of the key elements of the
   functioning of society. After all, they are meeting the constantly

Title = {FRAMING THE SYRIAN CONFLICT IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL MEDIA},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},

Abstract = {The article analyzes features of the coverage of the Syrian conflict by
   the Russian media. Empirically, the study is based on the articles
   published in 2015-2019 in the most cited federal media resources - the
   online edition of RIA Novosti, as well as the newspapers Izvestia and
   Vedomosti. The authors employ the method of the qualitative content
   analysis in the MAXQDA program. Given the extremely important role that
   framing plays in media resources, the authors focused on identifying key
   frames of coverage of the events in Syria, which allowed them to trace
   the main trends in presenting these events, as well as document
   technologies and techniques used by the media to create political images
   related to the Syrian crisis. The research study showed that the
   collective frame of the Syrian conflict in the Russian media has the
   following features: (1) emphasis on the diplomatic component to the
   detriment of the military one; (b) demonization of the United States;
   (3) ignoring causes of the conflict; (4) anti-terrorism rhetoric. Two
   technologies were actively used in framing - the technology of
   fragmenting information, which prevents the formation of a general
   picture of what is going on, and the technology of attention distraction
   aimed at playing down coverage of the controversial events, which
   violates the integrity of the frame by focusing on relatively
   insignificant and obvious events.
   According to the authors' conclusion, despite all the efforts of the
   federal media, the Syrian operation of Russia failed to become a ``small
   victorious war{''} that would provide a wave of patriotic mobilization
   in the country. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Syrian
   crisis has actually disappeared from the media agenda and is unlikely to
   make any significant contribution to changing the Russian information
   field in the future.},

Abstract = {Faced with increasing feminisation and with the concerns of their
   members and social movements, and having to deal with injunctions from
   national governments or European actors, the national and European
   social partners have over the last thirty years been preoccupied with
   gender and its articulation with other dimensions of social life, which
   are sources of inequality and discrimination. This text looks at how the
   social partners have been put to the test by gender and
   intersectionality, and it presents the main contributions of the
   literature which investigates the structuring of the relationship
   between social partners, gender and intersectionality.},

Title = {Exit or Invest: Segregation Increases Investment in Public Schools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Recent literature suggests that integrated communities invest more in
   public goods by overcoming political polarization that plagues
   segregated cities. However, investment in public education is not likely
   to follow the same pattern as other public goods because of the
   historical legacy with segregation and public education. To test this, I
   have collected data on the 11,000 plus school districts in the United
   States from 1995 to 2011. Using multilevel models with a state-school
   district nested design, I find that White-Black segregation leads to
   more investment in public education while White-Hispanic segregation, as
   well as segregation by income, has no effect. To help establish
   causality, I use the overturning of court desegregation orders as an
   exogenous shock to school segregation as a natural experiment. This
   result is robust across a broad array of alternative specifications. The
   results imply that segregation is still shaping public education.},

Abstract = {The article examines the impact of the coalition approach in US policy
   on integration processes in Europe in the post-bipolar era. The aim of
   this article was to identify the peculiarities of the political
   situation in the world after a period of escalation of the nuclear
   conflict. It involved an analysis of sources in the field of coalition
   approach research in the United States, as well as a comparison of its
   impact on the political situation and European Union law. The author
   concluded that there is a lack of proper research in the field of the
   impact of the coalition approach in US policy in the post-bipolar era,
   and its impact on integration processes in Europe. Comparing the
   experience of the EU and the US, it was determined that the awareness of
   nuclear danger affected the development of a coalition approach in US
   policy. The study resulted in the identified specifics of the EU's
   security policy under the influence of the US coalition approach, where
   the need to ensure stability and armed security is crucial. Prospects
   for further research include identifying US influence on Eastern
   countries.},

Abstract = {We investigate how emotions, threat perceptions and past violence
   influence foreign policy attitudes via a survey experiment in Georgia.
   Using a stratified sample across areas with differential exposure to the
   conflict and the presence of internally displaced persons, we randomly
   assign respondents to receive emotional primes about Russian aggression
   in the region. We find that exposure to violence, as well as simply
   being primed about past Russian aggression, both increase the perceived
   threat from Russia, and to a lesser extent anger towards Russia.
   Individuals who receive the primes are more supportive of a hardline
   foreign policy. In contrast, we find that exposure to violence does not
   have a direct effect on foreign policy attitudes, but increases hardline
   attitudes indirectly, through increased anger and threat. Taken together
   our results provide evidence that reminders of past violence have
   different effects than direct exposure to violence on foreign policy
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article considers legal approaches to implementing human
   rights during the mass exploitation of artificial intelligence and
   robotic systems in public life. Methods: Within the framework of this
   study, an emphasis is placed on the legal regulation of artificial
   intelligence systems and robotics used for remote biometric
   identification of a person and the creation of social credit systems.
   This study analyzes different models of legal regulation that are
   typical of certain countries and regions, including the UK, USA, China,
   and the EU. Results: In the UK, it is allowed to use real-time face
   recognition systems in public spaces but the set of scenarios and
   situations for their use is significantly limited by legislation and law
   enforcement. The legal regulation of these systems in each state is
   based on a constant dialogue between state and civil society. The use of
   artificial intelligence and robotic systems to create social credit
   systems is tested in some countries. Modern states have formed several
   approaches to the creation of such systems: some of them completely
   prohibit these systems, while others develop a technological and
   regulatory framework for the creation of national systems.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Number = {8-9},
Pages = {39+},
Abstract = {Poland reacted quickly and cruelly to the growing number of migrants on
   its border with Belarus. The national government in Warsaw saw in this
   an attempt by the regime in Minsk to destabilize Poland and responded by
   sealing the green border with barriers and deploying a massive
   contingent of border guards and soldiers to the region. Laws were also
   tightened. Polish and international human rights organizations have
   criticized the violation of international law, while the church has
   taken a mediating position. For the government, the crisis has a strong
   security policy dimension. It perceives an act of hybrid warfare
   involving Russia. Warsaw has received far-reaching support within the
   European Union. However, the attempt to divert attention from the
   conflict with Brussels over the rule of law has not succeeded.},

Abstract = {Many theories of war predict conflict becomes more likely as a state
   increasingly values the prize at stake. This article showcases an
   important limit. If-as in many cases-a state has uncertainty over its
   opponent's material cost of fighting, then increasing the opponent's
   valuation can decrease the probability of war. Why? Uncertainty
   condenses the various types' reservation values, reducing the peace
   premium and incentivizing a proposer to make safer offers. We also
   recover an analogous result under some conditions with uncertainty over
   power. The results indicate that higher valuations of the prize do not
   have a clear-cut relationship with the probability of war.},

Abstract = {Turmoil in the House of Assembly leading up to the 2019 general election
   in Newfoundland and Labrador foreshadowed an unusual result. Liberal
   Premier Dwight Ball, stung by public outrage over his government's 2016
   austerity budget, spent the balance of his term wary of difficult
   decisions while ministers and MHAs hurled accusations of bullying at
   each other. The Liberal government routinely evoked its The Way Forward
   planning document as a source of policy solutions and blamed the
   Progressive Conservatives for sanctioning the Muskrat Falls
   hydroelectric project boondoggle. Public opinion polls often put the
   Liberals in front, but Ball's popularity lagged behind his party's and
   occasionally that of the opposition leaders. The election produced the
   first minority government in nearly half a century, including the rare
   victory of two Independents, and the Liberal caucus soon agitated for
   new leadership. The province's dire economic circumstances mean that
   more political turmoil is likely.},

Title = {Social In justice and Rental Housing Discrimination in Urban Canada: he
   Case of Ethno-racial Minorities in the Herongate Community in Ottawa},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-101},
Abstract = {In 2015, the predominantly visible minority immigrant community of
   Herongate, in Ottawa, Ontario, was slated for redevelopment by its
   landlord, Timbercreek Asset Management. This redevelopment involved mass
   eviction of the incumbent tenants, demolition of the existing affordable
   housing and its replacement with luxury rentals, which, by all
   indications, are beyond the financial reach of the former Herongage
   tenants. This paper seeks to problematize large-scale residential real
   estate redevelopment in Canada and examine its impact, using the
   Herongate situation as a case study. Among other things, it profiles the
   Herongate community, its history and present redevelopment, and explores
   the legal framework, and the limits thereof constraining mass evictions
   of this type in Ontario. The findings indicate that the selection of
   Herongate for redevelopment was not fortuitous; generally, racialized
   and immigrant communities like Herongate are disproportionately likely
   to be selected for large-scale redevelopment projects, and thus
   subjected to mass-evictions. Further results suggest that the
   dissolution of the Herongate community - and the attendant dislocation
   of its members - has exacted a pronounced social and economic toll and
   compounded the racial discrimination already experienced by the former
   Herongate residents, most of whom are visible minorities. The paper
   concludes with an appeal to imbue the redevelopment process with a
   greater regard for social justice, and a right to housing as a policy
   solution to address the injustice caused by real estate redevelopment.},

Abstract = {The second year of Jair Bolsonaro's presidency in Brazil has been marked
   by multiple sources of pressure on the government. The COVID-19 pandemic
   has taken its toll on Brazilian lives, on the national health system and
   on the country's already sluggish economy. Hitting close to home,
   Bolsonaro has witnessed the beginning of several investigations against
   his also politician sons and increasing pledges for moderation from
   Centrao, the informal and yet powerful centrist coalition that has
   historically shaped Brazilian politics. Moreover, criticism from
   external markets and foreign powers regarding Brazil's mishandling of
   environmental policies has been constant, while Bolsonaro's campaign
   promises of economic liberalization remained largely unfulfilled. Quite
   puzzling though, domestic businessmen approval of the president
   increased over the year, as I show through the analyses of survey data.
   What explains this group's persistent support for Bolsonaro? This
   article reviews some of the main political events in Brazil in 2020 and
   it uses in-sights from International Political Economy and Brazilian
   politics scholarships to advance hypotheses that can explain why those
   who self-identify as businessmen remain steadfast supporters of the
   president, even amidst the economic, social, and sanitary turmoil in the
   country.},

Volume = {97},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The article presents a factual analysis of the origin and formation of
   the ``party of power{''} in Russia. The work demonstrates that at all
   stages the Russian ``party of power{''} was designed and controlled by
   the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.
   The research carried out by the author shows that Russia's ``party of
   power{''} does not meet the criteria that would allow to qualify this
   political party as dominant, in any of its ``incarnations{''}. This
   fully applies to the United Russia party that does not exert a
   significant impact on the appointments to the political and
   administrative positions and does not have any effect on the decisions
   that determine the state's policy. The dominance of the United Russia
   party in the electoral field is ensured primarily by the electoral
   corruption, as well as by the fact that its ``electoral machine{''} is
   represented by the system of public authorities at all levels, from
   federal to local. In turn, the dominance of this party in the State Duma
   and the rigid and strictly hierarchical administrative structure that it
   built in the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament allows the
   Presidential Administration to control the legislative process and
   parliamentary activity in general.
   According to the author's conclusion, the ``party of power{''} is an
   externally controlled political organization of a party type that
   protects the interests of Russia's ruling nomenklatura and implements
   its goals in the processes of the formation of public authorities
   through electoral procedures, as well as in the course of the
   legislative and parliamentary activity. Not only does such an
   organization fail to meet the criteria of the dominant party, but it
   also fails to fully correspond to the concept of a political party per
   se.},

Abstract = {The relationship between crime and punishment has never been isolated.
   Under the influence of socio-economic, political, and cultural changes,
   metamorphoses of the institution of execution of punishments took place;
   in particular, the rights of convicts were liberalized. Therefore, it is
   necessary to analyze the historiography of this phenomenon in terms of
   international standards, as well as the peculiarities of their
   implementation. The work aims to characterize the implementation of
   international standards on the rights of prisoners in terms of
   historiography and legal regulation. The object of research is the norms
   of international law. The subject of the study is social relations that
   arise in the implementation of international standards on the rights of
   convicts in prisons. The research methods were dialectical, systemic,
   structural, formal-legal, historical-legal, methods of analysis,
   synthesis, induction, and deduction. As a result, international

Abstract = {With European Union agencies becoming increasingly significant actors in
   European governance, further research is needed to understand how they
   interact with their environment. Applying the `reputation' literature to
   Europol, this article examines in greater detail how agencies behave
   with their `informal' audiences in comparison with the formal ones. It
   demonstrates that agencies are deeply invested in the shaping of their
   reputation, including towards their informal audiences especially if the
   latter represent `reputational threats.' Based on a quantitative
   analysis of activity reports and on a qualitative study of the
   face-to-face engagements of Europol with the European Parliament over
   time, this research sheds light on the complementary communicative
   strategies agencies can use to (re)present themselves depending on the
   dimension of their reputation at stake.},

Pages = {58-88},
Abstract = {Based on the analysis of police cooperation, this article explains how
   complex the post-Brexit paths could be in respect to British public
   policies and thus contributes to the renewed study of Europeanization.
   Political speeches and campaign arguments in favour of the British
   withdrawal could have let one assume some distancing of the UK from the
   European Union (EU) or even some dismantling of what had been previously
   europeanized. However, our contribution offers to understand the
   (non-)changes related to Brexit in some policy fields. In other words,
   this unprecedented event would not necessarily create discontinuity or
   change as Europeanization could remain active. Using interviews and
   document analysis, we argue that this scenario is due to the preexisting
   mutual adjustments between the British and EU level, considering their
   intensity but also their characteristics, especially their
   multi-dimensional nature.},

Abstract = {In art, Babi Yar was portrayed as the site of one of the largest
   massacres of the Second World War and as a place of remembrance even
   before a monument was erected there. Dmitry Shostakovich's first
   movement of his 13th Symphony, which is based on the famous poem by
   Yevgeny Yevtushenko, towers above all other commemorative musical works.
   These range from Lullaby for Babi Yar by Nechama Liv ic to various
   Soviet singer-songwriter works, to Dmytro Klebanov's Memorial Symphony
   for the Victims and Yevhen Stankovych's opulent ``Babi Yar{''}
   Requiem-Kaddish. As long as the Soviet Union refused to acknowledge the
   Jewish identity of most of the victims, anyone who expressed the events
   at Babi Yar through art risked becoming the victim of cultural and
   personal repression.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I provide a short reply to Jacobs's critical appraisal of
   my previous article, ``Ernesto Laclau's Oblivion of Political
   Economy,{''} published in this journal, volume 32, number 2 (2020).
   There, I had argued that Laclau's post-Marxism suffered from a marked
   incapacity to theorize the extent to which capitalist dynamics affect
   ongoing hegemonic struggles. In this regard, Jacobs argues that I
   implicitly resort to an ontological dualism at odds with post-Marxism's
   ontological stance, from which an essentialist account of capitalist
   dynamics ensues. I argue that, while remaining firmly within
   post-Marxism's core ontological assumptions, further theoretical
   integration of political economy approaches is a promising path for
   enhancing post-Marxism's usefulness for strategic reflection, as both of
   us ultimately aim to do.},

Volume = {73},

Pages = {90-117},
Abstract = {Brexit, a phenomenon of turbulences characterised by its uncertainty,
   represents a governance challenge for the British Council, an
   international British agency responsible for educational exchanges and
   cultural relations. The trajectory of the British Council and its
   relative stability in the post-referendum turbulence of 2016 context are
   analysed through the concepts of organisational reputation and soft
   power, thereby highlighting the institution's dynamic resilience
   strategy. Symbols, history and rhetoric associated with the British
   Council are key elements of the ``cognitive confidence{''} that it can
   inspire in its various audiences. It gradually generates a ``myth{''},
   internalized by its very staff. The British Council can then rely on the
   links forged with its audiences when it comes to thinking about leaving
   the European Union.},

   and a topical narrative model was used, with a theoretical coding
   analysis. Five (5) of these volunteers (four men and one woman) were
   considered in this research and a series of semi-structured interviews
   were conducted. As a conclusion, the relevance of volunteering in the
   implementation of the Peace Agreement and the reintegration of former
   FARC-EP combatants into society was demonstrated, due to their role as

Title = {Motivations and Intended Outcomes in Local Governments' Declarations of
   Climate Emergency},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {17-28},
Abstract = {Near 1,500 governments worldwide, including over 1,000 local
   governments, have declared a climate emergency. Such declarations
   constitute a response to the growing visibility of social movements in
   international politics as well as the growing role of cities in climate
   governance. Framing climate change as an emergency, however, can bring
   difficulties in both the identification of the most appropriate measures
   to adopt and the effectiveness of those measures in the long run. We use
   textual analysis to examine the motivations and intended outcomes of 300
   declarations endorsed by local governments. The analysis demonstrates
   that political positioning, previous experience of environmental action
   within local government, and pressure from civil society are the most
   common motivations for declaring a climate emergency at the local level.
   The declarations constitute symbolic gestures highlighting the urgency
   of the climate challenge, but they do not translate into radically
   different responses to the climate change challenge. The most commonly
   intended impacts are increasing citizens' awareness of climate change
   and establishing mechanisms to influence future planning and
   infrastructure decisions. However, the declarations are adopted to
   emphasize the increasing role cities are taking on, situating local
   governments as crucial agents bridging global and local action agendas.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Pages = {354-364},
Abstract = {When the Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKRE, Estonian Conservative
   People's Party) took over the defunct but extensive party organisation
   of the Estonian People's Union, it placed great emphasis on rebooting
   and extending the organisation and bringing in new activists. As a
   result, EKRE has grown into a full-fledged mass party type of
   organisation with all the characteristics associated to it. Furthermore,
   it has become the fastest-growing party in Estonia in terms of
   membership and been notably successful in electoral terms. This article
   focuses primarily on the question of how EKRE developed a mass party
   organisation with a strong, ideologically-devoted activist core and a
   remarkable presence on the ground. The article also demonstrates how the
   party offers a variety of opportunities for engagement to its members.
   In contrast to an archetypical right-wing populist party, the
   decision-making power is somewhat diffused within the party, though the
   party leader remains the public face and mouthpiece of the party. EKRE's
   online engagement strategies have been among the most successful in
   recent Estonian politics and make the party stand out. The article
   demonstrates that parties can often revise as well as repurpose the
   features of the predecessor parties and even build defunct mainstream
   parties into mass parties with a firm ideological core.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Pages = {49-78},
Abstract = {From the election of authoritarian leaders to the increase of popular
   uprisings, there are many signs that liberal political institutions have
   failed to meet the expectations of large social sectors. Although a high
   number of political actors and analysts insist on bringing conflicts
   back to the institutional level, much of the political action has also
   been running outside the formal framework and compromising established
   concepts and theories about democracy and representation. This paper
   discusses the contributions and the problems of contemporary theories of
   political representation in this context. On the one hand, they favor
   the study of different forms of representation besides voting. On the
   other hand, they are inadequate in articulating their electoral and
   non-electoral faces and tend to neglect their substantive dimension. Two
   cases are then analyzed to demonstrate the potentially democratic
   character of radical forms of participation and the necessary
   theoretical articulation between institutional and extrainstitutional
   political actions. Namely, the recent path of the Movement of Homeless
   Workers (MTST), in Brazil, and the protests of the Yellow Vests, between
   2018 and 2019, in France.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the socio-economic
   effectiveness of preventive measures of the main diseases of people of
   different age groups in the reality of Ukraine. The subject of the study
   is the characteristics of disease prevention for various age groups. The
   following research methods are used in the article: analysis and
   synthesis; systematization of theoretical and empirical research
   results; analogy and summary. As a result, the role of the prevention of
   major human diseases is clarified to ensure the socio-economic potential
   of countries, increase labour capital and productivity and, in addition,
   contribute to the expansion of gross domestic product. Prevention
   possibilities are characterized to reduce the burden of disease. At a
   practical level, comprehensive means of disease prevention are proposed
   for different age groups of the population. By way of reference, the
   conditions and possibilities of reducing the fatal outcomes of the main
   diseases inherent in the population of Ukraine, such as cancer and
   cardiovascular diseases, among others, are determined.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether governing parties strategically time
   austerity policies to help them win re-election. It contributes to
   existing research by focusing directly on government policy output,
   analyzing over 1,200 welfare and taxation austerity measures in thirteen
   Western European countries over twenty years. In line with previous
   research, the authors find that governments become less likely to
   introduce austerity measures as elections approach. The study introduces
   original hypotheses about which governments have the ability and
   opportunity to strategically time policy decisions. The authors suggest
   that minimal winning cabinets with leadership change (new prime
   ministers) face less complex bargaining environments and can credibly
   shift responsibility for austerity measures to the preceding government.
   The empirical analyses show that these governments are most likely to
   strategically time austerity policies.},

Abstract = {The Spanish Constitutional Court Judgment n. 35/2020, February 25 has
   set a case law stablishing that punishing extreme speeches, in
   particular glorification of terrorism, will be constitutional as a form
   of provocation which creates a danger of violent or discriminatory acts.
   Beyond it, this judgment for the first time requires that the danger
   should be examined through contextual, intentional and
   pragmatic-linguistic elements. However, the commented judgement also
   presents shadows, since it maintains a distorted conception of hate
   speech and does not sufficiently specify the standards that justify a
   limit to freedom of expression.},

Title = {CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY REFLECTED IN IMAGES OF THE PRESENT AND THE
   FUTURE: PSYCHOGRAPHIC METHOD},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-77},
Abstract = {This article is the first attempt in the field of Chinese studies in
   Russia to apply the psychographic method to the study of Chinese
   society. The article considers the way Chinese citizens imagine the
   present and the future of their own country. During November-December
   2019, when study was conducted by the authors, a database of 189
   drawings was created, from which 785 images were extracted. These images
   were classified among 14 categories ({''}nature{''}, ``war{''},
   ``culture{''}, etc.). The study shows that PRC citizens have high
   expectations of their future standards of living, strong faith in
   successfully resolving ecological problems, and concerns about China's
   ageing population. Contrary to the expectations of the authors, images
   directly associated with socialism or communism are absent. The article
   concentrates on China's image in the international arena and the role of
   Sino-Russian relations. Chinese citizens portray China as having
   tremendous potential and being supreme to other counterparts, while
   remaining a peaceful state. Russia does not play a key role, but is
   mentioned as an important geopolitical player and China's partner (not
   ally). The study reveals a discrepancy between the images regarding
   China's role in the world and verbal explanations thereof.
   Subconsciously, the respondents portray China as more powerful than
   other countries, yet at the same time deny the assumption that China is
   aspiring to become ``number 1{''}. The same can be said about the image
   of Russia: respondents notice the importance of relations between the
   two countries, but in most drawings, Russia is depicted in the same way
   as other neighbors of China.},

Abstract = {What kinds of politics do export controls entail and whose rights do
   they enable? The following article will take a critical perspective on
   the governance challenges associated with export controls of dual-use
   technologies. After discussing challenges around transparency, the
   performance of human rights and export control havens, this article will
   then turn to looking at policy solutions, including audits, transparency
   and targeted international governance mechanisms. With conclusion,
   export controls continue to constitute an important policy tool to
   promote human rights and can be improved considerably to strengthen
   human rights further.},

Abstract = {Military intelligence (MI) is critical to visions of future war. The
   analytical methodologies of the War on Terror have reshaped how MI teams
   are trained and deployed. MI personnel are increasingly specialised,
   with experience and judgement being replaced by rigid adherence to
   robust data-driven analytical methodologies. While these methods are
   likely to continue at higher echelons, Jack Watling argues that a large
   MI presence at the tactical edge will not be practical under the
   indirect fire threat on the future battlefield. Furthermore, reach-back
   to higher echelon support will be severely constrained in a contested
   electromagnetic environment. Tactical echelons will therefore need an
   expanded organic MI capability, with experienced personnel able to
   perform a wide range of MI functions.},

Abstract = {This text refers to the context of complex violence that we currently
   live in Mexico as a result of the war against drugs. We highlight the
   effects that such violence has on childhoods and we note the importance
   of considering girls and boys as allies in rebuilding the community
   fabric. Thus, information is presented on some dimensions of the
   community fabric reflected in the Child and Youth Consultation exercise
   held in Mexico in 2015 and 2018. For the analysis of the information, we
   used the technique of qualitative content analysis and we read the data
   based on the contributions of the New Social Studies of the Childhood,
   as well as the contributions of experiences of work with girls and boys
   in peace building in post-conflict contexts. We also recognize the merit
   of consultation exercises to know the opinions of girls and boys about
   their everyday experiences, so these initiatives should continue taking
   into account conditions that promote children ` s participation. For
   this is necessary to start from a non-adult-centered approach that
   considers childhood experiences and proposals as actions to be taken in
   the present. Finally, we highlight the importance of girls and boys
   participating in the reconstruction of the community fabric to ensure
   that the strengthening or creation of social ties, can last over time.},

Abstract = {Much of the peace agreement durability literature assumes that stronger
   peace agreements are more likely to survive the trials of the
   post-conflict environment. This work does an excellent job identifying
   which provisions indicate that agreements are more likely to endure.
   However, there is no widely accepted way to directly measure the
   strength of agreements, and existing measures suffer from a lack of
   nuance or reliance on subjective weighting. We use a Bayesian item
   response theory model to develop a principled measure of the latent
   strength of peace agreements in civil conflicts from 1975 to 2005. We
   illustrate the measure's utility by exploring how various international
   factors such as sanctions and mediation contribute to the strength or
   weakness of agreements.},

Abstract = {As spending on welfare in the United States has increased over time,
   preferences for more spending have remained fairly stationary. Given
   that previous research shows that the public adjusts its welfare
   spending preference thermostatically in response to welfare spending,
   the over-time pattern of preferences implies that something must be
   producing an increase in public support, but what? We address this
   question, focusing on individuals' demographics and a set of aggregate
   economic variables, both macroeconomic and distributional. Results
   reveal that individual-level factors matter little to the temporal
   variation and aggregate economics matter a lot: there are pro-cyclical
   and counter-cyclical elements in spending preferences and a dampening
   effect of income inequality over time. The combination of these
   variables accounts for the underlying trend in welfare spending
   preferences in the US, and the method used to reveal these dynamics can
   be used to analyze preference evolution in other spending domains and
   countries.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {77-94},
Abstract = {The international system is experiencing profound changes and has taken
   on an uncertain character as a result. The concept of strategy and its
   study has closely followed this trend, and new concepts have emerged
   both to adapt to and theoretically describe the practical changes and
   challenges it has engendered. This article explores the ill-suited
   features of mainstream debates and theorizing from a Turkish perspective
   and suggests that a critical realist analysis of agential strategizing
   is most useful to addressing the emerging context. It argues that Turkey
   has a long pursued grand strategy, but new concepts -resilience, protean
   power, and connectography- can enhance Turkey's ability to strategize
   and can enrich the lately emerged vibrant debates exploring Turkey's
   grand strategy.},

Abstract = {Gerrymandering is a controversial practice in American politics, and one
   that has generated a significant amount of legal, academic, and
   political interest. While gerrymandering is an important and timely
   topic, this issue receives relatively little attention in most
   introductory courses in American government. This omission is compounded
   by the complexity of the subject. Students often struggle to grasp the
   intricacies of the redistricting process and fail to understand how this
   process could affect the overarching political landscape. This paper
   will address these shortcomings by outlining a new method for teaching
   students about redistricting. Inspired by the broader literatures on
   active and project-based learning-as well as an episode of The Daily
   Show-this paper proposes hosting a gerrymandering art exhibit to better
   educate and engage students. The results suggest that this project can
   have educational benefits. Students displayed a deep level of conceptual
   understanding. Additionally, survey data suggests that this experience
   can increase students' self-assessed learning outcomes and overall
   interest in the class.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholar-educators have examined a variety of new
   approaches for teaching research in political science. Many of these
   inquiries begin with the observation that research activities cause some
   students to experience trepidation and aversion. The result is often
   poor performance in courses which assign research. In this project, I
   review and assess an approach to student research which focuses upon
   goal-orientation as a determinant of engagement. In doing so, I
   introduce three strategies for reconsidering goal orientation in the
   political science classroom. These include client consulting, low-cost
   survey deployment, and exit polling. These project-based courses are
   designed to reorient student attitudes toward the research process
   thanks to the identification of an external audience. Based on a pilot
   study of a goal-oriented learning experience, results provide suggestive
   evidence for the benefits of this approach in the undergraduate research
   setting.},

Abstract = {This article asks whether the willingness of partisans to condone
   democratic backsliding is a uniquely American phenomenon and explores
   why partisans would tolerate a party leader subverting democratic norms.
   We focus on executive aggrandizement as a key mechanism through which
   democratic backsliding occurs and develop three potential explanations
   for why partisans would accept the weakening of checks on the power of
   the executive. First, in a context of affective polarization, partisans
   may condone executive aggrandizement in order to advantage their party
   and disadvantage the opponent. Second, partisans may be willing to trade
   off democratic norms in pursuit of their ideological agenda. Third,
   partisans may take cues from the behaviour of party elites. These
   explanations are tested using a candidate-choice conjoint experiment
   administered to Americans and Canadians in 2019 that involved
   respondents choosing between hypothetical candidates in intra-party
   contests. Regardless of party, partisans in both countries proved
   willing to choose candidates who would loosen legislative and judicial
   restraints on the executive. While the partisan advantage explanation
   only held for strong Republicans in the United States, partisans in
   Canada and the United States alike were apparently willing to weaken
   restraints on the executive for the sake of their ideological agendas,
   at least in the case of abortion. Finally, Republicans who approved of
   the Trump presidency were much less likely than other Republicans to
   punish undemocratic candidates, lending support to the cue-taking
   explanation.},

Abstract = {Many countries have securitized their policy responses to the COVID-19
   pandemic by framing it as an existential threat demanding extraordinary
   security responses. The politics of securitization are particularly
   advantageous to nondemocratic regimes. Yet, contrary to the expectation
   that the Central Asian governments would resort to their
   tried-and-tested method of framing a new policy issue as a national
   security threat, these governments have used a deliberately constrained
   representation of the pandemic with some even diminishing the
   significance of a threat posed by COVID-19. What explains these
   unexpected patterns of securitization in response to the pandemic? This
   study argues that autocratic regimes' concerns with legitimacy and their
   specific legitimization practices shape their choices about
   securitization of a policy issue. In Kazakhstan, the government's
   response to the crisis became part of a political struggle between
   competing claims to presidential legitimacy. In Kyrgyzstan, weak
   government legitimacy rooted in poor economic performance coupled with
   the fear of unrest preempted any coherent effort to securitize the
   crisis. In Uzbekistan, the government's new technocratic self-image
   limited securitization within its COVID-19 response. In Tajikistan, a
   strategy of denial and delay emerged, since securitization of COVID-19
   promised little additional security aid.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Can the presence of police outside a polling place deter African
   American voting in the United States? To address this question, this
   study compares voter turnout at polling places in a 2017 U.S. Senate
   special election in Alabama based on whether police were present. In
   short, the presence of police is associated with a 32\% reduction in
   African American participation. That is, if the African American
   population is 10\% of a precinct's registered voter base, the presence
   of police is estimated to reduce the African American share of the
   participating electorate to 7\%. The results are the first to quantify
   the effect of police presence on voting in the United States and
   indicate that election participation and election outcomes can be
   affected by the presence of police. These results stand in stark
   contrast to assertions advanced by both scholars and the courts that the
   presence of police and other poll watchers in and around polling places
   has no meaningful consequence for participation.},

Abstract = {Two states in a dispute refuse to back down. One ties its own hands to
   strengthen its stand and gain advantage; the other tries to untie the
   tied hands to preempt disadvantage. Tying hands is a well-studied
   strategy, but it tells only part of the story, and the response strategy
   of untying hands remains unexplored. Can a state untie the tied hands of
   its opponent to give freedom back to its opponent-the freedom to
   concede? I identify three strategies of untying hands: counterthreat,
   reassurance, and normative framing. I show experimentally that these
   strategies can reduce the public costs of backing down and the perceived
   reputational damage from backing down. Tied hands and audience costs are
   not static and immutable, but dynamic and malleable by the other side.},

Abstract = {There is a severe mental health crisis among graduate students in
   political science. We present findings from an original survey on the
   mental health of political science PhD students at seven US
   universities. Our results are concerning: 15.8\% expressed thoughts of
   suicide in the two weeks prior to taking the survey. About 30\% of
   respondents met the criteria for depression and only a third of those
   were receiving treatment. Approximately 32\% met the criteria for
   anxiety and fewer than half were receiving treatment. We also found that
   students with poorer mental health were more isolated, had fewer friends
   in their department and fewer people to turn to for help, and were more
   likely to contemplate dropping out of their program. Our study raises
   important questions about the experiences of graduate students during
   the PhD program and serves as an urgent call to action to address the
   well-being of our colleagues.},

Abstract = {The support of party elites in the primary has a strong influence on who
   runs in a primary and how well they do. Yet party elites do not always
   engage or coordinate their efforts. Moreover, theories of parties
   disagree about whether and where party elites should engage and
   coordinate in primaries, depending on their view of the relative
   importance of electoral and policy goals. This article examines party
   elites' engagement and coordination in primary elections in the U.S.
   House between 2004 and 2018. Consistent with theories of parties as
   networks of policy demanders, party elites are engaged in primaries in
   both competitive and safe districts. But, while party elites coordinate
   their efforts in competitive districts, they are less likely to
   coordinate in safe districts. Their disparate coordination efforts
   reflect different electoral priorities in these districts.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the idea of global peace in early
   twentieth-century liberal international order was sutured together by
   the threat of race war. This understanding of racial peace was
   institutionalized in the League of Nations mandate system through its
   philosophical architect: Jan Smuts. I argue that the League figured in
   Smuts's thought as the culmination of the creative advance of the
   universe: white internationalist unification and settler colonialism was
   the cosmological destiny of humanity that enabled a racial peace. In
   Smuts's imaginary, the twin prospect of race war and miscegenation
   serves as the dark underside that both necessitates and threatens to
   undo this project. By reframing the problem of race war through his
   metaphysics, Smuts resolves the challenge posed by race war by
   institutionalizing indirect rule and segregation as a project of
   pacification that ensured that settlement and the creative advance of
   the cosmos could proceed.},

Abstract = {A necessary component of peaceful democratic rule is the willingness of
   election losers to accept election defeats. When politicians and parties
   acknowledge defeat in democratic elections, they reinforce the peaceful
   transition of power that sustains political order. When election losers
   in democracies reject election results, the public's confidence in
   democratic institutions is weakened, grievances and polarization abound,
   and the potential for violent mobilization grows. In this environment,
   terrorist activity is more likely. I test this proposition using
   cross-national time series panel data and within-country public opinion
   data for a wide set of democracies. I find that democracies experience
   significantly more domestic terrorist casualties when election losers
   reject election results. Moreover, I find that public willingness to
   tolerate and justify terrorism as a tactic increases in democratic
   countries where election losers reject election results.},

Abstract = {This research examines whether explicit course-level learning objectives
   (LOs) affect students' perceptions of courses and ability to recall
   factual knowledge and analyze political problems. The study compares
   four sections of the author's introductory world politics course - two
   that were provided with the explicit learning objectives and two that
   were not. The results revealed no difference in students' performances
   when it came to recalling facts and analyzing problems. Analyzing
   student evaluations, however, indicated that students who received
   learning objectives perceived the grading of their assignments as fairer
   than did students who did not receive LOs, indicating that LOs help
   students feel comfortable in a course. This suggests the need for
   research examining how LOs interact with such educational techniques as
   learning teams and weekly writing assignments. Future research also
   might explore how LOs affect students in courses employing online and
   other delivery methods.},

Abstract = {What are the political and cultural consequences when, as today, the
   most pervasive and subtle aspect of late-capitalist hegemony is defined
   by blocking any kind of collective imagination? Few authors in recent
   times as Mark Fisher have reflected as intensely on the meaning of this
   ``capitalist realism{''} from a concern that could perhaps be defined as
   ecological-cultural. Is the 21st century not suffering from a depletion
   of cultural resources similar to that of natural ones? This article
   seeks to analyse the meaning of the Fisherian category of ``popular
   modernism{''} as a way of implementing a counter-hegemonic cultural
   policy in our historical horizon.},

   educate youth about following health guidelines against COVID-19. This
   article provides an insight into the different ways in which these
   renowned individuals responded to this call as well as the forms of
   their responses. To do so, the content of the videos shared by these
   individuals on social networks was analyzed using a qualitative coding
   scheme inspired by Fields (1988). The result of this analysis shows that
   different means were used to accentuate the feeling of closeness between
   the celebrity and his audience, in order to increase the adherence to
   the message. The use of the pronoun ``On{''}, the use of narrative
   formulas and the intimacy that emerges from informative videos may
   contribute to the rapport between a celebrity and his public.},

Abstract = {A recently published paper in this journal (Choi, 2021) establishes a
   statistical link between, on the one hand, Islamist terrorist campaigns
   - including terrorist attacks and online propaganda - and, on the other
   the growth of the Muslim population. The author explains this result by
   stating that successful campaigns lead some individuals to convert to
   Islam. In this commentary, we intend to reply to this article by
   focusing on the impact of terrorist attacks on religious conversion. We
   first show that Choi's results suffer from theoretical flaws - a failure
   to comprehensively unpack the link between violence and conversion - and
   methodological shortcomings - a focus on all terrorist groups over a
   period where Islamist attacks were rare. This leads us to replicate
   Choi's analysis by distinguishing Islamist and non-Islamist terror
   attacks on a more adequate timeframe. By doing so, we no longer find
   empirical support for the relationship between terror attacks and the
   growth of the Muslim population. However, our analyses suggest that such
   a hypothesis may hold but only in contexts where the level and intensity
   of political violence are high.},

Abstract = {The word ``popism{''} is used by Mark Fisher to refer to an attitude
   consisting in claiming for pop music an equal status among other
   legitimate forms of musical expression as avant-garde music. The polemic
   between popists and ``rockists{''}-advocates of rock music as the
   superior form of avant-garde music over the frivolity of pop-was first
   formulated in the early 1980s in the British music press and reissued in
   the first decade of the XXI century. In this controversy and in the
   popular modernism that Fisher defends, elements of Adorno's aesthetics
   can be detected that inevitably lead to an aporia: that the
   democratization of taste cancels the division between high culture and
   popular culture but, at the same time, popular modernism is
   unsustainable without somehow reformulating that division.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes some of the dimensions of the concept of
   inclusion, in order to define the context in which the access of
   immigrants to public health develops in Argentina, a leading country due
   to the new migratory dynamics that emerged in the South American
   scenario. from 2015. Through a documentary analysis on the approach to
   the system of protection and social inclusion of the migrant, a review
   of sources is presented with emphasis on the binomial between migration
   and health. These categories function as indicators that describe a
   tense and constantly changing bond; it is the link between the national
   and the foreign, between the regular or the irregular, and between
   inclusion and effective access to law.},

   The direction of travel must be global guidance and national or regional
   AI law that stresses end-to-end accountability and AI transparency,
   while recognizing practical and fundamental limits. We also need a
   deeper understanding of tensions between AI and sovereignty and
   democratic values, in order to address them in the interplay of the
   social construction of sovereignty and democracy and the technological
   construction of AI.},

Abstract = {Collective identity is a key catalyst of protest mobilization. How does
   collective identity come into existence among strangers with diverse
   backgrounds, especially in movements without a centralized leadership?
   Although collective identity is often seen as something constructed by
   movement organizations or out of established networks, we describe a
   more bottom-up and decentralized process in which movement collective
   identity is created through the horizontal mobilization of intermediate
   identities, which leverage pre-existing social identifications to induce
   commitment among individuals. Focusing on Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition
   Bill Movement of 2019, we argue that online petitions against the
   controversial bill created intermediate group identities among myriad
   social groups, such as alumni, professions, hobby groups, and
   residential communities. These intermediate identities provided rich
   discursive resources for previously disconnected individuals to
   collectively perceive the threat of the bill and see the obligation to
   act, which, in turn, shaped a strong collective identity early on in the
   protests. Our findings may help contribute to a more nuanced
   understanding of collective identity formation in contemporary
   leaderless movements.},

Abstract = {Studies in several national jurisdictions have highlighted the
   limitations of joint health and safety committees and worker
   representatives in affecting change in working conditions. Using
   Canadian data, this article focuses on the argument that many health and
   safety committees and worker representatives have been captured or
   substantially controlled through the State's promotion of an internal
   responsibility system framed around a technocratic partnership. The
   historical development of this framing is first understood within a
   political economic framework which highlights several major influences,
   followed by a field theory analysis which explains how these control
   relations are established by management within workplace settings.},

Abstract = {American politicians frequently evoke race in their messages to the
   public; at the same time, politicians often pay a price for racialized
   rhetoric. We propose that elites continue to use messages about race
   because they can mitigate the costs of doing so with justifications for
   their original statements. Integrating literatures on elite rhetorical
   tactics and framing, we predict that when justifications and indirect
   racial messages are combined, elites can mobilize the support for
   racially resentful Whites without alienating others. In a pair of survey
   experiments conducted in 2019 and 2020, we examine the effectiveness of
   justifications in swaying Whites' attitudes. We find that two different
   elite justifications bolster support for their messages. Importantly, we
   also find these tactics do not incur political costs. This provides a
   compelling reason that political figures continue to use racial messages
   in politics despite recent social movements and possible shifts in
   Americans' attitudes about race.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether corruption amplifies the political effects of
   economic crises. Using Spanish municipal-level data and a
   difference-in-difference strategy, we find that local unemployment
   shocks experienced during the Great Recession (2008-2015) increased
   political fragmentation. This effect was four times larger in
   municipalities exposed to malfeasance than in municipalities without a
   history of political corruption. We bolster this evidence by showing
   that, conditional on province and population strata fixed effects, there
   is no evidence of differential pre-trends. We also find that the
   interaction of unemployment and corruption harms the two traditional
   main parties and benefits especially the new party on the left
   (Podemos).},

Abstract = {We know a lot about the new wave of autocrats and how they operate but
   much less about why so many people, particularly in the developing
   world, are cheering them on. Case-in-point: How do we make sense of
   widespread popular support for Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's
   strongman rule? Scholars generally cite frustration with a democracy
   widely regarded as elite-dominated and endemically corrupt, but this
   account is underspecified. Filipinos have been frustrated with liberal
   democracy for a long time and Duterte is not the first law-and-order
   candidate to seek the presidency. I will argue that we need to situate
   Duterte's election and enduring appeal in the conversation about
   democracy as it has unfolded on the ground. Specifically, (1) repeated
   failures to reform democracy have resulted in (2) conditional support
   for democracy and increasing openness to certain authoritarian forms of
   government. (3) These attitudes manifest on the ground as calls for
   ``disciplining{''} democracy. (4) Rodrigo Duterte is seen as a ``strong
   leader{''} and the answer to such calls, hence his enormous popularity.
   I will provide evidence for each of these claims and make the case for
   grounding the illiberal turn in people's experience of democracy.},

Abstract = {Party organization is a central concept in comparative politics. Yet,
   data on party organizational features is sparse, scattered and available
   for a limited set of countries and parties. To advance global research
   on party organizations, we present the Varieties of Party Identity and
   Organization Dataset (V-Party) - the most comprehensive dataset to date,
   including a wide range of information about organizational features and
   party stances of more than 1900 parties in 168 countries between 1970
   and 2019. In this paper, we focus particular attention on new measures
   that relate to parties' territorial reach, ties to social organizations,
   candidate nomination procedures, personalization, and internal cohesion.
   We validate these new measures using Adcock and Collier's (2001)
   three-pronged validation approach, looking at content, criterion and
   construct validity, to showcase and emphasize the potential of V-Party.},

Abstract = {Urban sustainability policy provides opportunities for expanding global
   efforts for climate change mitigation. Yet local governments may not
   commit to make such policy efforts. It is well recognized that internal
   and external factors in state and local governments can be potential
   drivers. Less recognized is that green energy policy adoption can also
   be impacted by competitive federalism, under which state laws might
   influence the likelihood of local adoption. Drawing on prior studies on
   inter-governmental interactions and managerial turnover, we hypothesize
   the effect of intergovernmental influence, managerial turnover, and
   their interactions on city adoption of energy efficiency and renewable
   energy programs. Results of the multilevel regression model indicate
   that state influence via regulatory or financial tools can encourage
   city sustainable energy consumption and production, while managerial
   turnover can inhibit these conditions, but the negative impacts of
   managerial turnover can be reversed when the successors are recruited
   externally. Our tests support the existence of both local government
   free-riding and city mobilization to enact more green policies with
   externally hired city managers, thereby helping us to distinguish the
   impact of competitive federalism in local energy policy.},

Abstract = {Using two recently published folios by Jeremy Bentham, I draw out a
   fundamental but little-analyzed connection between pauperism and both
   domestic and settler colonialism in opposition to imperialism in his
   thought. The core theoretical contribution of this article is to draw a
   distinction between a colonial, internal, and productive form of power
   that claims to improve people and land from within, which Bentham
   defends, and an imperial, external, and repressive form of power that
   dominates or rules over people from above and afar, that he rejects.
   Inherent in colonialism and the power unleashed by it are specific and
   profoundly negative implications in practice for the poor and disabled
   of Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries subject to
   domestic colonialism and indigenous peoples subject to settler
   colonialism from first contact until today. I conclude Bentham is best
   understood as a pro-colonialist and anti-imperialist thinker.},

   thought. To do this, we will structure the work in three parts: the
   first analyzes what an affect is and describes the grammar of affects
   that Spinoza postulates, giving an account of its specificity and
   complexity; the second studies that particular affect that is revenge
   according to how it appears in the Theological-political treatise, the
   Ethics and the Political treatise, in order to show the variations of
   its conceptualization in each of these works and their relationship with
   others. affections very close to revenge, such as indignation, pity or
   hatred; the third reflects on the complexities of revenge but clearly in
   reference to the political field, investigating whether it can be
   established as an affect capable of founding a State or encouraging the
   perpetuation of its existence.},

Abstract = {The article explores how the European populist radical right uses
   references to rights and freedoms in its political discourse. By relying
   on the findings of the existing research and applying the
   discourse-historical approach to electoral speeches by Marine Le Pen and
   Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leaders of two very dissimilar EU PRR parties,
   the Rassemblement National and the Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc, the article
   abductively develops a functional typology of references to rights and
   freedoms commonly used in discourses of European PRR parties: it
   suggests that PRR discourses in Europe feature references to the right
   to sovereignty, citizens' rights, social rights, and economic rights.
   Such references are used as a coherent discursive strategy to construct
   social actors following the PRR ideological core of nativism,
   authoritarianism, and populism. As the PRR identifies itself with the
   people, defined along nativist and populist lines, rights are always
   attributed to it. The PRR represents itself as the defender of the
   people and its rights, while the elites and the aliens are predicated to
   threaten the people and its rights. References to rights in PRR
   discourses intrinsically link the individual with the collective, which
   allows to construct and promote a populist model of ethnic democracy.},

Abstract = {There is limited Marxist, Marxian, or otherwise explicitly materialist
   queer studies scholarship. While such scholarship is growing, it remains
   underdeveloped compared to the post-structural strain. This is a serious
   omission because we need the tools of materialist analyses now more than
   ever to grapple with incredibly important economic and political issues
   that are not being discussed nearly enough within queer studies/social
   movements, such as LGBTQI2S youth homelessness. This discussion can be
   seen as a modest move in this direction, arguing for the utility of a
   novel materialist concept, ``homohegemony,{''} to describe, explain, and
   deconstruct queer new ideological and institutional realities that we
   find ourselves embedded in, over a decade since Puar's pathbreaking and
   incredibly important coining of ``homonationalism.{''} The article
   theorizes ``homohegemony{''} in order to make a broader case that more
   materialist interventions into queer studies are needed and have value,
   particularly in times when homonationalism is increasingly ``common
   sense.{''}},

Abstract = {Several scholars have suggested that political dividedness has harmful
   effects on economic performance. Interestingly, empirical tests tackling
   this argument are almost entirely absent. The paper aims to fill this
   gap by testing the above hypothesis using data from the European Social
   Survey, including 27 countries between 2002 and 2015. Controlling for a
   range of well-known explanatory variables, the results of the panel
   regression analysis suggest that partisan polarisation is adversely
   related to economic growth, while ideological polarisation is not. The
   finding is congruent with the hypothesis of polarisation having a
   notable negative effect on growth, yet future works are necessary to
   test both the direction and the possible channels of causality. As
   scholars increasingly describe contemporary politics as an era of
   growing polarisation, the results imply that partisan polarisation
   should deserve more attention from political scientists and economists
   as a factor that might influence economic growth.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to our understanding of interest intermediation
   structures in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and, specifically,
   whether, which, how and to what extent organized interests are
   incorporated into policy-making processes. Unlike previous studies
   primarily focusing on patterns of economic coordination (Jahn 2016), we
   focus on energy policy-making in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
   Slovenia. We address the extent to which these energy interest
   intermediation systems are gravitating towards a more corporatist
   policy-making paradigm and whether corporatist arrangements have been
   dismantled in view of the new wave of national conservatism in CEE. We
   offer a complex operationalization of corporatism based on concrete
   indicators and present the results of a survey of energy interest groups
   operating in the region. It covers questions regarding interest
   intermediation between the organized interests and the government,
   regulatory authorities as well as the degree of policy coordination and
   political exchange with the state and between rivalling organizations,
   enabling us to derive a ``corporatism score{''} for each national
   institutional setting and discuss them in the light of Jahn's (2016)
   corporatism rankings for the region. We show that-despite striking
   differences-at least rudimentary corporatist interest intermediation
   structures have emerged with some variations of pluralism and statism in
   all four countries.},

Abstract = {Recent reports indicate that employers are increasingly interested in
   hiring individuals that can think critically and are able to solve
   complex problems. Further, the ability to apply knowledge learned during
   college to real-world settings is a major sought-after skill. Overall,
   these findings emphasize the importance of teaching our students to
   think critically but also suggest the importance of including activities
   within our courses that promote the application of ideas. This paper
   presents research on short in-class activities to promote student
   learning in knowledge acquisition, application, and critical thinking.
   In particular, this paper considers the use of these activities in two
   different courses: Introduction to International Relations and American
   Foreign Policy. To assess student learning, this paper compares changes
   in student scores on these activities, as well as considers students'
   self-assessment of learning. The findings suggest that the use of these
   in-class assignments improves students' ability to define, apply, and
   analyze course concepts, and also increases student level of engagement.},

Abstract = {Coalition governments prevail at the European subnational level.
   Although some studies explain the formation of subnational government
   coalitions, we know little about the determinants of individual parties'
   likelihood of joining such coalitions. This article aims to fill this
   gap in empirical and theoretical ways. It shows that an important
   institutional constraint matters for political actors' strategies when
   forming subnational coalitions: the party affiliation of the directly
   elected head of the executive. Being the party of the head of the
   executive or being ideologically close to that party significantly
   increases a party's likelihood of joining a coalition. The empirical
   evidence results from multinomial choice models using a novel data set
   on subnational parties' likelihood of joining 92 coalition governments
   at the local level in Germany between 1999 and 2016. The findings have
   substantive implications for subnational institutional settings
   resembling `mixed' political systems (i.e. neither purely presidential
   nor purely parliamentarian).},

Abstract = {Does increasing executive power necessarily decrease accountability? To
   answer this question, I develop a two-period signaling model comparing
   voter welfare in two separation-of-powers settings. In one, the
   executive works with a median legislator to change policy; in the other,
   the executive chooses between legislation or unilateral action. Both
   politicians may have preferences that diverge from the voter's, yet I
   find that increasing executive power may increase accountability and
   welfare, even in some cases when the legislator is more likely to share
   the voter's preferences than the executive. Unilateral power allows a
   congruent executive to overcome gridlock, implement the voter's
   preferred policy, and reveal information about the politicians'
   types-which can outweigh the risks of a divergent executive wielding
   power for partisan ends.},

Abstract = {Democratic representation is increasingly remote from citizens. Many
   institutions exacerbate this remoteness, but the shrinking ratio of
   legislative representatives to citizens is perhaps the most obvious.
   Around the world, the number of representatives has not kept pace with
   growing populations. To what extent does this distance, between citizens
   and their elected politicians, explain our current democratic malaise?
   Relying on both quantitative and historical evidence, this article maps
   the remoteness of democratic representation and considers its causes,
   consequences, and potential remedies. Strongly associated with economic
   inequality and rural elites, the remoteness of representation has
   far-flung implications, ranging from deficits of diversity and
   accountability in political representation to the weakened capacity of
   citizens to engage in political collective action.},

Abstract = {How did the legal and political-administrative relationship between
   central and local governments of two decentralised states shape their
   response to COVID-19? Literature and theories on decentralisation argue
   that federal and decentralised states are less able to respond to crises
   in a coordinated manner due to their perceived greater susceptibility to
   political conflict. Situated within this theoretical debate and based on
   the analysis of legal acts, political decisions, and relevant national
   news media articles between March and August 2020 in Germany and Italy,
   this research note shows that, counterintuitively, more decentralisation
   does not necessarily translate into more legal and political stress
   during pandemic management. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,
   Germany, a highly decentralised state, experienced less legal and
   political tensions than the less decentralised Italy. The key to
   understanding this variation lies in different institutional
   arrangements, complemented by the specific political cultures of both
   states.},

   evaluation of a non-Western scholarship program from a public diplomacy
   perspective},

Abstract = {Most governments offer scholarships for international students as part
   of their public diplomacy toolbox. However, empirical assessments of
   these programs are relatively rare. The limited number of existing works
   often concern Western countries, while international student mobility
   programs in non-Western countries remain insufficiently researched. This
   special issue addresses these two gaps in the literature. All the
   articles utilize a unique and rich dataset of the perspectives of Global
   Korea Scholarship (GKS) recipients about South Korea. This dataset
   consists of four surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019 of GKS students,
   alumni, and pre-arrival inbound students. There are over 200 variables,
   most of which are about GKS recipients' cognitive and affective
   evaluation of Korea, their Korea-related behaviors, their perceptions of
   how they are treated by Koreans, their satisfaction with studying in
   Korea, satisfaction with university and language school, and integration
   into Korean society. The articles look at various aspects of GKS as a
   public diplomacy tool, including the determinants of positive
   recommendations toward Korea as a study or tourism destination, the
   relationship between behavioral experience, symbolic environment and
   communication behaviors, determinants of students' intentions to stay in
   the host country, gendered dynamics of the scholarship, students'
   perspectives on justice based on their experiences in, and beliefs
   about, the host country, and the determinants of students' satisfaction
   with life in Korea.},

Abstract = {Violent extremism is associated with an intricately linked network of
   variables. Existing psychological models and research tend to either
   focus on specific forms of violent extremism or take a broad
   perspective. We propose an abstract model for the path towards violent
   extremism that allows for specification when needed; the General Needs
   and Affect (GNA) process model. This model can be used by researchers to
   align research outcomes focusing on various forms of violent extremism
   but can also show practitioners which variables are more relevant for
   specific cases of violent extremism. We demonstrate how the GNA model
   can be used as a starting point for applications such as decision-making
   tools and data-collection methods and for hypothesis generation,
   intervention development, and simulation.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is well-known that candidates listed first on the ballot paper tend
   to receive more votes than other candidates. However, experimental
   studies that confirm this truism mostly stem from first-past-the-post
   systems. Do we also find ballot position effects in PR systems where
   voters may vote for a party instead of a specific candidate? We
   investigate a natural experiment in Danish national elections involving
   more than 9,000 candidates on almost 100 different ballot papers. Our
   findings show that ballot positions, indeed, have a causal effect on
   election results in PR systems. Since Danish national elections
   constitute a least-likely case, our findings indicate that ballot
   position effects are much more empirically relevant than suggested by
   existing research.},

Abstract = {This article poses the question of how to correctly understand the
   working class and the socialist movement, stresses the existence and
   development of the Marxist left movements that represent the vanguard of
   the working class, while putting forward a definition of the proletariat
   and examining the structural changes the proletariat has undergone. The
   article indicates how the relationship between the dictatorships of
   different classes and democracy should be understood, suggests that the
   state systems of capitalist countries, that is, their class attributes,
   represent bourgeois-democratic dictatorship. The article puts forward
   views on how to correctly understand socialism, parliamentary democracy
   and proletarian revolution, sets out the reasons why proletarian
   dictatorship constitutes the dictatorship of the people. It explains how
   the new and old imperialism and the aspirations of the working class
   should be understood, details the characteristics of the new and old
   imperialism, and points out that it is necessary to use historical
   materialism to dialectically analyze the appearance and essence of the
   aspirations of the working class and of the broad masses of the people.
   It indicates how the general development trend of human society should
   be understood; expounds views on the basic contradictions of
   contemporary capitalism, the law of accumulation and the existence and
   continued development of various crises; and contends that Leninism is
   an international Marxist theory, paralleling the thought of Marx and
   Engels, that has guided the international proletarian revolution and
   socialist construction.},

Title = {The Greater Transformation: Digitalization and the Transformative Power

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {535-552},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {This article discusses digitalization and its connection with the
   political economy of transformation. Its point of departure is Karl
   Polanyi's historical analysis as presented in The Great Transformation.
   Polanyi analyzed the development of ``self-regulating{''} markets-with
   transformative and destructive consequences for individuals, nature, and
   society-and government efforts to contain these consequences. Polanyi's
   perspective is compared to Marx's theorem of the development of
   productive forces. Their respective focal points are different but
   complementary. For Polanyi, the decisive historical and theoretical
   break (and the cause of the destructive effects) lies in the act of
   purchasing human labor, whereas for Marx it lies in the act of producing
   value and in the relations of production as well as the relations of
   distribution linked to it. Working from this theoretical basis, current
   developments in digitalization are analyzed not as a further development
   within productive forces but as a transforming development of
   distributive forces. Following the logic of The Great Transformation,
   current developments should thus not be interpreted as a second great
   transformation but as the augmentation of the first, leading to a
   ``greater{''} transformation associated with even more destructive
   potential. This leaves little hope for a smooth transition into any form
   of post-growth society.},

Abstract = {A ballot reform was adopted in Colombia in early 1990s. The traditional
   paper ballots, which were printed and distributed by parties, were
   replaced by an Australian ballot-an office-centered design in which the
   electoral authority was responsible for its distribution. The article
   examines about 5,800 department-level legislative lists, during 10
   election cycles between 1970 and 2002, to evaluate the consequences of
   the reform. The evidence shows that candidates expanded the geographical
   scope of their campaigns after the ballot reform and that party bases
   became more geographically dispersed. Moreover, the evidence indicates
   that the new ballot undermined the power of party leaders to coordinate
   factions, resulting in a considerable increase in the number of
   lists-and with it, of wasted votes. These findings suggest that an
   arguably minor reform, such as the adoption of a new ballot form, may
   have major implications for democratic representation.},

Abstract = {Joseph Carens develops one of the most prominent cases for open borders
   in the academic literature on the basis of freedom and equality. Yet the
   implementation of his social membership theory would mean that
   immigrants who have not yet lived in a country long enough to become
   members would be excluded from political and social rights, thus raising
   the possibility of their domination and subordination by citizens. Given
   that these problems arise because Carens aims to balance the freedom of
   individuals with the ``claims of belonging{''} to a political community,
   can we theorize the relationship between freedom and community
   differently? French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy does just that, by
   showing how to think freedom and community as mutually constitutive.
   Nancy thus offers the resources for an alternative case for open
   borders, grounded on the claim that the freedom of community entails
   openness to the outside. Drawing also on Nancy's account of the common
   and of democratic politics, my Nancean argument for open borders
   challenges Carens's exclusion of nonmembers from the rights of citizens,
   emphasizing instead the need for an ongoing political struggle to expand
   who is eligible to claim rights as well as the scope of the rights
   themselves.},

Abstract = {This artide examines the state and prospects of Russia's policy toward
   China. We look at recent trends in the evolution of the world order, the
   history of Moscow-Beijing relations, and the changes in the balance of
   power between Russia and China to offer a forecast of Russia's China
   policy in the near term. Special attention is paid to the role of the
   2001 Treaty of Good-Neighborliness, Friendship, and Cooperation. The
   authors conclude that, despite the Treaty's significance, the
   international situation -and indeed the relative strengths of the two
   countries -have significantly changed over the past 20 years. The new
   conditions will inevitably compel Russia to adjust its policy toward
   China. Moscow, as always, will seek to develop its political and
   economic partnership with Beijing. However, it will likely move toward
   hedging against risks that excessive dependence on China could bring
   about.},

Title = {Democracy, external threat, and military spending},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A number of studies find that democracies spend less on their military
   than non-democracies. Yet there are well known counter-examples,
   including but not limited to the United States and Israel. We contend
   that these counter-examples are part of a larger pattern. The
   relationship between regime type and military spending is conditional on
   external threat. Among countries that do not perceive a significant
   external threat to their interests, democracies allocate considerably
   less to the military than non-democracies. However, democracies with a
   significant external threat do not allocate less to the military than
   non-democracies. The reason prior research consistently finds that
   democracies, on average, spend less on the military, even while
   controlling for external threat, is that democracies are much less
   likely to have a high external threat. For example, autocracies are
   nearly twice as likely as democracies to have a significant external
   threat in our sample. An empirical analysis of military spending from
   1952-2000 is consistent with these expectations.},

Abstract = {Although the landscape for female candidates in U.S. politics has
   improved, research continues to find that many voters possess sexist
   attitudes. We rely on a standard political communication framework to
   help reconcile sexism in the electorate with increasingly favorable
   outcomes for women in primary elections. Based on two national survey
   experiments, we first demonstrate that in the absence of gendered
   campaign rhetoric, sexism is a weak predictor of support for female
   candidates on both sides of the political aisle. We then show, however,
   that when a male candidate attempts to activate sexism among voters by
   attacking a female opponent, gender attitudes become more salient-but
   not to the woman's disadvantage. In a Democratic primary, gendered
   attacks backfire and lead to a significant boost in support for the
   female candidate. On the Republican side, a male candidate does not face
   the same backlash, but the attacks do very little to depress his female
   opponent's support. While the persistence of hostile attitudes toward
   women has slowed the march toward gender equality in society, our
   experimental results suggest that sexism exerts only contingent effects
   in primary elections and not systematically to female candidates'
   detriment.},

Abstract = {We investigate how support for President Donald Trump, beyond
   partisanship, guided Americans' attitudes toward COVID-19. This speaks
   to not just how ``Trumpism{''} and the Trump administration's handling
   of the pandemic influenced public attitudes but to the larger issue of
   how Trump's hold on voters within and beyond the Republican Party
   provides further evidence that leaders surpass the role of parties in
   influencing public opinion. Using longitudinal data with individual
   fixed-effects, we find that from the start of the pandemic, support for
   Trump above and beyond partisanship drove public attitudes capturing
   skepticism toward COVID-19, fears of personal vulnerability, compliance
   with public-safety measures, and viewing the pandemic in racist terms.
   Between March and August 2020, this gulf in attitudes between Trump
   voters and non-supporters, and between Republicans and Democrats,
   widened; the widening was more pronounced between Trump voters and
   non-supporters. Trump's influence on Independents and non-voters also
   grew over the same period. While the use of terms like ``China virus{''}
   was related to partisanship and support for Trump, we find an increase
   in awareness across groups that these terms were racist.},

   Wohlstetter},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-90},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {After the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan
   in 1945, both nations experienced a profound need for a new and
   encompassing story of what it meant to be Japanese, and to be American,
   in the permanent nuclear age. This article is a thought experiment to
   juxtapose the writings and personas of two people who helped their
   respective societies answer those needs and questions during the early
   Cold War: Takashi Nagai-medical radiologist, and survivor of the
   American atomic bombing of Nagasaki, and Albert Wohlstetter-leading
   American civilian nuclear strategist for the RAND Corporation in the
   1950s. Using a combination of mythopeic analysis, biography and
   illuminative juxtaposition, the study discovers surprising similarities
   and analogies between the two cases. They each enact and propose
   interesting variations of sacrificial causalities-claims that human
   nuclear sacrifices past or promised can bring peace by deterrence now or
   peace by abolition soon enough. This is an important study now, as both
   Japan's nuclear pacifism and the American nuclear umbrella in Northeast
   Asia are coming under more severe questioning than perhaps ever before.},

   two-party convergence in India},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Duverger's Law states the single-member district plurality rules should
   produce two-party competition. In district-level election races where
   this expectation holds, what political behaviors-ranging from elites'
   strategic formation of political parties to voters' strategic
   abandonment of losing candidates-account for these outcomes? Using data
   from state elections in India, this article demonstrates that no single
   mechanism accounts for most electoral outcomes consistent with
   Duverger's Law. However, mechanisms related to the behavior elites, far
   more than voters, produce convergence on two-party competition. This
   article uncovers relatively little evidence of outcomes driven by
   strategic voting, instead finding that much of the convergence on two
   parties is attributable to various forms of strategic entry in which
   parties selectively field candidates in certain races. In particular,
   elite collusion-when multiple parties coordinate on where to field
   candidates-is especially important. Data from other countries confirm
   that these findings are not unique to India.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing importance of local action to counter violent
   extremism (CVE), empirical research on the local organization and
   management of CVE is scarce, especially regarding public administrators'
   strategic work to translate policies and recommendations into frontline
   practice. Based mainly on ethnographic data and departing from new
   institutional theory, the paper refines our understanding of the
   symbolic, material, and relational work used to translate a diverse flow
   of ideas into concrete action in diverse institutional settings. Due to
   the institutional complexity, the cultural skill of the local CVE
   coordinator is identified as pivotal to successfully legitimizing and
   implementing CVE efforts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze online discussion threads related to national
   belonging in Finland, Denmark, and France. These discussions are all
   related to immigration and the definition of `legitimate' citizens. Our
   approach is empirical: the goal is to show how in-groups and out-groups
   are construed linguistically and discursively in the data and how the
   interactants negotiate membership categories and express their opinions
   regarding them. The most important in-group in the datasets consists of
   the nationals born in the country, whereas the out-group par excellence
   is formed by Muslims. The data show how the boundaries of national
   communities are performatively constructed through the everyday
   discourse of online fora, which constitute an important arena of
   societal debate today. This discourse draws its force from the
   reiteration of stereotypical generalizations and the power attached to
   the written word in a communication environment enabling an efficient
   dissemination of ideological discourse.},

   Science},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The history of political philosophy serves as a valuable resource for
   the current research paradigms in political science. In comparative
   terms, the paradigm of Western research is essentially
   ``change-oriented{''} and tends to shift constantly with its evolving
   thoughts. Due to the influence of bourgeois revolutions around the
   world, contemporary politics has transpired as the synopsis of
   governance of the established order. As the ``governing strategies{''}
   of the established order encounter multiple social crises, the Marxist
   political science or Marxism has emerged as the naturally preferred
   alternative research paradigm. During the Cold War period, such
   governing strategies were adopted as universal values in Western
   political science, effectuating the prediction of ``the end of the
   history.{''} After the launch of the reform and opening-up campaign,
   ``change-oriented{''} liberal democracy became an instrumental paradigm
   for Chinese political science. However, as the contemporary world order
   disfavored this paradigm, Chinese scholars shifted their research focus
   to developing an independent discourse power in democracy and
   governance, as well as prioritizing state governance as their primary
   research paradigm and methodology. Thus, political science is expected
   to resume its common sense nearly after a century of political chaos.},

Abstract = {What affects Americans' sensitivity to international laws and norms on
   the use of force? A wealth of recent IR literature tackles this question
   through experimental surveys using fictional scenarios and treatments to
   explore precisely when Americans would approve of government policies
   that would violate the laws of war. We test whether such survey
   experiments may themselves be affecting public sensitivity to these
   norms-or even Americans' understanding of the content of the norms
   themselves. We show that being invited to express a preference regarding
   war crimes in survey settings has a negative impact on Americans'
   understanding of US legal and ethical obligations in war and that
   reporting previous findings can inflate support for war crimes. We
   conclude with suggestions for future experimental survey design in
   international relations and international law.},

Abstract = {Support for the populist radical right (PRR) has surged across Europe.
   Existing studies on female support for the PRR are mostly cross-national
   in nature and have found that neither social-demographic nor attitudinal
   differences satisfactorily explain the gender gap in PRR support. Here
   we focus on the gender gap in support for UKIP and the Brexit Party, two
   parties that have significantly shaped British politics. Using data
   covering two European Parliamentary and three General Elections, we show
   that a gender gap exists in PRR support, but that it varies over time.
   In line with comparative studies, we find little evidence to suggest
   that social-demographic or attitudinal differences explain the gender
   gap in PRR support. Instead, we show that party leadership is crucial.
   Women in the British electorate hold negative opinions on Nigel Farage
   and this explains the gender gap in PRR support in Britain.},

Abstract = {The Middle East is a geostrategic spot marked by various conflicts and
   crises nowadays, which determine the relationship between state actors
   and non-state actors involved in the area, as well as the establishment
   of strategies and alliances among them. The main cause of some of these
   problematic dynamics is the rivalry between two powers: Iran and Saudi
   Arabia. These states seek the essential goal of standing up themselves
   as the only political and religious leader in the local scenario. The
   antagonism of their interests awakens in a climate of high tension and
   enmity that translates into a form of indirect confrontation, proxy war,
   which has repercussions in their surroundings, coming up greater
   instability and insecurity throughout the region.},

Abstract = {We examine the substantive meaning of public opinion on government
   spending using open-ended data from an original survey. Belying the
   conventional wisdom on this subject, we find that public opinion on
   government spending is not reducible to views on social welfare
   programs. While most people do have specific associations with spending,
   in the aggregate, public associations span a wide range of government
   functions. Balance does not necessarily mean harmony, however. We find
   strong evidence of what we call substantive divergence along party lines
   in this area-when they think about spending, Republicans and Democrats
   envision different bundles of goods and services, on average. This is
   true even for opposing partisans with the same overall assessment of
   spending (e.g., those who say government spends too much). These
   findings bring fiscal conflict into sharper relief and also have broader
   implications for the conceptualization and measurement of differences
   across parties, as well as other political cleavages.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the Washington Agreement (WA) in the context of
   European Union (EU) efforts to facilitate the dialogue between Kosovo
   and Serbia. The starting point is based on the idea that EU-led
   negotiations seek consensus between leadership in Belgrade and Pristina,
   as opposed to unilateral or imposed solutions. The central question is
   as follows: is the WA a supplementary document to the Brussels process?
   While certain points of the agreement are a mere repetition of previous
   agreements signed by the two parties, the agreement commits Kosovo to
   the mini-Schengen and brings a novelty into the dynamics of the
   Belgrade-Pristina relationship, such as in the case of the joint
   management of Gazivode/Ujmani lake. With a new Kosovar government, the
   mini-Schengen point, together with the point of Kosovo and Serbia's
   pledge to open/move embassies to Jerusalem, remains the most contested
   part of the Agreement. Finally, the two sides have reaffirmed their
   commitment to western values and agree to become less dependent on
   Russia's energy and China's technology supplies.},

Abstract = {Film matters to political theory, Davide Panagia has argued, because its
   unique properties as a medium create the possibility of experiencing
   ideas about politics in a way that the arguments of textual political
   theory cannot convey. This paper disputes this account by drawing on
   work on both the nature of political theory and on the concept of visual
   argument. It uses the work of Gilles Deleuze to argue that even if the
   filmic image cannot be understood on the analogy of language, insofar as
   film seeks to convey political ideas, these are always at least
   implicitly linguistic. Using examples drawn from classic and
   contemporary political films, the paper provides a classification of
   political films by genre according to the same criteria as written works
   of political theory. It concludes that although Deleuze's argument that
   film can present political images and signs in a way that has no
   linguistic equivalent may be correct, Panagia's further claim that there
   are political ideas that are uniquely suited to, or can only be conveyed
   in, a visual medium has no warrant.},

Abstract = {Borders are not merely assertions of sovereign territorial demarcations,
   but indicative of cultural boundaries. This article discusses how the
   India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement (2015) led to reorganisation of
   territorial boundaries, whereby the inhabitants had the choice of
   citizenship between India and Bangladesh that reaffirmed their identity.
   The subjective differentiation between `us' and `them' was negotiated by
   various cultural elements such as Bangla language; an everyday language
   symbolizing membership in the constituting communities, kinship and
   citizenship in the nation. Language was an important attribute that
   identified them as `Bengali'/'Bangladeshi' while navigating the
   trans-territorial national identity. While arguing that the new
   citizens' construction of `acts of citizenship' was based on a
   linguistic identity and everyday languages made claims to citizenship
   possible, the paper also explores: how does language help negotiate the
   cultural boundaries of `us' or `them' in post Land Border Agreement? How
   has language (re)shaped identity towards attainment of citizenship?},

Abstract = {Editors Rachel Brown and Deva Woodly bring together Mara Marin, Shatema
   Threadcraft, Christopher Paul Harris, Jasmine Syedullah, and Miriam
   Ticktin to examine the question: what would be required for care to be
   an ethic and political practice that orients people to a new way of
   living, relating, and governing? The answer they propose is that a
   21st-century approach to the politics of care must aim at unmaking
   racial capitalism, cisheteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and the
   colonial present. The politics of care is an approach to political
   thought and action that moves beyond the liberal approach which situates
   care as a finite resource to be distributed among autonomous
   individuals, or as a necessarily feminine virtue. Instead, those
   elucidating the politics of care for the contemporary era draw on rich
   interdisciplinary traditions and social movements to theorize and
   practice care as an inherently interdependent survival strategy, a
   foundation for political organizing, and a prefigurative politics for
   building a world in which all people can live and thrive.},

Abstract = {Supreme Court job approval is sensibly connected to its decisions,
   particularly salient ones. We fill a gap in the literature by
   theorizing-via a presidential appointment mechanism-how partisan
   alignment with the incumbent president (presidential copartisanship)
   influences Supreme Court job approval. Analysis of data from 1986 to
   2019 (supplemented by longer-term confidence data) shows that a
   president's copartisans are significantly more approving of the Court
   than outpartisans. Analysis of the American Panel Survey surrounding
   high-salience events during the transition from Obama to Trump shows
   that Republicans, who significantly increase in Court approval following
   Trump's election victory, are anticipatory of Trump's prospects of
   changing the Court. Democrats, whose approval significantly declines
   only after Justice Gorsuch's confirmation, are not anticipatory but
   reactive to the president's confirmed appointee. Our findings generate
   new evidence of how the president structures public opinion toward the
   Court, which has important implications for judicial independence and
   legitimacy.},

Title = {Gender Gaps in Electoral Turnout: Surveys versus Administrative Censuses},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {304-313},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gender gaps in voter turnout are usually studied using opinion surveys
   rather than official census data. This is because administrative
   censuses usually do not disaggregate turnout according to voters' sex.
   Without this official information, much of the research on gender gaps
   in electoral turnout relies on survey respondents' self-reported
   behavior, either before or after an election. The decision to use survey
   data implies facing several potential drawbacks. Among them are the
   turnout overstatement bias and the attrition or nonresponse bias, both
   affecting the estimation of factors explaining turnout and any related
   statistical analysis. Furthermore, these biases may be correlated with
   covariates such as gender: men, more than women, may systematically
   overstate their electoral participation. We analyze turnout gender gaps
   in Chile, comparing national surveys with official administrative data,
   which in Chile are publicly available. Crucially, the latter includes
   the official record of sex, age, and the electoral behavior-whether the
   individual voted or not-for about 14 million registered individuals.
   Based on a series of statistical models, we find that analysis based on
   survey data is likely to rule out gender gaps in electoral
   participation. Carrying out the same exercises, but with official data,
   leads to the opposite conclusion, namely, that there is a sizable gender
   gap favoring women.},

Abstract = {Old-age pensions are the most widespread social security programmes
   around the world that in many countries account for a huge part of the
   national budget. Based on the PENLEG dataset (Pension Legislation around
   the World, 1880-2010), this article answers the question whether the
   political regime type has affected the choice of a specific pension
   design when implementing old-age pensions for the first time. The global
   study shows that nondemocratic regimes were more likely to implement
   social insurance designs, as these pension designs are best suited to
   bind citizens to the state and to target benefits on groups that are
   essential for regime survival. In contrast, the study can only find weak
   evidence that electoral autocracies were less likely to implement social
   insurance designs than closed autocracies. Moreover, colonial legacies
   mattered strongly. Especially former French colonies were more likely to
   implement social insurance designs.},

Abstract = {The terrorism discourse in the Kenyan context dates back to the colonial
   and post-colonial years with the country having suffered its most
   devastating terrorist attacks in the period since 1998. Despite a series
   of dreadful experiences, it was not until 9/11 that the country's
   counterterrorism discourse took a serious upward trajectory. This was
   after Kenya's elevation by her Western allies as an ``anchor{''} state
   in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). This development illustrates how
   Kenya's security architecture is hugely dependent on Western
   counterterrorism frameworks, strategies, and at times, security
   priorities. In this regard, the existing counterterrorism frameworks not
   only perpetuate colonial continuities but also neglect the national
   contextual peculiarities. This article, thus, explores how Western
   constructions of terrorism permeate Kenya's counterterrorism, and deny
   subaltern actors the opportunity to participate in developing
   intervention priorities and owning the strategies. Our analysis of the
   explicit knowledge predispositions between Western and the local
   constructions of counterterrorism, consequently, suggest some parallels
   between colonial continuities and the state-owned interventions. We,
   therefore, seek to deconstruct the universality of knowledge on
   counterterrorism, and argue for increased recognition and inclusion of
   indigenous African counterterrorism approaches which have been obscured
   from mainstream knowledge systems.},

Abstract = {The UK's 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and
   Foreign Policy states that the UK will no longer give public figures for
   its operational nuclear weapons stockpile, deployed warheads or deployed
   missiles, ending previous policies on transparency. Accurate accounting
   for historical holdings of nuclear weapons will likely be of importance
   in any future verifiable nuclear disarmament treaty. The National
   Archives provide details on the UK's historical stockpile and its
   composition, and in this article John RWalker makes an initial tentative
   estimate of the UK's annual holdings by weapon type between 1953 and
   1977.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {337-359},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Populist politicians surrounded by military allies are a frequent sight
   in countries that have experienced democratic backsliding. Populists
   sometimes seek protection in the military, who in turn leverage the
   relationship to advance their own interests. Despite the recent wave of
   populism, the burgeoning literature on it has not devoted due attention
   to analysing the populist-military relationship; its origins, outcomes,
   and tensions. This article analyses the Brazilian military's
   re-appearance under President Jair Bolsonaro. Absent the usual
   institutional support bases on which Brazilian presidents rely,
   Bolsonaro has cultivated military support with resources and positions
   that allow officers expanded political power and privilege. An
   equilibrium held for the government's first two years. Thereafter,
   growing reservations about propping up an increasingly unpopular
   president, especially by heeding orders that would threaten their
   professional integrity, put in question the future of the armed forces
   as a pillar of the Bolsonaro administration. At the same time, the
   military's substantial expansion in government and state positions under
   Bolsonaro raises the specter of elevated military autonomy under future
   administrations. This would be problematic for popular sovereignty, a
   cornerstone of democracy, even if uniformed officers are not
   saber-rattling, mounting coups or occupying presidential office.},

Abstract = {This article compares cross-national aging populations in Latin America
   to study the relationship between this population, regime type, and
   types of social expenditure. Much of the previous research addressed
   this relationship in industrialized countries, but those countries are
   predominantly democratic and have less variation in age demographics. I
   demonstrate that the effect of the aged population varies by regime type
   and type of expenditure. In general, democratic regimes with larger
   elderly populations spend more on social security and welfare. By and
   large, education policy is unaffected by the size of the elderly
   population regardless of regime type. These results suggest that the
   elderly population is most concerned with social security, which makes
   sense because these government expenditures directly affect them.},

Abstract = {Female representation in political decision-making positions is now a
   salient issue in public discussions throughout Europe. Understanding
   public attitudes towards a more balanced gender distribution in politics
   remains limited, however. Using a 2017 Eurobarometer, we focus on
   cross-national differences in public support for increased female
   participation in politics to address this limitation. Building on the
   policy feedbacks literature, we stress the role of gender quotas. We
   argue that quotas - as legislative devices usually adopted through
   elite-driven initiatives - stimulate support for stronger female
   representation. Ensuing debates on quotas raise individual awareness
   about the underrepresentation of women - informational effect - and,
   once adopted, give a clear signal that persistent gender imbalance is a
   social problem to be redressed - normative effect. Our empirical
   analysis supports this argument. Citizens in countries with gender
   quotas display stronger support for increased female participation in
   politics.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have largely overlooked the democratic challenges
   inherent in the governance of U.S. public education-despite profound
   implications for educational delivery and, ultimately, social mobility
   and economic growth. In this study, we consider whether the interests of
   adult voters who elect local school boards are likely to be aligned with
   the needs of the students their districts educate. Specifically, we
   compare voters and students in four states on several policy-relevant
   dimensions. Using official voter turnout records and rich microtargeting
   data, we document considerable demographic differences between voters
   who participate in school board elections and the students attending the
   schools that boards oversee. These gaps are most pronounced in majority
   nonwhite jurisdictions and school districts with the largest racial
   achievement gaps. Our novel analysis provides important context for
   understanding the political pressures facing school boards and their
   likely role in perpetuating educational and, ultimately, societal
   inequality.},

Abstract = {How do racially concentrated policy changes translate to political
   action? Using official election returns, the Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study, and original data on the unprecedented mass closure of
   schools in segregated, predominantly Black neighborhoods across Chicago,
   we demonstrate that those living in the communities affected (1)
   increase their attendance at political meetings; (2) mobilize in support
   of ballot measures to avert future closings; and (3) increase their
   participation in the subsequent local election, while decreasing their
   support for the political official responsible for the policy on the
   ballot-at a higher rate than every other group. These findings shed
   light on how groups that previously participated at the lowest rates go
   on to participate at the highest rates on community issues that matter
   to them. We develop a theory of place-based mobilization to explain the
   role of ``the community{''} in acting as a site of coidentification and
   political action for marginalized groups.},

Abstract = {Democracy in the sphere of policy-making warrants fulfilling the popular
   will by opening spaces for citizen knowledge of the governance processes
   participation, inclusion and a framework for accountability. The four
   budget stages of preparation, approval, implementation, and audit
   necessarily ought to integrate the above principles for an essential
   nexus with democracy. Using the work of two groups of civil society
   partners working on Nigeria's budgeting, we studied the 2016-2019 period
   around the principles of democratic budgeting as well as explored
   changes related to civic engagements over the period. We found a
   monopoly of budget preparation by cloistered bureaucratic experts. The
   approval stage is marred by politics of vested interests in the
   legislature and executive with resulting delays in implementation and
   limited monitoring of the process by citizens. Budget audit suffers
   delays and non-response to its sensitive findings. Nonetheless,
   participatory civic engagements have led to a legal framework for civic
   vigilance in budgeting and enabled the country to save
   US\$500,373,421.40 from frivolous allocations as well as annual budget
   adjustments for pro-poor inclusiveness and fair distribution of capital
   projects. Hence, civil society work for democratic budgeting regime is
   slow but incremental and unfolds amidst encumbering political and
   institutional dynamics.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {637-645},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In an era when elections scholars expected American national
   presidential election turnout to increase, its steep, prolonged
   post-1960 decline sparked deep concern and generated an avalanche of
   individual-level analyses searching for explanation. The post-1960
   decline, however, no longer dominates turnout's trajectory; it has been
   on the upswing since 1996. This complicates our understanding as we have
   yet to settle on turnout's description, much less its explanation. Here
   we introduce the first political science-oriented, multivariate modeling
   of American national presidential election turnout. Our results offer a
   mix of important confirmatory and original findings. First, we discover
   that modeling turnout's decline as a post-1968 secular disturbance
   reveals turnout's expected steady increase across the modern era
   (1952-2020). Second, we show that turnout's increase can be traced to
   increased polarization working its influence indirectly through the
   direct, positive turnout affects of voter external efficacy and negative
   presidential campaign advertising (1960-2012).},

Title = {Reputation versus office: Why populist radical right governmental

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {5},
Pages = {613-630},

Abstract = {Sweden and Denmark have presented contrasting relationships between
   centre-right and populist radical right (PRR) parties. In Sweden, the
   centre-right has refused cooperation with the Sweden Democrats
   (Sverigedemokraterna) (SD), even when this cost the centre-right office.
   However, in Denmark, coalitions led by centre-right parties have
   cooperated with the Danish People's Party (Dansk Folkeparti) (DF) on
   multiple occasions. Through a controlled comparison, we examine what
   explains these different outcomes. Using Chapel Hill Expert Surveys and
   public opinion data, we firstly look at the policy congruence between
   parties and the social acceptability of cooperation. We then examine
   interview material with representatives from centre-right and PRR
   parties in Sweden and Denmark to see their explanations of cooperation
   and non-cooperation. We conclude that, while the office goals of Danish
   centre-right parties, along with the policy focus and uncontroversial
   past of DF, explain that case, the reputation and past of SD has
   precluded a similar outcome.},

Abstract = {Grant and Lebo (2016) and Keele et al. (2016) clarify the conditions
   under which the popular general error correction model (GECM) can be
   used and interpreted easily: In a bivariate GECM the data must be
   integrated in order to rely on the error correction coefficient,
   alpha(1){*}, to test cointegration and measure the rate of error
   correction between a single exogenous x and a dependent variable, y.
   Here we demonstrate that even if the data are all integrated, the test
   on alpha(1){*} is misunderstood when there is more than a single
   independent variable. The null hypothesis is that there is no
   cointegration between y and any x but the correct alternative hypothesis
   is that y is cointegrated with at least one but not necessarily more
   than one of the x's. A significant alpha(1){*} can occur when some i(1)
   regressors are not cointegrated and the equation is not balanced. Thus,
   the correct limiting distributions of the righthand-side long-run
   coefficients may be unknown. We use simulations to demonstrate the
   problem and then discuss implications for applied examples.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the tension between endorsements of relativism and
   anti-relativisms in the European historical culture between 2000 and
   2020. Relativism, defined as the idea that the authority of a claim is
   always and only dependent on the context in which it is made, has
   historically been controversial. In the EU's historical culture,
   relativism is sometimes endorsed, and sometimes not. This paper finds
   that in the EU historical culture, anti-relativism should analytically
   be distinguished from anti-relativizing-even though the terminology of
   ``relativism{''} and ``relativizing{''} is often used interchangeably.
   This insight helps to understand what is at stake in EU debates around
   memory and history and replaces the question of whether (not) to be
   relativist, with that of when (not) to relativize.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the Conservative Party finds itself in a period
   of ideological crisis. The last significant period of intellectual
   realignment in the party led to the dominance of Hayekian market theory
   as a structuring logic for government. Under Boris Johnson, this
   economic logic is challenged by the political logic of neoconservatism,
   which restores the political through appeals to authority, hierarchy and
   quite particular articulations of the nature of the (national)
   community. To demonstrate this tension, the article examines how Brexit
   and the `levelling-up' agenda can be understood as structured by this
   division between the economic and the political. Both of these logics
   are incompatible with older, traditional forms of conservatism and
   whichever is ultimately successful, this signals a major shift in the
   character of British conservatism and potentially ushers in a new era of
   conservatism without tradition.},

Abstract = {In this article I offer a comparative analysis of the relationship
   between waste and large-scale social crises. Drawing on the history of
   extremes, the history of Nazi Germany to be precise, I argue that
   garbage itself functions as a language of crisis that translates
   seemingly insurmountable social problems into questions of cleanup,
   upkeep and order. The encroachment of waste often inspires crisis
   rhetoric, yet it is almost always a symptom of larger, systemic
   malfunctions such as infrastructural breakdowns, political impasses,
   social disruptions, natural catastrophe, war or pandemics. In the
   context of the Nazi race war, an obsession with waste and recycling
   promised to clean up the mess of war, while hiding the ways in which
   waste management itself was central to the practices of both war and
   genocide. My discussion of the Nazi waste regime thus provides a frame
   for rethinking our own current crisis and its origins in the late 1960s
   through the prism of the ``garbage crisis.{''}},

Abstract = {Does electoral competition increase affective polarization? Can
   inter-party cooperation depolarize voters? Addressing these questions is
   challenging since both competition and cooperation are endogenous to
   political attitudes. Building on social identity theory and leveraging a
   natural experiment unfolding over seven Israeli election studies, we
   demonstrate that the enhanced salience of electoral competition
   increases affective polarization. We then consider whether inter-party
   cooperation can depolarize the electorate. To do so, we further build on
   theories of coalition ambivalence and party brands and leverage the
   ambiguity around coalition building following elections of Israel's
   22(nd) Knesset, to implement a survey experiment where we credibly shape
   respondents' perceptions regarding the likelihood that a unity
   government will form. We find that priming party cooperation in the form
   of a unity government promotes tolerance across partisan lines. Our
   studies contribute to the affective polarization literature by
   identifying institutional causes and remedies of polarization in a
   comparative context.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on David Ruccio's blog, Occasional Links \&
   Commentary, in light of his broader work on economic representations: a
   project that decenters economic knowledge beyond the ivory tower in
   order to understand how other kinds of economic knowledge are formed and
   how they might offer alternatives to existing economic arrangements. The
   blog can be understood as an instantiation of that project: an
   anticapitalist archive that breaks down the boundaries between academic
   and everyday perspectives on the economy and between what are often seen
   as separate spheres of economics, politics, and culture.},

Abstract = {Why do governments centralize control over regions? We present a theory
   of the transition from indirect to direct rule, focusing on the
   strategic interaction between a ruler and local potentates who provide
   civil order in exchange for a share of tax revenue. When the threat of
   rebellion from below falls and elites become less crucial
   intermediaries, the ruler is able to centralize power, replacing local
   potentates with direct agents of the state and investing in a fiscal
   bureaucracy for future state development. We assess the theory using
   subnational data from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mexico around
   the time of a dramatic demographic collapse, which undermined the threat
   of domestic conflict. Using a difference-in-differences approach and an
   instrumental variables empirical strategy based on the climate shocks
   associated with a virulent series of epidemics, we show that state
   centralization occurred faster in areas experiencing a more dramatic
   decline in population.},

Abstract = {How do politicians staff the bureaucracy and what are the policy
   implications? We develop a dynamic model of personnel policy,
   bureaucratic quality, and electoral competition. In each period,
   incumbents choose how much to support patronage and civil service
   personnel systems. The civil service system is needed to produce public
   goods, but patronage provides private goods and improves an incumbent's
   reelection prospects. Incumbents must also worry about whether opponents
   will sustain the civil service system following an electoral loss. Our
   results demonstrate the importance of a cross-party commitment to public
   goods, along with low costs of civil service hiring, for encouraging
   good government in equilibrium. The model also suggests that electoral
   competitiveness has only a limited influence on good government and
   challenges previous arguments about electoral vulnerability and civil
   service reform. We finally present empirical evidence regarding our
   predicted relationship between party system convergence and merit-based
   hiring.},

Abstract = {The research studies the features of coverage of the Syrian conflict by
   Russian media. In scientific discourse, there are a number of works
   studying the information support for the civil war in Syria, which is
   explained by its specificity - a multilateral, multilevel protracted
   conflict creates an opportunity for a varied interpretation of events
   and causal relationships. The way events in Syria are presented in
   various regions of Russia is of particular interest. In the course of
   this study, a database of media articles, both federal and regional
   (Dagestan, Tatarstan, Chechnya), was collected. The articles were then
   analyzed from the point of view of the prevailing semantic codes, which
   made it possible to identify how the Syrian conflict is framed, as well
   as the similarities and differences of different regions' frames.},

Abstract = {This article starts from understanding nonviolence as a proposal for
   cultural transformation that seeks, from different social shores, to
   delegitimize all types of violence and, therefore, highlights the
   importance of understanding the logics that the patriarchal culture
   manages, structured from its use and naturalization, seeking and
   building alternative paths that allow it to be overcome.
   In a first section I make an approach to culture as a human, historical
   and social construction, which has allowed the adaptation of actions
   based on the protection of life, to conclude that the crisis is an
   expression of its inability to sustain it. Overcoming it means
   understanding the mechanisms that have allowed this human history to
   legitimize much of its violence based on what I call the conscience of
   goodness or moral superiority. Who are the subjects of this legitimation
   and to whom do we grant this power? What kind of learned cultural
   imaginaries support this delegation? Sections 2 and 3 seek comprehensive
   approaches to these questions, to conclude that nonviolence is also a
   critical look at the ways of doing and thinking installed and
   naturalized through culture.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to deal with the converging premises of
   holistic (or environmental) justice and socioeconomic justice in order
   to attribute a hermeneutic-concreting sense to socio-environmental
   justice. The study addressed the ideological aspects of ecologism, the
   premises and transdisciplinary nature of environmental justice. The work
   concluded that socio-environmental justice, as content and process, can
   be materialized in its precarious historicity, but permanently revisited
   and updated. Therefore, it is necessary to improve or create
   institutions and instances that effectively extend the recognition and
   enable the participation of peoples and social groups in the
   deliberative and monitoring processes of environmental issues and
   sustainable socioeconomic development at local, regional, national
   levels and international. The methodologies used in the research were
   philosophical-speculative, analytical-conceptual,
   philosophical-deductive and philosophical-normative, since the study has
   axiological-conceptual and procedural intent. Specific bibliographic
   texts were consulted as primary sources.},

Abstract = {Due to the development of the information society, countries face the
   task of effectively regulating the relevant social relations. The
   mechanisms of such regulation should correspond to the specifics of such
   relations. Digitization is one of the modern methods of legal
   regulation, which is the use of information technology at the state
   level. The existing scientific achievements on digitalization processes
   need constant improvement, which corresponds to the specifics ofthi s
   field. The object of research is digitalization in law in the light of
   international experience. The article aims to study and analyze
   digitalization in law in the international legal aspect. The following
   methods were used during the study: systemic, systemic-functional,
   comparative, sociological, analysis, synthesis, analogy, observation,
   classification, and statistical analysis. The article analyzes the
   phenomenon of digitalization, identifies the main approaches to
   understanding it. On the example of international experience (such
   countries as France, Germany, Italy, Georgia, Greece, and Great
   Britain), the mechanisms of using digitalization in public
   administration are determined, the legal regulation of informatization
   is analyzed. Also, based on the study and analysis of doctrinal
   teachings of international information experience, it is proposed to
   improve the domestic legal mechanism to ensure the effective functioning
   of public relations.},

Abstract = {We examine women's access to campaign resources using data from all 960
   candidates competing in Chile's 2017 legislative elections. Even when
   controlling for district characteristics, women candidates receive less
   money in party transfers, bank loans, and donations; place fewer
   personal funds in their campaigns; and have fewer resources overall.
   However, previous experience and incumbency narrow the gap. When women
   are newcomers, gender serves as an important cue about candidate quality
   and funders default to favoring men. Our results lend credence to
   practitioners' claims that money disadvantages women candidates in
   democracies, but focuses attention on the disadvantage faced by women
   newcomers. Moreover, this gender gap in campaign funding exists despite
   a gendered electoral financing scheme designed to make political actors
   more likely to invest in women's campaigns. While increasingly popular
   among development experts, our research suggests such schemes might be
   insufficient for equalizing campaign funding between men and women.},

Abstract = {This article concerns freedom and financial markets. First, I consider
   the republican case for liberalization, extending Robert Taylor's
   economic model of republicanism to financial markets. This case adopts
   what I call a ``philosopher-king{''} approach to political theory,
   arguing by reference an ideal or first-best set of policies or reforms.
   Then, I investigate the negative externalities of several decades of
   financial market liberalization, including the erosion of political
   accountability and the growing concentration of political and economic
   power in the hands of those best suited to profit from the rise of
   finance. From this ``political economy{''} perspective, the impact of
   liberalization is clear: we paid for greater access to credit with
   political and economic domination. In republican terms, we traded
   freedom for credit. My analysis, moreover, has implications for
   republican debates on freedom and the market. In second-best worlds,
   where reforms will almost certainly be incremental, shaping the balance
   of power in ways that impact future policy, judging reforms by reference
   to a vision of domination-free markets will often suggest policies that
   make individuals less free. The political economy approach is far more
   relevant to debates about which economic institutions further or hinder
   freedom as non-domination.},

Abstract = {In small samples, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of logit model
   coefficients have substantial bias away from zero. As a solution, we
   remind political scientists of Firth's (1993, Biometrika, 80, 27-38)
   penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimator. Prior research has
   described and used PML, especially in the context of separation, but its
   small sample properties remain under-appreciated. The PML estimator
   eliminates most of the bias and, perhaps more importantly, greatly
   reduces the variance of the usual ML estimator. Thus, researchers do not
   face a bias-variance tradeoff when choosing between the ML and PML
   estimators-the PML estimator has a smaller bias and a smaller variance.
   We use Monte Carlo simulations and a re-analysis of George and Epstein
   (1992, American Political Science Review, 86, 323-337) to show that the
   PML estimator offers a substantial improvement in small samples (e.g.,
   50 observations) and noticeable improvement even in larger samples
   (e.g., 1000 observations).},

Abstract = {Several recent analyses have examined the effects of religious beliefs,
   belonging, and behaviors on the representation of women in American
   politics. Taken collectively, these studies present an interesting
   puzzle. Specifically, they demonstrate that religious adherents express
   attitudes that are less supportive of women in positions of political
   leadership and that at every stage of the process, from primary
   candidacy to general-election victory, women are less likely to run and
   win in districts with greater numbers of religious adherents. However,
   this does not appear to be the result of even the most devout voters'
   unwillingness to support women candidates in general elections. This
   body of work, therefore, suggests that the effect of religion on the
   representation of women manifests at earlier stages of the process,
   including individual vote choice in primary elections, party and elite
   recruitment, and potential candidates' strategic entry decisions.},

Abstract = {A great challenge for capitalist development under authoritarian regimes
   is to effectively constrain predatory behavior. Beyond existing
   frameworks of the dictator's time horizon and institutionalized power
   sharing, we introduce an alternative perspective-elite cleavage. We
   argue that the systematic vulnerability of marginalized local cadres
   motivated them to ally with grassroots constituents and protect local
   economic interests in order to increase the odds of political survival.
   Difference-in-differences analysis of counties in two Chinese provinces
   shows that the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution created a moment of
   political decentralization which enabled marginalized local elites to
   protect local entrepreneurs against national-level radical policies,
   resulting in much more vibrant private economic activities in some
   regions. Further empirical evidence shows that elite cleavages formed in
   the 1940s had a long-lasting impact on economic performance in the
   reform era.},

Abstract = {The Arab Spring revived interest into how contentious mobilization
   diffuses across time and space. We evaluate individual-level attitudinal
   implications of this literature through laboratory experiments with 681
   Egyptian college students. Across two separate experiments, primes based
   on recent protests in Tunisia, Syria and the Sudan reveal a limited
   ability to shift respondents' retrospective views of the Arab Spring,
   the efficacy of protest to achieve political change, Egypt's perceived
   domestic situation vis-a-vis its neighbours and a personal willingness
   to assume risk in a computer game-based behavioural extension. Our
   findings imply the need to continue to improve theorizing and
   empirically testing key implications from the diffusion literature.},

Abstract = {In many international agreements, the European Union sets up joint
   bodies such as `association councils' or `joint committees'. These
   institutions bring together European Union and third-country officials
   for agreement implementation. To date, we know surprisingly little about
   how much discretion the European Commission enjoys in them. Drawing on a
   principal-agent framework, we hypothesise that the complexity of
   agreements, the voting rule, conflict within the Council, and agency
   losses can explain Commission discretion in these institutions. Drawing
   on an original dataset covering nearly 300 such joint bodies set up by
   the European Union since 1992, we find robust empirical support for all
   expectations except for the agency loss thesis. Our findings suggest
   that the European Commission is the primary actor in the implementation
   of many of the European Union's international agreements, allowing it to
   influence EU external relations beyond what is currently acknowledged in
   the literature.},

Abstract = {Chieftaincy conflicts in Ghana are often presented as disputes involving
   rival groups over succession to traditional political power. However,
   chieftaincy conflicts are complex and often shaped by constellation of
   different actors, national and local level politics and elite
   maneuvering. This paper argues that chieftaincy conflicts go beyond the
   structural interpretations of competition and contestation for
   traditional power, but rather processual, encompassing constellations of
   diverse actors, elite politics and manipulation. In Northern Ghana, the
   combination of structural and processual factors drive chieftaincy
   conflicts. Party politics in chieftaincy conflicts have rendered
   chieftaincy institutions, that are supposed to be apolitical in nature,
   political.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Electoral rules establish incentives that encourage candidates to strike
   a particular balance between cultivating their own personal reputations
   and cultivating shared party reputations. Higher levels of intraparty
   competition stress the need for an individual reputation and minimize
   the usefulness of a shared, party reputation. We develop a new indicator
   of intraparty competition that addresses shortcomings pointed out in
   previously used indicators. We also identify new, particularly intuitive
   indicators of ``personal{''} and ``party{''} vote seeking. Using
   within-system and across-system variation in parliamentary elections in
   Japan, we find that candidate manifestos contain more frequent uses of
   first-person pronouns and candidate names and fewer references to
   political parties when intraparty competition is stiffest.},

Title = {Ideological Asymmetries and the Determinants of Politically Motivated
   Reasoning},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {A large literature demonstrates that conservatives have greater needs
   for certainty than liberals. This suggests an asymmetry hypothesis:
   Conservatives are less open to new information that conflicts with their
   political identity and, in turn, political accountability will be lower
   on the right than the left. However, recent work suggests that liberals
   and conservatives are equally prone to politically motivated reasoning
   (PMR). The present article confronts this puzzle. First, we identify
   significant limitations of extant studies evaluating the asymmetry
   hypothesis and deploy two national survey experiments to address them.
   Second, we provide the first direct test of the key theoretical claim
   underpinning the asymmetry hypothesis: epistemic needs for certainty
   promote PMR. We find little evidence for the asymmetry hypothesis.
   Importantly, however, we also find no evidence that epistemic needs
   promote PMR. That is, although conservatives report greater needs for
   certainty than liberals, these needs are not a major source of political
   bias.},

Abstract = {Recent survey research has revealed a `devolution paradox': some
   citizens who favour stronger regional governments inconsistently desire
   policy uniformity across regions and state-wide intervention in policy
   provision. It is argued and empirically shown that preferences for
   regional authority can be broken down into preferences for self-rule -
   that is, for autonomy for the region - and for shared rule - that is,
   for collaboration between regional and national governments. Drawing
   upon the International Constitutional Values Survey, which includes
   4,930 respondents from 142 regions in eight countries, it is also shown
   that preferences for self-rule and shared rule have different impacts.
   Preferences for self-rule translate into a preference for regional
   reform that strengthens regional autonomy, whereas preferences for
   shared rule drive preferences for fiscal transfers from richer to poorer
   regions. These results are important because they can explain why
   citizens who are in favour of more regional authority may support an
   apparently `paradoxical' set of policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {The left-right dimension plays a crucial role in how political
   scientists think about politics. Yet we know surprisingly little about
   the extent to which citizens are able to position themselves on a
   left-right dimension. By analysing non-response on left-right
   self-identification question from seven waves of the European Social
   Survey (N = 295,713), this study demonstrates that citizens' ability to
   position themselves on the left-right dimension depends on the political
   system they live in and its history. Citizens in countries with lower
   levels of elite polarization place themselves on a left-right dimension
   less often, this difference is partiularly pronounced for citizens with
   high levels of political interest. Citizens in countries with a recent
   authoritarian history were unable to place themselves on the left-right
   dimension more often. These findings show the importance of political
   socialization for left-right self-identification.},

Abstract = {Studies of populist parties typically focus either on discourse,
   policies, or institutional captures (e.g., constitutional reforms). Yet
   the analysis of each in isolation risks thwarting our understanding of
   populists' electoral success. Discursive practices and institutional
   captures of populist parties are not separate processes but their
   successes depend on each other. The resiliency of populist parties
   relies not only on overt but also insidious captures. Silent, gradual
   captures become effective through populist performances, deployment of
   excluded discourses and the extension of benefits to marginalized
   groups. Analysis of the recent transformation of Turkey's oldest locally
   elected representative institution, mukhtars, illustrates how populist
   policies turn nonpartisan institutions into partisan ones through
   insidious captures and deployment of religious discourse. While
   empowering some groups, expanding political discourse and access to the
   state, such practices also limit nonpartisan representation, and turn
   political questions into normative issues, exacerbating the ongoing
   polarization and authoritarian control of ruling parties.},

Abstract = {Electoral incentives affect legislators' responsiveness to voters,
   parties, and other stakeholders. Proportional representation (PR)
   electoral systems with party control over nominations foster party
   discipline and reduce legislators' responsiveness to local constituents
   when at odds with the party. Yet, even under closed-list PR regimes
   policymakers have incentives to respond to local interests who help
   advance their political careers. We illustrate this argument using
   evidence from a survey of Argentine legislators and a roll-call vote on
   a salient export tax bill. Despite the incentives created by the
   electoral regime, we find that legislators' trade-policy preferences and
   legislative behavior reflect the expected consequences of trade on local
   constituents. Our evidence suggests that catering to voters, rather than
   organized interests, are more likely to motivate legislators to defy
   their parties. These findings underscore the importance of understanding
   when and how catering to local constituents can affect politicians'
   trade policy choices.},

Abstract = {The article considers the role of Russian border controls in the context
   of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impacts on immigration and
   customs controls and on cross-border social and economic activities.
   Although in March 2020 Russian border controls proved to be
   insufficient, they still were used as one of the main tools for
   immobilizing people. The sanitary bordered order contributed to social
   exclusion of marginalized groups. Meanwhile, those who had money, access
   to decision-making, eligible immigration status, ability to make their
   voices heard, or access to advanced knowledge on travel logistics still
   had some options to move across the ``closed border.{''}},

Abstract = {Consultations are thought to increase the legitimacy of policies.
   However, this reasoning only holds if stakeholders really participate in
   the consultations. Current scholarship offers three explanations for
   participation patterns: Institutional rules, policy characteristics, and
   interest group resources determine participation. This article argues
   that additionally the linguistic complexity of consultation documents
   influences participation. Complex language deters potential
   participants, because it raises the costs of participation. A
   quantitative analysis of the German consultation of electricity grids
   lends credibility to the argument: If the description of a power line is
   simplified between two consultation rounds, the number of contributions
   mentioning that power line increases. This result contributes to our
   understanding of unequal participation patterns, and the institutional
   design of participatory procedures. If we think that legitimacy is
   enhanced by broad participation, then language of the documents matters.},

Abstract = {It is now commonly accepted that the study of well-being must
   incorporate a measure of life satisfaction. This satisfaction is studied
   here using a question asked in two surveys conducted in France in 2009
   and 2013 on the perception of inequality and feelings of justice.
   Subjective well-being then appears to be influenced by income,
   professional life-course, social mobility and relative deprivation or,
   more broadly, by comparisons with others, as well as by social and
   emotional relationships. There is also a strong correlation with
   feelings about justice in society as a whole. This association could not
   be anticipated, since in one case it is a matter of judgment about one's
   own personal life and, in the other, about society as a whole. However,
   it may be explained by theories of justice and in particular that of
   Rawls. It is in any case an explanatory dimension which cannot be
   reduced to others, even to the mere perception of inequality. For a
   better understanding of subjective well-being, it would therefore be
   advisable to take into account this relationship with feelings of social
   justice beyond all indicators conventionally used.},

Abstract = {The picture superiority effect suggests that a single photograph can
   communicate a significant amount of political information to voters.
   Accordingly, politicians must make strategic choices in their
   self-presentation, particularly when considering how to respond to
   gender-based stereotypes. Strategic stereotype theory suggests that
   politicians will either emphasize or rescind gender-based stereotypes
   depending on whether they believe them to be advantageous to their
   political image. While the literature on gendered self-presentation is
   largely confined to television advertising, there is a growing
   literature focused on the online environment. In this research note, we
   develop a methodological framework to assess gender-based stereotypes in
   a purely visual environment. We test the framework using photographs
   from the Twitter feeds of the main party leaders in the 2018 Ontario
   election. The note concludes by reflecting on the methodological
   challenges of examining gender in visual political content online.},

Abstract = {Following the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the Joint
   Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and the reimposition of
   economic sanctions, Iran witnessed public unrest that threatened the
   survival of the regime. Throughout its history, the Iranian regime has
   deployed various intricate internal and external strategies that have
   worked separately at times, and overlapped at others, to secure the
   regime against threats and guarantee its survivability. It is important
   to discover the strategies the Iranian regime has followed to survive
   the stifling crises it has faced since its establishment in 1979, in
   order to evaluate whether it will be able to survive its chronic
   economic crises. While the regime has purposely supported the
   Palestinian cause, strengthened its relations with non-state actors, and
   engaged in religious discourses on an external level, it has also
   achieved militarization and securitization, populated unelected
   governmental institutions with personnel loyal to its clerical and
   military institutions rather than qualified persons and pursued
   legitimacy renewal on an internal level.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to study how public
   opinion towards the redistributive role of the state reacts to a major
   economic shock. The pandemic and the measures taken to stop it exposed
   citizens to both increased fiscal constraint and heightened
   redistributive capacity: historical drops in GDP (and fiscal revenue)
   coincided with unprecedented increases in public spending on healthcare
   provisions and social policy, as well as staggering amounts of financial
   liquidity provided to hard-hit economic sectors. How did this affect
   citizens' attitudes towards redistribution and their assessments of the
   capacity of the state to intervene? To tackle these questions, we rely
   on a two-wave panel survey fielded in Germany, Sweden and Spain in late
   2018 and June 2020. While preferred levels of redistribution have
   remained largely stable, our results indicate major shifts and growing
   ideological polarization around perceptions of welfare state efficiency
   and capacity, fiscal constraint and political trust. Hence, the
   COVID-crisis has so far neither led to a left- nor a right-wing shift in
   citizens' desired level of state intervention, but to an increasingly
   polarized context of (re)distributive politics, which is likely to imply
   heightened conflict over economic and social policy in the future.},

Abstract = {President Trump's rhetoric casting doubt on the integrity of mail-in
   voting ignited debates about whether the federal government should be
   allowed to intervene in states' policy decisions regarding how elections
   are conducted. This study examines public opinion on rhetorical threats
   by the Trump Administration to block the expansion of states'
   vote-by-mail policies and potentially delay the November 2020 election.
   In an online survey experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to
   receive information regarding the traditional role of states in
   administering U.S. federal elections and more or less salient partisan
   cues. Even though the information treatment was successful in informing
   respondents about intergovernmental control and reducing partisan gaps
   in knowledge, it had only a modest impact on attitudes. Preferences
   about which level of government should be in charge are malleable,
   subject to partisan and context-specific considerations.},

Abstract = {In a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the
   world are dependent on voluntary support of their citizens. Based on a
   four-wave panel survey conducted in the Netherlands between April and
   July 2020 (n = 1742), this study investigates the development of
   citizens' engagement in prosocial political activities and what
   motivates such acts of political participation. With previous research
   indicating strong relationships between news as well as social media use
   and political participation, we test whether these types of information
   consumption drive participation over time. The spread of misinformation
   during the COVID-19 crisis, however, was described as an
   ``infodemic{''}. The study therefore explores how holding misinformation
   beliefs directly and indirectly affects participation in COVID-19
   related activities.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Considerable research has examined the role of sexism and vote choice,
   especially within the context of the 2016 presidential election. These
   findings are clear, consistent, and unequivocal - sexism hurt Hillary
   Clinton at the ballot box. However, the 2020 presidential primary
   provides an opportunity to examine sexism's effects on candidate
   favorability among a broader range of candidates. Using data on
   candidate favorability from the 2019 VOTER survey, I find that sexism is
   unsurprisingly predictive of lower favorability of women running for the
   Democratic nomination. However, I also find that sexism influences
   support for men running for the nomination, in a way that is
   statistically indistinguishable from its effect on support for women.
   This effect persists even among only Democratic respondents.},

Title = {When the chickens come home to roost: The long-term impact of party
   positions on religious voting},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {566-585},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite the widespread secularisation of West European societies,
   research has only found mixed evidence of a decline in the influence of
   religion on people's electoral preferences. A relatively recent line of
   inquiry has adopted a `top-down' approach to this problem, arguing that
   the impact of religion not only depends on structural social changes,
   but also on parties' convergence on moral issues. Drawing upon this
   `top-down' approach and the `impressionable years' model, this article
   argues that parties' political strategies aimed at (de-)mobilising
   social cleavages have a lasting effect on voters' party preferences.
   Using nine rounds of the European Social Survey for 19 West European
   countries, I find the impact of religiosity on voting for the
   centre-right (Conservative and Christian Democratic parties) to be
   significantly smaller for voters who were exposed during emerging
   adulthood (aged 15-25) to a centre-right party that adopted similar
   positions on moral issues to those of its main competitors. These
   findings have important implications because they highlight the role of
   generational replacement in bringing about electoral change, even when
   this is prompted by parties' strategic choices.},

Title = {What Satisfaction with Democracy? A Global Analysis of ``Satisfaction
   with Democracy{''} Measures},

Abstract = {Asking citizens ``the way democracy works{''} is the basis of a wide
   literature on the support citizens have for their political institutions
   and is one of the most common survey items in political science.
   Moreover, it is a key indicator for the purported global decline in
   legitimacy. Yet, its trends, levels, and dynamics are still debated, and
   conclusions may be erroneous. In this paper, we compile a unique global
   dataset between 1973 and 2018 encompassing all major cross-national
   datasets and national election studies in twelve countries to study the
   dynamics and consistency of ``satisfaction with democracy{''} (SWD)
   measures globally. Our results show that while trends and
   between-country differences in democratic satisfaction are largely
   similar, the levels of satisfaction vary substantially between survey
   projects, and both trends and levels vary significantly in several
   widely studied countries. We show that this has consequences at the
   individual level: opting for one survey over another may alter our
   conclusions about the relationship between key demographics and SWD.
   Thus, researchers studying SWD should endeavor to consult diverse survey
   sources and should be cautious about their conclusions when they do not,
   especially when it comes to making claims about changes in SWD over
   time.},

Title = {Ideology and succession politics in Ethiopia: autocratic leadership

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the institutionalization of politics in Africa has
   highlighted the consolidation of constitutional leadership turnover in
   electoral democracies. However, leadership turnover is not limited to
   democracies, and is increasingly also regularized in a subset of
   non-democratic regimes ruled by dominant parties. Why have some dominant
   ruling parties in Africa been able to facilitate leadership turnover
   while others have not? With evidence from a detailed case study of
   Ethiopia's leadership transitions, we argue that the historical
   persistence of ideology and its institutional expressions are important
   drivers of dominant parties' ability to manage leadership turnover. In
   Ethiopia, the ideology of ethno-national self-determination (forged in
   the 1960s) influenced political development for decades, culminating in
   the adoption of constitutional ethnic federalism and the creation of a
   ruling party alliance comprised of ethno-national parties. This
   institutional backdrop defined the contours of transitions in 2012 and
   2018. It also explains contestations over the nature of federalism in
   Ethiopia, including the outbreak of conflict in Tigray in 2020. In
   addition to highlighting the role of ideology in African politics, this
   paper brings a comparative perspective to the study of Ethiopia, a
   country that is often studied in isolation.},

Abstract = {Increasing ideological polarization and dysfunction in Congress raise
   questions about whether and how Congress remains capable of constraining
   the activities of other actors in the separation of powers system. In
   this article, I argue Congress uses nonstatutory policymaking tools to
   overcome the burdens of legislative gridlock in an increasingly
   polarized time to constrain executive branch actors. I leverage a new
   data set of committee reports issued by the House and Senate
   appropriations committees from fiscal years 1923 through 2019 to
   empirically explore these dynamics and evaluate my argument.
   Traditionally, these reports are a primary vehicle through which
   Congress directs agency policymaking in the appropriations process.
   Committees increasingly turn to them when passing legislation is most
   difficult and interbranch agency problems are most pronounced. In this
   way, nonstatutory mechanisms may help maintain the balance of power
   across branches, even when Congress faces gridlock-induced incapacity.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the findings from qualitative research into the
   electoral decision-making processes of working-class Conservative voters
   from a constituency in northern England. Through focussing specifically
   upon their primary concerns during the 2019 election, the piece expands
   upon existing quantitative research. Survey studies have highlighted
   leadership concerns and Brexit as the primary factors that have driven
   voters away from Labour and towards the Conservative Party. It is argued
   here that leadership, Brexit, and economic management were closely
   intertwined, with party leaders at the centre of broader thinking for
   these participants. Perceptions of the party leaders were foremost in
   these deliberations and this has clearly impacted upon the interviewees'
   thinking on a range of political matters. Additionally, the interviews
   asked what might influence the participants' future electoral choices.
   Here, the data suggest a sense of limited, qualified attachment to the
   Conservative Party and a desire to see the Labour Party move towards
   what the respondents perceive as a centrist ideological position. The
   final section considers what these findings may mean for the major
   parties in future electoral contests. It is suggested that the
   presidential focus has worked for Johnson so far due to his abilities as
   a communicator, but the government will have a difficult hill to climb
   in this parliament if they are to retain the loyalty of these voters in
   future.},

Abstract = {The influential World Bank Averting the old-age crisis study profoundly
   influenced pension policies around the globe, but nowhere more so than
   in Eastern Europe. While Western Europe dismissed radical carve-out
   pension privatization initiatives, Eastern European countries with
   similar Pas-As-You-Go legacies pursued World Bank reforms hoping to
   increase retirement incomes, spur economic growth, and hedge political
   risks inherent in public systems. However, 25 years later, reversals are
   taking place in all reforming countries, ranging from outright
   dismantling of mandatory private pension funds to their scaling-down and
   moving to voluntary participation. Empirical evidence presented in this
   article suggests that carve-out privatization failed to accelerate
   economic growth, while private pension funds turned out to be
   dynamically inefficient and inferior to PAYG systems they were intended
   to replace. We argue that the carve-out approach is the root cause of
   inherent economic and fiscal tension between public and private pension
   pillars. We identify a minimum set of Pareto improving reform
   adjustments that address the most pressing sources of economic
   inefficiencies and political instability by undoing the carve-out
   financing. The suggested re-reforms would be a first step in enabling
   private pension funds in Eastern Europe to become a meaningful
   supplement to existing PAYG benefits, in line with typical pension
   practices in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {Much of the revived interest in new - populist and/or authoritarian -
   styles of leadership - has been a response to developments, initially in
   Europe, from the late1980s on, one aspect of which has been a renewed
   interest in charisma and in plebiscitary leadership. How applicable are
   approaches to leadership developed primarily in European political
   science and sociology to contemporary South and Southeast Asia? Building
   both on Weber's classical account of charismatic authority, and on more
   recent work, we propose a relational conception of charisma as an
   interaction between leader and followers. This leader-follower dialectic
   is a key characteristic of contemporary populist politics. In order to
   investigate the ways in which populist leaders appeal to followers, we
   apply this relational conception of charisma to two Asian national
   cases: India under Narendra Modi and Myanmar under Aung San Suu Kyi
   during the - now arrested - period of transition from military rule. We
   shall be primarily concerned with one specific form of charisma:
   plebiscitary leadership.},

Title = {The dilemma of Brexit: hard choices in the narrow context of British
   foreign policy traditions},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {170-186},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Brexit threatens to disrupt the fabric of British foreign policy
   thinking. For decades, policymakers identified membership of the
   European Community as one of two pillars of British influence (the other
   being the `Special Relationship' with the United States). Together, they
   allowed Britain to exercise power on a global as well as regional scale.
   These assumptions were repeated so often that the UK was regularly
   criticised for lacking policy imagination and avoiding hard choices when
   the interests of Europe and the United States conflicted. Brexit
   presents an unavoidable dilemma for policymakers as they chart a new
   course for British foreign policy. Interpretivism, as set out by Bevir
   and Rhodes (2003), offers a route to understanding how actors interpret
   and respond to such dilemmas, via reference to traditions. This article
   uses their approach to examine the expression of beliefs about Brexit
   and British foreign policy. In particular, it focuses on two datasets,
   one a `control sample' of commentary since 2016, the other, the
   parliamentary debates on the first EU Withdrawal Bill in December 2018
   and January 2019. We find a contrasting willingness to evoke traditions
   in a substantive fashion to understand and justify political choices. In
   particular, parliamentarians utilise one particular tradition,
   pragmatism, to marginalise the expression of abstract belief. In the
   process, they reduce discussion to a technocratic exercise that is
   unable to manage the conflicts Brexit has brought about. Meanwhile,
   those MPs that are most creative in their expression of traditions tend
   to be from smaller regional parties or on the political periphery. The
   resulting deadlock is evidence of the importance of traditions to
   interpreting and managing dilemmas of social change.},

Abstract = {Theoretically, political ambitions paired with elections generate more
   responsive elected officials. In this paper, we test whether the
   progressive political ambitions of public officials affect whether and
   how they respond to their constituents by conducting a experimental
   audit study where local public officials receive both an electorally
   related service request and a generic service request. We combine their
   responses (or non-responses) with data from a survey of these public
   officials conducted months prior about their political ambition in
   seeking higher office. On the whole, we find that politically ambitious
   officials are not more responsive to electorally oriented service
   requests and that there are not systematic differences in the content of
   the responses of ambitious and non-ambitious elected officials. In areas
   of constituency service, ambition does not seem to affect
   representational behavior, regardless of whether the service requests
   are electorally related or not.},

Abstract = {Over the last fifty years, eighteen regional assemblies in Europe have
   debated the extension of voting rights to foreign residents. Yet only
   Scotland and the Swiss cantons of Neuchatel and Jura have adopted such
   legislation. What explains this variation? Through a comparison of
   debates that have taken place in Italy and Switzerland, I show that
   multilevel governance expands access to policymaking, but also
   multiplies veto points in the system. As a result, attempts by regional
   assemblies to directly give voting rights to foreign residents are
   generally doomed to fail. At the same time, multilevel governance can be
   used as a strategy to indirectly shape the political inclusion of
   different groups. Even if they are unsuccessful in giving the right to
   vote to foreign residents, these discussions can lead to broader reforms
   of political rights at the national level.},

Title = {Police-Generated Killings: The Gap between Ethics and Law},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {366-378},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article offers a normative analysis of some of the most
   controversial incidents involving police-what I call police-generated
   killings. In these cases, bad police tactics create a situation where
   deadly force becomes necessary, becomes perceived as necessary, or
   occurs unintentionally. Police deserve blame for such killings because
   they choose tactics that unnecessarily raise the risk of deadly force,
   thus violating their obligation to prioritize the protection of life.
   Since current law in the United States fails to ban many bad tactics,
   police-generated killings often are treated as ``lawful but awful.{''}
   To address these killings, some call on changes to departmental policies
   or voluntary reparations by local governments, yet such measures leave
   in place a troubling gap between ethics and law. I argue that
   police-generated killings merit legal sanctions by appealing to a
   relevant analogy: self-generated self-defense, where the person who
   engages in self-defense started the trouble. The persistent lack of
   accountability for police-generated killings threatens life, police
   legitimacy, and trust in democratic institutions. The article closes by
   identifying tools in law and policy to address this challenge.},

Title = {Why does the European Right accommodate backsliding states? An analysis
   of 24 European People's Party votes (2011-2019)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, the EU's fundamental values have been under threat
   at the national level, in particular among several Central and Eastern
   European states that joined the EU since 2004. During this time, the
   European People's Party (EPP) has been criticized for its unwillingness
   to vote for measures that would sanction the Hungarian Fidesz
   government, one of its members, in breach of key democratic principles
   since 2010. In this paper, we seek to understand how cohesive the EPP
   group has been on fundamental values-related votes, how the position of
   EPP MEPs on these issues has evolved over time, and what explains
   intra-EPP disagreement on whether to accommodate fundamental values
   violators within the EU. To address these questions, we analyse the
   votes of EPP MEPs across 24 resolutions on the protection of EU
   fundamental values between 2011 and 2019. Our findings reveal
   below-average EPP cohesion on these votes, and a sharp increase in the
   tendency of EPP MEPs to support these resolutions over time. A number of
   factors explain the disagreements we find. While the EPP's desire to
   maintain Fidesz within its ranks is central, this explanation does not
   offer a comprehensive account of the group's accommodative behaviour. In
   particular, we find that ideological factors as well as the strategic
   interests of national governments at the EU level are central to
   understanding the positions of EPP MEPs, as well as the evolution of
   these positions over time. These results further our understanding of
   the nature of the obstacles to EU sanctions in fundamental values abuse
   cases, and the role of partisanship in fuelling EU inaction especially.},

Abstract = {Numerous scholars have contributed to the police culture body of
   knowledge (Cockcroft 2013; O'Neill, Marks \& Singh 2007; Sklansky 2005).
   They submit that the traditional understanding of police culture is no
   longer relevant due to the new developments that have transpired in
   policing, which have consequently changed the police culture. More
   specifically, they suggest that the South African Police Service (SAPS)
   too has witnessed changes in the traits of its police culture that
   accentuate the cynicism of and isolation from the public. This article
   is an attempt to challenge this narrative by comparing the police
   culture themes of solidarity, isolation, and cynicism attitudes of two
   different cohorts of new South African Police Service (SAPS) recruits
   separated by ten years. By making use of the 30-item police culture
   themes of solidarity, isolation, and cynicism questionnaire, designed by
   Steyn (2005), the article establishes that a representative sample (138
   out of a population of 140) of new SAPS recruits from the SAPS
   Chatsworth Basic Training Institute (August 2015), have remarkably
   similar attitudes in support of police culture themes of solidarity,
   isolation, and cynicism, compared to a representative sample of all new
   SAPS recruits that started their basic training in January 2005 (Steyn,
   2005). Although small in representation, the study refutes the claims
   that traditional understandings of police culture are no longer relevant
   and that the traits of the police culture in the South African Police
   Service (SAPS) has so changed that it accentuates the cynicism of and
   isolation from the public.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze Judith Butler's critique of Hannah Arendt.
   Butler claims that the strict distinction between private space and
   public space in Arendt's work results in the negation of the body in
   politics. This distinction prevents the analysis of demonstrations,
   protests, and occupation of public space as contemporary forms of doing
   politics, since it denies the fact that the bodies in the streets are
   carrying out a specific performative, in which they speak politically
   through their resistance and persistence in the public space. We will
   try to show that the limitations Butler observes in Arendt's thought
   actually respond to her interest in recovering the true political
   meaning of freedom in a post-totalitarian world.},

Abstract = {Does EU funding improve local state capacity? We focus on two specific
   types of state capacity, namely (a) the ability to provide information
   to third parties and (b) to discriminate between different kinds of
   inquiries. Because the EU's structural funds are distributed through a
   competitive mechanism and incentivize expansions in administrative
   personnel, our theory predicts that high levels of EU funding bring
   about a higher bureaucratic capacity equilibrium. Empirically, we
   analyze the effect of structural funds on local government capacity in
   the largest recipient country: post-communist Poland. Through a
   randomized survey with more than 2400 municipal administrations, we find
   that administrations that have benefited more from EU funding, have
   developed higher levels of discrimination capacity. Yet we find no
   evidence for higher information provision capacity.},

Abstract = {Crises brought about by COVID-19 have provided us with a key set of
   observations about global power in an era where international relations
   scholars are close to coming to a consensus in acknowledging the decline
   of Western and specifically American hegemony. This paper adopts a
   decolonial approach to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on
   international politics. It argues that throughout much of the Western
   world, COVID-19 has marked one of the first unexpected encounters with
   death that populations have faced since World War II and the
   pre-poliomyelitis vaccine era. As a result, global health policies
   mandated by the WHO have been articulated in favour of the West.
   Statistical analysis of death tolls brought about by COVID-19, numerous
   other infectious diseases and viruses along with associated geographic
   patterns reveal that quarantine and lockdown policies were carried out
   at the expense and wellbeing of much of the developing world. Contrary
   to popular contemporary arguments that contend the international liberal
   order is in decline, the emergence of COVID-19 and subsequent global
   health policy responses have demonstrated that Western hegemony and soft
   power are still salient.},

Abstract = {Although labor policy shapes and molds working conditions and the
   treatment of workers, and non-citizen Latinos are disproportionately
   exposed to poor working conditions, research on the relationship between
   the two - labor policy attitudes of non-citizen Latinos - remains
   scarce. This study draws on a dataset with an atypically large sample of
   both citizens and non-citizens and key indicators of labor policy to
   examine views of labor policy. The findings indicate that non-citizen
   Latinos are strongly supportive of labor policy that would make it
   easier to form labor unions and hold positive views of labor unions. The
   results extend our understanding of labor policy and the relationship
   between citizenship in the US. and support for labor unions -
   institutions that strengthen workers' rights, reduce inequality, and
   improve working conditions.},

Abstract = {If nonviolent methods of resistance are effective - and perhaps even
   more successful than violent methods - why do opposition movements ever
   resort to violence? The literature on social movement and nonviolent
   resistance implies that expansion in an opposition movement's size
   decreases the risk of violent dissent since successful recruitments
   improve the movement's relative power and reduce the necessity of using
   violence to pressure the state. Nevertheless, a sudden and large
   expansion in movement size can overburden its organizational capacities
   and thus increase the risk of violent dissent. Therefore, this study
   contends while a gradual expansion in the size of the movement decreases
   the likelihood of violent dissent, a sudden and large expansion in its
   size raises the risk of violence. These theoretical arguments are
   evaluated empirically using Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and
   Outcomes 2.1 and Mass Demonstrations and Mass Violent Events in the
   Former USSR datasets. The analysis of these datasets across several
   regression models supports the developed theoretical arguments.},

Abstract = {The Sardines ``movement{''} emerged in the fall of 2019, giving itself
   mainly the purpose of countering the possible assertion of the
   right-wingers in the regional elections of 2020. The political discourse
   developed by this mobilization was characterized in an anti-populist and
   anti-fascist sense. The anti-populist register constituted the main mode
   of self-representation of Sardines. The political discourse of this
   mobilization is thus presented as, in some ways unprecedented, for an
   extra-institutional actor. The article addresses the following issues:
   a) the formal adequacy of the category of ``social movement{''} to
   define Sardines; b) their constitution and development from November
   2019 to November 2020; c) the key elements of their political discourse;
   d) the change in strategies and repertoires following the onset of the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Transitions from authoritarianism and breakdowns of democracy have long
   been central puzzles for scholars of Latin American politics. Because
   structural explanations have proved to be weak, recent work has
   emphasised political agency. This strand of research is promising, but
   major questions remain unanswered: Who are the key actors driving regime
   change? How do their individual preferences affect transitions and
   breakdowns? This article focuses on three central members of the
   political elite: presidents, opposition leaders, and military
   commanders. These actors develop unique preferences about regimes and
   unique degrees of radicalism regarding their preferred policies; in
   turn, these preferences and radicalism affect the probabilities of
   regime change. Testing the argument in 20 nations between 1945 and 2010,
   we find that an average measure of preferences masks crucial
   distinctions in the chain of regime change. Transitions to a competitive
   regime are more likely when autocrats have low intrinsic commitments to
   dictatorship. The survival of democracies hinges on whether top military
   officials develop pro-democratic preferences. The role of executive
   preferences, by contrast, is moderated by the attachments and radicalism
   of opposition leaders. Next, we examine how structural contexts shape
   both preferences and political outcomes, finding that economic
   development shapes both the emergence of preferences and radicalism and
   their impacts on regime change. Our findings improve the validity of
   political agency theories and reconcile the roles of actors with the
   environments in which regimes emerge and fall.},

Abstract = {The newspaper Noticias sobre todo lo que pasa en el mundo (from now on,
   Noticias) constitutes a piece of journalistic analysis of vital
   importance for the approach of the Argentine left in the 1970s. Linked
   to the Montoneros guerrilla movement, it constituted a profuse periodic
   initiative, successful and of great relevance characterized by a staff
   of renowned intellectual and political personalities in national life.
   We specifically propose an analysis of the debates that were opened in
   said publication around the 1973 oil crisis, which occupied a large
   space on its pages, as well as its national incidence. For this, an
   analysis has been reconstructed on the economic ideas of Montoneros, the
   importance of its main references in the economic field, the
   characteristics of said publication and examined the available numbers.
   We have found that Noticias gave great importance to the debates around
   the oil crisis and that these involved important aspects of its
   politicaleconomic conceptions around vital issues such as international
   relations, the role of the State, the place of companies and the
   village.},

Title = {When Revolutions End: The Latin American Experience of the 20th Century},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although the revolutions have achieved sufficient visibility in the
   social sciences to be benefited from a significant theoretical
   production, the same is not true of the post-revolutionag moments in
   which the alliances and social pacts inheriting the revolutions are
   consolidated. This article tries to discuss those moments and for this
   it divides its argument into three parts. The first is an attempt to
   reach a conceptual definition of both the term revolution and
   post-revolution. In the second part, these processes are analyzed in the
   two most significant revolutionary experiences in Latin America in the
   20th century: Mexico and Cuba. Finally, in its conclusions, the article
   advances some ideas for future studies on the subject, in the light of
   the new paths of the Latin American opposition movements.},

   scientists-from department heads to graduate students based at public
   and private universities in the United States and abroad. Many of them
   contributed to a newly published volume, Stories from the Field: A Guide
   to Navigating Fieldwork in Political Science (Krause and Szekely 2020).
   As in the book, these contributors draw on their years of experience in
   the field to identify the unique ethical and logistical challenges posed
   by COVID-19 and offer suggestions for how to adjust and continue
   research in the face of the pandemic's disruptions. Key themes include
   how contingency planning must now be a central part of our research
   designs; how cyberspace has increasingly become ``the field{''} for the
   time being; and how scholars can build lasting, mutually beneficial
   partnerships with ``field citizens,{''} now and in the future.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Does the importance of the economy change during a government's time in
   office? Governments arguably become more responsible for current
   economic conditions as their tenure progresses. This might lead voters
   to hold experienced governments more accountable for economic
   conditions. However, voters also accumulate information about
   governments' competence over time. If voters are Bayesian learners, then
   this growing stock of information should crowd out the importance of
   current economic conditions. This article explores these divergent
   predictions about the relationship between tenure and the economic vote
   using three datasets. First, using country-level data from a diverse set
   of elections, the study finds that support for more experienced
   governments is less dependent on economic growth. Secondly, using
   individual-level data from sixty election surveys covering ten
   countries, the article shows that voters' perceptions of the economy
   have a greater impact on government support when the government is
   inexperienced. Finally, the article examines a municipal reform in
   Denmark that assigned some voters to new local incumbents and finds that
   these voters responded more strongly to the local economy. In
   conclusion, all three studies point in the same direction: economic
   voting decreases with time in office.},

Abstract = {Candidates with STEM backgrounds ran for Congress in record numbers in
   2018. Understanding who participates in this form of ``mobilized
   science,{''} and whether they are successful, is important because these
   candidates may campaign-and ultimately take action-to advance
   science-informed policies. However, whereas there is ample journalistic
   coverage of individual candidates, few scholars have studied them
   collectively. I constructed a novel dataset that allowed me to
   descriptively profile almost 200 STEM candidates who ran in 2018 and to
   explore correlates of their electoral success. I find that three
   quarters of the candidates were first-time congressional candidates,
   most of whom were Democrats and men. Democratic incumbents and
   candidates endorsed by the 314 PAC were significantly more likely to
   advance to the general election. I also find that women Democrats with
   STEM backgrounds are as likely (and perhaps more likely) to advance to
   the general election. I conclude by discussing how these findings
   advance the study of mobilized science in an increasingly partisan era.},

Abstract = {The use of big data by tax administrations, together with that of
   artificial intelligence tools, has an enormous importance in the current
   application of taxes, with clear legal consequences both for the rights
   and guarantees of taxed parties and for public finance practice. Tax
   administrations employ big data and artificial intelligence, in addition
   to other cases, in the selection of taxpayers in order to introduce a
   tax inspection procedure, predictive risk models for taxpayer
   non-payment, virtual assistants, the drawing up of tax returns,
   automatic administrative practice and automatic administrative
   resolutions. The use of these technological tools must be characterised
   by a strict observance of the legal principles which regulate the
   application of the taxes, and must respect the rights and guarantees of
   the taxpayer.},

Title = {The limits of the attractiveness premium in elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The literature on looks and politics suggests that, at least in
   personalistic electoral systems, physical attractiveness helps
   candidates that are more attractive. We test this assumption using the
   unlikely case of Quebec, where provincial elections are highly salient,
   characterized by a strong cleavage, a sophisticated electorate and
   strong party-and leader-centeredness. Evaluating the effect of physical
   attractiveness on vote shares for nearly 5500 candidates in a
   multivariate analysis for four elections (i.e. 2008, 2012, 2014 and
   2018), we find that physical attractiveness plays no role in determining
   candidates? vote shares. This applies for candidates? attractiveness
   score, as well as their attractiveness ranking relative to other
   candidates. For theory, this finding suggests that the effect of
   attractiveness on candidates? electoral fortunes in winner takes all
   systems is contingent on other factors such as the existence of
   cleavages and the candidate-or party centeredness of the party system.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a reality TV series, Sweden's best employment
   service, broad-cast on Swedish public service television in 2018. The
   purpose was to investigate ongoing political transformations in the
   Swedish welfare model. The series focuses not only on unemployment, the
   unemployed and their life situation but more specifically on the
   organisation of the Swedish Public Employment Service (PES) as reflected
   at a local PES office. Informed by a cultural studies approach to the
   politics of popular culture, the aim of this article is to examine how
   the makeover is staged in the series. The article focuses on how the
   unemployed are positioned in the series in a setting of organisational
   change initiated at the local PES office. The analysis provides insights
   into how the makeover is staged and initiated in reality TV and
   illustrates how the unemployed are positioned as willing and able to
   work and to actively seek opportunities. The unemployed are not the
   primary target for the makeover in the series. The makeover is primarily
   directed at the organisation of the PES and its managers. Consequently,
   unemployment is presented in the series as not only a concern for the
   individual citizen but also for society.

Abstract = {This article analyses how the infrastructural architecture of social
   networking sites (SNS) is conducive to the emergence of religious
   subjects and digital collectivities. I argue that SNS enable social
   connections, and subjectivities are created to reify discriminatory
   religious and political practices and discourses online. This study
   identifies and responds to three critical arguments about SNS and
   religious subjectivities. First, it challenges the liberal assumptions
   that advancement in SNS will lead to the creation of depoliticized and
   more rational societies. I argue that SNS deepens the already existing
   social segregations in the society through the creation of digital
   collectivities. Digital collectivities inform functional possibilities
   (ontology) and discursive modes (epistemology) of enacting religious
   subjectivities. These collectivities not only shape the ways in which
   users articulate their religious and political allegiance but also the
   content of their online presence. Finally, in unpacking the formation
   and existence of digital collectivities and how they are linked with the
   emergence of religious subjects, I examine the question of digital
   ontology-the debate regarding what a religious subject on SNS is and of
   epistemology-how is a religious subject defined.},

Abstract = {Research on invalid voting has expanded over the past few years.
   Scholars largely agree on the most important determinants of invalid
   voting, foremost compulsory voting, quality of democracy, and ballot
   structure. However, disagreement prevails concerning several factors;
   more exactly, whether the effect is positive or negative. We examine
   determinants of invalid voting in the four most recent local elections
   in a single country, Sweden, all municipalities included. Applying a
   subnational research design allows us to control for several
   determinants that have been reported to be of significance in explaining
   varying levels of invalid voting, and, consequently, to examine factors
   with theoretically contradictory directions of effects. Two theoretical
   models of invalid voting are tested, an institutional and a societal
   model, each consisting of four variables. The latter explains
   considerably more of the variation in the dependent variable than the
   former. The most important determinant is education: higher levels of
   education among the population decrease the share of invalid votes.
   Concerning the institutional model, only district magnitude
   significantly affects the dependent variable, indicating that larger
   district magnitude depresses invalid voting. However, the effect
   disappears when societal variables are included, due to higher levels of
   education among the population in municipalities with high district
   magnitudes. Proportion of the electorate born abroad also significantly
   affects levels of invalid voting; higher proportions decrease invalid
   voting. We suggest that this is a consequence of political
   sophistication, interest, and being politically informed combined with
   who decides to vote and who decides to abstain amongst immigrants.},

Abstract = {In a panel study where one survey was conducted immediately after a
   terrorist attack in central Stockholm, with over 20,000 participants, we
   examine the possibility that first-hand experiences with terror
   increases effects compared to people located elsewhere in Sweden. We use
   matching and as-if random variation in our data to identify the effect
   of personal proximity. While we find that people close to the attack
   perceived themselves as more affected, attesting to the vividness of the
   experience, we find no evidence of stronger rally effects, greater
   outgroup dislike, preferences for security policies or emotional
   effects. The results challenge previous theories on public opinion
   change in the aftermath of vivid events. In line with prior research,
   however, the results indicate that public opinion among people across
   Sweden did change on a range of issues. These general effects occurred
   uniformly, regardless of geographic location in the country.},

Abstract = {This article investigates opposition to the competitive authoritarian
   regimes in Montenegro (1997-2020), North Macedonia (2006-2017), and
   Serbia (2012-). In each of the three countries, opposition parties face
   or have faced the challenge of competing on an electoral playing field
   that is structurally skewed in favour of the incumbent. The articles
   explore the question in which circumstances opposition parties have been
   able to contest the dominant parties. In doing so, it focuses on three
   dimensions, namely the relationship between spatial party competition,
   different levels of opposition cohesion or fragmentation, as well as
   extra-institutional strategies of contestation. The country comparison
   illustrates that party systems with cross-cutting cleavages tend to
   produce divided patterns of contestation (Montenegro and Serbia),
   whereas reinforcing cleavages facilitate the coordination among
   different types of opposition actors (North Macedonia). Finally, large
   protests, rather than boycotts, prior to elections have been important
   factors in facilitating opposition cohesion and signalling broad support
   (Montenegro and North Macedonia).},

Abstract = {The recent surge of global populism has led many intellectuals to call
   for new forms of democratic elitism. Yet research into the sources of
   support for political organizations and regimes predicts that
   suppressing opportunities for public participation will likely
   exacerbate antisystem political tendencies. We cite the recent protests
   in Chile, a nation that has employed democratic elitism more effectively
   than perhaps any other, as illustrative of the eventual consequences of
   suppressing voice. Our research indicates that empowering citizens
   through vibrant parties and continuous democracy is the best way to
   avoid populist impulses and waves of contentious politics.},

Abstract = {Extensive political communication research shows that people respond
   differently to the same policy problem depending on how it is portrayed,
   or ``framed.{''} Specifically, Iyengar {[}1991]. Is Anyone Responsible?
   How Television Frames Political Issues. Chicago, IL: Chicago University
   Press] finds that when news coverage about a policy issue is framed
   episodically, citizens tend to attribute responsibility to the
   individual, whereas when news is framed thematically, they attribute
   responsibility to government/society. But how might these framing
   effects be conditioned by the identity of the individual/group portrayed
   in the news? Here we examine whether episodic vs. thematic framing
   effects vary when the target population is ``Muslim American,{''}
   compared to ``American.{''} We do so both in the context of poverty
   (following Iyengar's original study) and also in a context where the
   difference between ``Americans{''} and ``Muslim Americans{''} might
   prove especially salient: religious radicalism. Using data from an
   online survey experiment (N = 1655), we find that participants treat
   both groups similarly and in line with episodic vs. thematic framing
   effects when the issue is poverty. But in the case of religious
   radicalism, framing effects disappear. Instead, participants
   consistently attribute responsibility to the people who radicalize
   rather than to government/society. Yet importantly, the substance of
   these individual-level explanations is significantly more likely to
   involve religion when the person portrayed is Muslim American.},

Abstract = {This article responds to Lowe and Pemberton's second volume on the
   history of the civil service and analyses fundamental shifts in British
   governance at the centre that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. The
   traditional `public service bargain' (PSB) that underpinned the
   relationship between ministers and officials has been repeatedly
   undermined. The article examines how far prior civil service reforms
   relate to the changes of the contemporary era instigated by
   Conservative-led governments since 2010. As Lowe and Pemberton's work
   illustrates, the impulse to reform the state and the managerial reforms
   it unleashed were long in the making. Their legacy can be traced to the
   emergence of Thatcherism after 1979. The core argument of the article is
   that the more recent efforts of the Johnson administration to transform
   the state and undermine the PBS were scarcely original. Rather, they
   consolidated and drew upon earlier initiatives.},

   Withdrawals from International Institutions},

Abstract = {This article examines the systemic implications of the growing popular
   backlash against international cooperation and analyzes how
   voter-endorsed attempts to withdraw from international institutions
   reverberate abroad. Observing other countries' disintegration
   experiences allows voters to better assess the feasibility and
   desirability of such withdrawals. More positive withdrawal experiences
   encourage exit-support abroad, whereas negative experiences are likely
   to have a deterring effect. These contagion effects will be conditioned
   by the availability of information and voters' willingness to learn. The
   article empirically examines this argument for the case of Brexit. It
   leverages original survey data from 58,959 EU-27 Europeans collected in
   six survey waves during the Brexit withdrawal negotiations and from a
   two-wave survey of 2,241 Swiss voters conducted around the first Brexit
   extension in spring 2019. It finds both encouragement and deterrence
   effects, which are bigger when respondents pay attention to Brexit and
   are dampened by motivated reasoning.},

Abstract = {Even though Prime Ministers (PMs) are the central actors in
   parliamentary democracies, little comparative research explores what
   makes them perform successfully in office. This article investigates how
   the political careers of PMs affect their performance. For this purpose,
   we make use of a unique expert survey covering 131 cabinets in 11
   Central and Eastern European countries between 1990 and 2018.
   Performance is defined as a two-dimensional set of tasks PMs ought to
   fulfill: first, managing the cabinet and directing domestic affairs as
   tasks delegated to their office, second, ensuring support of parliament
   and their own party, who constitute the direct principals. The findings
   indicate that a simple political insider career is not sufficient to
   enhance prime-ministerial performance. Rather, PMs who served as party
   leaders have the best preconditions to succeed in office.},

Abstract = {Recent accounts of democratic backsliding are negligent about the
   cultural foundations of autocracy-vs-democracy. To bring culture back
   in, I demonstrate that (1) the countries' membership in culture zones
   explains some 70\% of the global variation in autocracy-vs-democracy and
   (2) that this culture-bound variation has remained astoundingly constant
   over time - in spite of all the trending patterns in the global
   distribution of regime types over the last 120 years. Furthermore, the
   explanatory power of culture zones over autocracy-vs-democracy roots in
   the cultures' differentiation on ``authoritarian-vs-emancipative
   values.{''} Against this backdrop, lasting regime turnovers happen as a
   corrective response to glacially accruing regime-culture misfits -
   driven by generational value shifts into a pre-dominantly emancipatory
   direction. Consequently, the backsliding of democracies into
   authoritarianism is limited to societies in which emancipative values
   remain under-developed. Contrary to the widely cited
   deconsolidation-thesis, the prevalent generational profile in people's
   moral orientations exhibits an almost ubiquitous ascension of
   emancipative values that will lend more, not less, legitimacy to
   democracy in the future.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses Habermas's argument that justice requires
   solidarity as its `reverse side', whereby the former provides the
   necessary global framework for establishing intersubjective solidarity
   whilst the latter constitutes an important precondition for igniting
   social and political change in the direction of social justice. In this
   paper I argue that such a paradigm of reciprocity might be fruitfully
   complemented by a less apparent yet substantial nexus: that between
   solidarity and perceived injustice, which I contend also triggers the
   emergence of solidarity. Drawing from Arendt's thematisation of
   solidarity as a principle that stems from human suffering and recent
   scholarship on transitional post-conflict justice, I analyse the
   negative and reactive aspect of solidarity and the role of negative
   emotions in its emergence.},

Abstract = {Russia's 2020 Constitutional reform was notable not just for the
   substantial institutional changes introduced, but also for the almost
   complete lack of public discussion of those changes in elite debates or
   the public campaign for the nationwide vote. Instead, proposals to write
   social and patriotic issues into the Constitution absorbed the lion's
   share of coverage. These issues were not superfluous, but rather reveal
   the dynamics of patriotic legitimation and the role of everyday
   patriotism in Russian politics today. Among Russia's elite, patriotic
   legitimation regulates competition, determines the boundaries of
   acceptable public politics, and provides access to regime patronage. For
   the public, the avoidance of politics and the appropriation of Russians'
   everyday patriotism facilitated the mobilization of an apolitical
   electorate in the nationwide vote. While the reform may have
   strengthened the institutional basis of Putin's rule, it potentially
   limits the regime's adaptability and could affect its long-term
   survivability.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between malapportionment and
   blatant electoral fraud. Although blatant electoral fraud enables
   incumbents to win elections, it may undermine legitimacy and provoke
   protests. Malapportionment also helps the incumbent succeed by assigning
   larger portions of seats to party strongholds, yet its key features
   differ from electoral fraud. Because malapportionment neither involves
   coercion nor overt fraud, it is less likely to be followed by
   reactionary protests. But, it is an inflexible electioneering strategy,
   because reapportionment leads to difficult coordination problems among
   ruling legislators. Cross-national statistical analyses of 98 countries
   (1993-2012) show that, although malapportionment does not affect whether
   leaders use election violence and electoral cheating, political leaders
   become less dependent upon the simultaneous use of these fraudulent
   strategies when high levels of malapportionment are already endowed. The
   results suggest that although governments might continue to use specific
   types of blatant electoral fraud even when the levels of
   malapportionment are high, malapportionment allows governments to be
   more selective with combining different methods of blatant electoral
   fraud.},

Abstract = {The People's Republic of China (PRC) has irrefutably reached `great
   power' status. As a consequence, most studies argue that it has adopted
   a revisionist posture towards the US-led international order. However,
   this image tells us little about Beijing's revisionist strategy,
   particularly whether it is revolutionary or incremental and what this
   implies in terms of actual policies. The current article posits that the
   PRC is behaving as an incremental revisionist and aims at tracing its
   modes. To verify this hypothesis, the analysis focuses on Beijing's
   policies towards its regional security order. In this light, it
   diachronically compares post-Cold War China (1989-2019) with the
   paradigmatic case of a revolutionary revisionist in the Indo-Pacific
   region: Showa Japan in the Interwar period (1926-1941). The findings
   offer a helpful contribution to the literature, providing the foundation
   for a more nuanced theoretical definition of incremental revisionism.},

Abstract = {Funding for legislative staff represents a valuable commodity to
   legislators. However it is a resource distributed to separate internal
   organizations. Previous studies show strong correlations between a
   legislator's available institutional power and the benefits of having
   access to more staffing resources. Therefore, all individual
   legislators, committee chairs, and party leaders face incentives to
   direct a larger share of the Senate's budget. However, we argue the
   Senate approaches staff allocations for each organization by giving
   attention to the previous workload of the chamber and resources
   allocated to other offices in the same bill. Using newly collected data
   on staff resource allocations between 1885 and 2018, we observe that the
   Senate's internal organizations do not undermine each other, and that
   allocation decisions benefit each area separately. Results of a time
   series model show that increasing allocations for a staff area actually
   promotes greater allocations for other areas rather than undermining
   them, and that changes in membership and eras shape how senators
   collectively choose to allocate staff resources.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of local participatory democracy
   initiatives on individual voter turnout in ordinary elections, using the
   example of participatory budgeting (PB). Such initiatives often aspire
   to create more activated citizens, but there is still limited empirical
   research validating these claims. We link participants in New York
   City's participatory budgeting process to their state voter file records
   to test whether PB increases participants' likelihood of voting in
   regular elections. We use coarsened exact matching to identify similar
   voters from council districts where PB was not implemented. Comparing PB
   voters to similar individuals who were not exposed to PB, we find that
   engaging with participatory budgeting increased individuals' probability
   of voting by an average of 8.4 percentage points. In addition, we find
   that these effects are greater for those who often have lower
   probabilities of voting-young people, lower educated and lower income
   voters, black voters, and people who are the minority race of their
   neighborhood.},

Abstract = {Because of the COVID-19 threat to in-person voting in the November 2020
   election, state and local election officials have pivoted to mail-in
   voting as a potential solution. This method of voting-while safe from a
   public health standpoint-comes with its own set of problems, as
   increased use of mail voting risks amplifying existing discrepancies in
   rejected mail ballots. While some mail ballot rejections are to be
   expected, a lack of uniformity in whose ballots get rejected among
   subgroups of voters-whether for mistakes on a ballot return envelope
   (BRE) or lateness-raise concerns about equal representation. We draw on
   official statewide voter file and mail-in ballot data from the 2018
   midterm election in Georgia, a state that until the pandemic did not
   have widespread use of mail voting, to test whether some voters are more
   likely to cast a mail ballot that does not count. Most importantly, we
   distinguish between ballots rejected for lateness and those rejected for
   a mistake on the return envelope. We find that newly registered, young,
   and minority voters have higher rejection rates compared with their
   counterparts.},

Abstract = {`Spillover democratisation' is an ongoing process. It envisages that
   democratic values, institutions and practices continue to spread and
   evolve through various pathways - horizontal, geographical and vertical.
   Yet, possibilities also remain that anti-democracy forces may thwart the
   process. In Middle East and North Africa (MENA), social and economic
   rights were not accompanied by civil and political rights. The Arab
   Spring was a response to this gap: it raised the optimism of achieving
   democratisation in the MENA region, through geographical and horizontal
   pathways. However, the promise remains largely elusive at present;
   rather, we witness the cementing of existing anti-democratic forces.
   Yet, citizens' innate support for democracy, sporadic pro-democracy
   activism and rising consumerism sustain the democratising potentials of
   the Arab Spring.},

Abstract = {How does an individual's criminal record shape interactions with the
   state and society? This article presents evidence from a nationwide
   field experiment in the United States, which shows that prospective
   applicants with criminal records are about 5 percentage points less
   likely to receive information from college admission offices. However,
   this bias does not extend to race: there is no difference in response
   rates to Black and White applicants. The authors further show that bias
   is all but absent in public bureaucracies, as discrimination against
   formerly incarcerated applicants is driven by private schools. Examining
   why bias is stronger for private colleges, the study demonstrates that
   the private-public difference persists even after accounting for college
   selectivity, socio-economic composition and school finances. Moving
   beyond the measurement of bias, an intervention designed to reduce
   discrimination is evaluated: whether an email from an advocate mitigates
   bias associated with a criminal record. No evidence is found that
   advocate endorsements decrease bureaucratic bias.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes long-term effects of changes in external conditions
   on the support for populist parties in the Czech Republic. The results
   confirmed importance of political dissatisfaction for the rise of
   populist parties but are limited by the presence of other protest
   parties. While the evidence of the effects of the economic context is
   mixed, results of our analysis indicate the importance of time and of
   election campaigns in particular. All in all, our results point to the
   importance of the campaign dynamics, the party system setting, and
   incumbency in assessing support for populist parties in Central Europe
   and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {How does the minority status of a government influence cabinet duration?
   This article analyzes the influence of minority status on cabinet
   duration by differentiating between different types of minority
   governments. Minority governments are not in general less stable than
   majority ones but different types of minority governments have different
   effects on cabinet duration. The main theoretical argument is that
   substantive minority governments without support agreements are less
   stable than majority governments, while contract minority governments
   that rely on written support agreements with non-cabinet parties which
   secure majority support in parliament are as stable as majority ones.
   Drawing on survival analysis, the effect of different minority cabinet
   types on cabinet stability is tested for 471 cabinets in 30 countries
   from 1977 until 2019. The results show that only minority governments
   without support partnerships have a substantially higher risk of early
   government termination than majority cabinets. The findings of this
   analysis have important implications for the coalition theory and the
   evaluation of minority governments.},

Abstract = {This paper examines two common critiques of ethnic quota policies in
   government hiring and education: that they do not benefit the target
   group, and that any benefits are unevenly distributed within the target
   group. It focuses on the effects of educational and hiring quotas for
   Other Backward Class (OBC) castes in India, using
   difference-in-difference and triple difference designs that take
   advantage of the gradual introduction of these quotas. The results
   provide little support for these critiques: affirmative action is
   associated with small increases in educational attainment and government
   employment among eligible age cohorts, though the increases in
   government employment may be a result of other social and political
   trends. These benefits extend even to poorer OBCs (though not the very
   poorest), and increase the chances of social contact between uneducated
   OBCs and government officials.},

Abstract = {In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Greek state
   engaged in a campaign that opted to present southern Macedonia as a
   genuinely Hellenic space. The goal was to inhibit rival national
   discourses that emphasized the primordial presence of non-Greek ethnic
   groups in the province which legitimized expansionist claims by other
   states. To achieve this, many Greek governments at the time employed
   agents and institutions who used three devices to spatialize the
   Hellenic past of the province: Travelogues, monuments, and excavations.
   This paper explores and assesses their impact on defining southern
   Macedonia as a Greek land.},

Abstract = {Recent political theory in the area of deliberative democracy has placed
   listening at the normative core of meaningfully democratic deliberation.
   Empirical research in this area, however, has struggled to capture
   democratic listening in a normatively relevant way. This paper presents
   a new, theoretically informed instrument for measuring and assessing
   listening in deliberation. Here, I tackle the observational challenge of
   measuring the act of listening itself, as opposed to either the
   preconditions or outcomes of listening. Reviewing existing measures, I
   show that each, in isolation, fails to capture the most democratically
   meaningful aspects of listening. The paper argues, however, that
   existing and novel measures can be usefully combined to allow
   researchers to capture different degrees of democratic listening. Using
   Rawls's concept of ``lexical priority,{''} I aggregate relevant
   components of listening into a normatively significant lexical scale.
   The paper describes this novel measurement and highlights how it can be
   used in empirical research on democratic deliberation.},

Abstract = {The origins of voter preferences about the vertical distribution of
   political power in federal systems are not well understood. I argue that
   negative historical experiences with higher-level governments can raise
   demands for both exit strategies and a decentralization of power, but
   also for upward integration. I specify conditions when delegating power
   upwards, for example, from the nation-state to a supranational level or
   international organization, can better serve the purpose of constraining
   nation-state actions to overcome history. Empirically, the quasi-random
   division of the French regions Alsace and Lorraine allows estimating
   differences in support for integration with a spatial regression
   discontinuity design. More negative exposure to nation-state actions
   causes persistently higher support for European integration in three
   referenda and less Euroscepticism in EU elections. Survey evidence
   supports exit and integration as two complementary alternatives. Both
   options can serve the purpose of moving power away from the government
   level associated with negative historical experiences.},

Abstract = {Governments routinely justify why the regime over which they preside is
   entitled to rule. These claims to legitimacy are both an expression of
   and shape of how a rule is being exercised. In this paper, we introduce
   new expert-coded measures of regime legitimation strategies (RLS) for
   183 countries in the world from 1900 to 2019. Country experts rated the
   extent to which governments justify their rule based on performance, the
   person of the leader, rational-legal procedures, and ideology. They were
   also asked to qualify the ideology of the regime. The main purposes of
   this paper are to present the conceptual basis for the measure, describe
   the data, and provide convergent, content, and construct validity tests
   for new measures. Our measure of regime legitimation performs well in
   all these three validation tests, most notably, the construct validity
   exercise which explores commonly held beliefs about leadership under
   populist rule.},

Abstract = {Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge argues forcefully that there
   are inherent limitations to the predictability of human action, due to a
   circumstance he calls ``ideational heterogeneity.{''} However, our
   resources for predicting human action somewhat reliably in the light of
   ideational heterogeneity have not been exhausted yet, and there are no
   in-principle barriers to progress in tackling the problem. There are,
   however, other strong reasons to think that disagreement among
   epistocrats is bound to persist, such that it will be difficult to
   decide who has ``the right answer{''} to a given technocratic problem.
   These reasons have to do with competing visions of the good society,
   fact/value entanglement, and the fragility of the facts of the social
   sciences.},

Abstract = {How do social movement organizations involved in abortion debates
   leverage a global crisis to pursue their goals? In recent months there
   has been media coverage of how anti-abortion actors in the United States
   attempted to use the COVID-19 pandemic to restrict access to abortion by
   classifying abortion as a non-essential medical procedure. Was the
   crisis ``exploited{''} by social movement organizations (SMOs) in other
   countries? I bring together Crisis Exploitation Theory and the concept
   of discursive opportunity structures to test whether social movement
   organizations exploit crisis in ways similar to elites, with those
   seeking change being more likely to capitalize on the opportunities
   provided by the crisis. Because Twitter tends to be on the frontlines of
   political debate-especially during a pandemic-a dataset is compiled of
   over 12,000 Tweets from the accounts of SMOs involved in abortion
   debates across four countries to analyze the patterns in how they
   responded to the pandemic. The results suggest that crisis may disrupt
   expectations about SMO behavior and that anti- and pro-abortion rights
   organizations at times framed the crisis as both a ``threat{''} and as
   an ``opportunity.{''}},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many scholars have examined the nature of campaign advertising strategy
   across differing contexts in U.S. elections. Little attention has been
   devoted to exploring the incentives that candidates face to appear ? or
   not ? in their own advertisements. We argue that candidates should seek
   to distance themselves from potential backlash stemming from more
   negative messages by not appearing in negative ads. We also expect that
   candidates should be more likely to appear in advertisements aired
   during primary elections relative to general elections because
   candidates should use ads in this election stage to introduce themselves
   to voters. Furthermore, incumbents should be less likely to appear in
   ads than other candidates because their constituents should not need to
   be introduced to them. Data on candidate-sponsored television
   advertisements collected across four years for four different offices
   provides support for our expectations and suggests that candidates make
   strategic decisions about when to appear in advertisements.},

Abstract = {Attempts to define terrorist typologies often emphasise the importance
   of socio-political and psychological factors and the distinction between
   lone and group actors. However, these attempts are predominantly driven
   by theory or secondary data, and controversies still surround how much
   influence family, ideology, and personality factors exercise on
   terrorist behaviour. Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we developed a
   typology for terrorism utilising common social, family, childhood,
   ideology, and personality factors. The sample comprised 160 incarcerated
   offenders convicted of terrorism in Iraq. We applied LCA, including a
   total of 21 variables representing participant characteristics,
   attitudes, perceptions, and behaviours commonly identified in the
   literature. Analysis indicated a three-class model fit was better than
   two- and four-class models. The largest class in the LCA (40.6\%, n =
   65) was classified as `non-religious nationalists' (class 1). The second
   largest class (40\%, n = 64) was classified as `oppressed
   instrumentalists' (class 2). The smallest class (19.4\%, n = 31) was
   classified as `aggrieved antisocials' (class 3). The new typology merits
   further investigation in different settings with a larger sample
   Although the widely supported distinction between lone and group actor
   terrorism was not borne out in this sample, the new categorisation can
   nonetheless offer opportunities for identifying those at risk and
   offering social interventions.},

   research and analysis; this introduction, to the Dialogues theme
   Politicizing Disability, calls for this uptake of disability to increase

   two current issues gripping our worlds: COVID-19 and police brutality
   and killing of Black people. I show how scholars within disability
   studies and disability activists are framing the global pandemic and
   police violence, before introducing the three articles within this

Abstract = {Recent studies have acknowledged the heterogeneity in the way citizens
   make sense of their economic and cultural beliefs, thus calling to
   question the conventional assumption that political views are organized
   along a single liberal-conservative dimension and connected accordingly
   with left-right identifications. Our article contributes to this stream
   of research. Primarily highlighting the influence of political
   sophistication on attitude consistency, we show that only the most
   interested in politics associate their economic and cultural attitudes
   in accordance with the liberal-conservative continuum and are able to
   combine them in a coherent fashion with their ideological
   identifications. In contrast, large segments of the French public do not
   respond to the dominant framing of the political debate.},

Abstract = {What motivates Peers to attend legislative sittings? Sitting attendance
   is a symbolic way for legislators to show citizens that they are being
   productive and hence is often explained by electoral motivations that
   Peers lack. I argue that Peers make decisions to attend sittings when
   critical events threaten their position in the legislature. Attending at
   these times-namely after scandals and House of Lords reform debates-is
   an attempt to counteract negative impressions about the House and its
   members. Other critical events that may impact elected legislators such
   as terrorist attacks and natural disasters should have no impact on
   Peers attendance. Using a newly compiled dataset on attendance and
   critical events, I show that Peers respond by increasing attendance only
   after House of Lords reform debates in either House; attendance after
   scandals, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks is unchanged. This
   suggests that Peers are responsive in only the most urgent cases: when
   they are in the spotlight and the future of the House is on the line.
   More broadly, I offer the first empirical investigation of symbolic
   responsiveness among unelected legislators and show that there are some
   situations where said legislators feel the need to respond.},

Abstract = {Often foreign countries levy sanctions in the attempt to foment
   discontent with a hostile government. But sanctions may provoke costly
   reactions by the leaders of the target country. This paper presents a
   model in which sanctions exhaust the target country economically and
   impair its government's fiscal capacity. Then, an office-motivated
   leader may find it convenient to default on foreign debt in order to
   free resources that she can invest to regain internal political support.
   The default thus becomes a defensive tool to partially dampen the
   internal political turmoil sanctions generate.},

Abstract = {Various studies demonstrate that candidates at the top of the party list
   have a strong advantage in preferential voting systems, particularly
   under open-list PR. Such ballot position effects can be explained by
   voters' tendency to rely on easily available information shortcuts when
   selecting a candidate. In this paper, we argue that the strength of
   ballot position effects depends on the context of how voters cast their
   vote. Specifically, we argue that postal voters are less likely to rely
   on the ballot position cue compared to voters who vote on election day
   for two reasons. First, postal voters might be more politically
   interested. Second, postal voters have more time to assess additional
   information about the candidates. The hypothesis is tested by analyzing
   newly collected data from two open-list PR elections in the German
   federal state of Hamburg. The results confirm the theoretical
   expectations: Ballot position effects are substantively weaker among
   postal voters. Additional analyses suggest that differences in the
   political interest between postal voters and election day voters are
   unlikely to fully explain these results. These findings advance our
   understanding of ballot position effects and voters' use of information
   shortcuts more generally.},

Abstract = {South Sudan became a juridical state in July 2011. Its statehood
   materialised after protracted north-south civil wars were brought to an
   end by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The CPA set forth
   self-rule for an interim period and a referendum on independence for the
   South Sudanese in January 2011. While the two states split peacefully,
   post-separation relations between the Sudans has been complicated. This
   paper explores the unamicable political divorce of South Sudan from
   Sudan. It examines the key post-separation issues that have remained
   sources of contention and conflict between the Sudans. Based on a
   qualitative approach, and primary and secondary sources of data, the
   paper argues that border claims over Abyei and Heglig/Panthou, the
   politics of oil, mutual subversion, historical grievances, and internal
   political dynamics continue to drag the two countries into conflict. It
   argues that because of their importance to the socio-economic and
   political vitality to both states, border claims and oil remain
   particularly important in shaping relations between the Sudans. Unless
   managed properly, based on a win-win approach, the divergence on
   outstanding issues will exacerbate state building challenges in the
   world's newest state of South Sudan.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the British polling industry has encountered
   difficulties in its attempts to measure voting intentions in important
   popular consultations, notably the 2014 referendum on Scottish
   independence, the 2015 UK general election, and the 2016 EU membership
   referendum. In such a context, it is extremely valuable to explore how
   different forecasting models that rely on political and economic
   variables can be used to predict the outcome of elections. In this
   paper, we propose such a model by introducing a political economy
   equation to estimate the vote share obtained by the incumbent party in
   UK general elections three months before the vote as well as a set of
   seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) to forecast the results of the
   Official Opposition, the Liberal Democrats, and the remaining parties.},

Abstract = {This article explores perceptions of the legitimacy of income inequality
   in South Africa, looking at the `just income gap': salaries considered
   to be fair for occupations at opposite ends of the status continuum.
   Data from the 2009 and 2016 waves of the South African Social Attitudes
   Survey (SASAS) were analysed. Findings on perceived actual and ethical
   wages for five occupations indicated that, although South Africans feel
   that those on the low end of the wage continuum deserve a substantial
   increase in income, fairly high, occupationally specific levels of wage
   inequality were deemed legitimate. The `just gap' was heavily influenced
   by perceptions of particular occupations and the `ethical calibre' of
   people assumed to work in those sectors, with high public sector
   salaries perceived as illegitimate based on perceptions of corruption.
   South Africans accepted fairly high levels of inequality but favoured
   higher incomes for the poor and limits on corporate sector salaries.},

Abstract = {Immigration has become a key issue in electoral competition in Italy.
   Several studies have demonstrated the weight of immigration on voting
   choices of Italian voters, as well as the importance that this issue has
   had for the electoral success of certain parties, namely the League.
   However, it is still unclear why voters are mobilized on this issue and,
   more generally, what are the underlying factors of individual attitudes
   towards migrants. In this paper we explore whether and to what extent
   these attitudes are the result of latent cultural factors, which find
   their roots in long-standing and deeper value predispositions. We do so,
   relying on an original survey carried out among Italian citizens and
   making use of the Schwartz conceptualization and measurement of values.
   A series of regression analyses demonstrate that, besides conditions of
   objective economic deprivation, proximity to migrants, and perception of
   threat and insecurity, values are the most relevant explanatory factors
   of attitudes towards immigration. This leads us to conclude that hostile
   attitudes towards immigration are not the result of a radical
   transformation of public opinion in Italy, but rather the expression of
   more general, structurally conservative value orientations.},

Abstract = {This article applies a method of multidimensional scaling (visualization
   of multi-dimensional structures) to studying different dimensions of
   power competition between the great states. On the basis of analysis of
   the Neo-Realist, Neo-Liberal, and World-systems theory literature on
   global hegemony, 8 criteria of global leadership were defined: GDP per
   capita (PPP), military expenditure (\% of GDP), amount of currency
   reserves ( including gold), export of goods and services, direct foreign
   investments, population size in urban agglomerations with more than one
   million people (\% of total population), articles in peer-reviewed
   scholarly journals, and patent applications. A group of 19 states of the
   G-20 (excluding the EU) was selected for comparative analysis. Four
   models visualizing positions of 19 countries according to 8 dimensions
   were created: for 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2016. These results were
   compared to the results of calculation including 14 countries:
   Argentine, Brazil, China, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, India,
   Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and the USA. Using mathematical
   methods of analysis, as traditionally applied in IR literature, turns
   the making of such models into a very complicated task. Therefore, the
   mathematical method of the visualization of multi-dimensional structures
   developed by Russian scholars was applied to this task. The models
   demonstrate that China's positions sharply increased in 2009 and since
   that time China has started to slowly replace USA as an absolute leader.
   However, if we analyze leadership within specific categories included
   into our model, the USA still hold leading (or close to leading)
   positions according to the majority of parameters, while China has a
   strictly defined profile of leadership connected to its accelerated
   economic and technical development. However, China is still far from
   leadership, from the point of view of the development of social
   structures and even regarding the military dimension.},

Title = {``Not Some Other -ism{''}-On Some Western Marxist Misrepresentations of
   Chinese Socialism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-189},
Abstract = {This study tackles four Western Marxist misrepresentations of socialism
   with Chinese characteristics, particularly as it has developed with the
   reform and opening-up. Each of these misrepresentations sets in
   opposition the economy and the state, with the former being seen as
   ``capitalist{''} (in some form) and the latter as variously
   ``authoritarian,{''} ``bureaucratic{''} or simply as
   ``interventionist.{''} In other words, ``Chinese characteristics{''}
   designates the superstructural feature that determines- incorrectly in
   light of Marxist analysis-the economic base, which is mistakenly seen as
   capitalist. While each misrepresentation has its own distinct problems,
   they also have common problems: a voluntarist position on political
   decisions, which fails to provide any reason for a ``capitalist
   turn{''}; the assumption that a ``market economy,{''} wherever and
   whenever it appears, is by definition capitalist; the deployment of
   neocolonial and ``Orientalist{''} assumptions coupled with a Western
   ``betrayal narrative{''}; and a systemic neglect of Chinese language
   research. The conclusion provides a summarising assessment that focuses
   on the empirical flaws and methodological presuppositions of these
   misrepresentations. We emphasise that our focus is primarily on the
   internal problems and inconsistencies of these misrepresentations,
   although we also offer-where needed- some constructive alternatives.},

Abstract = {When do candidate-centred electoral systems produce undisciplined
   parties? In this article, we examine party discipline under open-list
   proportional representation, a system associated with MPs cultivating
   personal constituencies. We present a model explaining how legislators'
   preferences and support among voters mediate political leaders' ability
   to enforce discipline. We show that disloyalty in candidate-centred
   systems depends on parties' costs for enforcing discipline, but only
   conditional on MP preferences. MPs who share the policy preferences of
   their leaders will be loyal even when the leaders cannot discipline
   them. To test the model's implications, we use data on legislative
   voting in Poland's parliament. Our empirical findings confirm that
   disloyalty is conditioned on party leaders' enforcement capacity and MP
   preferences. We find that legislators who contribute more to the party
   electorally in terms of votes are more disloyal, but only if their
   preferences diverge from the leadership. Our results suggest that the
   relationship between open lists and party disloyalty is conditional on
   the context of the party system.},

Abstract = {Pentecostalism was born at the beginning of the 20th century as a
   reaction to the secularization of Protestantism. Initially aimed at the
   dominated members of bourgeois society, women and the working classes,
   Pentecostalism invested the devalued emotions. His charismatic cult,
   centered on glossolalia, which seems to give free rein to emotions, is
   in fact a system of incorporating moral emotions which provoke an
   ascetic habitus among the faithful. From the 1970s onwards, the
   revaluation of emotions in the dominant culture led part of the middle
   classes to gradually rally to Pentecostalism. This renewal of the social
   composition of Pentecostalism led it to enter the political field, with
   initially mixed success due to the division of the movement into
   competing churches. The referendum for peace between the Colombian
   government and FARC in October 2016 is a first example of the conversion
   of the Pentecostal moral habitus into electoral discipline.},

Abstract = {Electoral gender quotas now exist in a majority of national legislatures
   worldwide. In general, quotas are followed by greater legislative
   attention to the interests and priorities of women as a group. Across
   cases, effects have been most pronounced on issues related to women's
   rights, public health, and poverty alleviation. Quotas can influence
   policy in two general ways: First, quotas may send cues to all
   officeholders, prompting broad changes in legislator behavior among both
   men and women. Second, quotas typically bring more women into
   legislatures, causing a shift in aggregate legislator preferences and
   increasing women's ability to collectively influence legislative
   decisions. Yet, the positive effects of quotas are not universal, and
   some research reveals instances in which quotas have led to limited
   policy changes or even to more gender-inegalitarian outcomes. I suggest
   several variables that may moderate the relationship between quota
   adoption and policy change, including underexplored dimensions of quota
   design.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long established the importance of the cultural outcomes
   of social movements in the context of political power and
   representation. However, they have also acknowledged the methodological
   difficulties associated with studying cultural outcomes, especially when
   culture is manifested through linguistic practices. This paper addresses
   the potential for dealing with movements and culture as manifested in
   symbols, public discourse, narratives, and rhetoric and makes two
   contributions: It links the social movement literature studying culture
   through language with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for
   systematic and comprehensive cultural analysis; and introduces a
   state-of the-art method which provides a better understanding of
   language change and linguistic influence given the capacity of
   computational analyses to process large volumes of data for multiple
   actors and varied data sources during long periods of time. The paper
   describes the cultural influence of women organizations in Spain between
   2000-2020 on issues such as gender inequalities, abortion, gender
   violence, prostitution, and surrogacy. Tweets and manifestos by women's
   organizations', as well as national press coverage of women issues and
   interventions by MPs in the parliamentary arena, are used to describe
   the advantages and limitations of the method for the study of cultural
   outcomes. Computational linguistics provides new possibilities for
   scholarly research on cultural outcomes of social movements but also
   shows that these methods should be accompanied by precise definitions of
   cultural outcomes, detailed and replicable operationalisation processes,
   and theoretical models that identify the mechanisms that explain the
   linguistic phenomena that underly cultural change.},

Abstract = {Using new comparative expert data about the 2016 US Presidential
   Election, this article explores the effects of experts' ideological
   preferences on their evaluations of electoral integrity. Without
   contesting the claim that the 2016 election faced challenges of
   integrity, our analyses reveal a substantial association between
   negative evaluation of election integrity and experts' ideological
   orientation. Our results also suggest that this ideological effect is
   stronger in States that `swung' from Democratic to Republican in the
   2016 election.},

Abstract = {The extent to which citizens comply with newly enacted public health
   measures such as social distancing or lockdowns strongly affects the
   propagation of the virus and the number of deaths from COVID-19. It is
   however very difficult to identify non-compliance through survey
   research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable.
   Using three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of different
   `face-saving' questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the
   measurement of compliance with public health measures. Our treatments
   soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in
   combination with a guilty-free answer choice making it easier for
   respondents to admit non-compliance. We find that self-reported
   non-compliance increases by up to +11 percentage points when making use
   of a face-saving question. Considering the current context and the
   importance of measuring non-compliance, we argue that researchers around
   the world should adopt our most efficient face-saving question.},

Title = {The politics of recognition: the debate between Taylor, Honneth and
   Fraser},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Pages = {106-120},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze and compare the models of
   recognition of philosophers Charles Taylor (1931), Axel Honneth (1949)
   and political scientist Nancy Fraser (1947), in order to evaluate the
   limits and possibilities of each of these views on this model of
   justice. The struggles for recognition, unlike the struggles for
   ``redistribution{''}, do not have as normative orientation, in the first
   place, the elimination of economic inequalities, but the fight against
   prejudice and discrimination of certain groups and individuals,
   considering that the denial of recognition constitutes an effective form
   of oppression. The debate will be held with the answer of these authors
   on two issues that are intertwined: The first question is to seek to
   know whether justice claims recognition of what differs individuals and
   groups or the recognition of our common humanity is sufficient. The
   second is to know how to separate the demands for recognition that are
   justified from those that are not.},

   research on formal institutions in comparative politics. We focus on the
   case of written constitutions and discuss the scholarly utility of
   studying such documents in the face of four analytic and theoretical
   challenges. Each of these challenges, in turn, implies a set of
   empirical questions, for which we invoke original data to sketch a
   broad-brushed set of answers. The data analysis and accompanying
   discussion suggest a set of guidelines for how written constitutions
   should be deployed in comparative research designs on topics that

Abstract = {In recent decades, Mexico has introduced increasingly strict electoral
   rules regarding the gender electoral regime, while the descriptive
   representation of women has been increasing. This article analyzes
   empirically the relationship between the strength of the gender
   electoral regime and the descriptive representation of women in local
   congresses of the 32 states, expanding the longitudinal analysis based
   on the data of most local legislatures between 1987 and 2019. It aims to
   identify whether the gender electoral regime of each state has been
   strengthened (diachronic comparison) and if there is a positive
   relationship between the strength of the gender electoral regime
   (synchronous comparison) and the proportion of female legislators in
   each local congress. The results of this research suggest that the
   stronger the gender electoral regime, the greater the predicted
   proportion of women elected by the principles of relative majority and
   proportional representation, even after controlling for other political
   and socioeconomic factors. The results also illustrate that the effect
   of the gender electoral regime index is not homogeneous among
   sub-national entities.},

Abstract = {Democratic multinational federalism is not to be conceived as panacea
   but as a concrete way of achieving three key objectives that are
   essential for the management of conflicts, namely (1) decoupling and
   distinguish the notions of `nation' and `state', (2) strengthening a
   sense of identity through the implementation of politics of recognition
   and (3) developing a better equilibrium between self-rule and shared
   rule through the implementation of a multiplicity of collaborative
   initiatives while valuing the principle of political autonomy.
   Multinational federalism can lead the way in developing policy
   instruments that put limits to the domination of the majority nation
   over other national groups. To the extent that minority nations are
   treated fairly, one would expect that state stability would be greatly
   augmented and that constitutional loyalty would gain prominence.
   Self-restraint on the part of the majority nation is more a guarantee of
   success than the imposition of norms.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze both the role that the royal
   prerogative plays in the Spanish democratic system and its particular
   legal regime. For that purpose, it will be detached from past or
   historical conceptions which before justified its existence, trying to
   find its present foundation in the framework of a democratic
   Constitution, which will determine the function it is called to play in
   the Spanish legal order. Then, the paper will explore its legal scope,
   both in substantive and temporal terms, so as to verify whether it is
   compatible with the function the inviolability holds and, consequently,
   if we are dealing with a justifiable prerogative or an intolerable
   privilege.},

Abstract = {The attempt to assess the essential functions and aspects of the
   intellectual establishment in the modern and contemporary world occupies
   a prominent place in the social sciences and in the political philosophy
   of the 20th century. Antonio Gramsci was undoubtedly one of the
   philosophers who made the most heuristic and hermeneutical
   contributions, from his revisionist Marxist perspective, to understand
   intellectuals as leading actors and active political subjects, situated
   in the dilemma of favoring the preservation of the established order, in
   the case of traditional intellectuals, or in promoting their radical
   transformation as a program of action of the so-called organic
   intellectuals, who dedicate themselves at all times to interpret the
   needs and aspirations of justice and equity of the time and social space
   of which they are part, to endow it with concrete political content.
   Consequently, the objective of this scientific article is to examine the
   role of the critical intellectual with social commitment in the current
   complex context, marked by the systemic crisis of the current world
   order. Methodologically speaking, the document presented here was
   developed through dialectical hermeneutics and the documentary research
   technique. The findings obtained allow us to conclude that critical
   thinking is key to revitalizing democracies.},

Abstract = {On October 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the central coast
   of California. Three weeks later, on November 7, 1989, San Francisco
   held a municipal election. A dozen polling places had been destroyed or
   were otherwise inaccessible to the public due to the earthquake, so new
   polling places were selected for the affected precincts in the days
   leading up to the election. This case represents a credible natural
   experiment examining how changes in the costs of voting affect political
   participation, with the ``as-if{''} random assignment of voters to the
   treatment group determined by earthquake damage to individual buildings
   rather than election administration decisions which could conceivably be
   related to turnout, such as precinct consolidation or the location of
   precinct boundaries. We use a difference-in-differences design, with the
   difference in turnout between the 1987 and 1989 municipal elections as
   the outcome variable. We find that voter turnout was 2.9 {[}5.1, 0.6]
   percentage points lower in precincts in which the polling place was
   relocated due to earthquake damage as compared to precincts that kept
   their original polling place.},

Abstract = {The North Crimean Canal ran from the Dnieper River to the northern
   border of the Crimea and from there to Kerch. It enabled large-scale
   irrigation of the peninsula's dry areas and supplied water to the
   population and to industry. In response to Russia's annexation of
   Crimea, Ukraine cut off the water supply in April 2014. As a result, the
   canal system that once irrigated rice and grain fields, vegetable and
   fruit plantations soon dried up. The capacity to provide water for the
   population and industrial enterprises deteriorated considerably. The
   water blockade has yet to move Russia to give up the Crimea. But this
   sanction should be put to the test if Russia offers something in return,
   for example, with respect to the status of the occupied Donbass.},

Abstract = {The isolationist presidency of Donald Trump was only the last, albeit
   the most radical, of a series of United States administrations that have
   largely ignored fostering close relations with Latin America and the
   Caribbean. This apparent withdrawal has resulted in the steady rise of
   Brazil as a significant regional power as well as the incursion of
   Russian and Chinese influence in the region. In light of these
   developments, this article presents a historical overview of United
   States hegemony in the western hemisphere before outlining how recent
   setbacks have undermined this trend in the areas of regional trade,
   diplomacy, and security. As the Biden administration makes its
   transition, the article finishes by proposing how the United States
   could regain influence in the region by collaborating with its southern
   neighbors to promote economic development, defend human rights, and
   confront the region's ongoing security issues.},

Title = {``Refugees{''} as a Misnomer: The Parochial Politics and Official
   Discourse of the Visegrad Four},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {174-184},
Abstract = {Attitudes towards migrants and refugees are created and reflected at the
   level of public policies, as well as in local communities which
   cultivate traditional approaches and a specific worldview. The refugee
   crisis in Europe in the mid-2010s showed how public opinion translated
   into voting behaviour and became a source of strength for nationalist
   anti-immigrant movements and parties across the continent. East-Central
   Europe was no exception, regardless of the absence of a long-term,
   massive inflow of refugees. Nevertheless, the migration crisis created a
   new political narrative which exploited deeply rooted resentments,
   complexes, and fears. This article aims to analyse the official policy
   responses to the refugee crisis in the four East-Central European
   countries: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, which
   together constitute the so-called Visegrad Four. It puts the emphasis on
   the discriminatory practice of misnaming the refugees, which became
   deeply anchored in the political discourse of these countries. Based on
   a qualitative content analysis supplemented by the findings of public
   opinion polls, the argument developed in the article is that reluctant
   and defensive attitudes towards the refugees have been determined by the
   revival of parochialism as a radical reaction to the challenges of
   global trends and supra-local processes. The theoretical framing of the
   refugee problem is built on politicization, in connection with the
   concept of parochialism, seen from political and social perspectives,
   and the meaning of the use of the misnomer as a policy instrument. The
   article concludes that the migration crisis petrified traditional
   cleavages at the supra-local level, reinforcing simultaneously the sense
   of parochial altruism and hostility towards ``the other.{''}},

Abstract = {Although there are 10 million Polish Americans in the United States,
   this group has been understudied recently, with most work relying on
   unrepresentative samples. We fill in knowledge gaps on party affiliation
   and presidential voting with data from 1972-2018 waves of the General
   Social Survey. Until the last decade, Polish Americans were consistently
   Democratic in party identification and presidential voting. Recently,
   however, this group's voting has become more moderate, bringing it into
   greater alignment with the overall American electorate. Our findings
   support current political thought about US Poles overall, while
   challenging secondary assumptions in ways that suggest further
   longitudinal study.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {875-883},
Abstract = {This study examines the problem of characterizing the political
   communications system in Britain as a socio-political phenomenon. In the
   XX-XXI centuries, the intense growth of knowledge has shaped the
   socio-cultural and political activity of the population. Political
   communication becomes a separate area from human activity. In modern
   conditions, political communication is a set of processes, the source of
   which should be power. There are many processes in species diversity.
   Political communications in modern conditions have acquired the status
   of a social institution. The article attempts to present the
   institutional status of the phenomenon of political communication as a
   structure of three main components. First, the state as a governing
   body, represented by three powers: legislative, executive, and judicial.
   Secondly, society, which acts as the recipient of the initiatives of
   state power, or which has a positive attitude towards state policy or,
   negative and opposes, or has an attitude of waiting to see what happens.
   At the same time, there are groups in society that tend to actively
   intervene in politics. The third element of the political communication
   system is the media.},

Abstract = {I study a bargaining model of war in which states contest two issues and
   the state receiving offers has private information about her value for
   each issue. When the offerer starts sufficiently uncertain about the
   receiver's favorite issue, he makes a balanced offer (evenly distributed
   across both issues) that is less efficient than an offer concentrated on
   the receiver's most valuable issue would have been but avoids guessing
   the receiver's favorite issue. I then allow players to resolve this
   uncertainty through costless diplomacy. The receiver uses diplomacy to
   truthfully reveal her favorite issue leading to a Pareto-improving offer
   concentrated on that issue. However, diplomacy has a dark side: when it
   causes the offer to switch from a balanced offer to a concentrated
   offer, it induces an equilibrium that (weakly) carries a larger risk of
   war because concentrated offers confront risk over the receiver's
   relative value between issues. The results track Sino-American and
   Sino-Soviet precrisis diplomacy.},

Title = {Ranked Choice Voting and Youth Voter Turnout: The Roles of Campaign
   Civility and Candidate Contact},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {319-331},
Abstract = {Ranked choice voting (RCV) has become increasing popular in the United
   States as more cities and states begin allowing voters to rank
   candidates in order of preference. This change in election system has
   been linked to increased campaign civility and mobilization, but with
   little evidence suggesting these benefits lead to increased voter
   turnout in the general population. This study argues that RCV elections
   may not increase overall voting but will increase youth voting.
   Considering young Americans, who have become increasingly pessimistic
   towards politics and are also heavily reliant on mobilization for
   participation, this study argues that increased campaign civility and
   mobilization may work to offset the negative feelings and lack of
   political engagement that plague young Americans. Using a matched study
   of individual level voter turnout for seven RCV and fourteen non-RCV
   local elections from 2013 and 2014, we find that there is no statistical
   difference in voting rates between RCV and plurality cities for the
   general public. Yet, in line with our hypotheses, younger voters are
   more likely to vote in RCV cities. Further, we find that increased
   contact in RCV elections accounts for a larger portion of the increased
   voter turnout compared to perceptions of campaign civility. Findings
   suggest RCV acts as a positive mobilizing force for youth voting through
   increasing campaign contact.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the so called impossibility
   theorem, according to which democracy, state sovereignty and
   globalization are mutually exclusive and cannot function to the full
   extent when present simultaneously. This theorem, elaborated in 2011 by
   Dani Rodrik, a famous economist from Harvard University, poses a
   fundamental problem about the prospects of the global scalability of
   political institutions of the nation-state. Is it in principle possible
   to globalize executive, legislative and judicial branches of power,
   civil society, and democracy, or is it necessary to limit globalization
   in order to preserve democracy and nation-state? Rodrik's conclusions,
   in essence, make one give up hopes to create global democratic order
   against the background of global capitalism.
   On the basis of the Stanford School of Sociological Institutionalism and
   the reconstruction of the historical materialism by Jurgen Habermas, the
   author refutes Rodrik's theorem. The author's analysis shows that not
   only is it possible to build democratic order at the global level, but
   also that it already exists in the form of the world culture that
   includes such norms as electoral democracy, nation-state, civil society
   and other institutions of Modernity. The world culture reproduces
   fundamental social values, playing the role of social integration for
   the humanity, while global capitalism provides for its material
   reproduction, playing the role of system integration. However, since
   globalization is a more dynamic process than the development of the
   world culture, between material and ideational universalism arises a
   gap, which in its turn is fraught with various kinds of political and
   economic crises.},

   Elections},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The 2019 Polish parliamentary elections were the last in a series of
   three elections held within 12 months (chronologically: local elections,
   European Parliament election, elections to the Sejm and the Senate). The
   three consecutive elections opened up the possibility for cooperation
   within the parliamentary opposition with the aim of political victory.
   This article examines the relations be- tween opposition groups in
   2018-2019. Each election is analyzed in terms of the nature of relations
   within the opposition as well as cooperation and interparty competition.
   The hypothesis assumes that the types of relations among parliamentary
   opposition groups were shaped by the character of the given elections
   and the decisions taken by individual parties choosing between
   maintaining their independence and steps to potentially increase their
   electoral chances. The analysis shows that dur- ing the period in
   question the opposition did not develop a stable unified model of
   cooperation and that relations between individual groups were dominated
   by competition; however, depending on the election, cooperation was
   possible and was pragmatically pursued by the parties, as in the case of
   the European Coalition. The only stable cooperation was between Civic
   Platform and Modern.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This article proposes a characterization of the European regulatory
   process for health claims, as well as an analysis of the controversy
   surrounding the methodological and evidentiary requirements for
   scientific substantiation. The study of regulations and relevant
   scientific papers looks at three issues: the epistemic policies adopted
   by the European Food Safety Authority, their possible implications for
   different areas, and proposals for alternative strategies presented by
   critics' approaches. The hierarchy of evidence and methodologies defined
   by the regulation establishes that proving causality on the basis of
   randomized controlled trials is crucial for the authorisation of a
   claim. However, this standard of proof might be not suitable for
   investigating the effects of ingredients in nutrition science, promoting
   research, development and innovation in the functional foods sector, or
   improving individual and public health. The article concludes that the
   European Food Safety Authority may need to reconsider the epistemic
   policies hitherto adopted, by means of reviewing the prioritisation of
   its regulatory objectives and analysing the for each level of proof in
   all contexts.},

Title = {Job attraction and career choice motivation in a socialist-market
   economy: the case of the young Vietnamese workforce},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-149},
Abstract = {This paper aims to explain the career choice motivation of young workers
   in a non-Western setting, Vietnam. After witnessing the greater role of
   the relatively small but competent bureaucracy in East Asia, many have
   assumed that `pervasive and powerful' bureaucracy also occupies a
   similar prestigious position in the rapidly growing Vietnam. For the
   past decade, however, declining talent acquisition in the public sector
   indicates that good quality workers are leaving or not choosing public
   sector jobs. What job motivators and perception on the government jobs
   affect the younger generation's career choice in Vietnam? Based on the
   classic motivation theories and Public Service Motivation (PSM)
   framework, we surveyed fresh graduates and final year university
   students (n = 433) and found that there is a positive relationship
   between public career choice and motivation to serve the public as PSM
   theory expected. Yet, our data show that traditional job motivators such
   as materialistic benefits, job security, and stability were more
   important for the young Vietnamese. From a comparative perspective, this
   suggests that Vietnamese bureaucracy, regardless of its power and
   pervasiveness, needs substantial improvement by meeting public workers'
   basic sanitation needs and working environment to recruit quality
   manpower for continuous economic success.},

Title = {RUSSIA'S GLOBAL POSITION AS REFLECTED IN FRENCH STUDIES: THE
   OBSERVATIONS OF THE OBSERVERS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {2},
Pages = {180-191},
Abstract = {A number of decisive foreign policy actions taken by the Russian
   authorities have returned this country to the center of attention of
   international analysts, ensuring its place in the top three most
   influential world powers, after the USA and China. However, influence is
   a relative category. Despite Moscow's goal being to strengthen its
   position in the new world hierarchy, in the West its policy is regarded
   as a challenge to Euro-Atlantic security. The discrepancy between the
   goal and the result raises the question of what the criteria for the
   attractiveness of a State are in the modern European context. The
   subject of this article is an assessment of Russia's position in the
   world from a special focus - through the eyes of European observers. The
   reason for this was the publication of a collective monograph ``Russia
   in the World{''} by Anne de Tinguy, one of the leading French experts on
   Russian politics; this provides a unique opportunity for retrospective
   analysis as she published a book on the same topic more than ten years
   ago. In both cases, a wide range of co-authors suggest ideas of the
   evaluation criteria that determine Russian's place in the foreign policy
   strategy of European States. To the Russian reader, the presented
   studies are interesting for the critical view of their authors, as a
   reflection of the identity of the European observer based on the needs
   of national foreign policy. The positions of the observers have changed
   over the past ten years. In the first decades of the formation of the
   new Russian state, the attitude toward it depended on the degree of its
   readiness to integrate into the liberal world under the aegis of the
   West; however, at the turn of 2000s-2010s, Europeans realized that
   Russia's transformation into an independent power center was accompanied
   by the refusal to converge on the Western model. This is a return to the
   idea of ``the big Other{''}: it opposes the universal liberal paradigm
   of development, which has begun to be challenged not only from the
   outside but also from within. Thus, the ``Russian question{''} intrudes
   into the domestic political sphere at crucial moments, such as the
   presidential elections in the USA and in France. Does Russia benefit
   from this? The analysis of the European reflection of Russian politics
   clarifies the reasons for persistent divergence between Moscow and
   Europe.},

Abstract = {What motivated Latinos to turnout in 2020 in the middle of a global
   health pandemic that has devastated their community financially,
   physically and mentally? How might we explain Latino support for each
   one of the Presidential candidates in the context of these crises? In
   this paper, we tackle these questions through an investigation of the
   factors that drove Latino turnout in 2020 and what might explain Latino
   favorability for Joe Biden and Donald Trump. To contextualize these
   findings, we compare these results to the 2016 election. We find that
   the most predictive factors of Latino turnout in 2020 were perceived
   group discrimination and mobilization efforts by campaigns and other
   organizations. We also find that Latino candidate preference in 2020 can
   be best explained by issue prioritization. Latinos for whom the economy
   was the most important issue were more likely to support Donald Trump.
   However, Latinos for whom COVID-19 and racism towards the Latino
   community were the top pressing political priorities were more likely to
   favor Joe Biden. These findings continue to shed light on the diversity
   and heterogeneity of the Latino vote and speak to the significance of
   outreach efforts by political parties, candidates and community
   organizations.},

Abstract = {With the 2020 election marking the 100th anniversary of the ratification
   of the 19th Amendment, our attention has been keenly focused on women
   voters. Media coverage of women voters portrayed them as swing voters
   and focused on a small subgroup of women (white, married, mothers). I
   argue that women's and men's voting behavior in 2020 was highly similar
   to past elections and does not support the claims that women or a
   subgroup of women are swing voters. I illustrate the diversity of
   women's voting behavior through analyzing the intersection of gender
   with race, ethnicity, education, marital status, and parental status.
   Even though women were not swing voters, women still play an important
   role in electoral politics, representing the majority of members in both
   the Democratic and Republican Parties and holding stronger attachments
   to these parties than men.},

Abstract = {The article uses the knowledge practice repertoire approach, combined

   local community knowledge based on holistic worldviews plays in the
   formation of collective actors, action and outcomes. This is argued to
   be crucial given that environmental governance is shaped instead by
   knowledge based on a worldview of a nature/culture divide, and that
   local community knowledge is key to responding to the planetary crisis
   and subject to this potential ontological clash. Attention to local
   community collective action using this lens can shed light on whether
   and how spaces can be made for different approaches, giving a fresh view
   to how outcomes matter. The article presents two case studies of local
   community collective action through community protocols from South
   Africa and Argentina. Community protocols are documents, recognised in
   international environmental law, where local communities set out their
   worldviews, their traditional knowledge and practices in support of
   environmental protection, and link these to rights and protections in
   national and international law as a basis for collective action. They
   are thus ideal sites for investigating knowledge practices and
   ontological politics. Focusing on different types of knowledge practices
   and opportunity contexts helped to untangle the complex question of how
   outcomes mattered to the local communities in these cases.},

Abstract = {Felipe Calderon Hinojosa is the second president of the Mexican
   political alternation, but, in contrast with his predecessor, Vicente
   Fox, he came into power in 2006 with a very small margin. During his
   presidential campaign, he did not present himself as the candidate of
   the war on drug trafficking. Nevertheless, he declared it a few days
   after his inauguration as president, which is presumably his main
   political legacy.
   The goal of this article is precisely to analyze how a president, who
   made the war on drug trafficking the priority of his six-year term
   (2006-2012), was able to paradoxically contribute to the development of
   a deep security crisis that quickly became a true humanitarian crisis.
   In the first part of this paper, we will study the declaration of the
   war on drugs by Felipe Calderon by asking us if it was a means to
   legitimize his coming to power in the context of the most controversial
   election in contemporary Mexican history. In the second part, we will
   analyze the pillar of Felipe Calderon Hinojosa's security policy that we
   describe as ``improvised{''}: i.e. militarization. In a third and last
   part, we will try to explain why the security crisis became a true
   humanitarian tragedy in Mexico and to decipher what its main features},

Abstract = {Illiberalism recently became a favourite catchphrase of several
   political actors around the world. Although not necessarily precise, the
   term conjures alternative understandings of democracy, by contesting the
   inherent need of a democratic political system to be intimately tied to
   liberal values. This lack of precision is often instrumentalized to
   boost popular support for taking measures leading to discrimination and
   resisting or even fighting pluralism. This text aims to familiarize the
   reader with the existing conceptual debates surrounding the concept of
   illiberalism, while also offering a glimpse into the causes responsible
   for its popularity. Theoretical knowledge is then juxtaposed with
   information regarding an awareness raising project aiming to fight
   illiberalism in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The conclusion
   stresses the need for communication and education campaigns regarding
   the perils of illiberalism, especially in the more fragile democratic
   contexts of post-communist Europe. Citizens need to be aware of how
   illiberalism endangers democracy, as well as have at their disposal
   mechanisms for raising awareness regarding illiberal measures taken by
   various governments.},

Abstract = {The literature on national parliaments and the EU has built up its
   knowledge on the strength and activities of domestic parliaments in the
   European Union. While these studies were of outmost importance to
   understand how and why parliaments and MPs act on EU affairs, we still
   know little on the influence of domestic parliaments on the EU policy of
   their executive and on EU policy-making more generally. The article
   first presents the current gaps in knowledge as well as the challenges
   to study the influence of parliaments in EU affairs and ends by
   presenting a research strategy which advocates `reconnecting' empirical
   works on national parliaments and the EU with the Principal-Agent model.
   This research agenda could foster new theoretical and empirical studies
   with important implications for the debate on the
   (re)parliamentarisation of the European Union as well as on EU
   negotiations.},

Abstract = {List experiments are a widely used survey technique for estimating the
   prevalence of socially sensitive attitudes or behaviors. Their design,
   however, makes them vulnerable to bias: because treatment group
   respondents see a greater number of items (J + 1) than control group
   respondents (J), the treatment group mean may be mechanically inflated
   due simply to the greater number of items. The few previous studies that
   directly examine this do not arrive at definitive conclusions. We find
   clear evidence of inflation in an original dataset, though only among
   respondents with low educational attainment. Furthermore, we use
   available data from previous studies and find similar heterogeneous
   patterns. The evidence of heterogeneous effects has implications for the
   interpretation of previous research using list experiments, especially
   in developing world contexts. We recommend a simple solution: using a
   necessarily false placebo statement for the control group equalizes list
   lengths, thereby protecting against mechanical inflation without
   imposing costs or altering interpretations.},

Abstract = {In the world of super information featuring the Internet times, certain
   messages take root in the public opinion before other ones. This happens
   by hazard or, most often, intentionally. Falsehoods or fakes find a
   fertile ground to create opinions with proven potential to destabilize
   governments, influence elections or jeopardize important State values
   such as equality, dignity, pluralism, health, etc. Notwithstanding the
   lack of absolute truth in democracy, this article analyzes those
   statements issued by government, private citizens, associations or
   political parties, that, because of their absolute disregard for
   rigorous information or because of clear intention to deceive, cannot be
   admissible. This is so even if they are expressed in a political debate
   context as a result of free expression enjoyment. Democracy requires
   freedom of information, and demands participation, debate and opinion.
   In that interaction, nonetheless, minimum rules of the game -limits-
   must be respected so as to secure a basic democratic safeguard.},

Abstract = {The topic of migration has before been a subject of numerous studies,
   particularly in terms of analyzing the economic costs and benefits to
   accepting and integrating migrants into the host country's work force.
   While the conclusions were in economic terms in favor of integrating
   foreign workers, there exist concerns that the process of integration
   itself can have hidden costs on the host state, in terms of damaging
   social cohesion necessary for the functioning of the modern state. This
   paper addresses the issue of social impacts of migration through an
   analysis of a select group of cases of individual states through which
   it is possible to observe how immigration impacts their society. The
   analysis is done on a group of individual cases, selected for their
   varying approach to migration and social integration, as well as
   referencing more recent studies about identitarian and cultural cohesion
   as well as research on political tolerance. The results of the analysis
   seem to indicate that it is the context of the of the host country,
   specifically its approach to national identities and the mutual
   relations of subnational groups that determines the social impacts of
   immigration. Also, the way the host country conceptualizes its national
   identity, whether it is based on an adherence to an ethnicity or a
   culture, tends to impact the smoothness of the integration process.
   Thus, any policies suggestions in terms of creating more cohesive
   societies, should be preceded with an in-depth analysis of the host
   country, in terms of its social structure and mutual relations of
   present subgroups.},

Abstract = {Against all fatalism, the attribution of responsibility presupposes the
   recognition of the subject's freedom. When does this freedom emerge most
   clearly? When exercised regardless of the context within which we act.
   In this regard, the text measures itself with the reflection of Kant and
   with that of Levinas, with the aim of highlighting two fundamental
   declinations of the theme: responsibility as an answer-of (what one
   does) and responsibility as an answer-to (the other). In the second part
   of the text, two implications of this constitutive link between
   responsibility and freedom are highlighted: the centrality of the theme
   of interiority and the openness of thought to the mystery. Free action,
   and therefore morality, have their roots in a terrain that remains
   mysterious, as it escapes any possible understanding.},

Abstract = {This article explains a surprising wave of lethal attacks by drug
   cartels against hundreds of local elected officials and party candidates
   in Mexico, 2007-2012. These attacks are puzzling because criminal
   organizations tend to prefer the secrecy of bribery over the publicity
   of political murder. Scholars suggest that war drives armed actors to
   attack state authorities in search of protection or rents. Using
   original data on high-profile attacks in Mexico, the authors show that
   war need arguments underexplain violence. Focusing on political
   opportunities, they suggest that cartels use attacks to establish
   criminal governance regimes and conquer local governments, populations
   and territories. The study presents quantitative and qualitative
   evidence showing that cartels took advantage of Mexico's political
   polarization and targeted subnational authorities who were unprotected
   by their federal partisan rivals. Cartels intensified attacks during
   subnational election cycles to capture incoming governments and targeted
   geographically adjacent municipalities to establish control over large
   territories. The findings reveal how cartels take cues from the
   political environment to develop their own de facto political domains
   through high-profile violence. These results question the widely shared
   assumption that organized criminal groups are apolitical actors.},

Abstract = {This article compares trade-union activity in support of the rights of
   domestic workers in the Netherlands, Germany and France. Even though
   trade-union membership among domestic workers is very low, trade unions
   have taken action to defend the rights of domestic workers in all of
   these countries. However, such actions have been only partial, and have
   not comprehensively included the needs and rights of all domestic
   workers. Comparing trade-union activity shows that actions in support of
   domestic workers have been encouraged by transnational advocacy in all
   three countries. While inclusive institutions have facilitated actions
   in France, in Germany and the Netherlands, trade-union actions have been
   constrained by the persistently ``informal{''} characteristics of
   domestic work and by the hesitancy of trade unions to engage
   comprehensively with the issue of migrants' rights.},

Abstract = {In Italy, many governments and coalitions have formed and dissolved in
   the post-1993 era, called the Second Republic. During this period,
   various legal changes have affected political life. In the past 25
   years, political agents have struggled to make good on the wishes for
   change, and society's renewal has reshaped the country. This study
   focuses on these developments since the mid-1990s to understand the
   recent shifts in Italy. The article emphasizes the effects of Lega and
   the M5S, the newest political agents rising in Italian democracy, and
   examines them in the context of the crisis of populism and liberal
   democracy. The study argues that the continuing democratic debate in
   Italy protects democracy from the tendency to turn authoritarian.
   Conversely, the never-ending crises and fluctuations make the stability
   of central politics more and more challenging. This tension in democracy
   extends beyond Italy to the whole of European politics.},

Title = {How do executives communicate about crises? A framework for comparative
   analysis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {A plethora of accumulating crises, and the public frustration with how
   they were tackled, have provided fertile ground for growing public
   scepticism towards the European Union (EU). The way in which political
   leaders manage these crises may well decide the future of the EU.
   Research has addressed these developments comprehensively. However, it
   has not, to date, provided an adequate analytical lens to confront the
   crisis theme explicitly and therefore needs analytical advancement. We
   contribute to the debate by developing a framework for comparative
   analysis and evaluation of public political crisis communication,
   identifying four aspects along which public political crisis
   communication can be analysed: (1) how accessible it is, (2) how well it
   can contribute to allaying fears, (3) to what extent it accommodates
   public concerns, and (4) how politically aligned crisis managers are in
   their communication. We analyse a dataset of 10 years of speeches and
   press releases of the governments of Austria, Germany, Ireland and the
   United Kingdom in addition to the EU's executive institutions (EU
   Commission and Councils). Drawing on different approaches to automated
   text analysis, we score texts on the four identified dimensions and draw
   dimensions together in a holistic similarity index. Results demonstrate
   the cohesion of crisis-relevant communication in contrast to
   non-relevant communication. They also show that accommodation, is
   consistently emphasised more in crisis than in non-crisis communication;
   however, political crisis managers have practiced a politics of fear
   rather than allaying concerns, potentially fuelling political
   frustration and disenchantment. In addition, the EU's crisis
   communication is not found to be different from communication about
   non-crisis topics, opening up avenues for future research concerned with
   legitimation processes at different political levels. Overall, the
   results do partly resonate with the insights provided by the existing
   literature but also shine a new, holistic light on how political
   executives have managed crises in the past decade.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the impact of reunification on the Bundestag from
   a historical institutionalist perspective. Accordingly, it focuses on
   procedural development and parties' behaviour. More specifically, it
   analyses parties' control of the legislative agenda and their
   willingness to obstruct this agenda. Prior to reunification, the
   Bundestag emerged as a working legislature with decentralised agenda
   control. Even though the Bundestag was vulnerable to obstruction,
   especially by questioning the quorum, obstructive behaviour virtually
   ceased after 1951. After reunification, the Bundestag's vulnerability
   was increased when a plenary `core time' was introduced in 1995.
   However, all parties, including the one most directly related to
   reunification, the Left Party, continued to abstain from exploiting
   procedural loopholes. Only the AfD as the other post-1990 newcomer
   (albeit less directly related to reunification) did so by questioning
   the quorum to an unprecedented extent after it entered the Bundestag in
   2017. So far, this systematic obstruction has only led to a
   path-dependent procedural reform. If, however, the AfD continues with
   this behaviour, it can be regarded as a threat to legislative democracy
   at least indirectly related to German reunification.},

Title = {Using the Narrative Policy Framework in the Teaching of Introduction to

Abstract = {In today's world characterized by political tribalism, narrative is an
   increasingly important concept for understanding politics. The Narrative
   Policy Framework (NPF) seeks to describe, explain, and predict the role
   of narrative in politics and policy. We wanted to explore whether the
   assumptions and postulates of the NPF could help students in
   Introduction to Politics: Critical Thinking and Analysis to understand
   how narrative relates to politics. We present the results of an
   introductory politics course taught at a public four-year university
   that used narrative as a central concept. We focused our course on
   cognitive processes such as confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance,
   political theory and political ideology, young people and politics,
   political tolerance, motivated reasoning, political identity, selective
   perception, the use of evidence, and fake news. We used the NPF to
   explore how narrative plays into each of these topics. Our findings
   suggest that students were surprised by the large role narrative plays
   in politics, and at the end of the course they better understood the
   role of narrative in the current state of United States politics. Some
   students, however, accepted narratives as being more reflective of
   political reality even when evidence presented in the course disputed
   the narrative. Of course, this may show the power of narrative,
   motivated reasoning, and political identity even among students who were
   primed to use critical reasoning when encountering narrative. We
   conclude that helping students understand the power of narrative, via
   the NPF, is one way to keep political science relevant to young people.},

Abstract = {The 2012 Syrian Constitution has been largely (dis)regarded as embodying
   a mere policy intent to placate contestation, leaving the resorts of
   monocratic power untouched. While this might be true, there were formal
   changes whose study is worthwhile to understand the possibilities for
   some degree of democratization. This article delves into the 2012
   charter and its main innovations, asking, first, from a
   descriptive-analytical perspective, what are the main trends underlying
   contemporary Syrian constitutional politics? Second, from an explanatory
   perspective, what specific constitutional provisions prevent the rule of
   law and the material constitutional transformation in democratic terms?
   What legal-institutional mechanisms account for this phenomenon? While
   the 2012 formal constitutional changes can be conceived as a `blueprint'
   revealing governmental priorities, the outstanding democratic deficits
   might help to identify the opposition's priorities. Together, they
   contribute to delineate a bargaining range for the ongoing constituent
   negotiations.},

Abstract = {This article introduces and discusses the findings of the Canada School
   Choice Policy Index (CSCPI). This is the first index of its kind that
   measures the development of school choice policies across the Canadian
   provinces from 1980 to 2020 using eight unique indicators of choice. In
   contrast to other countries in the Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD), the CSCPI reveals that although
   Canada has witnessed an increase in school choice over time, this
   increase has largely been contained within public education systems
   rather than in the expansion of private education options. Our findings
   raise the importance of future research to address growing choice in
   public education systems across the provinces, in addition to choice in
   the private sphere.},

Abstract = {The traditional welfare state, which emerged as a response to
   industrialization, is not well equipped to address the challenges of
   today's post-industrial knowledge economies. Experts and policymakers
   have therefore called for welfare state readjustment towards a `social
   investment' model (focusing on human skills and capabilities). Under
   what conditions are citizens willing to accept such future-oriented
   reforms? We point at the crucial but hitherto neglected role of
   citizens' trust in and satisfaction with government. Trust and
   satisfaction matter because future-oriented reforms generate
   uncertainties, risks and costs, which trust and government satisfaction
   can attenuate. We offer micro-level causal evidence using experiments in
   a representative survey covering eight European countries and confirm
   these findings with European Social Survey data for 22 countries. We
   find that trust and government satisfaction increase reform support and
   moderate the effects of self-interest and ideological standpoints. These
   findings have crucial implications not least because they help explain
   why some countries manage - but others fail - to enact important
   reforms.},

Title = {The Austrian-German Relationship in EMU Reform: From Asymmetric
   Partnership to Increased Independence},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {240-262},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {The relationship between Austria and Germany is characterised by many
   political and cultural commonalities and strong economic
   interdependencies. Moreover, the asymmetry between the two countries,
   both in terms of economic size and political power, has long time
   characterised the relationship as one between `leader' and `follower'.
   Yet, despite these strong ties, Austria has assumed an increasingly
   independent role in recent EMU politics. Therefore, this article asks
   whether and why the close partnership of the two countries is slowly
   growing apart. Based on the analysis of three periods of EMU reform, the
   article shows that Austria followed Germany during the fast-burning
   phase of the euro crisis (2010-12), became more self-reliant in its
   slow-burning phase (2012-16), and even opposed German positions in
   post-crisis reform (2016-20). Converging economic preferences and the
   strong power asymmetry between the two countries can explain Austria's
   cooperative strategy until 2016. By contrast, Austria's shift from loyal
   followership towards more pronounced independence is largely caused by
   domestic developments. The reluctance of the Austrian government to
   share risks and build joint capacities in EMU reflects a Europe-wide
   trend, as an increasing `constraining dissensus' at the national level
   makes it difficult for small state governments to compromise at the
   European level.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to demonstrate the concept of digital democracy and its
   ability to form attitudes and trends in public opinion and it also deals
   with the opportunities available for digital democracy to activate
   participatory democracy in the Palestinian territories and it also sheds
   light on the reality and challenges of digital democracy there. The
   study uses both the analytical descriptive and the historical
   approaches. The study concludes that Palestinian citizens lost their
   confidence in their appointed representatives due to the lack of
   practical mechanisms that stimulate the processes of participation.
   Because of that, the media and communication technology tools in
   Palestine have transformed among the citizens into a space for the
   exchange of ideas and information, as well as a space for dialogue and
   debate, and for raising issues of wide popular interest, far from the
   formal and traditional frameworks.},

   Interact to Affect Voter Responses to Candidates Accused of Harassment},

Abstract = {Public airing of incidents of sexual harassment have moved abuse from
   the shadows to the light, spurring mass response in the form of \#MeToo
   and ``Time's Up.{''} While sexual harassment holds negative valence,
   election outcomes suggest that not all voters punish leaders accused of
   harassment. We argue there is systematic variation in how voters respond
   to candidates accused of harassment because evaluations are made within
   the context of both partisanship and the gendered issue of sexual
   harassment. As a result, we expect to find distinct responses across
   four voter groups-Democratic women and men, and Republican women and men
   on the specific issue of harassment. We present supporting evidence from
   two survey experiments and a third associational study to show that
   Democratic women are most likely to electorally punish sexual harassers.
   Experimental evidence also shows that Republican men are least likely to
   electorally punish candidates accused of harassment.},

Abstract = {Political communication is a field of knowledge in the study of public
   opinion, inherent to Political Science. Numerous intellectuals
   throughout history have defended a political communication that seeks to
   promote civic responsibility and presents a democratizing character, in
   order to be cautious with the type of public opinion that is built in a
   society. In this paper we propose a critical analysis as a review with
   an interpretative hermeneutic approach, reviewing the theoretical
   tensions and positions in the 20th century, giving way to a research
   question: Has the technological revolution of the Internet in the 21st
   century helped those democratizing aspirations necessary for the
   informative task?},

Abstract = {This article explores Rush Limbaugh's efforts to tribalize American
   politics through his racially divisive, falsehood-ridden portrayal of
   President Obama. By playing and preying on white anxiety, the host laid
   the groundwork for the election of a president who essentially adopted
   his view of the Obama presidency. Limbaugh's rhetoric about Obama serves
   as a case study whereby the most influential part of the conservative
   media during those years represents the whole. ``How did we get
   here?{''} is the essential question right now in American politics. How
   did we go from a society that relatively easily elected Barack Obama
   twice to one that, popular vote loss aside, elected Donald Trump, and
   came within a small popular vote shift in three states from doing so
   again in 2020? Analyzing how Limbaugh ginned up white racial anxiety
   about a Black president helps us understand the rise of Trump, who began
   his White House campaign by serving as the nation's birther-in-chief and
   who, in his reaction to the white nationalist terrorist attack in
   Charlottesville, Virginia, to name just one example, demonstrated his
   reliance on white identity politics. As Jamelle Bouie wrote: ``You can
   draw a direct line to the rise of Trump from the racial hysteria of talk
   radio-where Rush Limbaugh, a Trump booster, warned that Obama would turn
   the world upside down.{''}},

Title = {Norm-Based Governance for Severe Collective Action Problems: Lessons

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},

Abstract = {The world has surpassed three million deaths from COVID-19, and faces
   potentially catastrophic tipping points in the global climate system.
   Despite the urgency, governments have struggled to address either
   problem. In this paper, we argue that COVID-19 and anthropogenic climate
   change (ACC) are critical examples of an emerging type of governance
   challenge: severe collective action problems that require significant
   individual behavior change under conditions of hyper-partisanship and
   scientific misinformation. Building on foundational political science
   work demonstrating the potential for norms (or informal rules of
   behavior) to solve collective action problems, we analyze more recent
   work on norms from neighboring disciplines to offer novel
   recommendations for more difficult challenges like COVID-19 and ACC. Key
   insights include more attention to 1) norm-based messaging strategies
   that appeal to individuals across the ideological spectrum or that
   reframe collective action as consistent with resistant subgroups'
   pre-existing values, 2) messages that emphasize both the prevalence and
   the social desirability of individual behaviors required to address
   these challenges, 3) careful use of public policies and incentives that
   make individual behavior change easier without threatening norm
   internalization, and 4) greater attention to epistemic norms governing
   trust in different information sources. We conclude by pointing out that
   COVID-19 and climate change are likely harbingers of other polarized
   collective action problems that governments will face in the future. By
   connecting work on norms and political governance with a broader,
   interdisciplinary literature on norm psychology, motivation, and
   behavior change, we aim to improve the ability of political scientists
   and policymakers to respond to these and future collective action
   challenges.},

Abstract = {In The Prince, Machiavelli often associates power with force and the
   ability to compel obedience. In the Discourses on Livy and Florentine
   Histories, however, he emphasizes the role that moral authority has
   played in the construction of princely power, especially in republics
   like ancient Rome and modern Florence. This article explores the
   alternative style of princely virtu that Machiavelli associates with
   these princes and contrasts it with cruder forms of fraud, like moral
   hypocrisy, playing the hero, and ideological innovation. Finally, it
   shows how Machiavelli's analysis of power and princely virtu constitutes
   a revival of the historiographic tradition epitomized by Thucydides,
   Sallust, and Tacitus, in which irony is used to critique the social
   grammars that princes have used to underwrite their domination.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a variety of deliberative
   practices in the organization and activities of political parties. What
   remains unclear, however, is how parties can promote deliberative
   democracy in an environment that remains predominantly representative.
   To investigate this tension, we study the Agora party in Brussels. Agora
   competed for the first time in the 2019 regional elections in Brussels
   with the aim of institutionalizing a permanent, randomly selected
   Citizen's Assembly with legislative power in the Brussels Capital Region
   and immediately gained a seat in the Brussels Regional Parliament. Based
   on an in-depth qualitative study including 20 semi-structured interviews
   with a broad range of party members and document analysis, we study
   whether and how Agora's organizational structure, i.e. its leadership
   and centralization, its intra-party democracy, and its organizational
   resources, allow it to promote deliberative democracy in a
   representative context. We argue that Agora experiences tensions between
   its deliberative ideals and its representative means and that there is a
   looming danger of becoming ``just another part{''} of the system.
   However, it succeeds in simultaneously rejecting and competing in the
   representative system by adopting a stratarchical party organization.},

Abstract = {How do public health crises affect peace? Guided by the understanding
   that peace has situational and relational dimensions, this study
   explored the impact of public health crises on peace using the 2020
   COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria as a case study. Data collected between
   March and July 2020 through in-depth interviews with 37 Nigerians,
   Nigerian media sources, and the website of Nigeria Interreligious
   Council (NIREC) indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak and state response
   to it had mixed effects on peace in Nigeria. The article argues that
   this has major implications for interreligious peace in Nigeria and
   other religiously diverse societies.},

Abstract = {Global forums on climate action consist of groups of countries that take
   climate action outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change. This analysis investigates in which global forums
   post-Communist countries participate and their motivation for it. The
   article draws from theories of policy diffusion to explain why
   post-Communist countries have joined such forums. It contends that the
   wish to follow the example of high-status countries , considerations
   concerning economic competitiveness, and the wish to obtain access to
   knowledge are potential factors explaining membership. Our findings
   suggest that access to knowledge was the most relevant driver of
   participation.},

Abstract = {Most scholars agree the rise of states led to modern territoriality. Yet
   globally the transition to precise boundaries occurred most often in
   colonies, and there are virtually no systematic explanations of its
   occurrence outside Europe. This article explains how precise boundaries
   emerged in the earliest context where they were regularly and generally
   implemented: seventeenth- and eighteenth-century colonial North America.
   Unlike explanations of modern territoriality in Europe, it argues
   property boundary surveys became an entrenched practice on the part of
   settlers and were a readily available response to intercolonial boundary
   disputes. After independence, settlers who were accustomed to surveys
   pursued linear boundaries with Britain, Spain, and Russia. Moreover, the
   article argues that linear borders (delimited linearly and typically
   physically demarcated), not sovereignty, are constitutive of modern
   territoriality. By disentangling the literature's Eurocentric confusion
   between modern territoriality and sovereign statehood, the article makes
   possible a global comparative study of the emergence of modern
   territoriality.},

Title = {Winning cures everything? Beliefs about voter fraud, voter confidence,
   and the 2016 election},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rhetoric about ``rigged{''} elections has raised concerns about the
   solidity of public trust in the integrity of the voting system.
   Mitigating these concerns, research by Sinclair et al. (2019) on the
   2016 U.S. presidential campaign documents a robust ``winner's effect{''}
   on voter confidence despite intense partisan messaging aimed at
   influencing citizens' acceptance of the legitimacy of the election. This
   suggests that regularly fluctuating electoral outcomes in competitive
   democracies limit the impact of elite messages on trust in electoral
   institutions. A critical question is whether similar dynamics apply to
   dimensions of electoral trust that are more clearly partisanbranded and
   targeted, such as beliefs about the prevalence of illicit voting. This
   paper uses a panel study with waves conducted before and after Election
   Day 2016 to compare the effect of election on beliefs about the extent
   of illicit voting and voter confidence. Underlining both the promise and
   limitations of democratic competition as a counterweight to elite
   efforts to sow electoral distrust, there are significant ``winner's
   effects{''} on both but substantially smaller impact on beliefs about
   illicit voting, a difference that is especially large among strong
   Republican partisans.},

Abstract = {The paper studies the gendered impact of the pandemic in a war ravaged
   Afghanistan. For majority of Afghan women, the onslaught of Covid has
   exacerbated their already dire condition and adversely impacted their
   social, economical, physical and cultural aspects of life. The research
   also underlines that the imposition of lockdown has caused the reversal
   of war gains. The paper also highlights the notable works of various
   Afghan women carried out during the corona pandemic that has contributed
   to their emancipation and upliftment of the society at large. It brings
   forth strong and courageous women who are combatting terrorism, everyday
   conflicts, frequent bombings, societal restrictions and now the deadly
   coronavirus and yet contributing majorly in re-building the Afghan
   society. This paper is an attempt to dispel the dominant narrative of
   their state of helplessness and despondency around Afghan women before
   the withdrawal of American troops and Taliban takeover. Both primary and
   secondary sources have complemented this research.},

Abstract = {Rationalism refers to a mode of theorizing that sees in universal reason
   the right tool to apprehend politics. It affirms that everything needs
   to be grounded in reason and it is optimistic that reason has the power
   to set all social and political institutions and practices on firm
   rational foundations. In this paper, I argue that this mode of
   theorizing is a source of epistemic violence in that it silences and
   distorts the voices of the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island. I
   firstly explain what this mode of theorizing is in greater detail. I
   secondly provide an account of the ways in which it is generally applied
   to the theorization of Indigenous peoples and to their political claims.
   Thirdly and fourthly, I explain how this rationalist mode of theorizing
   both silences and distorts the voices of Indigenous peoples. Finally, I
   explain what is entailed in opposing rationalism so as to hear
   Indigenous peoples in their own voices. I discuss two considerations
   about politics and political theory that should be kept in mind so as to
   avoid masking domination under the guise of reason and ignoring people's
   agency in determining the right structure of society.},

Abstract = {Universal basic income is an old idea that has experienced a surge in
   global attention. In many countries, it is creeping up the policy agenda
   as an alternative to traditional welfare. Yet, in Australia, the idea is
   mostly ignored by the two main political parties. Communication scholars
   have long contended that the media play a role in influencing opinion
   and setting the policy agenda. Using a framing approach, this study
   analyses how basic income was framed in 2018 by seven Australian
   newspapers and compares the results with those in countries where basic
   income has solidified a position in public discourse. We found that the
   mainstream media outlets in Australia are overtly hostile to the idea,
   which presents a significant obstacle to a universal basic income
   gaining legitimacy as a social policy.},

Abstract = {How do citizens change their voting decisions after their communities
   experience catastrophic violent events? The literature on the behavioral
   effects of violence, on the one hand, and on political behavior, on the
   other, suggest different answers to this question. Using a
   difference-in-differences approach, we investigate the influence of
   indiscriminate, rampage-style school shootings on both voter turnout
   levels and the relative electoral support for the Democratic and
   Republican Parties at the county level in US presidential elections
   (1980-2016). We find that although voter turnout does not change, the
   vote share of the Democratic Party increases by an average of nearly 5
   percentage points in counties that experienced shootings-a remarkable
   shift in an age of partisan polarization and close presidential
   elections. These results show that school shootings do have important
   electoral consequences and bring to the fore the need to further examine
   the effects of different forms of violence on political behavior.},

Abstract = {While the study of populism has typically focused on the national level,
   recent years have seen a growing body of research on populism's local
   dimensions. Despite making important scholarly advances, this `localist
   turn' has yet to develop a systematic account of how populism intersects
   with localism. In this research note, we broach this gap. By exploring
   how right- and left-wing populisms conceptualize the `local', as well as
   how localist sentiments can heighten or diminish the appeal of right and
   left populist politics, we establish a general framework to guide future
   inquiry into local manifestations of populist politics.},

Abstract = {The paper evaluates the convergence paths of Central and Eastern
   European member states of the EU during the 2010s, when the main task
   for these countries was avoiding the middle-income trap-when wages are
   not so low anymore to compete with less developed countries, while
   innovation is not developed enough yet to compete with developed
   countries. Using various statistical indicators, the paper shows that
   while most countries in the region have been on a convergence path
   during the decade under analysis, not all succeeded in avoiding the
   trap. While some countries successfully implemented policies to step on
   the path of productivity- and innovation-led growth (Czechia, Slovenia,
   Estonia, and Lithuania), in several other states, growth was supported
   mainly by low costs and loose monetary conditions including significant
   transfers from the EU. The comparative analysis of Estonia and Hungary
   illustrates the different growth models and shows how the institutional
   system plays a key role in exiting the trap.},

Abstract = {The ``white ballots{''} campaign in the 2012 parliamentary election in
   Serbia was accompanied by a change in the portion of invalid ballots,
   but also in their correlation with socio-demographic variables. When the
   percentage of invalid votes in the three previous elections is analyzed
   using the generalized least squares (GLS) multiple regression analysis,
   the percentage of inhabitants with incomplete primary education
   represents the best predictor. The percentage of individuals with
   primary education is also statistically relevant, just in the opposite
   (negative) direction, and less predictive. When GLS is applied to
   invalid votes in the 2012 election, incomplete primary education is
   positively, and primary education is negatively correlated with the
   criterion. The percentage of illiterates, the share of people over 65
   years of age and the degree of urbanization are significantly, but
   negatively related to the criterion. The consequences of the 2012
   election outcome were considered in the light of the regression to
   competitive authoritarianism.},

   Evidence from the 2020 George Floyd Protests},

Abstract = {Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black
   civilians have a widespread ``opinion-mobilizing{''} effect against the
   police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass
   opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer
   these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross
   sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in
   time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing
   of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd
   protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased
   perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically
   liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and
   politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced
   only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd
   protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the
   domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.},

Abstract = {Government Expenditure Revenue Scotland (GERS) remains a controversial
   statistical publication on Scotland's public finances. We trace the
   evolution of GERS over time, and track how it has been used in political
   debate since it was first published in 1992. Now in its 27th edition, we
   review its ongoing role in informing constitutional and fiscal debate in
   Scotland. We dispel some of the myths about the publication, but also
   highlight legitimate criticisms, and explore how it is used by both
   sides in the independence debate. Our main contribution is to summarise
   what GERS tells us - and crucially what it does not tell us - about the
   state of Scotland's economy and public finances. We conclude with an
   assessment of what GERS might tell us about the prospects for any future
   debate on Scottish independence.},

Abstract = {Far-right parties and pundits are often portrayed as parochial
   nationalists obsessed with the idea of national sovereignty. Opposed to
   a liberal world order, they prefer a rogue world of nation-states on the
   loose. This essay seeks to complicate that narrative. It suggests that
   alongside political parties with a nationalist agenda, an increasing
   number of voices on the radical Right are now pushing for a
   re-spiritualized world order in which cultures, civilizations, and
   empires are to set the scene. This vision of global order echoes
   Christopher Coker's recent claim that ``we now live in a world in which
   civilization is fast becoming the currency of international
   politics.{''} But, why does this strand of the far-right prefer
   civilizations to nation-states? To ponder this question, this essay
   zooms in on the European New Right and more precisely two of its main
   luminaries, Alain de Benoist and Aleksandr Dugin. It shows how the New
   Right stretches back to classical geopolitics to imagine a future
   polycentric world order in which large civilizations are set free from
   American hegemony. The empires of the future are no longer underpinned
   by nation-states but by ethnopluralism-a ``blossoming variety{''} of
   local, ethnic, agrarian polities.},

Abstract = {German governments, dominated by the conservative CDU/CSU, have
   historically not been at the forefront in recognising LGBTI rights in
   Europe. Yet, significant advances have occurred under Angela Merkel's
   leadership since 2005. This article seeks to understand the conditions
   under which these unexpected advances have occurred, to what degree
   Merkel and her government facilitated or obstructed them, and which
   groups benefitted from these advances. I use parliamentary questions,
   coalition agreements and party programmes to map the expansion of LGBTI
   rights and the forces Merkel and her government had to navigate.
   Comparing the four terms of Merkel's chancellorship, I find that she
   played a passive or indirectly facilitating role, only moving on LGBTI
   issues when pressured by international norms, the Federal Constitutional
   Court or electoral pressure. Although LGBTI interests are increasingly
   visible on the political agenda, the advances made did not benefit all
   groups under the LBGTI-umbrella equally, as bisexual, trans{*} and
   intersex interests remain mostly invisible. Taking a birds-eye view of
   Merkel's chancellorship I illustrate how and what kind of change can
   occur under conservative-led governments.},

Abstract = {This article studies sovereignty not only in relation to state,
   identity, or power but also in relation to the distinction between
   concepts of `loneliness' and `solitude.' Considering this goal, it
   analyses `loneliness' as a concept with potentially deep explanatory
   value when posing major questions in political theory. It also explores
   its relationship with `sovereignty' and `political identity.' Building
   on the existing literature on the connection between sovereignty and
   collective identity, this study extends such analysis towards a
   consideration of the interconnection between sovereignty and different
   forms of loneliness and relates them to `vertical' and `horizontal'
   modes of `organized loneliness.' The main aim is to use the framework of
   political representations of emotions to illustrate how a particular
   type of `loneliness' - `loneliness anxiety' - is filled with political
   reason. In empirical part, the article illustrates three specific models
   in which the `management of loneliness anxiety' may provide legitimacy,
   including for Russia's conservative ideological program of
   `state-civilization' and new 2020 amendments to constitution.},

Abstract = {How does the internet affect the radicalisation of extreme-right lone
   actor terrorists? In the absence of an established theoretical model,
   this article identifies six mechanisms seen as particularly relevant for
   explaining online radicalisation. Having first reviewed a larger set of
   relevant lone actor terrorists, the study traces these mechanisms in
   three selected cases where the internet was reportedly used extensively
   during radicalisation. The findings show that the internet primarily
   facilitated radicalisation through information provision, as well as
   amplifying group polarisation and legitimising extreme ideology and
   violence through echoing. In all three cases, radicalisation was also
   affected considerably by offline push-factors that through their
   presence made extreme online messages more impactful. The results
   challenge the view that offline interaction is necessary for
   radicalisation to occur but also the view that online influence itself
   is sufficient.},

Abstract = {What types of foreign policy cues are most likely to turn public opinion
   against a popular emerging norm? Since 2017, the US government has
   sought to discredit the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and
   its nuclear nonpossession norm among the largely prodisarmament American
   public. We fielded a national US survey experiment (N=1,219) to evaluate
   the effects of these elite cues as well as social group cues on public
   opinion. Our study thus offers one of the first experimental assessments
   of public attitudes toward nuclear disarmament. We find that both
   negative government messages and group cues can shift attitudes. Direct
   exposure to official rhetoric-particularly substantive security and
   institutional critiques-most effectively increases opposition to the
   norm. Yet, we observe that all cues have little effect on respondents'
   existing opposition to nuclear arms. The American population may support
   eventually eliminating nuclear weapons, but majority backing for
   immediate disarmament appears far from assured.},

Abstract = {The positive impact of descriptive representation upon congressional
   committees' work is well-documented in the literature: more racially
   diverse chamber membership and leadership increases racially salient
   committee activity. However, the possible descriptive effects of
   racially diverse congressional committees remain unexamined. A new
   dataset records the numbers of Black and Latinx members on all standing
   committees in the House from the 80th through 114th Congresses.
   Committees with higher numbers of Black members are more likely to hold
   racially salient hearings and hold a greater volume of such hearings.
   The effect remains even after controlling for committee jurisdiction,
   the race of the committee chair, and House diversity. Though Latinx
   membership on committees does not have a statistically significant
   effect upon racially salient hearings by those committees, the new data
   indicates the comparatively smaller numbers of Latinx members on
   committees as a likely explanation. The results for Black committee
   members indicate that representation of racially salient concerns
   requires not only a racially diverse legislative body but racially
   diverse committees. A thorough exploration of descriptive representation
   in legislative action must include consideration of committee diversity
   as an important piece of the puzzle.},

Abstract = {Recent debates about enfranchising incarcerated people raise the
   question of how many additional votes such policies would generate.
   Existing research finds very low voter participation among previously
   incarcerated people, but it remains unclear how often people might vote
   from prison if given the opportunity. We use data from states that allow
   people to vote while incarcerated for felony crimes, to address this
   question. We merge prison records with the voter file to estimate how
   many currently incarcerated people are registered and voted in recent
   elections. Estimates suggest very few (under one in 10) eligible
   incarcerated voters in Vermont and Maine voted in the 2018 election.
   Given the winning margins in other states' recent elections, these
   estimates suggest that enfranchising currently incarcerated people would
   likely not have changed these statewide election outcomes. We conclude
   that debates about enfranchisement should focus less on anticipated
   electoral effects and more on normative issues.</p>},

   Marxist-Leninist states of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Despite
   espousing an initial shared ideological commitment toward curbing the
   influence of domestic religion, actual regime policies toward these
   groups have varied considerably over time. I argue that the explanation
   for this difference can be found in unpacking the strength of each
   regime's state apparatus. This article introduces a new typological
   theory for understanding how state capacity has shaped the divergent
   strategies Cambodian, Lao and Vietnamese regimes have employed to manage
   organized religion during the post-Vietnam War era (1975 to present). In
   brief, I argue that regime elites in Vietnam have successfully co-opted
   organized religion through the state bureaucracy. Conversely,
   Marxist-inspired regimes in Cambodia and Laos have oscillated between
   policies of coercive violence and strategic accommodation to dilute the
   power of domestic religious groups.},

Abstract = {Leader evaluations are a crucial aspect in representative democracy. We
   analyse the patterns, antecedents and consequences of European Union
   leader evaluations against the backdrop of the 2019 European Parliament
   elections in ten countries. The article shows, firstly, that leader
   evaluations are unidimensional, both among voters with low and high
   knowledge as well as partisans and non-partisans. Secondly, among the
   antecedents of leader evaluations, European Union trust and performance
   evaluations are positively associated with leader evaluations, while
   European identity hardly plays a role compared to other factors. Lastly,
   the positive effect of leader evaluations on vote choice is conditional
   upon the individual leader and their party affiliation. Our results have
   important implications for expectations towards and evaluations of
   European Union leadership in the long term.},

Title = {Learning to be Legal: Transition Narratives of Joy and Survivor Guilt of
   Previously Undocumented 1.5-Generation Latinx Immigrants in the United

Abstract = {Relying on in-depth interviews and ethnographic research in California
   (2011-2018), this article theorizes the experiences of politicized,
   1.5-generation Latinx immigrants who have transitioned out of
   undocumented status. It shows that transitioning out of undocumented
   status comes with feelings of joy and privilege, as well as with
   feelings of survivor guilt, ontological fragmentation, and wanting to
   take up new responsibilities as a way of repaying, and standing in
   solidarity with, undocumented family and community members. I argue that
   the transitioning experiences of previously undocumented immigrants
   relate to (1) their mixed-status families in the context of uneven
   penalization of undocumented immigrants, (2) the immigrant narrative of
   struggle and sacrifice, (3) politicization, pressure, and social control
   within the immigrant rights movement, and (4) their durably embodied
   undocumented subjectivities. This paper thereby advances more relational
   understandings of citizenship, (political) subjectivity, and the
   profound effects of legal violence caused by the citizenship regime.},

Abstract = {Is it possible to form ``soft autocracy{''} that manages citizens by
   taking away their sense of resistance? This paper suggests that the rise
   of entertainment media in autocracies enables the rulers to maintain
   their resilience through a soft approach, thereby avoiding costly
   heavy-handed measures. Such a soft approach can work because
   entertainment media, like ``fictitious pleasure drugs,{''} undo
   audiences' sophistication so that people are susceptible to autocratic
   propaganda. By analyzing a Chinese data set, via instrumented
   regressions, this paper shows that a one standard deviation increase in
   people's interest in entertainment media is associated with an increase
   of almost 20\% in both their satisfaction with the current regime and
   their anti-Western hostility. Furthermore, the findings show a positive
   relationship between people's entertainment media interest and their
   acceptation of indoctrination by state media. In short, entertainment
   media contribute to China's regime stability through ``amusing ordinary
   citizens to loyalty.{''}},

Abstract = {Dense networks are supposed to allow political machines to solve the
   ``commitment problem{''} that is typical for electoral mobilization.
   Highlighting the effect of dense networks, we study the features of
   local communities that facilitate their emergence: countryside, small
   size of a settlement, and ``segregated{''} type of ethnic groups'
   localization in relation to each other. On the ground of the 2016 Duma
   elections, an original dataset based on local-level data and GIS
   techniques, we examine these attributes of local units in the
   combination with ethnic structure, and find moderator-type effects that
   indirectly prove the importance of dense networks in electoral
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {The article examines Kazakhstan's relations with Southeast Asia, an area
   of study which has been given little attention so far. It firstly
   analyzes Kazakhstan's multivector foreign policy, arguing that
   Kazakhstan has been trying to pursue an omnidirectional hedging strategy
   by diversifying its partners to enhance its strategic space. Secondly,
   it looks at how Southeast Asia is seen as part of this strategy,
   particularly as alternative economic partners for Kazakhstan. It argues
   that there are greater opportunities for enhanced economic interaction
   due to Kazakhstan's central role in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
   membership of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) that is shifting toward
   Asia, and reinvigorated economic diplomacy. Thirdly, it examines
   Kazakhstan's relations with five key Southeast Asian states - Singapore,
   Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand - which are Kazakhstan's
   largest trading partners in the region and arguably viewed as the
   Southeast Asian countries with the most potential to play a role in
   Kazakhstan's omnidirectional hedging strategy.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the question of whether international democracy
   aid helps to protect presidential term limits - a commonly accepted but
   increasingly challenged safeguard for democracy. According to our
   analysis, democracy aid is effective in countering attempts to
   circumvent term limits, thus, it contributed towards protecting
   democratic standards in African and Latin American countries between
   1990 and 2014. Democracy aid helps to fend off term-limit
   circumventions, but it is not as effective in deterring presidents from
   trying to circumvent presidential term limits. Our analysis furthermore
   suggests that there is double the risk of an attempt to circumvent term
   limits in Latin American than in African states. Although our results
   confirm prior findings that ``targeted aid{''} such as democracy aid
   makes a difference for maintaining democratic institutions, it
   challenges studies that argue democracy assistance has become
   ``tame.{''} Our findings furthermore support previous indications that
   more refined theories on the effects of democracy aid in different
   phases of domestic processes are necessary, in particular in the face of
   global autocratization trends.},

Title = {When Religion Speaks: Denmark's Face Covering Ban and European Human
   Rights Law},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {420-439},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {This article argues that although the challenges brought against banning
   face coverings in public spaces have so far been ineffective before the
   ECtHR, the particular situation obtaining in Denmark, the evolving case
   law regarding ECHR's Article 14 freedom from discrimination, and a
   re-examination of the distinction between protection of religious
   manifestation under Article 9 and expression under Article 10 could
   suggest a different outcome in future. This is because the ECtHR's
   jurisprudence regarding face covering bans does not consider the context
   of those bans or the possibility of non-religious claims. Specifically,
   this article examines two important contextual distinctions that suggest
   that challenges to face covering bans in countries other than France
   might find a different outcome: (1) the historical context of the
   political and constitutional debates (or lack thereof) surrounding the
   ban in specific countries and contemporaneous legislation and policy
   regarding Muslims and minorities and (2) the missing legal context that
   the Court could, and we argue should, use to inform the claims of veil
   wearers, namely, vulnerability and indirect discrimination stemming from
   Article 14 jurisprudence and the separate expression rights under
   Article 10.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},

Number = {3-4},

Abstract = {Current research has identified practices of ethnic closure and
   discrimination regarding voluntary positions in sports clubs. This
   article explores whether people with migration background differ in
   terms of taking on voluntary tasks from people without migration
   background. The analyses build on data from the project `Social
   Inclusion and Volunteering in Sports Clubs in Europe' (SIVSCE) that
   includes information about volunteering, as well as, individual
   characteristics of the members (n = 10,641) in voluntary sports clubs
   (VSCs) from ten European countries. When differentiating between first
   and second-generation migrants, the findings show that for all the
   examined voluntary tasks in VSCs, second-generation migrants are
   significantly better represented than first-generation migrants.
   Multiple regression analyses for different voluntary tasks indicate that
   direct effects of migration status disappear under the control of other
   socio-economic and membership-related variables. This indicates that the
   underrepresentation of first-generation migrants in the different task
   areas is not greatly influenced by ethnic closure and discrimination in
   the recruiting practices of the clubs, rather differences in
   volunteering are associated with variances of underlying individual
   characteristics such as educational level and membership duration.},

   attempts to theorize a transition to socialism. This essay offers a
   critical reading of Robert Linhart's contributions on this subject and
   compares his approach with Charles Bettelheim's own positions, including
   their dialogue that appeared in the journal Communisme in 1977. The
   essay suggests that a return to these debates is important for any
   attempt to theorize socialist transition.},
