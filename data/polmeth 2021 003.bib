Abstract = {The Philosophy of Right presents us with a vision of bureaucratic
   paternalism that is designed to check the excesses of free markets set
   in motion by the triumph of natural-law thinking, which abstracted the
   principles of private property and subjective freedom from the
   institutions that had tamed them and situated them in a stable context.
   Against these excesses Hegel pits the agricultural estate, which has not
   succumbed to natural-law thinking; and a ``universal estate{''} of
   bureaucrats who are educated in Hegel's philosophy itself, freeing them
   of the natural-law conflation of human needs with arbitrary and
   endlessly expanding preferences. Taught by Hegel to look after the needs
   of the organic whole that is society rather than the gratification of
   their own preferences, the task of the bureaucrats of the universal
   estate is to curb the tendency of free markets to produce the social
   preconditions for an alienated ``rabble{''} to bring down the system.},

Abstract = {The snowball sampling method (SSM) is one of the most widely used
   methods to collect information about hard-to-reach populations and in
   low-information contexts. This article argues that SSM can be enhanced
   by the use of Facebook in at least three ways. This social-networking
   site helps to address some of the inherent limitations of SSM by
   learning about local contexts and identifying principal political
   actors, by gathering background information about and establishing
   contact with them, and by triangulating information they provide and
   reaching out to additional key informants. Thus, this article shows how
   Facebook can provide leverage in overcoming the problem of biased
   samples and offers concrete empirical illustrations from research on
   local politics in Latin American countries.},

Abstract = {The Complete Systematic Land Registration Program is an effort of the
   Central and Local Governments to overcome various common problems in the
   agrarian sector. Through the granting of the legalization of assets, it
   is expected that the restructuring, ownership, use, and utilization of
   land can be carried out to create justice in the field of land tenure
   and ownership. This type of research is a qualitative descriptive study
   using a case study approach. Interviews, observations, library studies,
   or documentation are data collection techniques and data processing is
   carried out using Nvivo 12 Plus software. The results showed that the
   Complete Systematic Land Registration is an effort of the Central and
   Local Governments to accelerate the process of providing guarantees and
   protection of land rights in all regions of Indonesia. Complete
   systematic land registration program implementation in Aceh specifically
   Banda Aceh City and South Aceh District in general has been running well

Abstract = {Two decades after the twin towers collapsed, the identification of
   global terrorism still remains an open question for everyone. However,
   since 9/11, the trope of the virus entered the scholarly discourses as
   well as the sociopolitical debate. This investigation is aimed at moving
   from the metaphor of terrorism as a virus to the virus-like pathogenic
   processes that affect terror threats. The proposal is to highlight the
   fluid identity of a main viral phenomenon of evildoing, according to a
   strict dialogue with the microbiological domain. New lenses are needed.
   As the author argues, systemic thinking better suits this subject matter
   than traditional linear thinking. The author will seek to highlight the
   development of global terrorism in terms of the biological mechanism of
   the virus's life (pathogenesis). Finally, it will be assumed that
   through the subject matter of global threat philosophy can improve the
   understanding of a dynamic principle of identity suitable to living
   entities/open systems.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on the general elections that took place in April
   2019 in Spain. It analyzes the broadcast of the speeches performed by
   the main candidates through Twitter (tweets, retweets, comments and
   likes). A quantitative and qualitative analysis were carried out on the
   data offered by the candidates on the social network Twitter. The
   working hypotheses are related to the characteristics of the main
   studies in the area. The depersonalization and unidirectionality of
   existing political discourses in Spain are analyzed, as well as the
   characteristics of their speeches on Twitter through four main
   variables: level of preferences, interaction, originality and visual
   tendency. A NSA analysis was also carried out in reference to the
   connection nodes in Twitter network. Track and monitoring of Twitter
   have been carried out following the methodological principles of
   contemporary netnography during the last ten weeks before the elections.
   Among the main conclusions, it must be highlighted that one of the main
   deficiencies in the political discourse on Twitter is the lack of debate
   and interaction with users. The present work corroborates the hypotheses
   of similar works, it is the polarization of the discourses of political
   parties on Internet and the utopian democratization of the use of social
   networks by politicians and citizens.},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is occurring, unavoidably,
   within the broader civic context of today's extraordinarily polarizing
   political times. We seek to help students situate themselves with
   respect to and, above all, thoughtfully assess others' as well as their
   own perspectives on issues of profound contention, without contributing
   to exacerbated polarization ourselves. Specifically, we offer students
   in our first-year exploratory political science course a vital
   tool-critical rigor-for navigating but not being inundated by the storm.
   This article discusses our experiences in teaching the course titled,
   ``The Worlds of Politics,{''} as we attempt to help students deeply
   engage in cognitive processes of critical thinking and analysis, without
   undue infringement from their own-and least of all our own-personal
   political biases. Our focal learning objective is the cultivation of
   critical-thinking skills that promote students' drawing of distinctions
   between advocacy and analysis, as well as their discerning civic
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Intraparty caucuses in the US Congress are often recognized for the
   information sharing, voting blocs, and personal relationships they
   facilitate. This article introduces an additional benefit to joining
   intraparty caucuses: campaign donations. Applying social network
   analysis and exponential random graph models to the 115th and 116th
   Congresses, I find that members are more likely to donate to their
   fellow caucus members than other members in Congress. In addition, I
   find that party leaders, particularly Republican party leaders, are less
   likely to donate to members that join intraparty caucuses, indicating
   that Leadership PAC funding is strategic for rank-and-file members and
   party leaders alike. This article adds to our understanding of
   intraparty caucuses, particularly their role in facilitating
   member-to-member campaign donations, and the relationship between caucus
   members and party leaders.},

Abstract = {Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the
   composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are
   one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the
   political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with
   more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political
   views of the two biggest US multiracial groups-White-Asians and
   White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that
   linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in
   explaining multiracials' political attitudes. Leveraging the largest
   national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that
   White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more
   progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and
   racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We
   argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely
   to benefit the Democratic Party.},

Abstract = {Why is politics dominated by wealthy men, and how do gendered and class
   barriers to running for office intersect? This article addresses these
   questions using the UK as a case study. Drawing on interview data, I
   highlight the formal and informal institutions that shape the class and
   glass ceilings in electoral politics. I identify how the high personal
   costs of running for office, especially in relation to candidates' time,
   present a barrier to those without significant financial resources.
   These costs are gendered, as women typically have less time and money
   than men. These resource barriers are compounded by additional gendered
   obstacles including discrimination, abuse and gendered family roles. I
   find that the intersection of the class and glass ceilings creates
   cumulative barriers that are particularly prohibitive for working-class
   women. The findings extend our understanding of class and gender gaps
   within politics and, crucially, the intersection between them.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Candidate `authenticity' has become a frequent explanation of electoral
   performance. Yet its study in electoral research has been largely
   neglected. Building on recent work, we test its relationship with
   candidate support in the 2020 Iowa Democratic Caucus through a survey of
   likely Caucus goers. The Caucus offers an ideal setting - a contest
   focused on candidates and their personalities, in a context having
   far-reaching political implications. We demonstrate that authenticity
   perceptions played an important role in individual vote intentions.
   Indeed, for Biden and Buttigieg perceptions of their authenticity were
   strongly associated with vote intention even when controlling for other
   established traits. Warren, unlike the others, benefited indirectly,
   because her authenticity triggered substantial support among female
   voters. The performance of the authenticity trait, direct and indirect,
   points to its pivotal potential in the 2020 presidential campaign.},

Abstract = {Existing research has tended to examine party manifesto appeals to women
   voters as a homogenous group however we know relatively little about how
   parties appeal to different groups of women voters. Yet there are strong
   incentives for parties to respond to and reflect diversity in women's
   voting behaviour. Through a gendered analysis of party manifestos at the
   2015, 2017 and 2019 British general elections, we investigate the spread
   and reach of parties' policy appeals to women voters. We find that,
   while the principal state-wide parties are increasingly recognizing
   women's diversity in their policy pledges, some groups of women remain
   marginalized from parties' electoral agendas. Our findings extend the
   empirical and analytical understanding of how political parties make
   gendered appeals during election times and to whom. We argue the way
   parties seek to appeal to the diversity of women is important for the
   analysis of both issue ownership and interparty competition for women's
   votes. Additionally, we make a normative case for parties to recognize
   diversity and intersectionality in their manifesto policy promises.},

Abstract = {For the ten years prior to the Turkish partition of Cyprus into Greek
   and Turkish Cypriot zones, the Turkish Cypriot community lived in
   distinct ethnic enclaves governed by a parallel Turkish Cypriot
   administration. I argue that Turkish Cypriot elites formed a system of
   reciprocal relations with their community by acting as ethnic protection
   racketeers. With few material resources, but a demand for protection
   during intercommunal fighting, Turkish Cypriot leaders monopolised
   protection over and within enclaves, while also deterring co-ethnics
   from leaving their protection despite poor conditions. Ultimately, this
   influenced Turkish Cypriot preferences in UN-led talks, demanding to
   retain autonomy over specific territories they controlled, especially in
   providing security.},

Abstract = {In the vast literature on terrorism the choice of weapons has received
   relatively limited attention, despite the importance and visibility of
   this topic. Building on the literature on innovation in terrorism, the
   article first proposes a multi-level analytical framework that helps
   study terrorist weapon selection. It then investigates the use of
   weapons in jihadist attacks in Europe from 2014, with the rise of the
   so-called Islamic State, until 2020, based on an original database. The
   empirical analysis shows that the two traditional types of weapon of
   modern terrorism, firearms and explosives, were largely replaced by more
   primitive tools like melee weapons. In fact, in recent years jihadist
   terrorists in Europe have become less technologically advanced. Based on
   the original analytical framework, the article examines the reasons of
   this evolution, paying special attention to the use of the most common
   type of weapon in the database, bladed weapons, and the most lethal
   type, firearms.},

Abstract = {This essay is a survey of the field of Armenian Genocide studies, which
   outlines its academic development over the past sixty years and the
   conditions of its production. The latter refers to the state-sponsored
   denial of the Armenian Genocide by Turkey, and to the collusion, or at
   least acquiescence, of some Middle East studies scholars or
   organizations with such a denial. The essay assesses the state of the
   current historiography and the issue of access to the main relevant
   archival sources. Finally, it points to some of the current debates and
   gaps in the existing literature, and possibly to the road that lies
   ahead.1},

Abstract = {Staples industries dominated Quebec's forestry sector, with the State
   conceding near-exclusive exploitation rights of the province's public
   forests to large companies exporting minimally processed wood products.
   In 2013, a new law modified the forest regime and pointed to a
   transition towards a post-staples economy. However, when examining the
   role of the State during the period leading up to and that following the
   implementation of the new law, a more nuanced reading of the new forest
   regime emerges. Drawing on two typologies of the State, Ricardian and
   Schumpeterian, this article depicts a non-linear trajectory of the
   forest sector in Quebec.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to suggest that the emergence of the so-called
   Cambridge School of history of political thought can best be understood
   in terms of two competing visions of the relationship between history
   and social science, focusing on Peter Laslett and Quentin Skinner.
   Although Laslett is often distinguished as a founder of the Cambridge
   School, this paper suggests an alternative view by emphasizing the
   theoretical discontinuity between Laslett and Skinner rather than their
   continuity. Laslett, a practitioner of Karl Manheim's ideas, promoted
   the idea of a comprehensive scientific social history, within which
   intellectual history was located. This paper argues that Skinner broke
   with Laslett's idea. For Skinner, (1) Laslett was a positivist who
   applied the natural scientific model to intellectual history; (2)
   Laslett's positivism was actually `contextualism'; and (3) the
   alternative to Laslett's contextualism was the history of ideology.
   Skinner's early methodology was, in part, a rhetorical redescription of
   `ideology', which opposed both Mannheim and Laslett. As such, this paper
   focuses on the discursive disconnection between Laslett and Skinner,
   thus providing a clue to construct a platform for facilitating a further
   discussion of the history of ideas and the social sciences.},

Abstract = {On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente powers of Britain, France, and Russia
   issued a joint declaration that qualified the massacres, imprisonments
   and violence inflicted on the peaceful Armenian population as ``crimes
   against humanity and civilization.{''} The concept of crimes against
   humanity was further developed and explained by the Commission on the
   Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties
   (hereinafter: Commission), which was formed during the Paris Peace
   Conference to investigate violations of the laws and customs of war and
   prosecute war criminals. This article traces the evolution of
   discussions held within the Commission regarding the atrocities
   committed by the Ottoman Turkish government against its Armenian
   population, which technically fell outside the jurisdiction of the
   crimes specified in these talks, as the atrocities were committed not
   against the population of a belligerent state but, rather, against their
   own nationals. These discussions played a major part in the development
   of international criminal law; particularly of the concept of crimes
   against humanity. The Armenian Memorandum and the list of perpetrators
   of the Armenian atrocities were also presented to the Commission, which
   (together with other data and information collected) identified the
   crimes committed against the Armenian population by the Ottoman
   authorities, thus defining the concept of crimes against humanity and
   the acts that fell within its scope. Although post-World War I efforts
   for justice are generally assessed as a failed effort, crimes against
   humanity first materialized as a term in international law during this
   period and its development was based on the Armenian atrocities, which
   provided a critical basis for the International Military Tribunal's
   later convictions and contributed to the concept's evolution into its
   present-day significance.},

Abstract = {During his presidency, Barack Obama described rising economic inequality
   as ``the defining challenge of our time.{''} But a growing number of
   scholars and journalists argue that rising inequality is in part a
   result of the Democratic Party's diminishing fidelity to an egalitarian
   economic agenda and its embrace of neoliberalism. In this article, we
   assess the veracity of this claim through a content analysis of all
   national Democratic Party platforms issued since 1984. We find that
   broad assertions of Democratic retreat from economic equality are for
   themost part exaggerated. Specifically, we argue that Democrats' support
   for egalitarian policies has been complex and varied over time, with a
   marked decline under the influence of the New Democrats in the 1990s
   followed by a significant resurgence thereafter. However, while party
   support for equalizing policies has rebounded overall, the extent of the
   party's commitment to specific policies varies according to the
   purported deservingness of beneficiaries. Our findings have important
   implications for debates concerning Democratic Party change, the
   politics of inequality, and the policy agenda of the Joe Biden
   administration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that electoral context affects the projection
   mechanisms inherent within polling. This insight applies both to the
   estimation of party vote shares by pollsters and to poll-based seat
   projections. To test this argument, we analyse 794 in-campaign polls
   covering the UK's 21 post-war general elections, as well as an updated
   version of Jennings and Wlezien's (Jennings, Will, and Christopher
   Wlezien. 2018. ``Election Polling Errors Across Time and Space.{''}
   Nature Human Behaviour 2 (4): 276-283) international polling dataset. We
   demonstrate that the election level houses a substantial portion of the
   observed variance within polling error. This finding is valid across
   several modelling approaches and a range of measures of polling accuracy
   both within and beyond the UK. Within the UK, we show that the election
   level is a particularly important locus of variance when it comes to
   analysing whether polls give rise to misleading expectations concerning
   seat distributions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the discourse surrounding children of Southeast Asian
   (SEA) marriage migrants in Taiwan has seen a dramatic shift from the
   discourse of `social problems' to that of `social assets'. By
   integrating perspectives of critical geopolitics and critical discourse
   analysis, this paper shows that this discursive shift has resulted from
   the dual impacts of the `mother-child dyadic citizenship' and the
   geopolitics of the triad of Taiwan, SEA, and China. It is argued that
   the state formulates laws and policies concerning marriage migration
   based on the mother-child dyad rather than the individual-state nexus,
   while SEA is used merely as leverage against China. Moreover, confronted
   with an increasingly competitive global economy, especially the
   impending threat of a rising PRC, Taiwan's immigration laws have become
   more classist, discriminating against Southeast Asian marriage migrants
   in contradiction with the current positive discourse, which reveals that
   the state-citizen relationship has evolved into a corporate-consumer
   relationship.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Existing research about the effects of electoral systems on descriptive
   representation is mixed. In this paper, we test implications of
   theoretical arguments about the impact of electoral rules on voters'
   propensity to vote for women candidates. We conducted a survey
   experiment during the 2017 provincial election in British Columbia,
   Canada, using actual candidates in both real and hypothetical electoral
   districts. We find that more permissive, or candidate-centered, forms of
   proportional representation do not improve descriptive representation of
   women; if anything, they diminish it. We interpret these results as
   being driven by the supply of candidates - voters tend to vote for
   incumbent, well-known candidates who happen to be predominantly men. Our
   findings provide a cautionary note about how electoral rules can
   interact with real-world experiences and conditions.},

Abstract = {Although regional governments play vital roles in most political
   systems, citizens' perceptions regarding regional authority are only
   rarely studied. Relying on the International Constitutional Values
   Survey held among more than 6,000 respondents from 142 regions in eight
   countries, we develop measures to tap into citizens' preferences for
   self-rule-i.e., for autonomy for their region-and citizens' preferences
   for shared rule-i.e., for regional engagement in national
   decision-making. A majority of citizens prefer their regional
   governments to have some level of both self-rule and shared rule, but
   around a quarter of the citizens prefer their region to have more
   self-rule and less shared rule or vice versa. The analysis reveals these
   varying preferences are associated with a region's actual authority and
   regional identity. These results are important because they indicate
   that most citizens do not presume increased self-rule to be the main or
   only path to a strong regional authority.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {582-608},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The 2021 transition will be remembered as the most tumultuous in over a
   century. President Trump sought to delegitimize the presidential
   election as flawed and refused to concede his loss, and several of his
   departments and agencies slow-walked their cooperation with the incoming
   team. Further, the insurrection on the Capitol and the Trump impeachment
   trial brought more turmoil. The question this article will consider is
   how, in such an environment, did Joseph R. Biden manage to complete the
   basic transition preparations needed to get off to the fast and
   effective start his administration had? A presidential transition has
   two dominant threads that come together to pave the path to a productive
   beginning. In 2020, early transition planning by the Biden team and
   existing laws detailing what resources the federal government will
   provide, when, and under what conditions were two important elements in
   his successful transition. Additionally, an effective transition depends
   on people leading it who have experience in both management and
   government service. The 2020-2021 transition had both.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {916-926},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {How parties compete by utilizing frames in the public debate is not well
   understood. A widespread understanding is that parties tend to compete
   by talking past each other, i.e. when they utilize dissimilar frames.
   This article relies on a unique data set of parties' framing of four
   individual policy questions over two decades in Denmark to examine frame
   overlap, i.e. when parties adopt similar frames. Results show that
   parties utilize similar and dissimilar frames in the public debate.
   However, a high degree of frame similarity was generally found across
   parliamentary blocs (between the leading mainstream party from each
   bloc, their leading junior coalition partner, and the two blocs) and
   most often a very high degree of overlap was found within parliamentary
   blocs (between the leading mainstream party and its junior coalition
   partner). This result suggests a need to rethink thoroughly how to
   understand and study interaction among parties utilizing frames.},

Abstract = {What is the role of economic interdependence with foreign powers when
   legislators vote on foreign policies? Foreign aid and trade are among
   the European Union's most important foreign policy instruments, over
   which the European Parliament has veto power. Yet, few studies address
   foreign economic policy voting in European Parliament scholarship. This
   study presents a new theoretical model about economic interdependence
   and foreign policy positioning in the European Parliament. I argue that
   economic interdependence with major foreign powers is associated with
   legislators' foreign policy positions. Analysing European Parliament
   votes concerning aid and trade with Ukraine, I show a statistical
   association between Members of the European Parliaments with high levels
   of Russian Foreign Direct Investment in their electoral districts and
   voting against aid and trade with Ukraine (supporting the pro-Russian
   policy). These findings offer new insights on Members of the European
   Parliaments' position-taking in foreign economic policy decisions that
   have global economic and political ramifications.},

Title = {The (a)symmetric effects of income and unemployment on popular demand
   for redistribution},

Abstract = {Numerous studies show that those with lower income and the unemployed
   support more redistribution, which is attributed to material
   self-interest. However, recent studies assessing within-individual
   changes result in smaller and less consistent effect estimates. To
   explain why preferences do not narrowly follow material self-interest,
   this study argues that the effects of income and unemployment may be
   asymmetric, implying that improving and deteriorating material
   circumstances exert differently sized effects. The claims are tested
   using panel data from Great Britain and a weighted
   difference-in-difference estimator. The results show that only income
   increases (negatively) affect redistribution support while income
   decreases have null effects. In contrast, unemployment is estimated to
   have a strong and symmetrical effect in line with self-interest theory.
   These results add further evidence for the validity of self-interest
   theories but suggest that individuals are only boundedly rational.

Abstract = {Extensive research on political participation suggests that parental
   resources strongly predict participation. Other research indicates that
   salient political events can push individuals to participate. I offer a
   novel explanation of how mundane household experiences translate to
   political engagement, even in settings where low participation levels
   are typically found, such as immigrant communities. I hypothesize that
   experiences requiring children of Latinx immigrants to take on
   ``adult{''} responsibilities provide an environment where children learn
   the skills needed to overcome the costs associated with participation. I
   test this hypothesis using three datasets: a survey of Latinx students,
   a representative survey of young adults, and a 10-year longitudinal
   study. The analyses demonstrate that Latinx children of immigrants
   taking on adult responsibilities exhibit higher levels of political
   activity compared with those who do not. These findings provide new
   insights into how the cycle of generational political inequality is
   overcome in unexpected ways and places.},

Abstract = {Ideational explanations of policy change are popular in the fields of
   political economy, comparative politics and policy analysis. And yet, to
   make the case for ideational explanations, we must make further progress
   on the nature of ideas, where they come from, what they consist of, and
   how they change over time. We highlight four critical building sites
   concerning the definitional aspects of ideational explanations,
   micro-foundations, mechanisms and the difference between ideational and
   cognitive analysis. We make recommendations on how to carry out work in
   the building sites and describe the range of suggestions and ways
   forward found in the articles of this Symposium. We also suggest
   cross-fertilising political science with the findings of neighbouring
   disciplines that have developed empirically robust models of ideation
   and cognition.},

Title = {The Political Theory of Data: Institutions, Algorithms, \& Formats in
   Racial Redlining},

Abstract = {Despite widespread recognition of an emergent politics of data in our
   midst, we strikingly lack a political theory of data. We readily
   acknowledge the presence of data across our political lives, but we
   often do not know how to conceptualize the politics of all those data
   points-the forms of power they constitute and the kinds of political
   subjects they implicate. Recent work in numerous academic disciplines is
   evidence of the first steps toward a political theory of data. This
   article maps some limits of this emergent literature with an eye to
   enriching its theoretical range. The literature on data politics, both
   within political theory and elsewhere, has thus far focused almost
   exclusively on the algorithm. This article locates a further dimension
   of data politics in the work of formatting technology or, more simply,
   formats. Formats are simultaneously conceptual and technical in the ways
   they define what can even count as data, and by extension who can count
   as data and how they can count. A focus on formats is of theoretical
   value because it provides a bridge between work on the conceptual
   contours of categories and the technology-centric literature on
   algorithms that tends to ignore the more conceptual dimensions of data
   technology. The political insight enabled by format theory is shown in
   the context of an extended interrogation of the politics of racialized

Abstract = {After decades of relatively high inflows of foreign nationals,
   immigration is now at the center of substantial political divisions in
   most European countries and has been implicated in one of the most
   vexing developments in European politics, the rise of the xenophobic
   right. However, it is not clear whether high levels of immigration
   actually do cause a public backlash, or whether publics become
   habituated to, and supportive of, immigration. This study tests these
   backlash and habituation theories using novel measures of immigration
   mood and immigration concern produced by combining over 4,000 opinion
   datapoints across twenty-nine years and thirty countries. The authors
   find evidence of a public backlash in the short to medium run, where
   mood turns negative and concern about immigration rises. Yet the study
   also finds evidence of a longer-run process of habituation that cancels
   out the backlash effect within one (concern) to three (mood) decades.},

Abstract = {The Brexit cleavage continued to define politics in the 2019 general
   election. This posed a challenge for parties and voters on each side of
   the debate: how to coordinate in favour of their side in each seat. In
   this note, I examine the extent to which party (electoral pacts) and
   voter (tactical voting) coordination affected the outcome of the 2019
   general election. On the voter side, I find that tactical voting was
   only slightly more prevalent than in previous election cycles. On the
   party side, I find that neither the Unite to Remain pact nor the Brexit
   Party's withdrawal of candidates against incumbent Conservatives
   noticeably affected the results. Holding the structure of preferences in
   2019 constant, Labour would probably have won a handful of additional
   seats in England and Wales (three on average but only one clear gain) by
   joining the Unite to Remain pact. The effect of the pact is limited
   because Labour successfully won over many Remain supporters from the
   other parties during the campaign. This meant that voters of the other
   Remain parties were only modestly more likely to prefer Labour over the
   Conservatives by the end of the campaign, and the pool of minor party
   voters was generally small in Labour's target seats. The Liberal
   Democrats would have received around eight additional seats if Labour
   had joined the pact (again holding preferences constant).},

Abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to interrogate the meaning of Zimbabwe's
   four decades of independence after the country attained it in 1980. We
   argue that the creation of and continued dominance by a new class of
   elites in the country is the principal reason why many citizens remain
   entrenched in poverty. Based on a desktop study of the evidence and
   cases of issues surrounding dichotomies of sectors - urban versus rural,
   formal versus informal, low-income versus high-income - the paper
   engages thematic and content analysis. The findings reveal that
   inequality remains a staunch force that the new president must fight.
   The country has rich mining deposits, yet inequality remains high. Good
   governance and progressive distributive policies are suggested as
   possible measures to rescue the country from gross inequalities
   currently bedevilling it.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {International relations is often confusing for students. IR theories are
   introduced as parsimonious and elegant and then systematically
   challenged as students learn more about detailed events. There are
   rules, there are norms, and states follow them until they don't. East
   Asia increases these challenges because it often undermines IR theory.
   Simulations can provide a key means of grounding students studying
   international relations because they apply IR theory to real-world
   examples-something especially important in a large lecture course. While
   simulations are effective tools, they often rely on strong institutional
   arrangements around which the rules of simulations are based. This
   presents a challenge for studying foreign relations in regions like East
   Asia, which have weaker multilateral institutions and thus no obvious
   template for a simulation. To overcome the challenges of weak
   institutionalization and subject-matter difficulty, we present two
   alternative models of simulations tested in a large lecture course on
   transpacific relations. The consensus model simulates what an
   international summit looks like in a weakly institutionalized
   environment maximizing the realism of the experience for students. The
   cooperation model captures the motivations of states to seek
   international cooperation despite the complications faced in
   international relations, maximizing the spirit of urgency that animates
   weakly institutionalized environments. We provide detailed instructions
   and materials to adapt these models to similar courses.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a qualitative study in relation to the research
   interests of students of the Master of Culture of Peace at the
   University of Malaga, from the subject of Research Methodology for Peace
   and Conflicts, analyzing the proposals and outlines of research projects
   of the last six academic terms. In these sketches we have been able to
   identify the topics of interest and the methodological perspectives of
   possible approaches. The problems that stand out are related to the
   educational field, in the first place, and to the social field, in the
   second place, which in part can be explained by the profile of the
   student, but also by the conceptions of the Culture of Peace concerns
   with problems of coexistence, conflicts and school violence that
   students sustain. On the other hand, the research proposals propose
   lines of work with social skills programs, emotional education or other
   projects that can reduce or limit the idea of a Culture of Peace as a
   right and possibility of advancing in the construction of citizenship.},

Title = {Attitudes about containment measures during the 2020/2021 coronavirus
   pandemic: self-interest, or broader political orientations?},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {We analyze opposition towards Covid-19 containment measures by assessing
   the role of self-interest, sociotropic threat, political
   predispositions, and infection rates. We base our analyses on two waves
   of survey data from Germany (N = 3258/3201). Our measure of
   self-interest includes objective indicators for and subjective
   perceptions of individual threat from containment measures in the
   economic sphere and in the family and health domains. We also analyze
   whether the role of self-interest changes as the pandemic proceeds in
   its course. Our results show that self-interest plays a limited role in
   explaining attitudes about containment measures. More important are
   broader political predispositions such as trust in institutions,
   including the government. Attitudes are unrelated to local rates of
   infection or death. This pattern has remained stable over the course of
   the pandemic. We discuss the relevance of these findings with respect to
   the general enforceability of public policies that serve collective
   goals, such as efforts to limit climate change. Parts of the population
   may be reluctant to comply with these public policies even if the
   associated costs to the individual are small. This is less because of
   people's personal circumstances, and more because of their opposition to
   government interventions as such.},

Abstract = {This article examines the theoretical connections between identity and
   linked fate, extending the latter concept across three countries and
   four types of ( potential) identity groups. This belief, that what
   happens to one's ethnic group, religious group, region, or class shapes
   one's own life chances, is an understudied middle ground between
   ideational and material drivers of political attitudes. The study uses
   experimental and observational analyses to show that the strength of
   individuals' beliefs in linked fate and that belief's consequences vary
   in systematic and predictable ways. From the very material effect of
   labor market uncertainty to the highly ideational effect of regional
   identity, linked fate is a cognitive bridge between two very different
   kinds of social-psychological experiences that can (and should) be
   applied across a wide range of countries and groups.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Open-ended survey questions can provide researchers with nuanced and
   rich data, but content analysis is subject to misinterpretation and can
   introduce bias into subsequent analysis. We present a simple method to
   improve the semantic validity of a codebook and test for bias: a
   ``self-coding{''} method where respondents first provide open-ended
   responses and then self-code those responses into categories. We
   demonstrated this method by comparing respondents' self-coding to
   researcher-based coding using an established codebook. Our analysis
   showed significant disagreement between the codebook's assigned
   categorizations of responses and respondents' self-codes. Moreover, this
   technique uncovered instances where researcher-based coding
   disproportionately misrepresented the views of certain demographic
   groups. We propose using the self-coding method to iteratively improve
   codebooks, identify bad-faith respondents, and, perhaps, to replace
   researcher-based content analysis.},

Abstract = {Social scientists use the concept of interactions to study effect
   dependency. In the causal inference literature, interaction terms may be
   used in two distinct type of analysis. The first type of analysis
   focuses on causal interactions, where the analyst is interested in
   whether two treatments have differing effects when both are
   administered. The second type of analysis focuses on effect
   modification, where the analyst investigates whether the effect of a
   single treatment varies across levels of a baseline covariate. While
   both forms of interaction analysis are typically conducted using the
   same type of statistical model, the identification assumptions for these
   two types of analysis are very different. In this paper, we clarify the
   difference between these two types of interaction analysis. We
   demonstrate that this distinction is mostly ignored in the political
   science literature. We conclude with a review of several applications
   where we show that the form of the interaction is critical to proper
   interpretation of empirical results.},

Abstract = {Constitutional review has become a hallmark of modern liberal democracy.
   The efficacy of this review, however, is far from guaranteed. In this
   article, I argue that courts enhance judicial authority by using
   discretion over the temporal effect of decisions invalidating
   legislation. Building on the comparative judicial politics literature on
   the separation of powers and strategic judicial behavior, I develop a
   theoretical account of how courts strategically delay the implementation
   of their decisions through the declaration of a statute's
   incompatibility with the constitution. The accompanying theoretical
   model's main prediction is that courts use this tactic when the
   incumbent government is electorally weak, as delaying compliance raises
   the probability of a new government taking office and subsequently
   implementing the decision. An empirical analysis of incompatibility
   rulings by the German Federal Constitutional Court supports the model's
   predictions.},

Abstract = {As a research objective, the digital paradigm of economic and social
   development, in general, which defines the information strategy for the
   development of the Russian customs service and administration as
   necessary and priority, is analyzed. The methodological basis is based
   on the ideas and principles of an integrated information approach to the
   study of the customs service and the concept of ``customs service{''},
   which treats the customs administration as service oriented. We also use
   additional theoretical approaches (socio-cultural and neo-institutional)
   as an explanatory model of the developmental characteristics of the
   Russian customs service. The empirical verification of conceptual
   attitudes in this study was conducted based on our 2020 expert
   sociological survey. In the survey, there were 269 employees of Rostov
   customs, which is structurally included in the Southern Customs
   Administration. The study concludes that the greater efficiency in the
   positive dynamics of the work of the Russian customs authorities is
   associated with the introduction of information technologies (especially
   electronic declaration). Consequently, the results of this study can be
   used to develop a strategy to overcome certain barriers in service.},

Abstract = {Theobjectiveofthestudywasthephenomenonofdoublethinking as a special form
   of anomie thinking. Doublethinking leads to a distortion of the
   perception and appreciation of political reality, which is expressed in
   the inaccuracy of information about the surrounding world. In
   methodological terms, the ethical theory of Alasdair McIntyre and the
   idea of doublethinking of G. Orwell were used. This allows us to
   conclude that in our time there is a crisis of values, which consists in
   the simultaneous presence of two normative-value systems in the human
   mind. One of them is inherited by the idea of modern humanity from
   Christianity; the second, which is preferred by many, was created by
   utilitarianism. This makes it possible to formally recognize, in words,
   socially approved values, norms and objectives, while at the same time
   devaluing them in actions, replacing them with the principle of personal
   gain. As a result, a new political language is emerging newspeak. The
   desire for constructive public action, mutual help, respect, and
   altruism is replaced by corruption, hypocrisy, opportunism, the decline
   of professionalism and productivity, the negative selection of political
   elites.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the indirect accountability of political appointees.
   The appointee's quality is uncertain, and voters hold the politician
   accountable for the appointee's performance. The politician has better
   information about the appointee than voters do, but electoral concerns
   induce the politician to make inefficient retention decisions.
   Specifically, there is over-retention of appointees relative to the
   social optimum. If the quality of candidates for appointment is low,
   then improving the pool of candidates can help reduce distortions and,
   in fact, it is in the interest of the politician to do so. I also show
   that more public information about the appointee reduces over-retention.},

   Despite this, a number of recent suggestions may continue to lead

   likelihood of drawing both correct and incorrect inferences under a
   variety of stationary and non-stationary data-generating processes. I
   extend previous work in this area by focusing on both short- and
   long-run effects using several popular model specifications. Given these
   findings, I conclude by offering a variety of recommendations to

   common good of all those subject to its rule. This raises the question
   how to do so most effectively, either through particular policies or

   and Aristotle, flowered in the writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero, and
   reappeared with the revival of learning in such authors as Machiavelli,
   James Harrington, John Adams, and Immanuel Kant. More recently Philip
   Pettit, Jurgen Habermas, and others have returned to the republican
   conception of liberty as nondomination, and how to secure this through
   the rule of law, popular sovereignty, and the checks and balances of
   well-designed deliberative politics. Republicanism seeks freedom and

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the legal regulation of the
   decentralization reform in Eastern Europe and its impact on the
   unemployment rate. Methodologically, statistical analysis,
   hypothetical-deductive method and correlation were used. It was found
   that the first stage of the reform of the New Civil Service in Poland,
   Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Latvia, and Bulgaria
   began in 1990, but can be called an informal preparatory stage. It is
   determined that the process of implementation of administrative reforms
   is influenced by a series of factors: historical, economic,
   geographical. It is concluded that there is no positive correlation
   between the effectiveness of public administration and the effectiveness
   of local self-government in all the countries studied. The reform of
   decentralization has been shown to have a negative impact on employment.
   In addition, it found that Poland is the most stable country among those
   studied, with a high level of efficiency of local self-government. La
   more negative correlation between the efficiency index of local
   self-government and employment, and the most positive correlation
   between local and unemployment rate.},

Title = {The family policy positions of conservative parties: A farewell to the
   male-breadwinner family model?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Since the Golden Age of the Welfare State ended, the male-breadwinner
   family model traditionally supported by conservative parties has been
   put under pressure. Familialism appears to be no longer attractive to a
   changing, more volatile constituency. By comparing four different
   European countries - namely, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the United
   Kingdom - this work investigates the evolution of the conservative
   parties' family policy positions in the post-Fordist era (1990s-2010s).
   The article has two goals. First, relying on a multidimensional
   theoretical framework where both social consumption and social
   investment policy instruments are at stake, it probes whether
   conservatives have switched their positions by backing de-familialism
   and thus the dual-earner family model. Second, it explains policy
   position change or stability over time and cross-country differences
   through a multicausal analytical framework. The content analysis of
   party manifestos shows that, in the post-Fordist era, the conservative
   parties have supported `optional familialism', thus upholding both
   familiarizing and de-familiarizing measures. However, such positions are
   not static. In the 1990s, support for familialism was higher while,
   since the 2000s, there has been a constant, increasing backing of
   de-familialism. While the shift is evident for all the parties,
   cross-country differences remain. The comparative historical analysis
   has pointed out that the specific `optional familialism' positions taken
   by the conservative parties over time result from the interaction of
   constituency-oriented, institutional, contextual and political factors.},

Abstract = {Violence against women (VAW) affects at least 35\% of women worldwide.
   The need to combat VAW is seemingly noncontroversial: As existing work
   shows, ideology does not explain governments' propensity to adopt
   anti-VAW legislation. Yet, effectively implementing anti-VAW legislation
   requires complex policy frameworks at odds with conservative values.
   Voters' preferences can meaningfully influence policy outputs, so can
   electoral conservatism make women more vulnerable to violence? Employing
   data from 5570 Brazilian municipalities, we find that conservatism in
   the electorate is associated with the adoption of fewer anti-VAW
   policies. With data from a nationally representative survey of Brazilian
   respondents (N = 2086), we then show that conservative voters are less
   likely to prioritize the need for tackling VAW. That is, the adoption of
   fewer anti-VAW policies in conservative municipalities reflects
   conservative voters' policy preferences. Critically, our results suggest
   that in contexts where the electorate holds conservative preferences,
   policy responsiveness may incur costs to women's lives.},

Abstract = {While antigovernment protests have been widespread across the world in
   recent years, it is still not well understood why people protest their
   governments. This study addresses this question and asks why some
   individuals participate in antigovernment protests, while others don't.
   I argue that commitment to democratic values is essential to
   understanding participation in antigovernment protest: individuals who
   are committed to democratic values are more likely to participate in an
   antigovernment protest. With broader implications for political protests
   in political regimes other than consolidated democracies, this research
   explores recent widespread protests in Georgia and finds evidence
   consistent with its primary argument.},

Abstract = {Despite the rapid decrease in poverty across the developing world, there
   have been few attempts to analyze the implication of poverty alleviation
   on regime legitimacy. Bridging the literature on poverty alleviation and
   political trust, this analysis examines the mechanisms through which
   poverty reduction affects trust in local elected and appointed
   officials. Using an original survey on the Target Poverty Alleviation
   campaign in China and causal mediation analyses, we find that
   beneficiary status is positively associated with political trust. The
   perception of anti-poverty governance quality, rather than economic
   evaluation, is the mediator through which beneficiary status affects
   political trust. Moreover, the intensified non-formalistic elite-mass
   linkage developed in the poverty alleviation campaign enhances political
   trust through the improvement of perception of governance quality. These
   findings have implications for mechanisms through which poverty
   reduction affects political trust and the type of political linkage that
   sustains regime legitimacy.},

Abstract = {In many democracies, voter turnout is higher among the rich than the
   poor. But do changes in income lead to changes in electoral
   participation? We address this question with unique administrative data
   matching a decade of individual tax records with voter rolls in a large
   municipality in northern Italy. We document several important findings.
   First, levels of income and turnout both dropped disproportionately
   among relatively poor citizens following the Great Recession. Second, we
   show that within-individual changes in income have an effect on
   participation, which is modest on average due to diminishing returns,
   but can be consequential among the poor. Third, we find that declining
   turnout of voters facing economic insecurity has exacerbated the income
   skew in participation, suggesting that income inequality and turnout
   inequality may reinforce each other. We discuss the theoretical
   implications of these results, set in a context with strong civic
   traditions and low barriers to voting.},

Abstract = {There is widespread agreement among scholars that political competition
   in Western Europe is multidimensional in nature. Most existing studies
   at the very least distinguish an economic from a cultural dimension of
   conflict. However, while large segments of the population are found to
   combine egalitarian and nationalist attitudes, parties adopting that
   ideological stance are exceedingly rare, if not completely absent. This
   has implications for the political representation of these so-called
   `left-nationalist' voters and, more specifically, for their evaluations
   of the legitimacy of the representative system. In this paper, we put
   these expectations to the test using the 2017 Dutch Parliamentary
   Election Study. We show that evaluations of representative democracy
   vary for different combinations of egalitarian and nationalist
   attitudes. The findings shed further light on the link between
   substantive and symbolic representation and, more generally, on the
   functioning of representative democracy in the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {American Muslim intercommunal disunity (fitnah) is exemplified by an
   emic event when an editorial foray contests the inherited legacies of
   black Muslim icons like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, which exigently
   compels ``diplomats{''} of different minds into engaging the digital
   public square with calculated strokes. The woke era's partisan identity
   politics asymmetrically curtail acceptable expressions of religious
   authority on issues of race, religion, and politics. Hence, scholars
   spend their social capital as political actors in these ultracrepidarian
   environments to different ends. This multi-year study conducted across
   global sites analyzes scholars with dissimilar approaches to media and
   political engagement amidst an environment characterized by weaponized
   media, polarization, and shifting goal posts. Participant observation
   and textual analysis impart scenes of scholars with fraught associations
   to administrations, funding sources, and feuding authoritarian Arab
   regimes getting embroiled in geopolitical hostilities. With mainstream
   American Muslim narratives aligned with mainstream media's liberal
   filter bubbles, scholars impact consensus building with varying levels
   of success; those negotiating compromise within spheres of legitimate
   contestation and consensus ad interim maintain subsisting influence.
   However, those that do not are expurgated and thereby cede influence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political determinants of the variations in
   active labour market policies across advanced democracies. Specifically,
   it investigates the conditions under which a welfare state accommodates
   rather than disregards the interests of labour market outsiders. Relying
   on the literature on post-industrial electoral realignment, this article
   argues that ideological orientations not only in socio-economic but also
   in sociocultural dimensions dictate the policy preferences of political
   parties for labour market programmes. This study then hypothesizes that
   libertarian governments are more likely than authoritarian governments
   to support human capital formation of labour market outsiders. An
   analysis of cabinet-based periodization data of 21 advanced
   industrialized countries from 1985 to 2017 shows that left- and
   right-libertarian governments favour public spending on active labour
   market programmes, thereby supporting this study's hypothesis.
   Furthermore, it also reveals that while left-libertarian governments
   increase expenditures for direct job creation schemes, right-libertarian
   ones do so for employment assistance and training programmes.},

Abstract = {We assess Dugan and Chenoweth's Rational Choice-based argument regarding
   moderating effects of indiscriminate conciliatory state actions on
   levels of terrorist attacks in Israel-Palestine, utilizing data drawn
   primarily from declassified security records on Israeli state actions
   during the First Intifada (1987-1992). This type of data source, we
   argue, contains a more accurate ratio of conciliatory to repressive
   actions than Dugan and Chenoweth's media-based data, given state
   authorities' attempts at concealing repressive actions while publicizing
   conciliatory actions during times of intense conflict. We discuss
   differences in results-including, most centrally, no support for the
   hypothesized effect of conciliatory state actions-highlighting the
   theoretical payoffs of examining the Political Process-related factor of
   varying levels of state control over the political environment.},

   sphere in critical times},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Social relevance has become a key element to assess the social
   legitimacy of an academic discipline. This contrasts with a widespread
   sentiment among political scientists about the existence of a relevance
   gap. The context of multiple crises Europe has experienced since the
   late 2000s has provided political scientists with a multitude of
   opportunities to demonstrate the social relevance of their work and the
   usefulness of the discipline. This introductory article to the special
   issue aims to offer an explorative framework and a preliminary
   discussion of empirical examples to assess the phenomenon of political
   scientists' relevance in the public sphere during recent turbulent
   times. The framework (which emphasises three basic dimensions of social
   relevance - partisanship, visibility, and impact) is used to interpret
   the main results of the five case studies included in the special issue.
   Results show that contextual factors (salience of the issue, political
   and media contexts) influence political scientists' engagement in the
   public sphere, the role they adopt and their visibility. The article
   ends emphasising the importance of collective action within the
   discipline as an instrument to enhance its social relevance.},

Abstract = {Veto players hold the capacity to decline a choice being made, making
   them powerful actors within legislative systems. During 2016-2020,
   Ireland was governed by a minority government, reliant on confidence and
   supply votes from other parliamentarians, thus it did not hold a veto
   during parliamentary votes. However, if the independent Bills Office and
   Ceann Comhairle deemed a `Money Message' would be necessary for a
   Private Members' Bill (PMB), even if it had achieved majority support in
   the Dail, then the government could refuse to grant one, returning veto
   status to the minority government. To date, research has not provided a
   comprehensive overview of the PMBs blocked, nor examined in detail the
   cases that were high-profile. Via a nested analysis, we code 79 PMBs and
   complement our analysis through interviews with parliamentarians whose
   bills were blocked. We identify eleven policy themes in the PMBs that
   were blocked, demonstrating that vetoing via the Money Message was a
   widespread phenomenon. Next, we conduct a small-n analysis of the
   application of Money Messages across a variety of bills. Our analysis
   provides the first comprehensive examination of a procedure that holds
   lasting implications for the legislative process, perceptions of
   democracy, and executive dominance over minor parties in Ireland.},

Abstract = {The Russian leadership envisages Russia as a bridge connecting East and
   West via Asiatic Russia. Nevertheless, this self-image seemingly does
   not fully correspond to the current trends; moreover, it is unclear what
   the Russian Government tries to `bridge' as it has been unable to
   construct a bridge across the Lena River connecting Yakutsk, the capital
   of its largest Republic, to Russian mainland. This work attempts to
   examine both the external and internal dimension for the Russian Far
   East of Russia's `turn' to Asia, and the way Sakha Republic experiences
   the tension between the domestic and international dimensions of this
   `turn' to the East.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The measurement of well-being and its evolution is an open question. A
   suggested indicator, which is limited to the measure of material
   well-being, is based on taking into account the ``relative{''} nature of
   a generation's level of well-being and the ``absolute{''} impact of
   lifetime income growth. The assumption is that each individual has a
   level of well-being at birth that is proportional to the relative income
   available to his or her family. Subsequently, the well-being of each
   individual evolves as the real income available to him. In the long
   term, this indicator depends on the distribution of income (a reduction
   in inequality increases social welfare) and the growth rate of the
   economy, with rising per capita income leading to a sustainable increase
   in well-being, since lifelong generations enjoy higher well-being. It
   also evolves positively with lifespan and aging, as the share of
   generations that have benefited from increased well-being over life is
   increasing. The calculation of this indicator for France and the United
   States from 1950 to 2019 shows that well-being in France increased very
   sharply from the 1950s to the 1970s before stagnating since the 1980s.
   In the United States, the evolution of well-being has been much more
   consistent. Since the 2008 crisis, aggregate well-being has tended to
   decline in both countries as growth decline and inequality increase.
   Generations born after 1970 are much less favourable than previous
   generations, with the difference in well-being at the same age being
   particularly marked for those born since 1980.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the sustained processes of growth and institutionalization of
   political science in Argentina, the problems related to undergraduate
   university teaching have not been addressed as other disciplinary
   dimensions. This article offers the results of a cycle of conferences on
   the subject, and the results of a survey on threats, violence and
   harassment in political science classrooms. It is argued that although
   the challenges are relatively similar throughout the Argentine
   territory, their approaches and the proposed solutions have no
   coordination, and that the situation of respect for women and students
   in general is both serious and constant along time.},

   Additionally, author studies the ``economy- state-clientelism{''}
   triangle in the modern Russian setting to confirm previous findings from
   Mexico, Argentina, Cambodia, Germany, United Kingdom and other countries
   to reveal the typical behavior pattern: politicians favor the poor
   (because its cheap), citizens favor stalemate (because change is risky)
   and clientelism coerces and buys (because it's a time-tested mechanism).},

Abstract = {In the context of the recent struggle for the right to abortion in
   Argentina, the slogan of ``separation of Church and State{''} emerged
   strongly within a sector of the women's movement. This elementary
   liberal demand, formulated in the twenty-first century, stimulates
   reflection on the scope of secularization in modern societies and on the
   relations between the political and religious spheres.
   As a result, this article recovers the theoretical legacy of Max Weber,
   who not only made the universal process of rationalization his
   privileged research problem, but also carefully approached the
   categories of State and Church and the link that these institutions
   stablished historically. In that sense, the paper aims to: 1) examine
   the way in which Weber constructs his definitions of these two
   sociological concepts, specifying their affinities; 2) identify the most
   important typical-ideal relationships that he sees between the two
   institutions in the pre-modern world; and 3) characterize the separation
   of Church and State in modernity and the limitations that he finds in
   this area.},

Abstract = {Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Turkey has been using the
   Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) to gain soft power
   and increase its influence in the Balkans, Caucasia, and Central Asia.
   As Turkey's focus is on countries that were once part of the Ottoman
   Empire, many have characterized this attempt as Neo-Ottomanism.
   Especially problematic is the fact that, over the years, TIKA has funded
   the restoration of numerous Ottoman monuments in these regions. Using
   Serbia as an example, this article explores whether such projects are
   proof of Turkey having a `Neo-Ottoman agenda' of reviving Ottoman
   culture and exerting influence over former Ottoman territories, or just
   a way of Turkey gaining soft power through foreign aid.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Energy security is an important component of power politics, which
   explains the distribution of limited resources and the consequences
   thereof Yet contemporary international relations theories tend to focus
   more on the ``security{''} element when it comes to energy security and
   somewhat underplay the ``power{''} component that lies behind it. This
   may limit their purchase and nuance in explaining contemporary and
   future energy security developments. This article offers an initial
   theoretical argument that reveals and emphasizes how energy changes and
   shapes power and security concepts and, thus, requires an improved
   conceptual model in international relations theory. I provide a
   conceptual overview of energy and security before adapting and
   empirically examining existing international relations theories
   (realism, neorealism, liberalism). I then conceptualize energy security
   within the scope of realism and aim to emphasize the specific importance
   of power that energy security theory and policy requires. To do so, I
   investigate the Energy Security Development Capability and identify the
   elements that could contribute to the advancement of energy security. I
   also note why realism is still seen as a dominant approach to understand
   energy security.},

Title = {Two Theories of Hegemony: Stuart Hall and Ernesto Laclau in Conversation},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-246},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This essay stages a critical conversation between Stuart Hall and
   Ernesto Laclau, comparing their different appropriations of Antonio
   Gramsci's theory of hegemony. In the 1980s, Hall and Laclau engaged with
   Gramsci and with one another in order to conceptualize what they
   regarded as a triangular relation between the rise of Thatcherism, the
   crisis of the Left, and the emergence of new social movements. While
   many of their readers emphasize the undeniable similarities and mutual
   influences that exist between Hall and Laclau, this essay focuses on the
   differences between their theories of hegemony and locates the starkest
   contrast between them at the level of theoretical practice. While the
   main lesson that Hall drew from Gramsci was the privileging of
   conjunctural analysis, Laclau proceeded to locate the concept of
   hegemony at a higher level of abstraction, developing a political
   ontology increasingly indifferent to any specific conjuncture. The essay
   argues that this difference between conjunctural analysis and political
   ontology has a significant impact on Hall's and Laclau's respective
   understandings of two key political formations: populism and identity
   politics. Thus by focusing on these two formations, the essay argues
   that Hall's work should not be read as a derivative or even
   undertheorized version of Laclau's, for this tendency obscures
   substantial differences between their interventions as well as the fact
   that Hall's theory of hegemony, as a theory of the conjuncture,
   ultimately possesses stronger explanatory power than Laclau's political
   ontology.},

Abstract = {Different stereotypes exist for women politicians in a way that is not
   true for men; a difference that may affect voter evaluations. While some
   research concludes that these stereotypes disadvantage women candidates,
   other findings suggest there is no effect, or that women may have some
   advantages. I employ three unique experiments to offer insight to this
   disconnect, expanding the knowledge of stereotypes about the goals of
   legislative vs. executive offices and female politicians in these roles.
   This analysis provides insight into how the type of office matters,
   sharpening our understanding of gender stereotypes in candidate
   evaluation. I find that stereotypes of women in these offices are unique
   from those of an ungendered officeholder or male officeholders and
   stereotypes of women are vastly positive, but that these positive
   stereotypes never equate to an electoral feminine advantage and may
   penalize a woman with traits counter to the stereotype of the office.},

Abstract = {The interest group literature has long struggled with how to empirically
   approach the normative idea of a non-biased group system. While most
   previous attempts have focused on the descriptive representation of
   different types of groups, this article argues that substantive
   representation of citizens' attitudes is closer to the democratic
   principle of equal effective participation. It develops a methodological
   approach that captures substantive representation with respect to agenda
   priorities and policies by surveying interest groups on how much time
   they spend on lobbying in different policy areas, and in which direction
   they lobby on salient policy issues. The responses are compared with
   opinion data to estimate the level of political (in)equality. The
   findings from the case of Sweden - where relatively high levels of
   equality would be expected, but striking levels of inequality based on
   socio-economic status are instead found - highlight the perseverance of
   what Schattschneider once called the upper-class bias of the pressure
   system.},

Abstract = {Prevailing studies on silence and democracy, in spite of silence's
   inherently ambiguous nature, focus on subscribing meaning(s) to silence.
   Such attempts of turning silence into speech, point to an adversary
   relationship between silence and democratic theory. First, this article
   conducts an onto-epistemological critique of democratic theory's
   treatment of silence (as meaning). Second, it suggests that there are
   self-reflective analytical benefits for scholars of democratic theory
   should they broaden up their gaze from silence as meaning toward
   silence-as-doing. This article argues that this can be done by shifting
   the epistemological focus from interpreting possible meanings behind the
   nonvoters' silence into analyzing the context and/of interpretations of
   silence as ambiguous. Third, to illustrate this, the article uses the
   2018 name referendum in North Macedonia which shows how the
   speech-centered approach of democratic theory is utilized to serve
   political goals rather than reaching the democratic ideal of ``everyone
   having a vo-ice/te.{''}},

Abstract = {This article explores people's preferences for different containment
   strategies and policy programmes for managing COVID-19 risks. Using a
   survey experiment administered to an online sample of 1'562 Italian
   respondents in April 2020, we test whether and to what extent individual
   preferences are influenced by different framings of equivalent scenarios
   on gains and losses attached to alternative policy measures aimed at
   containing the health and economic costs of the pandemic. We find that
   subjects tend to be more risk-averse or risk-seeking depending on
   whether they are confronted with a positive (gain) or a negative (loss)
   description of the consequences of the proposed policy initiatives. The
   results yield relevant implications for our understanding of citizens'
   support for national and EU-wide responses to the coronavirus pandemic
   and the role of framing in contexts of crisis.},

Abstract = {Citizens' evaluation of how well the system works is central to the
   legitimacy of a democratic system. Elections and voting are crucial
   parts of the democratic system, and therefore, it is very important to
   evaluate voter satisfaction with the electoral process. In this study,
   we evaluate one aspect of the electoral process: the supply of parties
   on the ballot paper, and we use a direct measure of satisfaction with
   the party choices available on the ballot. We performed a survey
   experiment with a representative sample of citizens in four Western
   European democracies: Austria, England, Ireland and Sweden. The results
   point to a clear answer: voters are more satisfied if there are more
   parties to choose from. The findings also show that the positive effect
   is stronger among the higher educated. We also examined if it is the
   presence of an ideologically close option that really matters. The
   results show that respondents in every ideological position prefer more
   parties. This strongly suggests that it is the number of parties, as
   such that matters.},

Abstract = {The importance of minority parliamentarians for substantive
   representation is widely acknowledged, but little research exists on
   further explanations. By studying the substantive representation of the
   interests of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs), this study analyses
   why parliamentarians stand in for interests of minorities with an
   invisible characteristic. A quantitative content analysis of more than
   950,000 British and Irish parliamentary questions provides the basis for
   the analysis (2002-2017). The study considers parliamentarians'
   characteristics as explanatory factors. The results indicate that
   parliamentary presence is vital for LGBs. However, the most active
   parliamentarians are non-minority members: political values and
   awareness are also at play. Moreover, there are differences between the
   two parliaments.},

Abstract = {The Internet is playing an increasingly important role in shaping
   citizens' political experience. We turn to it to consume political news
   and, in some countries, to even cast our ballots at parliamentary
   elections. Leading the way in embracing Internet voting (i-voting) is
   Estonia where nearly half of the ballots cast during the 2019
   parliamentary election were submitted online. Using original data from
   the 2019 Estonian Candidate Study, this paper explores the relationship
   between how candidates campaign and their electoral performance. It
   finds greater use of both offline and online campaign tools to
   contribute to higher vote shares as candidates win more traditional and
   i-votes. These positive effects are similar in size, in terms of
   candidates' overall electoral performance as well as their ability to
   attract different types of votes. The results show not only that
   individual-level campaigns continue to matter, but that online campaigns
   have become as important as offline campaigns for candidates, and
   voters' political activity often transcends the medium through which
   they receive political communication.},

Abstract = {High temperatures have been linked to aggression and different forms of
   conflict in humans. We consider whether exposure to heat waves increases
   discriminatory behavior toward outgroups. Using data from two
   large-scale field experiments in Germany, we find a direct causal effect
   of exposure to heat shocks on discrimination in helping behavior. As
   temperature rises, German natives faced with a choice to provide help to
   strangers in every-day interactions help Muslim immigrants less than
   they do other German natives, while help rates toward natives are
   unaffected by temperature. This finding suggests that there may be a
   physiological basis for discriminatory behavior toward outgroups.},

Abstract = {Michel Foucault investigated the functioning of war in modernity, and
   more specifically civil war, from a perspective that significantly
   diverged from that of Carl Schmitt. While Schmitt aimed to demonstrate -
   particularly in The Nomos of the Earth - how the great achievement of
   jus publicum Europaeum was to humanize war (with the transformation of
   civil war into interstate war), in Penal Theories and Institutions and
   The Punitive Society Foucault showed that civil war is not a type of
   conflict that modernity was able to eliminate. Rather, civil war has
   been concealed in order to guarantee the exercise of power in terms -
   precisely - of civil war, which must, therefore, be understood not only
   as a fundamental theoretical node for the understanding of political
   processes, but also as a phenomenon shaping their operation. By
   examining these two authors, whose thought has rarely been compared, and
   while remaining within the framework of the Foucauldian research, the
   article highlights that Foucault developed a different genealogy of
   modernity than that of Schmitt. The consideration of the latter in order
   to explore the work of the former illuminates understudied aspects.},

Abstract = {Partisans hold unfavorable views of media they associate with the other
   party. They also avoid out-party news sources. We link these
   developments and argue that partisans assess out-party media based on
   negative and inaccurate stereotypes. This means cross-cutting exposure
   that challenges these misperceptions can improve assessments of
   out-party media. To support this argument, we use survey-linked web
   browsing data to show that the public has hostile views of out-party
   news sources they rarely encounter. We conduct three survey experiments
   that demonstrate cross-cutting exposure to nonpolitical or neutral
   political stories, forms of news widely available from online partisan
   sources, reduces oppositional media hostility. This explains how
   perceptions of rampant bias from out-party media coexist with more
   modest differences in the online content of major partisan news outlets.
   More broadly, we illustrate how negative misperceptions can sustain
   animus towards an out-group when people avoid encounters with them.},

Abstract = {Large numbers of people living under authoritarian governments
   participate in pro-opposition politics despite sometimes significant
   risks. Increasing amounts of this political participation are taking
   place and being organized online. Do emotions play a causal role in
   inducing pro-opposition participation in authoritarian regimes? Can
   emotions that mobilize participation be spread via social media? Through
   an experiment carried out by an opposition party in Zimbabwe, I test
   whether campaign appeals to opposition supporters' emotions affect their
   level of political participation in online pro-opposition discussions. I
   find that across two different issue areas, randomly assigned anger
   appeals increase participation on average by 0.4 standard deviations
   more than enthusiasm appeals with the same informational content. In
   real terms, this represents between 30\% and 170\% more participation in
   the groups assigned to the anger appeals across four different measures
   of participation. There is little evidence that these effects are
   stronger in areas with less poverty or that have historically been
   affected by more violence, or when coupled with messages emphasizing
   personal power. These results suggest that anger appeals that highlight
   economic grievances can be an important force for mobilizing online
   political participation in repressive environments.},

Abstract = {Numerous representation studies suggest that political elites are
   responsive to the expressed preferences of their voters, but scholars in
   the field have called for experimental research on the topic to shed
   light on the underlying mechanisms. This paper responds to this call.
   Results from a survey experiment with members of parliament in Belgium
   show, for the first time, that an important mechanism driving
   responsiveness is opinion adaptation by political elites. Just like
   `ordinary' citizens adapt their opinions when learning where their
   preferred party stands on an issue, politicians update their position
   when learning that it opposes the preferences of a majority of their
   electorate. This implies that elite responsiveness involves less discord
   between politicians' own preferences and voter preferences than is often
   assumed.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is the third-largest Muslim country in the world where
   Islamic ideals inherently influence people's thought and actions. One of
   the Islamist political parties that has been trying to influence the
   Bangladeshi population is the Jama'at-e-Islami (JeI). The JeI is one of
   the oldest and largest Islamist political parties in the country and has
   continuously exerted its influence on the social ethos and state policy.
   JeI's unconditional support for Islamization and a society based on
   Sharia law undoubtedly attracts some sections of the Bangladeshi
   population. Apart from promoting an Islamist totalitarian ideology, it
   also maintains a requirement of religious purification for choosing its
   party members; a strategy that has earned a reputation as a party with
   robust intraparty discipline. To enhance its trust-based relationships
   with its members (at both the horizontal and vertical levels), JeI helps
   its members through various means, including the provision of financial
   support, social welfare programs, and charity activities. Although the
   targeted population are their members, these schemes have had an impact,
   however minimal, on the Bangladeshi population to redress its
   anti-independence stance in 1971, on the failure to send an apology
   message for what JeI did in 1971, and on the worldwide failure of
   political Islam.},

Abstract = {At the level of regime typologies, the uncertain status and inherent
   weakness of the opposition mark defining features of regimes beyond
   liberal democracy. However, even the performance and evolution of the
   latter tend to be shaped by oppositions and the regime's approach to
   dealing with them. This article offers a bird's-eye view of political
   oppositions in contemporary electoral democracies and competitive
   autocracies. It focuses on patterns of strategic choices and behavior by
   both governments and oppositions. That endeavor forms part of a larger
   joint venture seeking to give center stage to those actors living in the
   shadows of increasingly unscrupulous power-holders.},

Abstract = {What motivates legislators to respond to citizen-initiated contacts
   about policy positions in party-centred systems with limited re-election
   incentives? We argue legislators are more responsive to individual
   citizens when they are being contacted about high-profile, salient
   policy issues, and when they have the relevant experience and staff
   resources to attend to individual requests. Using a field experiment
   where we email Mexican senators about their policy positions before
   casting eight different floor votes across nine months, we find
   substantial support for our argument. The article challenges the notion
   of re-election-based responsiveness by arguing that issue-visibility,
   access to individual resources, and personal political experience
   explain variation in communicative responsiveness in party-centred
   legislatures. Such findings hold critical implications for theories of
   democratic representation, suggesting the incentive to establish
   significant communicative relations with constituents does not only stem
   from incentives to cultivate a personal vote.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {It has become commonplace to suggest that the coronavirus pandemic is a
   `1945 moment' and should trigger a paradigm shift in the UK's political
   economy. But Starmer's Labour has thus far resisted putting forward a
   vision of what that shift might look like. This article argues that a
   `democratic socialist' vision is taking shape within the `new left'
   based on three core principles: basic economic rights, democratising
   ownership and democratising power. It suggests that there is a perhaps
   surprising level of consensus on many of these ideas within the UK
   Labour Party-but that the party nonetheless appears reluctant to embrace
   them under Starmer's leadership, for strategic and factional reasons.
   Ultimately, it is argued that an overriding preoccupation with
   distancing the party from Corbynism risks paralysing it from responding
   to the fast-changing and unprecedented situation it now finds itself in.},

Abstract = {We all know we will die, but not when and how. Can private death
   awareness become public, and what happens when it does? This
   mixed-method research on the Covid-19 crisis reveals how pandemic
   politics cultivates and uses mass existential anxiety. Analyzing global
   discourse across vast corpora, we reveal an exceptional rise in global
   `mortality salience' (awareness of death), and trace the socio-political
   dynamics feeding it. Comparing governmental pandemic policies worldwide,
   we introduce a novel model discerning `mortality mitigation' (coping
   mechanisms) on a scale from steadfast resistance ('oak') to flexible
   resilience ('reed'). We find that political trust, high median age, and
   social anxiety predict a reedy approach; and that the oak, typically
   pushing for stricter measures, better mitigates mortality. Stringency
   itself, however, hardly affects Covid-related cases/deaths. We enrich
   our model with brief illustrations from five countries: China and Israel
   (both oaks), Sweden and Germany (reeds) and the USA (an oak-reed
   hybrid).},

Abstract = {The relationship between original and induced preferences in affecting
   political actions has been a recurrent topic in the literature. Less
   attention has been devoted to investigating the interaction between
   these two preferences, and possible neutralising/reinforcing effects. We
   explore this dynamic on a crucial issue in XIX century Italy, the
   `Questione Romana', employing a quantitative analysis on an original
   corpus of legislative speeches (1861-1870). The absence of strong
   parties allows investigating the relationship between MPs' original
   preferences and that induced by their voters' linkage. Moreover, as
   politicians and voters were part of the same elite, we can check how
   their paths of political socialisation shape this relationship, leading
   to aligned or colliding preferences.},

Abstract = {Small and marginal parties are seldom the focus of studies in political
   science and are usually excluded from analyses altogether. However, an
   increase in the number of these `other' parties can be observed during
   federal elections, though their chances of gaining seats are almost
   non-existent. Moreover, small and marginal parties can have an impact on
   the party system by diffusing topics and posing a potential electoral
   threat to established parties, with whom they face the challenging task
   of competing. One way of increasing their chances of getting votes is by
   gaining issue ownership over a niche topic. In this study, we use a
   quantitative content analysis and a dictionary approach to investigate
   16 small and marginal German parties in order to determine whether they
   aim to cater to a niche or act as `failed' mainstream (topic) parties.
   Our analysis reveals that small and marginal parties indeed have
   incentives to cater to a niche in order to gain electoral advantages,
   though the same strategy also contributes to their small and marginal
   existence.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Women are less likely than men to run as candidates in political
   elections. One reason for this is gendered upbringing, which depresses
   political ambition among women and strengthens such ambition among men.
   Furthermore, gendered upbringing can be more pronounced when parents
   have children of both sexes. Based on these previous findings, we
   therefore test the theory that both women and men have a higher
   likelihood of becoming a political candidate if they have sisters rather
   than brothers. To establish whether the likelihood of running for office
   is affected by sibling sex composition, we utilize the fact that nature
   randomly assigns the sex of the younger sibling when parents decide to
   have a second child. Using data covering the entire adult Danish
   population and every candidate in national and local elections between
   1990 and 2015, we find, however, no evidence that men and women with a
   younger sister are more likely to run for office. These findings run
   counter to previous findings on the effects of siblings and gendered
   upbringing.},

Abstract = {Popular accounts suggest the surge in political participation post-2016,
   particularly among women, was driven by the \#MeToo movement. But
   emerging research demonstrates few people report being politically
   mobilized, or moved to political action, by the \#MeToo movement, which
   raises the question of how to reconcile these narratives. We hypothesize
   a sense of linked fate is a critical intervening variable. While anger
   has been shown to increase political participation, anger does not
   translate directly to participation for everyone. We argue those who see
   their fates as linked to the fate of women are more likely to overcome
   these barriers and more likely to be mobilized by the \#MeToo movement.
   Using original survey data, we find support for our hypotheses; those
   with a sense of linked fate were more likely to report \#MeToo increased
   motivations to participate in political activities, including engaging
   in protest and running for office. Translating anger into political
   action may be more difficult for some people, and overcoming that high
   bar may require a sense of collective identity for activation.},

Title = {To the factories! An analysis of the factory militancy and
   proletarianization of the militants of Politica Obrera, Argentina
   (1965-1975)},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {The proletarianization{''} was a tactic used by a large part of the left
   parties in Argentina in the 1960s and 1970s. The goal of the present
   article is to address its implementation in a Trotskyist organization
   called Politica Obrera, which was created at the end of 1963. Politica
   Obrera saw itself as the result, on the one hand, of the social and
   worker struggles that shook Argentina during the sixties and seventies
   and, on the other hand, of the need to build a revolutionary party that
   would overcome the reformism of organizations such as Peronism and the
   Argentinian Communist Party. In this paper we will analyze the reasons
   that led the organization to decide that a large part of its militants
   should ``proletarianize{''}, as well as the problems they faced when
   entering the factories and the impact of this tactic on the
   organizational development of Politica Obrera.},

   peace{''}},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This brief essay considers the ``mediation dilemma{''} in the light of
   new analysis by Constantin Ruhe and Iris Volg. Ruhe and Volg's analysis
   adds to our understanding of manipulative mediation in two important
   ways: (a) it demonstrates how an analysis that uses a lens of survival
   functions clarifies the policy trade-offs beyond what is possible from
   an analysis that uses a lens of changing hazard rates; and (b) it
   demonstrates that lighter (nonmanipulative) forms of mediation have a
   less positive effect on peace stability than in the original analysis.
   This response also offers important corrections to the conclusions drawn
   by Ruhe and Volg: (a) ignoring the lens of changing hazard rates misses
   key ways of testing for the observable implications that arise from the
   underlying theoretical arguments; (b) Ruhe and Volg misstate some of the
   theoretical claims made by Beardsley; and (c) almost all of the original
   implications explored by Beardsley remain supported.},

Title = {Critical pedagogies without Marxism? Bibliographic balance of
   educational topics in left-wing Latin American journals},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article seeks to show which are the thematic and problematic
   emphases associated with the field of education and pedagogy, based on
   the review of texts published in Latin American journals that are
   situated in a critical, left-wing position and in some cases directly
   from the Marxism. At the same time, it seeks to account for the degrees
   of use of the analytical perspectives outlined by Karl Marx and Marxism
   in the mentioned works referring to education. We have been able to
   verify that the selected publications make little reference to
   contributions of Marx's work and Marxism, addressing issues of the
   history of education, educational policies, student and teacher
   movements, but without developing or use the pedagogical dimension of
   Marxism and even, some of them, reproducing in an uncritical way the
   hegemonic conceptions in education. To carry out this bibliographic
   balance, were reviewed recent editions of the journals Actuel Marx/
   Interventions, Izquierdas, La Migrana. Revista de analisis politico,
   Herramienta. Revista de debate y critica marxista, y Memoria. Revista de
   critica militante. In methodological terms, was chosen a qualitative
   work based on the bibliographic analysis of academic journals and
   particularly an analysis of thematic content of the selected articles.},

Abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 misinformation highlights the need to correct
   misperceptions about health and science. Research on climate change
   suggests that informing people about a scientific consensus can reduce
   misinformation endorsement, but these studies often fail to isolate the
   effects of consensus messaging and may not translate to other issues. We
   therefore conduct a survey experiment comparing standard corrections
   with those citing a scientific consensus for three issues: COVID-19
   threat, climate change threat, and vaccine efficacy. We find that
   consensus corrections are never more effective than standard corrections
   at countering misperceptions and generally fail to reduce them with only
   one exception. We also find that consensus corrections endorsed by
   co-partisans do not reduce misperceptions relative to standard
   corrections, while those endorsed by opposition partisans are viewed as
   less credible and can potentially even provoke a backfire effect. These
   results indicate that corrections citing a scientific consensus,
   including corrective messages from partisans, are less effective than
   previous research suggests when compared with appropriate baseline
   messages.},

Abstract = {In a laboratory setting, we explore strategic discrimination in
   principal-agent relationships, which arises from mutually reinforcing
   expectations of identity-contingent choices. Our experimental design
   isolates the influence of the strategic environment from effects of
   other sources of discrimination, including statistical differences
   between subpopulations and outright prejudice. We find that, in a
   strategic setting, principals who reward agents on the basis of outcomes
   more readily attribute high performance to effort when they share the
   agent's group identity. No such bias exists either for principals whose
   reward decisions are outcome independent or for principals in a
   nonstrategic environment. Agents in the strategic setting tend to
   anticipate higher demands from out-group principals and condition their
   effort choice on that expectation. Because they underappreciate this
   conditionality, principals tend to underestimate the effort from
   out-group agents.},

Abstract = {Certain features of the legal system, such as litigant-driven appeals
   and random assignment of judges to cases, are supposed to prevent biased
   and error-prone decision-making by judges. I analyze a formal model
   illustrating this is not always true, even when judges are personally
   unbiased. First, an unbiased trial judge may make systematically biased
   judgments when that judge's decisions can be appealed by a losing
   litigant. If the judge is sufficiently reversal averse, this bias favors
   higher resource litigants. Second, litigant-driven appeals allow
   unbiased judges to put less effort into resolving cases correctly.
   Third, when unbiased judges are assigned randomly to cases, they will
   produce more errors than a case assignment system allowing trial judges
   more freedom to select cases. The results confirm one contention of
   ``team models{''} of judicial hierarchy (that litigant behavior is
   important) while also demonstrating the limits of another (that judicial
   hierarchies minimize adjudication errors).},

Abstract = {Permissibility of electoral systems, and in particular the conversion of
   voices in the electorate to the legislature, is broadly considered to
   depend on the number of seats per district (district magnitude) in a
   country. Yet the most prevalent electoral system in the democratic
   world, proportional representation with districts, is often
   characterized by an almost entirely overlooked variation: within the
   same country districts vary in their magnitude, sometimes by a factor of
   20. How does such variation affect permissibility of electoral systems?
   Drawing on a broad cross-section of democracies, we demonstrate that
   contrary to what the literature implicitly assumes, other things equal,
   a combination of large and small districts results in greater
   permissibility than a set of districts of similar magnitude. We find
   that where districts are of similar (different) magnitude the degree of
   permissibility is lower (higher) than that found by current literature.},

Abstract = {Delinquent minors are offered special services intended to prevent them
   from entering the juvenile justice system. Through productive
   activities, delinquents are trained to acquire socially acceptable
   behavior with the help of social workers. This phenomenological study
   explored the social workers' experiences in handling juvenile cases. The
   study focused on 10 social workers from rehabilitation facilities of
   children in conflict with the law in the Zamboanga Peninsula Region,
   Philippines. The result of the study revealed that working with the
   juvenile's case, social workers have encountered positive and negative
   experiences. The study leads to the challenges and plight of social
   workers in their day-to-day activity in juvenile case management. As for
   how the participants coped with the challenges, they have been mentored
   and adjusted very well like their work. They also managed their
   challenges by viewing them as advocacy and service to humanity through
   altruistic activities.},

Abstract = {Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) have been championed as a solution to the
   problem of research credibility, but without any evidence that PAPs
   actually bolster the credibility of research. We analyze a
   representative sample of 195 PAPs registered on the Evidence in
   Governance and Politics (EGAP) and American Economic Association (AEA)
   registration platforms to assess whether PAPs registered in the early
   days of pre-registration (2011-2016) were sufficiently clear, precise,
   and comprehensive to achieve their objective of preventing ``fishing{''}
   and reducing the scope for post-hoc adjustment of research hypotheses.
   We also analyze a subset of ninety-three PAPs from projects that
   resulted in publicly available papers to ascertain how faithfully they
   adhere to their pre-registered specifications and hypotheses. We find
   significant variation in the extent to which PAPs registered during this
   period accomplished the goals they were designed to achieve. We discuss
   these findings in light of both the costs and benefits of
   pre-registration, showing how our results speak to the various arguments
   that have been made in support of and against PAPs. We also highlight
   the norms and institutions that will need to be strengthened to augment
   the power of PAPs to improve research credibility and to create
   incentives for researchers to invest in both producing and policing
   them.},

Abstract = {This work is directed to examine what drive marketization and
   professionalization of campaigning of political parties in the emerging
   democracy of Indonesia. Focusing on such issue, this work adopts
   Stromback' (2007, 2010) and Stromback et al.' (2012) conceptual models
   of marketization and campaign professionalization of political parties
   and deploys a case study method. The findings are as follows. Following
   factors encourage these parties to adopt such practices. They include
   democratization of politics, establishments of the democratic political,
   government, media and election systems, declines of Indonesian
   electorates' partisanship and number of loyal voters, the emergence of
   rational voting behaviors, ICT development and increasing influence of
   the media logic in political news productions, domination of the media
   agenda over the political agenda and numbers of media consumers and the
   Internet and social media users who strongly engaged in political
   consumerism and activism. This work offers an analytical model that
   visualizes the structural factors and conditions, which stimulate
   political parties in the emerging democracy of Indonesia to take up such
   practices. We could consider this model as we want to evaluate
   developments of marketization and professionalization of campaigning of
   political parties in the emerging democracies, especially those shared
   similarity with Indonesian politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether household size affects economic voting. We
   argue when individuals are asked about national economic conditions and
   their personal financial situation that moderate or mid-range responses
   are more likely in multi-person households than in one-person
   households. The aggregation of personal economic evaluations within
   households reduces the variation in economic opinions across household
   members. As a result, it is harder for an individual to say that the
   national economic conditions and her personal financial situation are
   good or bad as the number of household members increases. Using
   individual-level data from the American National Election Studies from
   1966 to 2016, the authors find that both evaluations of the national
   economy and personal economic conditions are endogenous to household
   size. The aggregate, state-level evidence from five presidential
   elections in the U.S. shows that the impact of the economy on the
   incumbent support increases the larger the number of one-person
   households.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, citizenship scholars have moved from
   conceptualizing citizenship as a legal status with associated rights to
   a more process-oriented approach acknowledging the socially constructed
   nature of citizenship. Although the dual citizenship literature hints at
   the importance of contention and recognition, it has yet to consider
   claims-making as a major mechanism shaping dual citizenship. Drawing on
   in-depth interviews, I examine the dual citizenship claims (or the lack
   of such claims) among marriage migrant women from the Philippines and
   Vietnam in South Korea, analyzing how women's narratives regarding dual
   citizenship are framed vis-a-vis the normative ideals of citizenship in
   each state. I suggest the claims-making approach as an analytical
   framework through which the intersections of the normative,
   instrumental, and identity aspects of dual citizenship are brought to
   light in relation to the claimant's positionality.},

Abstract = {This article engages with internal records produced by Canadian
   government agencies surrounding the conflict in Sri Lanka in 2009 to
   examine techniques and discourses of surveillance and criminalisation
   directed at Tamil refugees and their supporters in the diaspora. These
   records demonstrate that the Tamil diaspora was framed as
   terrorist-sympathisers, human smugglers, and unlawful protesters, and
   that Tamil asylum seekers were framed as terrorist-travellers, a
   ``danger to the public{''}, and a ``significant threat to the health and
   safety{''} of Canadians in order to justify detention and deportation.
   Offering insight into border security practices through a reading of the
   settler colonial archive, this article presents a rich empirical account
   of the intricate workings of racialised technologies of rule
   operationalised in regimes of border security governance. Embracing a
   colonial analytic through readings of citizenship, diaspora, and asylum,
   the archive is interpreted through a critical reading of the coloniality
   of migration and empire's politics of security, providing insight into
   the governance of mobility and precarity, techniques of racialised
   surveillance, and how border security functions as an iteration of

Abstract = {The little-studied presidency of Benjamin Harrison offers valuable
   insights into the surprising role that political ideas can play in
   government. Harrison was a highly qualified president who demonstrated
   energetic leadership and political skill, but whose ideological
   commitment to the Republican party as a quasi-sacred enterprise overrode
   other important considerations, thereby contributing to one of the
   greatest economic catastrophes in U.S. history: the Depression of
   1893-1897. His ideas about the Republican party were forged in its early
   years, when it led the political battle against slavery; but when
   Harrison became president, the party's interests in trade protectionism,
   veterans' pensions, and silver drove him to support policies that
   eventually sent the economy into a tailspin from which it took years to
   recover.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {56},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {658-676},

Abstract = {Political machines use state resources to win elections in many
   developing democracies and electoral autocracies. Recent research has
   noted that the coordination of machine politics can be much more complex
   and problem-prone than previously thought. Yet, the role that the
   subnational political context plays in solving these coordination
   problems has largely been neglected in the comparative literature. This
   article seeks to fill this gap and suggests that control over the local
   administration is an important variable that shapes the effectiveness of
   authoritarian machine politics. We exploit the great institutional and
   political variation within one of the most prominent electoral
   authoritarian regimes of today, the Russian Federation, to test the
   empirical implications of the theory with detailed local level electoral
   and socio-economic data as well as multilevel regression models. The
   empirical results highlight the importance of subnational political
   structures in supporting electoral authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {We examine the individual-level characteristics and political and
   economic conditions associated with political discussion. To build our
   model of discursive engagement, we draw on existing research on
   political participation as well as our own theoretical reasoning. Our
   data cover two million individuals in twenty-eight European countries
   over forty-five years, and we employ a little-used approach to
   multilevel analysis that distinguishes variations in engagement
   attributable to cross-country differences from those stemming from
   within-country changes. Our primary findings reveal that, within
   countries, citizens are more likely to talk about politics at election
   time, when there are more electorally competitive political parties,
   during periods of recession, when unionization levels are higher, and
   when racial and ethnic diversity is greater. Across countries, political
   discussion is more likely where elections are ongoing and in countries
   with lower levels of income inequality and corruption. We also find that
   men and the higher-educated are more likely to discuss politics, as are
   those who are middle aged or employed. Our approach is wide-ranging, but
   it is also deliberately correlational. Future observational and
   experimental studies might expand on and identify the causal
   underpinnings of the associations we establish here.},

Title = {Knowing your sources: Partisan media and voters' perceptions of the
   economy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explains how media systems influence the extent to which
   partisanship colors voters' perceptions of the economy (i.e., the
   strength of the partisan screen). It builds upon research on
   individual-level biases in economic perceptions, seeking to extend
   existing work by considering how the availability of partisan media for
   a given party affect such biases. The implication of this is that the
   greater the availability of media sources favorable to a party, the
   stronger the partisan screen for its partisans. This follows from
   several mechanisms including selective acceptance of messages, selective
   exposure to partisan sources, and incidental exposure to partisan
   sources. Each of these suggests that differences in the availability of
   partisan media across parties leads to corresponding differences in the
   extent of partisan bias for partisans of these parties. I test this
   Hypothesis in 14 European countries over four time-periods using data
   built from expert surveys on media characteristics.},

Abstract = {Jeremy Waldron has argued that Berlin ignored the importance of
   institutions and constitutions and worked with an impoverished
   conception of social and political design. Political structures, legal
   and political institutions, constitutional design, mechanisms of
   representation and the rule of law: all this remained untouched by
   Berlin, who seemed, in Waldron's opinion, largely uninterested in the
   actual political institutions of liberal society. In this essay, I argue
   that what may be missing in Berlin-close and sustained attention to, and
   interest in, institutions and social context-can be found in the works
   of his prominent contemporary, Raymond Aron (1905-1983), who also wrote
   about liberty during the Cold War. As such, Aron's An Essay on Liberty
   can and should be read as a complement to Berlin's essay ``Two Concepts
   of Liberty.{''}},

Abstract = {How pluralist is political studies? How are resources distributed across
   the discipline? In this article, we turn one of the fundamental
   questions of politics - who gets what, when, and how - back on to the
   study of politics itself. Our focus is on two areas that are central
   concerns to pluralism: gender and sub-discipline. We pose two specific
   questions: What is the gender and sub-disciplinary composition of
   political studies? And how are various resources - ranging from jobs to
   prizes - distributed along gender and sub-disciplinary lines? In
   addressing these questions, we draw on a pilot and partial audit of
   departments, journals and other key indicators from 1998 to 2018. The
   article contributes to long-standing debates about the character of
   political studies and the extent to which the field is pluralistic or

Abstract = {What are the political consequences of economic globalization? Since the
   1990s, scholars of European party politics have noted the rise of
   extremist parties, especially right-wing populist ones, and the decline
   of mainstream left and right parties. This paper focuses on the
   association between globalization in terms of trade, capital and labor
   flows, technological change, and popular support for extreme right
   parties. I examine these relations at the regional and individual level
   in 15 advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe from 1990 to
   2018. Globalization, especially in the form of trade, is associated with
   growing vote shares for extreme right parties. Technological change in
   the form of automation increases support for extreme right parties. The
   financial crisis enhanced support for populist right parties and
   strengthened the negative relationship between trade shocks and
   declining support for mainstream left parties. And the use of social
   welfare compensation seems unable to dampen these political trends.(1)},

Abstract = {It has become axiomatic that backbench Members of Parliament (MPs) at
   Westminster have limited the capacity for independent action under the
   burdens of constituency business and whipped votes. Even the limited
   avenues available for such MPs to shine, such as select committees, are
   often illusory because parliamentarians have little time to prepare the
   materials or brief themselves on any but the highest profile witnesses.
   The political parties have benefitted from this state of affairs; docile
   MPs make for reliable votes. The rise of the European Research Group
   (ERG) as a parliamentary force disrupts this narrative. Galvanised by
   single-issue opposition to the UK's involvement in `Europe',
   encompassing both the European Union (EU) and the European Convention on
   Human Rights (ECHR), the Group successfully exploited the balance of
   power in the Commons during the 2017-2019 Parliamentary Session. This
   article analyses the methods by which the Group's members magnified
   their influence over Brexit debates.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the main assumptions underlying the
   reforms embedded in EMU and European Semester recommendations. We
   proceed in three steps. First, we question the notion that Italy and
   Germany embody two distinctive politico-economic models and challenge
   the conclusion, drawn from this assumption, that structural rigidities
   are the primary cause of Italy's economic woes and that its lackluster
   performance since the 1990s is due to its insufficient determination to
   implement structural reforms. Rather we show, second, that both
   countries have undertaken remarkably similar reforms which, however,
   have yielded different results both because of the different public debt
   levels they started with and because the interdependence created by the
   euro and the hyper-financialised markets rewarded those countries with
   low, and penalises those with high, sovereign debt. Third, we contest
   the assumption that the two economies would converge towards a common
   growth path if only Italy could adapt to the requirements of a
   globalised economy like Germany has apparently done, which leads us, in
   conclusion, to question the appropriateness of the EU's current strategy
   for both.},

Abstract = {In the last 30 years, Local Governments all over Europe experienced an
   intense season of institutional change of unprecedented width and
   intensity. This paper focuses on a neglected type of institutional
   change, a more indirect one - here labeled oblique-change - that however
   strongly influences the overall LG institutional change and local
   autonomy. Taking 2012 as the climax of the austerity period in Europe
   and Italy as a pilot case for future comparisons, this article shows
   that oblique-change matters to a considerable extent, and that it is
   much more frequent and highly impacting than expected. Moreover, it
   argues that bradyseismic adjustments provoked by oblique-change may turn
   out in an equally profound change of the local government's asset, as
   that induced by major reforms.},

Abstract = {Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important role in the
   representation of citizens' interests towards policymakers. However,
   they increasingly run their campaigns not only against policymakers, but
   also against corporations. While the choice among strategies has been
   examined either in the state (targeting policymakers) or in the market
   (targeting companies), the choice between the two remains unexamined.
   Moreover, conventional studies of advocacy have failed to comparatively
   assess how groups combine strategies. This study fills these gaps,
   examining when NGOs target their campaigns at (a) the market, (b) the
   state and (c) both. It examines 24 NGO campaigns in the UK and Italy
   using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Three main findings
   emerge. First, structural factors - especially the openness of the
   market - are most important in determining which target an NGO chooses.
   Second, campaigns that combine strategies tend to be either market- or
   state-oriented. Finally, high resources are the factor that pushes NGOs
   to combine strategies across the market and the state.},

Abstract = {References to the ``humility{''} and ``hubris{''} of judges are common
   in American political and constitutional discourse, but neither public
   nor scholarly commentators have developed an adequate theoretical
   framework for what humility means in the context of constitutional
   jurisprudence. In this article, we first draw out the common themes and
   tensions among conceptions of judicial humility by providing an
   extensive review of scholarly treatments of humility as a judicial
   virtue. Second, we develop a theoretical account of constitutional
   humility that delineates two interrelated dimensions: ``epistemological
   humility,{''} an inward-looking, self-referential dimension; and
   ``institutional humility,{''} an outward-looking, other-directed
   dimension. We argue that these dimensions work together to provide a
   complete account of constitutional humility. Finally, we conclude by
   highlighting how this conception of constitutional humility can improve
   our judicial practice and public discourse.},

Abstract = {Jean-Paul Sartre pointed to the `gap' in Marxism where a theory of the
   individual should be. Three attempts to fill it vied in the context of
   an intense ideological debate within the Parti Communiste Francais (PCF)
   which still resonates today. On the one hand, Louis Althusser's denial
   of individual agency as traditionally understood, structuralist theory
   which proved difficult to apprehend, let alone apply, in a capitalist
   world. On the other, Roger Garaudy's Marxist humanist explanation of
   personality, most likely unsatisfactory for many Marxists on account of
   its spiritualistic leanings. Finally, Lucien Seve's approach: very
   preliminary, often awkwardly formulated, and diluted over time, but a
   real alternative to structural Marxism and perhaps, in its final diluted
   form, not incompatible with a humanist approach after all. If the debate
   could be settled in his favour, the detailed practical work of applying
   the theory to psychology and other social sciences should take over with
   some urgency from here.},

Abstract = {Addressing climate change requires coordinated policy responses that
   incorporate the needs of the most impacted populations. Yet even
   communities that are greatly concerned about climate change may remain
   on the sidelines. We examine what stymies some citizens' mobilization in
   Kenya, a country with a long history of environmental activism and high
   vulnerability to climate change. We foreground efficacy-a belief that
   one's actions can create change-as a critical link transforming concern
   into action. However, that link is often missing for marginalized
   ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious groups. Analyzing interviews, focus
   groups, and survey data, we find that Muslims express much lower
   efficacy to address climate change than other religious groups; the gap
   cannot be explained by differences in science beliefs, issue concern,
   ethnicity, or demographics. Instead, we attribute it to understandings
   of marginalization vis-a-vis the Kenyan state-understandings socialized
   within the local institutions of Muslim communities affected by state
   repression.},

Abstract = {Theoretical advances in the study of institutional change center around
   a productive paradox. While change agents can take strategic action to
   change institutions, institutions display a remarkable level of formal
   stability. From this paradox, we expect that attempts to change
   institutions are an empirical regularity and that many formal change
   attempts will fail. This article contributes to historical
   institutionalism by analyzing the political effects of failed formal
   institutional change attempts on institutional sequences. Failed
   institutional change attempts could be mere blips, having little effect
   on subsequent institutional trajectories, or even inoculate against
   future attempts. Failed attempts could also lay the ideational
   groundwork, aid in coalition building, and garner concessions for
   subsequent institutional change, or convince change agents to alter
   their strategy. The article suggests analytical strategies to assess the
   effects of failed institutional change attempts, drawing on examples
   from comparative politics and two extended case illustrations from
   Italian party politics and the Affordable Care Act in the United States.},

Abstract = {Partial and perceived empowerment in the practice of public hearings,
   widely spreading across China since the late 1990s and still operating
   today, is puzzling. Citizens enjoy the right to participation,
   information, and formal equality but their political empowerment is
   constrained without the right to elect and dismiss officials there. This
   article examines the politics of `authoritarian empowerment,' which
   combines partial empowerment and sophisticated control, and separates
   psychological empowerment from political empowerment. Through such a
   delicate combination and separation, citizens are partially empowered,
   paradoxically, to prevent their full empowerment. Our study is a
   supplement to the previous study of authoritarian deliberation
   (consultation) and phantom democracy, discloses the deficiency of the
   literature on local deliberative democracy in China, and enriches the
   literature on sophisticated authoritarian innovation in Southeast Asia.
   The article is based on documented research, interviews with 469
   non-participants and 72 participants, and an in-depth case study in
   Shanghai.},

Abstract = {David Cameron's leadership of the Conservatives took as its starting
   point the assumption that the party needed to modernise, requiring a
   move towards the political `centre ground'. This shift presented the
   party leadership with a series of challenges, including brand
   detoxification, party management, and policy renewal. Modernisation also
   implied ideological change, to distance the Conservatives from the
   legacy of Thatcherism and realign conservatism with the values of a
   wider section of the electorate. In this respect, Cameronite
   modernisation can be judged a failure. This article suggests that
   ontological contradictions inherent in central elements of Cameron's
   conservatism, specifically the `Big Society' and the `social justice
   agenda', fatally undermined its ideological coherence. It argues that
   this is an important and hitherto overlooked part of the explanation for
   the shortcomings of Conservative Party modernisation as a political
   project. Although this is only one part in a wider explanation for the
   failure of Conservative modernisation, this case study demonstrates that
   ontological assumptions matter in political practice.},

Title = {``Do perceptions of EMU alter clarity of responsibility? A comparison of
   German and Greek electorates{''}},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to understand whether perceptions of
   supranationalisation of economic policy mitigate economic voting in the
   Eurozone. We focus on two countries with divergent performances in the
   Eurozone: Germany and Greece, and make use of a novel dataset, which
   contains all necessary items to test this hypothesis. Our comprehensive
   vote model shows that in both countries economic voting occurs. However,
   once we interact perceptions of EU responsibility with perceptions of
   economic performance, we obtain diverging results: in Germany, the
   weight of economic perceptions on vote increases when citizens assign a
   higher responsibility to the EU for the country?s economic situation.
   This is the opposite of what the ?blurring of responsibility? posits. On
   the contrary, Greek electors are in line with expectations of our main
   hypothesis. Moreover, in this country we also found support for the idea
   that only citizens with a high level of political sophistication are
   able to incorporate the distribution of responsibilities for the
   economic policy in their vote calculus. Our results suggest that the
   blurring of responsibility effect on the vote may not be systematic
   across the Eurozone.},

Abstract = {Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump secured their respective party's 2016
   nominations only after raucous, spirited debates among delegates at the
   start of each party convention. Groups and their preferred candidates
   behaved consistently with the policy demanders view of parties, which
   identifies parties as comprised of coalitions of groups with strong
   policy preferences that negotiate with one another for influence in the
   party decision-making and policy process. Using the 2016 Convention
   Delegate Study, the longest standing survey of Democratic and Republican
   Party activists, we examine intra-party groups as new delegates are
   folded into the framework along with returning delegates. We assess how
   the theory of parties as comprised of policy-demander groups works in a
   context of high external party polarization. The competition between
   these groups to recast their party in its preferred image in the absence
   of a standard party bearer for either party holds important implications
   for Democrats and Republicans in future presidential and congressional
   elections.},

Abstract = {Do incumbents dominate non-partisan elections because of an especially
   large personal vote? This question has important implications for
   understanding the causes of incumbent success and the benefits or
   drawbacks of non-partisan elections. This paper uses a natural
   experiment, combined with three original datasets, to estimate the size,
   persistence, and consequences of the personal vote in a large
   non-partisan city election. We first use individual-level survey data to
   show that individuals assigned quasi-randomly to a new incumbent are
   substantially less likely to support the incumbent. We use a second
   survey, one year later, to demonstrate the persistence of this effect.
   Finally, we use historical election results to simulate the electoral
   consequences of the personal vote; we find that the personal vote is
   sufficiently large to affect one in four incumbent races. We conclude
   that the personal vote, while large and important, is not sufficient to
   explain incumbent dominance in non-partisan contests.},

Abstract = {Reading testimonies and diaries of people of ethnic minorities in
   Amsterdam in the 17(th) and 18(th) century one cannot but admire
   Amsterdam for its policies of inclusion, which, actually inspired John
   Locke when he wrote A Letter Concerning Toleration. And yet, the traumas
   of the Jews in the Second World War and the Surinamese in the 1970s
   suggest that this model of inclusion and toleration was unstable and
   fragile. Indeed, in recent years many Amsterdamers have acknowledged
   that the city betrayed not only its ethnic minorities but also its own
   values. The shift in policies of tolerance which characterizes
   contemporary Amsterdam is interpreted here as a modification of the
   ethos of tolerance, from tolerance and inclusion based on indifference
   to tolerance and inclusion based on curiosity. This ethos includes
   seeing the other as part of one's own `self', and the `self' as plural,
   or, as several Amsterdamers told me, `hybrid'.},

Abstract = {This study investigates emotions conveyed in US presidential speeches
   and media coverage regarding the Iraq War and the Iran nuclear deal
   during 2003 and 2015. The researchers gathered and examined news stories
   about the two policies, all official speeches delivered by George W Bush
   and Barack Obama, and opinion polls conducted during the respective
   six-month period in those two years. Nine discrete emotions were coded
   to capture the valence and volume in the speeches and news media
   content. The study finds that emotions appear more frequently in the
   Iraq discourse than in the Iran counterpart. President Bush used more
   negative emotions while President Obama employed more positive emotions.
   Emotion in the media coverage is constant and stable across the two
   policy periods; yet negative emotions are more prevalent than positive
   counterparts in the media despite distinct foreign policies. The study
   also examines public opinion trends toward the two policies for
   inferring potential linkage. This article contributes to the conceptual
   nexus among emotional persuasion, journalism pattern, and foreign
   policy-making process.},

Abstract = {Global studies on the historical origins of old-age pensions from a
   political regime perspective are quite rare. Based on the novel PENLEG
   dataset this article shows that democratic and nondemocratic regimes had
   different policy priorities when designing old-age pensions for the
   first time. Whereas democracies had significantly higher legal pension
   coverage rates than nondemocratic regimes, the reverse pattern can be
   found for pension replacement rates. The study also shows that temporal
   effects and colonial legacy mattered. Longstanding democracies
   introduced much higher legal pension coverage rates than countries that
   had recently democratized. Additionally, the French colonial legacy
   spurred high legal pension coverage rates in African autocracies. These
   findings underline the importance of taking the multidimensionality of
   welfare programs into account when analyzing political regime
   differences. Moreover, due attention must be paid to the historical
   context when theorizing about welfare policies from a political regime
   perspective.},

Abstract = {What are the predictors of the five types of policy regimes on campus
   carry across the 50 U.S. states? This study explores the roles of
   problem environment, gun culture, state policy liberalism, region, and
   racial politics to answer that research question. We argue that morality
   policy, the role of region in the adoption of public policy, and the
   southern subculture of violence are useful theoretical lenses for
   examining campus carry. We find that the problem environment-measured as
   gun murders per 100,000 population and the violent crime rate on college
   campuses-is negatively related to the adoption of campus carry policy
   regimes, while the gun culture (measured as gun purchases per capita and
   the total number of gun-related interest groups) is positively related
   to the adoption of campus carry. State policy liberalism is a
   significant predictor of the type of policy regime adopted across the
   states, and the interaction term of percentage minority population and
   the South is a powerful predictor of adopting campus carry. The findings
   highlight the extant significance of the role of region, but it is
   conditioned by racial politics in the case of campus carry. Morality
   policy suggests that the rapid spread of concealed carry on college
   campuses may have hit a ceiling.},

Abstract = {Ever since they have existed, studies have shown a link between
   religious affiliation and political behavior. However, the basis for
   this link is a social science blind spot. This article will therefore
   focus on the relationships between four poles: religious affiliation,
   political, moral, and economic attitudes. According to the EVS data,
   Catholics, Muslims, and the ``no religion{''} group continue to express
   very different political attitudes in France today. These differences
   are not reducible to the peculiarities of the social affiliations of
   their members, nor to their possible migratory origin. And the opposing
   political attitudes of Catholics and the ``no religion{''} turn out to
   be only partly due to the cultural attitudes associated with them, in
   the economic sphere and even more so in the moral sphere.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to understand why the EU opted to conclude
   the `EU-Turkey refugee deal' in March 2016 in the context of the Syrian
   refugee crisis, despite the fact that the agreement deeply contradicts
   fundamental EU values and norms. The article seeks to explain the
   outcome-the conclusion of the EU-Turkey refugee deal-by analysing not
   only the ability of EU institutions to shape decisions, but also their
   motivations, ideas and preferences in justifying the EU's actions in
   responding to the refugee challenge. It is argued that the deal results
   from ideational and power struggles between supranational (the European
   Parliament and the European Commission) and intergovernmental
   institutions (the European Council and the Council of the European
   Union). It is demonstrated that while the former put forward normative
   arguments, the latter invoked security as a main concern to avoid
   internal divisions between Member States. This article also reveals that
   such ideational and power struggles have consequences for the EU's
   identity. Theoretically, the article builds on the new
   intergovernmentalist claims and on the normative/civilian power
   literature. Empirically, it explores the usage of normative
   justifications by EU institutions and points to inter-institutional
   tensions in framing the EU's response to the refugee challenge.},

Title = {Refugee camps and refugee rights: A simulation of the response to large

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This essay introduces and analyzes a one-class role-play simulation
   during which students engage in stakeholder negotiations on how to
   respond to a large flow of refugees between two fictional African
   countries. Participants acquire an in-depth knowledge of arguments
   regarding granting and restricting refugees' freedom of movement and
   civil and economic rights. Contributing to the expanding literature on
   active and interdisciplinary teaching strategies, this content-oriented
   simulation teaches public policy, as well as humanitarian and
   development responses in the wake of a large influx of forced migrants
   in a developing country. The simulation thus addresses questions related
   to courses on development, conflict and refugee studies, international
   organizations, human rights, and international relations. Based on six
   iterations of the simulation, the essay discusses specific design
   decisions in the preparation, interaction, and debriefing stage and
   their impact on the simulation, as well as principal learning outcomes.
   This includes detailed discussions of briefing memos, role sheets, role
   selection, and key questions during the debriefing session.},

Abstract = {The article examines the options for the interaction of paradiplomacy of
   subnational units subjects of federations and territorial autonomies -
   and the national foreign policy of the central governments. The author
   identifies three main types of interaction: parallel, conflict,
   synergistic. It is noted that initially the term paradiplomacy{''}
   referred to such external relations of subnational actors of
   international relations, which developed separately from the foreign
   policy of the federal level (that is, within the first or second type).
   It is shown that the development of interaction between foreign activity
   at the national and subnational levels has led to the expansion of the
   concept of ``paradiplomacy{''} and the emergence of alternative terms.
   The author of the article proposes the synthetic term auxiliary
   paradiplomacy to describe such a type of synergistic interaction between
   the international activity of the center and the subnational unit, when
   the latter acts as a tool for achieving national goals.},

Pages = {315-341},
Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the theories of the state and the law of
   exception that have tried to explain when and how the state can react to
   situations that endanger its own existence. The classical theories of
   the state of exception are unable to accommodate the exception in
   constitutional law because they are unable to distinguish exceptionality
   and normality. The theories on the law of exception, although they do
   allow distinguishing exceptionality and normality, reach the paradox of
   introducing the rule and the exception in the same constitutional text.
   The aim of this paper is to analyze how a constitutionally adequate
   construction of the exception in constitutional law can be carried out.

Abstract = {The subject of the investigation are the operational maintenance objects
   of the machine-building complex and the recreational-tourism sphere by
   criminal police divisions. The research methodology includes the
   following methods: general and special legal: monographic method, method
   of analysis and synthesis, comparative legal method, classification
   method, statistical method, abstract-logical method. Scientific
   approaches to operating service definition are considered. An analysis
   of the machinery construction complex and the tourist and recreational
   field was carried out to achieve high standards of its operational
   service. As a practical dignified facility of the machinery construction
   complex and the tourist and recreational sphere were ordered in
   appropriate groups to identify those in need of operational maintenance.
   It is concluded that the regulations of the Ministry of the Interior and
   the National Police of Ukraine do not contain provisions that clearly
   define the content of the institution of operational services and its
   place in the system of operational and investigative units to combat
   crime.},

Abstract = {Does a specificity of the collaborator-researcher ``actor{''} exist?
   This study examines this dual status which raises both epistemological
   and methodological questions about the approach to the fieldwork and the
   research object. But it also questions the effects of such a research
   posture on professional practice. To what extent do these two postures
   influence each other? This collaborative work aims to answer these
   questions through the reflexive analysis of each of the three
   contributors on their own experiences as collaborators of local elected
   representatives, members of Parliament and a minister. The aim is to
   identify possible paths of conducting research by placing the hybrid
   position of researcher-collaborator at the heart of the analysis. The
   article demonstrates that, despite certain methodological limitations of
   this dual status, it offers real heuristic advantages both
   methodologically and empirically in terms of understanding the
   functioning of Parliament and the ultimately heterogeneous role of
   parliamentary staff.},

Abstract = {The article examines a specific situation that is emerging in Russia and
   is associated with the erosion of the state monopoly of the legitimate
   use of violence. With the example of a seemingly routine private event
   that looks like a single failure in the system, the authors show that it
   represents one of the most significant practices of power holders, the
   essence of which they define as ``forced enforcement{''} and analyze its
   origins and possible implications.
   In a gigantic country, the regions of which vary significantly in the
   level of their socio-economic development, enforcement of rules is
   associated with costs that exceed the amount of the resulting benefits.
   Therefore, the state limits its function as an enforcer to the control
   only over the key industries and does not encroach on the rest. However,
   under the contemporary conditions this tactic stops working. Since key
   industries are no longer able to meet the needs of the enlarged state,
   it begins to extend its control to the new social and economic spheres.
   The dramatic expansion of the area of application of the enforcement
   tools and complicated procedures associated with the need to control
   these tools themselves make them more and more costly. Thus, the task is
   to make them less costly, while maintaining, or even increasing, the
   volume of work. The very fact of intentionally setting such an
   insurmountable task makes the corresponding organs look for non-trivial
   solutions that are outside the state-imposed rules. Created as
   ``enforcement machines{''}, they acquire their own mind and interests,
   and thus their own subjectivity. They no longer enforce the rules, but
   begin to form them, trying to shift the fulfillment of their functions
   to citizens and thereby pushing them to search for new enforcers that
   are not at all connected with the state.},

Abstract = {This monographic section questions the concept of domesticity, and some
   of its concrete developments, both as a principle of order and as a
   device through which historically and culturally variable differences
   and meanings are articulated - starting with those associated with it
   from the very beginning, namely the values of stability, solidity and
   centredness. The essays collected here challenge the idea of a
   separation between domestic and political space, which is made to
   coincide tout court with that between private and public space. For a
   long time, this dichotomy relegated domesticity to a politically
   irrelevant dimension. Instead, it is the home as a political form that
   is here investigated and questioned.},

Abstract = {Despite the European Parliament's (EP) growing role, its influence and
   scrutiny capacity remain considerably weaker than the role traditionally
   reserved for parliaments in economic and fiscal policy decision-making
   at the national level. The EP has exploited any opportunity to enhance
   these powers: In particular, the EP has a record of using crisis and
   extraordinary situations to expand its role beyond the formal
   prerogatives given to the institution. Following this literature, this
   article examines the role and influence of the EP on economic and fiscal
   policy, focusing on the response to the Covid-19 crisis. Negotiation of
   the Recovery and Resilience Facility presents an auspicious area to
   analyse the strategies implemented by the EP to influence the outcome
   and reinforce its position in EU economic governance. The article will
   look specifically at the formal and informal mechanisms used by the EP
   during the crisis to expand its powers. Moreover, it utilises a research
   design that combines the content analysis of several official/public
   documents and statements from key members of the European Parliament
   (MEPs) involved in economic policy.},

   from Micro-data on Extortion in West Africa},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-323},
Abstract = {Using two large cross-national micro datasets on extortion and commodity
   flows, I provide evidence of corruption cycles around elections in five
   West African states. In democracies but not in autocracies, police and
   other officials extort bribes that are 30\% higher in the buildup to
   elections. These cycles occur on the intensive margin - the price at
   which bribes are set - rather than on the extensive margin - the total
   number of agents extorting. When incumbents lose, prices remain
   abnormally high. When incumbents win, prices return to normal levels. I
   find no evidence of political cycles in the composition, quantity, or
   direction of commodity flows, and scant support for the idea that
   politicians use extortion for illicit campaign fundraising. Traditional
   political business cycles also do not appear to explain corruption
   cycles in this context. Rather, I argue that corruption cycles may
   result from independent decision-making by bureaucrats who need to
   insure against the uncertainty of future leadership.},

Abstract = {The text is proposed as an initial exercise in the construction of the
   Historical Memory of the Industrial University of Santander, UIS, within
   the framework of the Colombian internal armed conflict during the 1980s,
   with the aim of promoting symbolic collective reparation before the
   university community and the community in general, a fundamental step in
   the consolidation of peace and in the enforceability of guarantees for
   non-repetition of the victimizing acts. Based on the recognition that
   social memories are dispute fields, methodologically we appeal to oral
   history as a way of promoting the active participation of affected
   social actors and that, up to now, their voices have been silenced or
   dismissed in the resolution of their problematic. The university as a
   territory is a convergence of diverse knowledge space, movements,
   organizations and social actors. Next, we focus on the artistic groups
   that emerged in the UIS, with the purpose of understanding what was the
   role of artists, and how they contributed to the formation of a broad
   social movement in which various sectors of the UIS and of the
   Bumanguesa society.},

Abstract = {Ever since the 1920 Treaty of Trianon there have been sizable Hungarian
   minorities found in countries neighbouring the modern Hungarian state.
   Since the fall of authoritarian communist regimes and the rise of
   political plurality these minorities have sought representation, often
   through minority parties. This lens of political parties is applied in
   this article, in order to examine the seeking of representation by the
   Hungarian ethnic minority in Serbia and Slovakia. The overall
   development of parties is outlined, the stages of their development is
   illustrated and each stage is analysed in detail. The main findings are
   that Hungarian minority representation is incredibly fragmented and
   dogged by conflict in both countries, involving many splits in parties,
   with the formation and liquidation of parties common. However, during
   exceptional times they were able to show a united front to nationalist
   governments, this was observed in both Slovakia and Serbia. In more
   recent times conflict has returned to the fore, with the situations
   somewhat divergent. The high level of conflict within those seeking to
   offer political representation to the Hungarian minority in Serbia was
   notable, as was a lack of an end in sight. On the other hand, there were
   attempts to unite made in Slovakia, although they are yet to experience
   much success.},

Abstract = {When a non-violent resistance campaign does not have leverage to
   challenge powerful opponents, third-party intervention has been shown to
   assist. While the role of external third-party interveners - foreign
   activists - has been documented, less attention has been given to
   intervention from members of the dominant population. Drawing from the
   literature on civil resistance and through the study of Israeli Jews who
   intervene in Palestinian resistance campaigns against the Israeli
   military occupation, I argue that intervention from members of the
   dominant population is strategically desirable. Through an analysis of
   three Palestinian campaigns, this article identifies that the physical
   presence of Israeli Jews was needed to ensure the Palestinians could
   maintain their resistance efforts and presence on the land, despite the
   repression they faced. Furthermore, the skills and knowledge of the
   Israelis were needed to help the Palestinians achieve some of their
   goals, at least in the short term.},

   been the subject of controversies lasting over many years. This

   totalitarianism by discussing its interpretations by early anti-Fascism.
   The latter's representatives - Liberals, Christian Democrats, Social
   Democrats, Socialists - grasped the ``totalitarian{''} features of a
   movement before it had established as a one-party regime, and they
   coined the term itself.},

Abstract = {Within the Catalonian sovereigntist project, the Parliament of Catalonia
   has played a very prominent role through the approval of laws and
   numerous declarations and motions that sought to implement the
   pro-independence roadmap, and which have been systematically appealed
   before the Constitutional Court.
   In this paper, we will analyse the Constitutional Court's rulings on the
   Catalan Parliament's activity without legal force to determine whether
   they deviate from constitutional case-law on the position and functions
   of the Parliament and its members. In this way, we will try to determine
   whether and to what extent this case-law has modified the degree of
   parliamentary autonomy that the Constitutional Court has recognised for
   decades.},

Abstract = {In Russia, stricter measures were taken during the first half of 2020 to
   stem the spread of the coronavirus than in many other countries.
   However, in the second half of 2020 and in the spring of 2021, they were
   largely rescinded. Even so, the pandemic policy appeared to have been a
   success: the state budget was not badly affected, and domestic
   production declined to a lesser extent than in other countries, since
   business activity was not significantly restricted. The country boasts
   of its favourable position in the global ranking list of infections and
   deaths reported to the WHO. However, this official data does not reflect
   reality. The death rate, which increased considerably in 2020 compared
   to 2019, indicates that the real number of Covid-19 deaths and
   infections is six times higher in 2020, and three times higher during
   the first quarter of 2021.},

Pages = {16-28},
Abstract = {The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was the last policy field to be
   placed under the Ordinary Legislative Procedure and its 2013 reform was
   the first to be decided under this rule. This article analyses how rule
   changes following the Lisbon Treaty have shaped policy outcomes related
   to `greening,' i.e., making agricultural policy more environmentally
   friendly. Measuring the policy ambitions of amendments during the
   different phases of the legislative process (the processing phase within
   the Parliament and the negotiating phase during trilogues), we find that
   the European Parliament weakened the Commission's greening proposals-but
   did so to support an alternative greening agenda built on different
   policy instruments. This means that rule change has altered the power
   balance between the institutions, making the Commission more dependent
   on the European Parliament. In the 2013 reform, this new balance of
   power came at the cost of greening the CAP.},

Abstract = {Fundamentally, self-immolation is an ancient practice. Despite this
   cultural and historical humankind experience, every new case of
   self-immolation for political reasons is an appalling piece of
   information to us. In this paper, we examine, present and reflect on
   self-immolation as a form of suicide, on its causes and consequences in
   selected cases that we register in international relations. The aim of
   this study is to assess the self-immolation as a politically motivated
   act. We conclude that the aim of the self-immolation act as a political
   protest is, on the one hand, to point out, condemn, punish political
   authority, express the will to initiate political change or to express
   political guilt by one's own death. On the other hand, these actions are
   not automatically linked to the intention to mobilize for a collective
   response.},

Title = {Three Types of Culture Wars and the Populist Strategies in Central
   Europe},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-150},
Abstract = {Since the `migration crisis' in 2015 at the latest, the politics of a
   broadly conceived Central Europe has been marked by conflicts over
   symbols, values and norms. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria,
   and the Czech Republic have witnessed divisive debates and campaigns
   over refugee quo- tas, women's and gay rights, abortion laws and public
   monuments. As the term `culture wars' was becoming ubiquitous, it
   remained ambivalent in its meaning and usage. The aim of this article is
   to identify a political logic of recent Central European cultural
   conflicts without leaning solely on the ideological explanation, e.g.
   the anti-liberal backlash thesis of Rupnik, and Krastev and Holms. By
   borrowing R. Brubaker's conceptualizations of identity and populism, the
   article contends that it is possible to analyze culture wars as a
   repertoire of a populist political style. To do so, the article de-
   velops a critical perspective on culture wars, defined as polarizing
   conflicts in the arenas of the pol- itics of memory, politics of
   identity and politics of morality. Culture wars are analyzed as a
   strategy of re-politicization of memory (especially of World War II),
   (civilizational) identity and public morality and a code used in
   struggles for political and cultural hegemony.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {219-229},
Abstract = {The financial and eurozone crises highlighted the inadequacy of the
   original governance structures of the eurozone. In response, a range of
   reforms were launched, including the creation of a European banking
   union. In practice, some elements of the banking union were delayed by
   division among member states and the breakdown of the Franco-German
   motor, such as the question of the operationalization of the single
   resolution mechanism and fund or the deposit insurance scheme. In
   addition, eurozone governance-which would once have been regarded as a
   technocratic issue-became increasingly politicized. The aim of this
   article is to study the extent to which the banking union was
   scrutinized by parliament and to what degree this reflects material
   interests and ideas. For this purpose, it focuses on salience (i.e., how
   much attention the issue received) and polarization (i.e., the
   divergence of positions). The analysis of the resolutions and debates of
   the German Bundestag and French Assemblee Nationale, i.e., the
   parliaments of two key states in EU decision-making on banking union,
   finds that the German government was indeed closely scrutinized, whereas
   the French government was relatively unconstrained.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the study was to demonstrate the hypothesis that
   the use of an infrared spectroscopy method for the investigation of
   objects of examination allows to obtain important and reliable data that
   can be used in criminal proceedings. The authors explain that knowledge
   of the possibilities and procedures for using new methods of scientific
   research is necessary not only for experts, but also for other
   participants in criminal proceedings who evaluate the evidence. Through
   the documentary method focused on specialized literature on the subject,
   special sources of literature on the application of the IR spectroscopy
   method for the investigation of individual objects and the analysis of
   possibilities and establishment of the great importance of its use in
   judicial practice in general were reviewed. It is concluded that,
   studies show that the use of infrared spectroscopy can not only increase
   the level of scientific and technical support of legal medical practice,
   but also improves the quality of expert research and therefore increases
   confidence in the accuracy and reliability of conclusions made by an
   expert.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the state and development of civil society in
   Central and Eastern Europe as basic determinants of its development,
   using integrative indices of civil society sustainability. The external
   and internal logic of these indices for 2019 is studied. The research
   uses methods of cluster analysis, linear correlation, and multiple
   regression analysis to model the interaction of the determinants of
   civil society development in the region. The results of the analysis in
   the Central and Eastern European region reveal interesting links not
   only between the status of civil society and the state, but also in the
   relationship of factors that reflect the analytical triangle of
   relationships. People's satisfaction with government is not a simple
   consequence of the economic situation: the relationship between social
   wealth and economic progress. The status of civil society also turns out
   to be a factor in this system of relationships, along with the quality
   of social relations and the existing sociopsychological characteristics
   of the population. The numerical values of the civil society situation
   and development indices obtained in this way can be used in statistical
   models.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the paternalistic arguments for state regulation,
   considering that paternalistic justifications are one of the main
   reasons to regulate. It is noted that paternalistic regulation brings
   problems of three kinds: epistemic, institutional, and referring to the
   very linguistic framework used by law. More specifically, we argue that,
   when such justifications are used, there are (i) cognitive and
   situational limitations to the regulator; (ii) valid questions regarding
   the real motivations of regulatory interventions based on paternalism;
   and (iii) accentuation of the problem of ``incongruence{''} between the
   effects of the application of norms and the (first order) reasons that
   justify them.},

   organizing judicial activity based on information technologies, which
   aims to ensure the operation, mainly, of the principles of publicity and
   openness, transparency, and accessibility of information from
   constitutional (statutory) legal procedures as a variety of the latter
   in the Russian Federation. In the methodological of use the technique of
   documentary observation. Indeed, electronic (statutory)constitutional
   justice in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation has a
   multifaceted nature and characteristic, as it can be considered in
   several contexts, including the attribution to the group of additional
   constitutional guarantees of human and civil rights. It is concluded
   that electronic constitutional justice brings spaces of justice closer
   to individuals and communities, making it easier to exercise their
   rights and duties.},

Title = {Japan's Climate Change Discourse: Toward Climate Securitisation?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {53-64},
Abstract = {This article situates Japan in the international climate security debate
   by analysing competing climate change discourses. In 2020, for the first
   time, the Japanese Ministry of the Environment included the term
   ``climate crisis{''} (kiko kiki) in its annual white paper, and the
   Japanese parliament adopted a ``climate emergency declaration{''} (kiko
   hijo jitai sengen). Does this mean that Japan's climate discourse is
   turning toward the securitisation of climate change? Drawing on
   securitisation theory, this article investigates whether we are seeing
   the emergence of a climate change securitisation discourse that treats
   climate change as a security issue rather than a conventional political
   issue. The analysis focuses on different stakeholders in Japan's climate
   policy: the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of
   Economy, Trade, and Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
   parliament, the Cabinet, and sub- and non-state actors. Through a
   discourse analysis of ministry white papers and publications by other
   stake-holders, the article identifies a burgeoning securitisation
   discourse that challenges, albeit moderately, the status quo of
   incrementalism and inaction in Japan's climate policy. This article
   further highlights Japan's position in the rapidly evolving global
   debate on the urgency of climate action and provides explanations for
   apparent changes and continuities in Japan's climate change discourse.},

Title = {Defining ``Publicness{''} in Service Contracts - Adding Colour to the
   Grey},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-194},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify the circumstances under which
   general principles of public administrative law apply to services
   delivered by private entities under service contracts with public
   authorities. Relying on a functional approach to public administration,
   it builds on the notion that public administration in the substantive
   sense is the key to the applicability of general principles of
   administrative law in service contract situations. It seeks criteria
   usable to define a function as ``public{''} and so determine the
   applicability of such principles in the relations between the user and a
   private body carrying out services under a service contract. Icelandic
   law is used as test case, though guidance is sought from other sources
   and theories. Certain factors are deduced from judgements of the
   Icelandic Supreme Court, opinions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman and
   from theories on private liability for human rights violations. Together
   these form the grounds of a general holistic three-phased test, the
   initial points, the material points and the supporting points, for the
   definition of ``publicness{''}. Application of the test may help clarify
   the ``grey zone{''} bet ween public and private law.},

Abstract = {Of scientific interest is the process and the result of the cognitive
   activity of law enforcement, which affects the functioning of the entire
   legal system. The problem of developing the professional legal
   conscience of law enforcement is revealed through the study of its value
   component, so the reference to the legal axiology of 19th-century
   Russian conservatism is a relevant scientific issue. The authors
   consider the opinions of the main conservative thinkers of the
   pre-revolutionary period: K. N. Leontiev and K. P. Pobedonostsev, the
   heritage of I. A. Ilyin that belongs to the first quarter of the
   twentieth century, etc. It is concluded that professional legal
   understanding must be based both on the modern legal paradigm and on the
   national legal tradition, mentality and established positive social
   practices. It is necessary to correlate values of the ethical and legal
   categories: justice and truth, rights and duties, dignity and honor,
   freedom, equality, order, etc. It can be said that the modern legal
   conscience of special subjects accumulates many legal values of Russian
   conservatism, including ``justice{''}, ``order{''},
   ``responsibility{''}.},

Abstract = {The research highlights the peculiarities of the decentralization of
   power in Ukraine in the political and legal implementation aspect of the
   principle of subsidiarity. The objective of the study was to determine
   compliance with the political and legal aspects of the decentralization
   process in Ukraine based on global standards of the use of the principle
   of subsidiarity, during the implementation of decentralization reform.
   The research methodology is based on the fact that the principle of
   subsidiarity is the main feature of the interaction of all levels of
   power. This premise is recognized in the European Charter of Local
   Self-Government and therefore means an urgent task in modern Ukraine.
   Financial decentralization, district consolidation, the creation of
   different but united territorial communities, changes in the
   administrative-territorial structure, ensuring the capacities of
   communities, the provision of public services in accordance with
   national standards must be based on the principle of subsidiarity. The
   information gathered makes it possible to conclude that the principle of
   subsidiarity is a barrier to the overly profound centralization of the
   state body and the separation of power.},

   before the political elections in Slovakia in February 2020. As the
   `social-democratization' of Smer-SD was the result of party's
   Europeanization, the article explores the dimensions of
   de-Europeanization in the politics of this party in 2017-2020. Since
   2006, Smer-SD has occupied a dominant position among political parties
   in Slovakia. However, a substantive decline in the electoral support of
   the party took place after 2016. Smer-SD faced a significant political
   challenge during the political crisis after the assassination of the
   journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova in February
   2018. The result was the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico. The
   appointment of party vice chairman Peter Pellegrini as Prime Minister
   created a new situation within the party, as for the first time the
   positions of Prime Minister and head of the party were separated. The
   political crisis in 2018 revealed the presence of internal conflicts
   within the party and the weakening of the authority of its chairman,
   Robert Fico. The establishment of two centres of power within the party
   resulted in competition between Fico and Pellegrini and, finally, in
   June 2020, a split, as Pellegrini announced the founding of a new
   political party.},

Abstract = {This essay claims that intellectual property markets are not
   self-corrective. The discourse of self-corrective intellectual property
   markets is based upon a belief regarding the tendency of the market to
   automatically eliminate harmful consequences resulting from piracy,
   fraud, corruption, and conflict of interest among agents buying and
   selling music, movies, and journal articles. Following the
   critical-logics approach of discourse theory, this essay argues that
   intellectual property markets function according to certain logics:
   their social logics are grounded in the normalization of knowledge
   production and exchange, and their political logics deploy judicial
   mechanisms and sanctions against dislocatory moments such as copyright
   infringement. Meanwhile, their fantasmatic logics conceal the radical
   contingency of the given intellectual property regime, fueled by the
   academic desire for recognition via publishing in journals operated by
   for-profit companies. In exposing the logics of intellectual property
   markets, the essay suggests a counterhegemonic position supporting the
   ethics of open access and peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing.},

Abstract = {Internationally and nationally - although to different degrees - large
   companies have deployed business case arguments for investment in
   inclusion and diversity. This programme of equality or proportionate
   representation of women in decision-making can be seen as narrow or
   moderate, compared to a broader agenda of social justice, including
   redistributive wage strategies, pursued by trade unions, which often
   also link gender to social class. The European Commission has long
   advocated collective bargaining as a means of narrowing pay gaps within
   organisations, but progress in reducing gender pay gaps has stalled
   since 2008. Our analysis, based on a wider study of collective
   agreements on gender equality in France and illustrated by two
   organisational case studies in the information technology sector, shows
   how employers and trade unions deploy different forms of `gender
   knowledge', which shape the way in which information on pay gaps is
   collected and analysed and in which it forms the basis for action.
   Within the domestic context of state-managed collective bargaining,
   sectoral and local power relations determine the outcome of the
   negotiations.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, we have witnessed the consolidation of the knowledge
   society, based on a process of globalization, which promotes the
   consolidation of the knowledge economy as an emerging paradigm, as well
   as promoting new dynamics of scientific cooperation, especially from the
   European Union to the rest of the world. Agreements, summits, and a
   network of science diplomacy have been set up reflecting the impact of
   knowledge on new development models. From this process, conceived as a
   catalyst for value chains based on knowledge intensity, it is possible
   to glimpse new power conflicts related to other recent conflicts for
   economic and political hegemony on a global scale. This study aims to
   analyze countries??? behavior vis-??-vis the global threat of the COVID
   19 pandemic, based on the correlation between their ability to face it
   and their levels of knowledge-based development as a differentiating
   element in terms of vulnerability. The results show a process where
   scientific cooperation has given way to a field of geopolitical
   competition between the actors of the international system, affecting
   their levels of vulnerability to global threats.},

Abstract = {Electoral violence is conceived of as violence that occurs
   contemporaneously with elections, and as violence that would not have
   occurred in the absence of an election. While measuring the temporal
   aspect of this phenomenon is straightforward, measuring whether
   occurrences of violence are truly related to elections is more
   difficult. Using machine learning, we measure electoral violence across
   three elections using disaggregated reporting in social media. We
   demonstrate that our methodology is more than 30 percent more accurate
   in measuring electoral violence than previously utilized models.
   Additionally, we show that our measures of electoral violence conform to
   theoretical expectations of this conflict more so than those that exist
   in event datasets commonly utilized to measure electoral violence
   including ACLED, ICEWS, and SCAD. Finally, we demonstrate the validity
   of our data by developing a qualitative coding ontology.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {383-408},
Abstract = {A distinctive feature of the State of Autonomies is the recognition of
   political autonomy of the Autonomous Communities and, inherent to it and
   at the same time a necessary instrument to make it possible, the
   financial autonomy. The Spanish constitutional system provides
   protection to that autonomy, both at the textual and case-law levels.
   The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), however, has led a substantial
   transformation of the financial autonomy as a constitutional value, from
   the perspective of the spending power, of the Autonomous Communities.
   This article explores this transformation and identifies three stages
   -EMU precrisis, EMU in crisis and the current efforts of reforming the
   EMU and the allocation and management of the European funds for
   recovery- which have shaped the financial autonomy of the Autonomous
   Communities. The article analyzes the interaction between the Spanish
   constitutional system and the European Union Law and points out the
   latter as an engine of a constitutional transformation and as a decisive
   factor in the evolution of the State of Autonomies.},

Abstract = {He was intended to understand the process of transforming social and
   labor relations in the context of the implementation of pension reform
   in Russia, taking into account the axiological aspects, in particular
   ``digital axiology{''}. Its objective is to identify the impact of
   digitization on changes in industrial relations in the context of
   pension reform. The theoretical and methodological basis of research is
   based on an interdisciplinary system approach and generational value
   theory. An economic analysis is performed, along with the grouping of
   empirical data and digitization rates are presented. A survey of more
   than 6,000 people was also conducted, the theme of which was to assess
   the impact of the Russian Federation's pension reform on social and
   labor relations, economic growth and the quality of life of the
   population. The article examines cardinal changes in the social and
   employment relationships of people of pre-retirement age in the context
   of digitization. It is concluded that the main problems of the
   development and formation of digital axiology among the pre-retired
   demand a set of political transformations.},

   Climate Emergency Declarations},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {29-40},
Abstract = {UK universities have been successively declaring a climate emergency,
   following the University of Bristol's lead in 2019. Universities are key
   actors in climate change education, and potentially progressive
   organisations researching, teaching and implementing low carbon futures.
   Using universities' sustainability strategies, we present a secondary
   analysis identifying neoliberalism's significant role in influencing
   universities' sustainability policies and practices. This plays out
   through university boosterism where universities use their
   sustainability work to claim sustainability leadership, representing a
   form of sustainability capital to attract funding and potential
   students. Furthermore, we suggest a cognitive-practice gap exists
   between those researching sustainability and those implementing
   sustainability in universities. Thus, we conclude that there are
   inherent tensions in universities' sustainability governance, with
   universities embodying contradictory sustainability discourses and
   advancing a form of green capitalism. Entrenched neoliberal ideologies
   present challenges for those declaring a climate emergency and how such
   declarations are subsequently operationalised.},

Abstract = {Dowding's new edition of RCPP includes an original reflection on the
   task of conceptual analysis, where he argues against the need to provide
   a formal definition of power. In doing so, he endorses a strong
   anti-essentialist view on the definition of political concepts and
   resorts to a reductionist conception of power based on the notion of
   power-resources. In this article, I investigate the implications of
   Dowding's position for the understanding of the concept of power and I
   discuss the relation between power and power-resources. I conclude by
   providing reasons in favor of conceptual definition and by arguing, pace
   Dowding, that we need a concept of power.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {27-42},
Abstract = {External emergency assistance (EEA) provided in the aftermath of a
   disaster has costs and benefits to the donor and recipient countries.
   Donors benefit from quick recovery feedback effects from the trade and
   cultural links, and recipient countries have additional resources to
   manage the emergency. However, EEA costs could outweigh the benefits.
   Costs include dependency, low development of risk reduction capacity,
   and staff burdened with managing the assistance as opposed to managing
   the recovery. Current efforts to reduce dependency on EEA are not
   sufficient; they are based on limited past experiences with extreme
   events and are not based on the understanding of future risks. In this
   article, we present the concept of a climate fragility risk index
   showing factors that affect a country's predisposition to be fragile to
   climate change threats and we suggest that countries with a high climate
   fragility risk index tend to depend on EEA. Further, the article
   presents the concept of critical thresholds for extreme events as a
   metric to identify possible dependency on EEA. In addition, based on
   expert and policy consultations organized in the Philippines and
   Pakistan, we identify measures that can enhance the effectiveness of EEA
   including targeted EEA provision, better integration of lessons learned
   from the relief stage into the rest of the DRR operations, proper
   documentation of past assistance experiences and consideration of these
   lessons for the improvement of EEA in the future, as well as developing
   tools such as critical threshold concepts that can better guide the
   donor and recipient countries on more effective delivery of EEA.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Ecuador's newly assumed position in the
   international system between 2017 and 2020. In that regard, the
   country's historical competitive structure is considered key to
   understanding this shift. We begin by analyzing the competing national
   projects from a historical perspective, emphasizing the two recent
   administrations. President Lenin Moreno's positioning will be analyzed
   specifically in its relation with political and economic elements, as
   well as with regards to the ideational realm. We also study the
   continuities in Ecuador's internal politics and the country's
   repositioning within the world order through diplomacy, integration
   type, security, and defense strategies, as well as its linkages to major
   global players. To conclude, we characterize the country's repositioning
   and reflect upon some structural elements.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the current political phase in South West Asia and
   North Africa (SWANA) or Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by
   contextualising it in global politics. First, the transformations of the
   nation state and neoliberal capitalism are discussed along with the
   mobilisational strategies shared among social movements in the region,
   Europe and North America, Africa, and Latin America. Second, the paper
   discusses how such transnational developments have influenced the
   scholarship on SWANA/MENA politics, highlighting a number of
   epistemological breaks in the content and process of knowledge
   production.},

Abstract = {The year 2020 in Uruguay was characterized by the unfolding of the
   agenda of the new center-right government in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic. This paper analyzes this process, paying special attention to
   the political dynamics between the new multi party coalition government
   and the opposition, under the regional context of the rise of
   conservative parties. The paper shows that the new government managed to
   take advantage of the pandemic to successfully implement its agenda of
   reforms both in terms of effectiveness, the cohesion of the ruling
   coalition and the evaluation of public opinion. At the beginning of
   2021, the deterioration of health, social and economic indicators poses
   a more complex scenario for the government.},

Abstract = {Starting from the observation that the doctrine of Reponsibility to
   Protect has as its main and paradoxical outcome the collective
   de-responsibility generated by the ``post-bipolar{''} international
   system born from the 1989 caesura, the essay critically retraces the
   historical and theoretical stages of the ``humanitarian turn{''} of
   politics and the complex interaction between political and moral
   instances still operating today within global politics. According to the
   author, these must be observed and analyzed beyond any rigid and
   absolute dichotomy between sovereignty and humanity. The analysis of the
   disconnection between the ostentatious universalistic demands at the
   basis of the humanitarian turn of international politics and the
   strongly inegalitarian, if not openly hierarchical, aspects
   characteristic of its concrete methods of implementation allow the
   Author to deal with the contradictions and betrayed promises of the
   doctrine of the responsibility to protect, exactly twenty years after
   its first elaboration.},

Title = {SOCIAL CLEAVAGES AND POLITICAL DIVIDES IN A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE:
   CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {5},
Pages = {56-77},
Abstract = {Social cleavages and their political projections are key systemic
   elements in the evolutionary transformations of modern societies.
   Cleavage theory seeks to reflect the ambiguous and dynamic realities of
   contemporary divisions, but concepts and notions describing them often
   remain unclear. An overview of the mainstream theoretical and
   methodological approaches to assessing social and political divisions in
   contemporary societies indicates three key analytical standpoints: a)
   classical theory of social cleavages and their political projections
   (following Stein Rokkan and Seymour Martin Lipset); b) the
   politicization of new social divisions and of their potential
   transformation into competitive resources for promoting political
   projects; and c) political divides as drivers of social development. A
   correlation of these approaches can contribute to promoting a complex
   methodology of assessing political transformations in a rapidly changing
   contemporary world order. Economic and social inequality, cultural
   divides, and contentious politics are important indicators of growing
   divisions, alongside an ardent public discussion and a consistent
   research agenda on cultural and socio-political polarization. The
   authors consider institutionalized political divisions between identity
   groups (in the logic of Arend Lipjhart) as one of the possible
   characteristics (but not the only one) of divided societies, and argue
   for a wider approach to this concept. Growing cleavages of different
   natures are integral parts of contemporary social dynamics, but not all
   are politically relevant: politicizing cleavages is an inherent
   characteristic of ``divided societies{''}, and criteria for their
   assessment are proposed. These criteria are applicable in the framework
   of both territorially localized (the nation state) and extraterritorial
   (non-state) communities. A cognitive map of cleavages and their
   political projections depicts the current state of the research field
   and offers insights for updating the research agenda.},

Abstract = {Based on the case of CGT structure, this article analyses how the
   administrative secretaries take part in the work of union officials.
   Beyond the administration of the files or the typewriting tasks, they
   are involved in the invisible works such as the socialisation of union
   officials, the participation at the information flow or the team
   building of ``cegetiste{''} group. These functions require professional,
   activist and gender skills which constitute the ``domestic part{''} of
   unionist work. Often ignored, these particular functions may be
   recognized by the trade union organisation, for example, when the
   secretaries become elected officials. But, in this situation, it appears
   they are often confined to women's or administrative issues.},

Title = {POLITICAL PROVOCATIONS IN THE ELECTORAL DEBATES OF U.S. PRESIDENTIAL
   CANDIDATES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {6},
Pages = {137-154},
Abstract = {Provocations, in various politicians' speeches, aimed at forming a
   favorable public opinion, play an increasingly noticeable role in the
   current political processes of the world, particularly in the United
   States. This article examines the use of provocations and manipulative
   techniques in electoral debates with an emphasis on Donald Trump's
   speeches in the pre-election televised debates in 2020. For the study,
   we analyzed the full text of Trump's and Biden's speeches that they made
   during the pre-election televised debates in October 2020, including two
   communicative situations with the use of provocations, as separate case
   studies. The paper uses the methods of grounded theory, including
   semantic, conceptual, discursive, content analysis, document analysis
   (data from the media), and case studies. Semantic and conceptual
   analysis made it possible to single out the implicit meanings, and
   highlight the cases of the use of provocations by participants in the
   televised debates. Statistical analysis made it possible to determine
   the frequency of the use of provocative techniques by the communicants,
   to group the cases where provocations were used. The study revealed
   cases of the use of provocations within the framework of communicative
   tactics of justification, victimization, virtualization of reality,
   creation of false images, and accusations of an implicit nature. The
   author concluded that the active use of provocations by politicians in
   the electoral discourse can be instrumental in strengthening their
   positions in the pre-election struggle, in the absence of clear
   advantages over the rival. On the other hand, the high frequency of
   provocations and manipulative-provocative techniques in the speech of
   politicians can create reputational risks, and reduce the likelihood of
   a provocative candidate winning the election.},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-153},
Abstract = {The centrality of abstract labor in the Marxian theory of value seems to
   imply an essentialist position incompatible with Ernesto Laclau's
   poststructuralist theory of hegemony. However, this essay argues that
   the Marxian value theory-in the interpretation offered by Moishe
   Postone-is in fact very much compatible with Laclau's focus on social
   contingency insofar as it understands abstract labor as a framework of
   social relations. This raises the question: if abstract-labor
   equivalence does not derive from a metaphysical essence, then how does
   it emerge as a socially constructed universality? The theory of value
   already anticipated Laclau's logics of difference, equivalence, and the
   empty signifier, and Laclau's work on antagonism can strengthen the
   argument that abstract-labor equivalence does not involve essentialism.
   The central point of this essay is thus to interpret abstract labor as a
   contingent hegemonic formation, constituted upon the antagonistic
   exclusion of directly useful work.},

Abstract = {The founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was based on two objectives: the
   creation of a nation with a Slavic majority in ethnically mixed Central
   Europe and the establishment of a state armed against revisionism on the
   part of those who lost the First World War. The expulsion of the Germans
   in 1945-1946 and the fundamental transformation of the international
   system after the Second World War, in particular changes in Germany's
   understanding of itself, deprived the common state of Czechs and Slovaks
   of its basis to exist. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, a swift
   velvet separation followed under democratic conditions. Although
   Czechoslovakia's balance sheet in matters of security, welfare, and the
   rule of law is by no means unambiguously negative, this state had lost
   its central function.},

Abstract = {The use of spatial econometric models in political science has steadily
   risen in recent years. However, the interpretation of these models has
   generally ignored the important substantive, and even spatial, nature of
   the estimated effects. This leaves many papers with a (non-spatial)
   interpretation of coefficients on the covariates and a brief discussion
   of the sign and strength of the spatial parameter. We introduce a
   general approach to interpreting spatial models and provide several
   avenues for an exposition of substantive spatial effects. Our approach
   can be generalized to most models in the spatial econometric taxonomy.
   Building on the example of the diffusion of democracy, we elucidate how
   our approach can be applied to modern political science problems.},

Title = {Selective Deafness of Political Parties: Strategic Responsiveness to

Abstract = {How do political parties react to different signals from society
   indicating the saliency of a particular social problem? Are all parties
   equally responsive to all signals or do certain signals prove more
   effective in engaging some parties than others? We address these
   questions from an agenda-setting perspective. In particular, we
   investigate how media attention, protest activity and real-world signals
   shape parties' attention for immigration in the federal parliament of
   Belgium. A time series model suggests that media attention, protest
   activity and real-world indicators all increase parliamentary attention
   as measured by weekly oral questions. More detailed models show the
   impact of these signals to differ across parties. Media attention and
   protest activity engage left wing parties, whereas asylum applications
   drive political action of the party delivering the responsible
   secretary. Far-right parties, finally, react both to media attention and
   real-world indicators. We conclude that political parties are
   `selectively deaf'; they act (or do not act) strategically upon incoming
   signals, depending on whether the signal fits their political goals or
   not. This article contributes to agenda-setting research by including
   multiple societal signals in its research design and by focusing on
   party characteristics and party competition to disentangle the
   conditionality of various agenda-setting effects.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the relative roles of local tax policies
   and respondent attitudes and characteristics in shaping support for
   local taxes. Using a unique set of survey data collected across dozens
   of cities over several years, combined with contextual data on local tax
   systems, we can offer a comprehensive picture of who supports, and who
   opposes local taxes. The contributions of our approach are three-fold:
   We use measures of satisfaction with local taxes, using data gathered
   across dozens of localities; we incorporate measures of the local tax
   systems to help account for city-to-city variation in local tax
   attitudes; and we incorporate measures of racial attitudes to account
   for an important non-material element heretofore not incorporated in
   studies of local tax attitudes. Integrating these factors into an
   explanation of local tax policies rounds out and offers a more realistic
   understanding of attitudes in this critical policy area.},

Abstract = {Why do politicians cluster the distribution of benefits in the run-up to
   elections? I suggest that credit claiming is an explanation for
   political budget cycles. Brazilian rules banning credit claiming before
   elections while allowing the distribution of benefits until Election Day
   provides an opportunity to differentiate between distribution and credit
   claiming combined with distribution as an engine that reinforces
   political budget cycles. Evidence from housing and
   conditional-cash-transfer programs demonstrates that officials expand
   these programs before the credit-claiming ban and halt expansion after
   the ban yet prior to Election Day. Drawing on social media and
   qualitative data, I show that politicians use credit claiming to convey
   information about their competence and attribution. Distribution without
   attribution reduces the likelihood of political budget cycles compared
   to distribution with attribution, which together reinforces pre-election
   expansion of policy benefits. I rule out rival explanations of
   clientelism and party favoritism.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {618-634},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Extending theories of social exclusion and elite messaging, we argue
   that Trump's targeted rhetoric toward Asian Americans during the
   COVID-19 pandemic pushes the racial group, largely ``Independent{''} or
   nonpartisan affiliated, to lean more towards the Democratic Party. We
   support this claim by combining social media (Study 1) and survey data
   (Study 2) analysis. Tracing 1.4 million tweets, we find that Trump's
   rhetoric has popularized racially charged coronavirus-related terms and
   that exclusionary, anti-Asian attitudes have increased in the United
   States since the pandemic began. Next, by analyzing repeated
   cross-sectional weekly surveys of Asian Americans from July 2019 to May
   2020 (n=12,907), we find that the group has leaned more towards the
   Democratic Party since Trump first made inflammatory remarks towards
   Asian Americans. Whites, Blacks, and Latina/os, on the other hand,
   exhibited fewer and less consistent changes in Democratic Party-related
   attitudes. Our findings suggest that experiences with social exclusion
   that are driven by elite sources further cement Asian Americans as
   Democrats.},

Abstract = {While the number of newspapers and the circulation of those remaining is
   decreasing, they are still the greatest contributor of new information
   into media ecosystems. Newspapers continue to pay an important role in
   setting the agenda, as other sources recycle and repackage their
   content. To assist students in learning concepts of newspapers,
   gatekeepers, agenda-setting, and media ecosystems, this article explains
   how to run the simulation ``Setting the Agenda.{''} By utilizing both
   scholarly literature and my own experiences as a journalist, the
   simulation recreates budget meetings across multiple newspapers. This
   creates a simulation that approximates a complex media ecosystem with
   stories that are important to different audiences. Within their
   newspaper staffs, students must balance different goals. Section editors
   are primarily interested in receiving the front-page for themselves, as
   this is a prestigious achievement. Executive editors, however, are
   motivated to pick a story that matches their audience, as this will
   provide the greatest benefit to the newspaper as a whole. Through the
   activity, students are able to increase their media literacy. This is a
   beneficial skill for all students, as almost all will consume mass media
   after the course.},

Abstract = {Political science is deeply but reluctantly involved in learning
   outcomes assessment. A 2013 survey reveals that political science
   departments are using assessment data strategically to satisfy mandates
   and obtain resources. By applying criteria developed by Frickel and
   Gross, outcomes assessment in higher education can be understood as an
   example of a scientific/intellectual movement, providing insight on what
   strategies political scientists can use to advance their interests. The
   durability of the assessment movement can be attributed to support from
   (1) major institutional actors, including governments, accreditors,
   foundations, and higher education advocacy groups; (2) practitioners who
   conduct assessment; and (3) researchers involved in the scholarship of
   assessment, which includes political scientists. However, full
   acceptance of assessment activities is hampered by competing frames:
   improvement of teaching and learning (generally supported by academics)
   and accountability for results (the concern of external stakeholders).
   Political science departments and the discipline can advocate for their
   interests more effectively by providing assessment data on student
   learning for internal purposes and on student postgraduate success for
   external stakeholders.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate who would vote `none of the above' (NOTA)
   if this were available on the ballot paper using original data from
   eight European countries. In particular, we examine whether NOTA would
   be used by abstainers and voters to protest within the electoral
   process. We also test whether socioeconomic factors and specific and
   diffuse support for democracy and its institutions correlate with a NOTA
   vote. We find that having NOTA on the ballot would reduce invalid
   balloting more than abstention and much more than protest party voting.
   Our results also suggest that NOTA is related to socioeconomic status,
   political interest, political knowledge and distrust in political
   institutions and authorities, but not to broadly undemocratic attitudes.
   These findings have important implications for our understanding of the
   increasingly large amounts of abstention and invalid voting, as well as
   the growing distrust of political institutions, in democratic countries.
   They also hold lessons for electoral reformers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of women in Hobbes's economic thought.
   First, I frame Hobbes's economic thought in relation to his
   philosophical materialism so as to underscore the extent to which
   Hobbes's materialism entails the insight that human beings are, by
   definition, productive, economic creatures. I argue that his description
   of the economy, even without explicit acknowledgment, necessarily
   positions women as crucial economic actors. I then consider the
   implications of this in relation to the feminist possibilities of
   Hobbes's gender politics. I conclude that when deliberating on this
   question, we face the same conundrum that is evident in all literature
   considering Hobbes and gender. His radical comments about women in the
   state of nature are undermined by his seeming indifference to the state
   of women in commonwealths once they are founded.},

Abstract = {This work contributes to the few case studies that have examined the
   challenges of implementing transitional justice in displacement contexts
   by using the specific case of the displacement trend in the Conventional
   Basin of Lake Chad to further underscore the dynamics of the problems
   involved in the issue. The work finds that lack of commitment to the
   implementation of regional policy frameworks and also the numerous
   weaknesses of the demobilization, deradicalization and reintegration
   (DDR) programmes implemented in the region have all had specific
   hindrances, especially in the social and political (re)integration of
   displaced persons in the region. The work therefore calls for more
   regional efforts that take into account clearer screening methods,
   accountability measures, as well as the (re)integration of displaced
   persons in the study area into the wider systems of their various home
   countries.},

Abstract = {Regionalization, in the form of a dispersion of political power away
   from national political centers to regional governments, has been a
   defining feature of European politics since the 1970s. The article
   focuses on how institutional regionalization changed citizens' attitudes
   about the division of competences between the central and regional
   level. It argues that regional institutions and policies exert a
   socializing effect on citizens' preference in favor of these
   institutions through a mechanism of adaptive preferences. First,
   attitudes are studied across cohorts in a single population to test
   whether cohorts that came of age in a context of more institutional
   regionalization are more favorable towards regional decision-making than
   cohorts that came of age in a centralized state. The analyses indeed
   show evidence for a socializing effect of institutional regionalization.
   Second, the article shows how regional elites' discourses may moderate
   the relationship between institutional regionalization and citizens'
   attitudes about regionalization. We study Belgium as a crucial case. We
   use five cross-sectional datasets of the Flemish and Walloon populations
   during the course of increased regionalization in Belgium (1991-2007).},

Abstract = {This article identifies key elements of a potential new strategic
   framework to manage the security relationship between Turkey and the
   United States. Despite both being NATO members, their relationship is
   increasingly transactional, with shared interests on some issues,
   potential for convergence on others, and substantial disagreement on
   quite a few. Four problems breed their widening strategic divergence: an
   obsolete framework for governing the relationship, a trust deficit,
   weakened institutional ownership, and weakened popular support. The main
   challenge facing Turkey and the United States is to find a new modus
   operandi between the old strategic partnership framework and pure
   transactionalism. To this end, this article proposes ``structured
   transactionalism{''} as a flexible yet institutionalized form of
   bilateral engagement to supplement the NATO core of the US-Turkish
   security relationship.},

Abstract = {This paper problematizes injustices in care responsibilities between
   heterosexual partners as relational irresponsibilities. Firstly, the
   relevance of care theories for understanding power asymmetries related
   to an imbalance in care work is analyzed. Secondly, the paper analyzes
   concrete illustrations of the manifestations of this care imbalance in
   the intimate arrangements established by couples. These unjust
   consequences are conceptualized as ``relational irresponsibilities{''}.
   Finally, the concept of ``relational co-responsibility{''} is proposed,
   as one intellectual tool to work towards more justice and democracy
   between individuals, in both the private and public spheres.},

Abstract = {Although it is likely that in most jurisdictions AI will be increasingly
   used to support judges when making decisions, it is also probable that
   there will be moves over the next decade to entirely replace judges in
   some areas with forms of AI. This shift towards Judge AI, and to some
   extent even shifts towards supportive Judge AI, raise issues that impact
   democratic values, structures and may reshape any notion of judicial
   independence. This is partly because the systems that are used may be
   designed to support an interpretation of the law that will not permit a
   nuanced and contextual approach. Instead, the systems may reflect
   political or other agendas with little or no independent oversight.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of procedural rule change on the
   dynamics of parliamentary speeches in the Canadian House of Commons
   between 1901 and 2015. During this period, several new rules were
   introduced to reduce the opportunities for private members to speak
   during the debates so that the government could get its business done
   within an acceptable amount of time. Our analysis looks at the impact of
   these rule changes on the content and orientation of all individual
   speeches made by members of Parliament. The results indicate that
   parliamentary rules had an important effect on the topic and duration of
   debates. Our findings also confirm that procedural changes contributed
   to a heightening of partisan polarization in the Canadian Parliament
   over time and disproportionately reduced the influence of government
   backbenchers in the legislative process.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the significance of Napoleon for contemporary
   history and public affairs by reflecting on the career of Melvin Richter
   (1921-2020) and his forthcoming Tocqueville and the Two Napoleons.
   Richter maintains that Tocqueville's ever-deepening analysis of the
   Napoleonic model, a new and sinister form of the administrative state,
   achieved dystopian dimensions in his thought and serves as an important
   thread by which we can re-assess Tocqueville's entire oeuvre and
   political career. The article argues that Tocqueville's historical
   method, which takes center stage in Richter's reconstruction of the way
   in which Tocqueville submits Napoleon to the discipline of history,
   continues to inspire, even as contemporary concerns shift away from the
   dangers of the administrative state. It also speculates that the
   mythical Napoleon who transcended time, a figure inevitably neglected in
   ``Tocquevillian{''} histories but made compelling by a generation of
   romantic writers, is newly relevant in a world of mysterious affective
   attachments to populist leaders and the waves of expressive violence in
   which such attachments are enmeshed.},

Abstract = {This article explores the terrain of social conflict as it developed
   across advanced capitalist democracies throughout the `age of austerity'
   that followed the global economic crisis. It shows how a (broadly
   defined) working class mobilised in different ways in different
   capitalist contexts, contesting the institutional forms (and the crises
   that emerged from them) which constitute each particular model of
   capitalism. Considered this way, we are able to conceptualise and
   explain the forms of working-class mobilisation that have emerged in
   opposition to contemporary neoliberalism. In doing so, we go beyond a
   narrow focus on workplace-focused or trade-union-led forms of
   working-class mobilisation, highlighting the continuing contestation of
   neoliberal capitalism. Drawing on a protest event analysis of 1,1 67
   protest events in five countries (Spain, Germany, Japan, the United
   States and the United Kingdom), and developing a Regulation Theory
   approach to the study of protest/social movements, we provide an
   overview of the most visible patterns of social contestation in each
   national neoliberal capitalist context, tracing links to the
   institutional configurations that constitute those national models of
   capitalism. While there exists no direct (linear) process of causality
   between the model of neoliberal capitalism and the forms of mobilised
   dissent witnessed, nevertheless we are able to clearly trace the
   different pressures of capital accumulation that have given rise to the
   protest/social movements identified in each case, thereby allowing us to
   gain a better insight into both each particular model of capitalism and
   the forms of dissent that constitute it.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the themed section `Beyond Binaries of Nationalism'
   critically reviews the use of binaries in nationalism studies. It
   identifies a lack of precision in the use of ideal types as a key
   failing, and points to new conceptions and types. The contributions to
   the section question the reification of binaries, most especially
   western/eastern and civic/ethnic and their attendant biases, and instead
   emphasize a certain ideological fluidity in the character of
   nationalism.},

Abstract = {Why was Jordan able to survive the Arab Spring revolutions and the
   COVID-19 pandemic despite lacking financial capabilities compared to
   other monarchies? Based on the political system and a comparative case
   study approach, this article argues that during the Arab Spring, the
   absence of internal pressure for change and the presence of internal and
   external support led Jordan's state practice to change into a balanced
   approach of both authoritarianism and revolution to sustain stability.
   However, in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, Jordan faced a more
   imminent economic and health threat, coupled with a change in the
   positions of its external allies. The findings confirm that, in both
   cases, Jordan faced critical internal and external threats. During the
   Arab Spring, international assistance supported Jordan. However, during
   COVID-19, a global pandemic and changing international positions, Jordan
   did not receive international assistance. Consequently, the Jordanian
   monarchy had to control the political system through authoritarian
   policies. Therefore, in a changing environment with shifting
   international positions, the more the threat is imminent to Jordan's
   stability, the more Jordan's internal inherited elements sustain its
   stability.},

Abstract = {This article aims to examine regional parliaments of two prominent
   regional organisations in South America (Southern Common Market) and
   Western Africa (Economic Community of West African States), by focusing
   on their performance in the agenda of democracy protection. We
   comparatively assess the performance of regional parliamentary agents in
   contributing to the mediation and conflict resolution in cases of
   democratic breakdown as well as the conditions and factors that affect
   parliamentary performance. We argue that regional parliaments have
   exerted relevant agency in democratic crises, despite their low
   decision-making competencies and the strong intergovernmental features
   of Global South regional organisations.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new collection of data that consolidates information on
   European Parliament elections into one comprehensive source. It provides
   information on formal electoral rules as well as national-level and
   district-level election results for parties and individual politicians
   (including full candidate lists). The use of existing and new key
   variables makes it easy to link the data across the different units of
   observation (country, party, candidate, member of parliament) and join
   them with external information. Currently, the data cover four elections
   (1999-2014). Among other aspects, the collection should facilitate
   research on the European Parliament's allegedly weak electoral
   connection. In this article, we outline the main features of the
   datasets, describe patterns of intra-party competition and preference
   voting and conduct exploratory analyses of individual-level changes in
   list positions.},

Abstract = {The construction of new transmission grids for electricity is central
   for the German Energiewende. However, we know little about partisan
   differences in this policy field. Particularly the local level is
   under-researched. This article develops two hypotheses: According to the
   first, local parties have the same preferences as their federal state
   parties. According to the second, local parties diverge from the
   positions of their ``higher{''} party organizations, based on their
   economic situation. An analysis of twelve districts in Lower Saxony
   supports hypothesis 2. Parties in districts that profit from exporting
   electricity emphasize the benefits of electricity grids. Conversely,
   parties in mere transit districts emphasize the downsides of electricity
   grid construction. The article thus shows that partisan differences in
   environmental policy are context-dependent. On the local level-that may
   be important for the actual implementation of policies-party preferences
   may systematically diverge from of higher-level party preferences.},

Abstract = {Big technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon amass global
   power through classification algorithms. These algorithms use
   unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning on massive databases
   to detect objects, such as faces, and to process texts, such as speech,
   to model predictions for commercial and political purposes. Such
   governance by algorithms-or ``algorithmic governance{''}-has received
   critical scrutiny from a vast interdisciplinary scholarship that points
   to algorithmic harms related to mass surveillance, information
   pollution, behavioral herding, bias, and discrimination. Big Tech's
   algorithmic governance implicates core IR research in two ways: (1) it
   creates new private authorities as corporations control critical
   bottlenecks of knowledge, connection, and desire; and (2) it mediates
   the scope of state-corporate relations as states become dependent on Big
   Tech, Big Tech circumvents state overreach, and states curtail Big Tech.
   As such, IR scholars should become more involved in the global research
   on algorithmic governance.},

Title = {Can the EU be a federal democracy? Assessing the horizontal and vertical
   dimension of the EU government from comparative perspective},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {The European Union remains an ambivalent polity. This uncertainty
   complicates the assessment of its democratic and federal quality.
   Drawing on comparative federalism research can contribute not only to
   making sense of whether, or rather which kind of federalism the EU has
   developed. It can also enable addressing such a compounded, but
   necessary inquiry into the federal and democratic character of the EU
   and how to ascertain which type of democratic government for which type
   of federal union may be appropriate. The article first elaborates a
   framework to assess the dimensions of federal and democratic government,
   drawing on comparative federalism research to delineate basic types of
   federal democracy. Here the democratic dimension of government is taken
   as referring primarily to the horizontal division of powers (among
   `branches') of government, the federal dimension to the vertical
   division of powers (among `levels') of governments. The framework is
   applied to the government of the EU in order to gauge its own type(s) of
   division of power arrangements and the interlinkage between them.
   Finally, the discussion reflects on whether or rather how the EU could
   comprise a federal democracy, especially in light of recent crisis
   challenges and subsequent institutional developments in EU governance.},

Abstract = {Moving from primary opponents to presidential ticket partners requires
   negotiation and strategy. Yet no work has systematically tracked the
   evolution of how two separate campaigns rhetorically become one. Rooted
   in partisan appeals, descriptive and policy representation, and ticket
   balancing research, this study employs two computer-assisted content
   analytic methods to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's tweets during the 2020
   U.S. presidential primary and general election. Shifting between
   campaign phases, Harris did not rhetorically engage in ticket balancing
   or emphasize her qualifications, favoring other techniques instead to
   support Biden. Biden's messaging remained largely consistent yet showed
   some accommodations to emerging contexts.},

Abstract = {In this study, I investigate how information made available by the
   introduction of television affected the importance of the national
   economy in the context of US presidential elections from 1944 to 1964.
   Using the fact that television stations were introduced in counties
   across the United States at different points in time, I assess the
   effect of television on economic voting using a
   difference-in-differences design. I first show that television stations
   spent more time covering national politicians than did local newspapers
   in the 1960 presidential election. More national news increased the
   salience of the national economy in presidential elections. There was no
   evidence that television affected prospective pocketbook voting.},

Abstract = {A wealth of literature exists on the relationship between a country's
   domestic politics and its counterterrorism policies, yet few examine
   this relationship in the US. Past studies examining counterterrorism
   spending in the US find that domestic politics have little impact and
   that funding is distributed to the states largely as a function of its
   risk from a terrorist attack. Yet these studies suffer a number of
   shortcomings, including limited data on counterterrorist funding and a
   superficial conceptualisation of the variables that measure domestic
   politics. Using data on US outlays from the Department of Homeland
   Security Grants Program from 2003 to 2018, this study seeks to
   illuminate the process of counterterrorist spending in the US by
   reconciling three separate sets of predictors in the literature.
   Specifically, is counterterrorist spending distributed according to
   legislative politics (pork), genuine, rationally calculated population
   vulnerability (risk), or public fear in the wake of particularly
   notorious terrorist attacks (reaction)? The results support and expand
   the existing literature in that risk remains an influential variable,
   though grant distribution is still affected by political incentives.
   Finally, states do tend to see an influx of funds in reaction to
   terrorist attacks, though the source of the group plays no role.},

Abstract = {Funding is critical to the attainment of Aspiration 1 of the African
   Union (AU) Agenda 2063, which aims to promote inclusive growth and
   sustainable development. However, the funds required to meet these
   targets are not readily available in Africa. In Nigeria, constitutional
   provisions for revenue mobilization and public expenditure place
   restrictions on the foreign economic relations capabilities of
   non-central governments (NCGs) as well as undermine their capacity to
   raise the revenue required to meet development objectives. Against this
   background, this article reviews the strategies utilized by NCGs to
   overcome their fiscal powers-constitutional responsibilities mismatch
   and argues that in the context of the development imperatives subsumed
   in Aspiration 1, the strategies are counterproductive.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Number = {2},
Pages = {385-402},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Conventional wisdom treats politicization in the international human
   rights regime as invariant: for any given violation, states condemn
   adversaries while coddling friends. However, we find that politicization
   patterns vary markedly across human rights issues. Some norms are more
   politicized than others, and states are more likely to punish
   geopolitical partners on certain violations. We offer a novel theory of
   politicized enforcement wherein states punish human rights violations
   discriminatively based on their perceived ``sensitivity{''} for the
   target state. Using data from the UN Universal Periodic Review, an
   elaborate human rights mechanism, we show that states tend to criticize
   their adversaries on sensitive issues that undermine the target regime's
   power and legitimacy while addressing safer topics with friends. By
   uncovering a strategic logic of human rights enforcement, this research
   contributes new theoretical insights on the relationship between norms
   and power politics in global governance.},

Abstract = {To minimize damage to their popularity during economic downturns, rulers
   in electoral autocracies can draw on their propaganda advantage to keep
   the economy off the political agenda or shift the blame to other actors.
   How successful are these strategies in swaying citizens' views? While
   electoral autocrats frequently resort to these strategies, there is
   surprisingly little evidence about their effectiveness. To address this
   gap, I took advantage of the recent economic crisis in Turkey and
   deployed a population-based survey experiment that mimicked incumbent's
   use of these strategies. I find that incumbent's efforts of shifting the
   blame fail to elicit intended effects among large parts of the
   electorate. In contrast, changing the political agenda away from the
   economy to an issue area that is more favorable for the incumbent is
   more effective for shoring up popular support. These findings contribute
   to our understanding of the mechanisms that help sustain electoral
   authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This quantitative study queried perceptions of the gender corrective
   mechanism as part of a broader parliamentary gender balance reform
   programme in Southern European, EU island state Malta. A representative
   sample (n = 435) of the Maltese electorate showed support for increased
   representation of women (88.5\%) and the integration of the gender
   corrective mechanism (66.5\%); but manifested a preference for other
   measures, namely childcare facilities, full-time backbenchers and more
   females in the electoral commission. Consequently, should the preferred
   measures not be sufficiently addressed, the reform risks falling short
   of sustainable development. The study adds to literature about how the
   electorate engages with more representative parliaments when this is
   targeted using constitutional amendments. Recommendations include
   financial support for parties to attract candidates from
   under-represented genders, and an effective public information campaign
   that explains the gender corrective mechanism as a safety-valve that
   compensates for any gaps in representation that the other reform pillars
   fail to achieve.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the complementarity between the concepts of
   `justice' and `trust', and points out the `logical' link between the two
   concepts, but observes that while the notions of justice implies trust,
   trust does not imply justice. The argument is that in the ideal
   situation where there is both trust and justice in a modern democratic
   state where cooperation is voluntary, there is a constant supply of
   justice that enhances the quality of governance. The substance of
   justice as fairness, is discussed with reference to Rawls concern with
   redistributive issues and this is illustrated by the long-standing land
   redistribution challenges in South Africa and other settler
   post-colonial states. This link with justice is established through
   order which originates from the trust that is generated through
   cooperation. The significance of justice for social order depends on the
   values it is associated with, and conversely, the significance of trust
   for social order depends on the degree of the presence of justice.
   Linking the two concepts: trust and justice, can thus enrich the
   analytical assessment of social order.},

Abstract = {While Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has reduced the cost of
   collecting original data, in 2018, researchers noted the potential
   existence of a large number of bad actors on the platform. To evaluate
   data quality on MTurk, we fielded three surveys between 2018 and 2020.
   While we find no evidence of a ``bot epidemic,{''} significant portions
   of the data-between 25 and 35 percent-are of dubious quality. While the
   number of IP addresses that completed the survey multiple times or
   circumvented location requirements fell almost 50 percent over time,
   suspicious IP addresses are more prevalent on MTurk than on other
   platforms. Furthermore, many respondents appear to respond humorously or
   insincerely, and this behavior increased over 200 percent from 2018 to
   2020. Importantly, these low-quality responses attenuate observed
   treatment effects by magnitudes ranging from approximately 10 to 30
   percent.},

Title = {Gendered patterns in candidates' campaign fundraising: The case of Italy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {43-58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The lack of financial resources is an often-cited hurdle for women
   pursuing political careers. However, empirical analysis of the dynamics
   of the private funding of women candidates and its potential
   implications for their political careers is still scant, particularly
   for countries outside the anglophone regions. This paper contributes to
   the scholarly debate by focusing on the gendered patterns in campaign
   fundraising in Italy, where radical changes to the party funding regime
   and multiple reforms to the electoral laws may have changed the
   structure of opportunity for fundraising by women candidates. We analyse
   patterns of private funding for men and women candidates in four
   national elections between 1996 and 2018. Our analysis, triangulated
   with semi-structured interviews with women candidates, shows that
   differences exist in fundraising patterns between male and female
   candidates in Italy. It reveals differences in the quality of
   candidates' fundraising networks and confirms that political affiliation
   (to right-wing parties) and incumbency have an effect on the amount of
   donations received, thus granting women candidates greater access to
   private donations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the conceptual approaches and exhibition designs
   used by Russian museums for exhibitions on the Soviet terror. Using
   empirical data from 145 museums researched over 16 years, the author
   develops a typology of common models of visualization. At the center of
   this typology is an innovative approach to the representation of the
   ``hero-victim-villain{''} triad, which is pivotal to exhibitions
   focusing on humanitarian disasters. The author argues that the way
   Russian museums use this triad is the main reason for the inadequacy of
   the majority of Russian museum exhibitions dedicated to the terror.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain Europeanization processes among advocacy
   organizations from four post-communist states-Poland, Hungary, Slovenia,
   and the Czech Republic-which have been subject to strong Europeanization
   pressures before and after the European Union accession. The authors aim
   to identify how Central and Eastern European organized interests have
   adapted their organizational logics to a changing environment in the
   post-enlargement phase. Specifically, we address the following
   questions: How do various levels and dimensions of Europeanization of
   interest organizations differ across policy fields and countries and
   what determines this diversity? What are the strongest predictors of the
   specific forms of Europeanization? Against this background, we test how
   the specific characteristics of CEE advocacy organizations correlate
   with the different dimensions of Europeanization-its intensity, ways of
   occurring, variants, determinants, and outcomes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {560-567},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Little existing work studies public perceptions of climate-induced
   migration. We redress this gap, drawing on diverse literatures in
   political science and social psychology. We argue that climate migrants
   occupy an intermediate position in the public view, garnering greater
   support than traditional economic migrants but less support than
   refugees. Evidence from a conjoint experiment embedded in nationally
   representative surveys of 2,160 respondents in the United States and
   Germany provide support for this claim. Importantly, this result holds
   for internal and international migrants. These findings suggest the
   importance of humanitarian considerations and empathy in shaping
   migration attitudes. We use a follow-up factorial experiment to explore
   potential policy implications of public support for climate migrants. We
   find no evidence that priming climate migration increases support for
   climate change mitigation, echoing existing work on the difficulty of
   mobilizing climate action and suggesting that climate migration is
   unlikely to spur greater support for mitigating climate change.},

Abstract = {By reviewing the parliamentary debate surrounding a bill reforming
   maternity leave and part-time work, we demonstrate that women members of
   the religious-conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey
   emphasized women's motherhood duties within the family and childcare
   rather than highlighting the shared responsibilities of parents.
   Particularly, they perceive women as the core unit of family. Women
   members of AKP follow the religious-conservative claims of the party and
   perpetuate women's traditional location in the society. In this sense,
   women's substantive representation in the AKP is inherently limited to
   the gendered claim-making leaving little room for the presence of
   diverse interests, particularly feminist claim-making demanding gender
   equality.},

Abstract = {This article contests the conventional view that the `Depressed Classes'
   lost out on representation by agreeing to joint electorates in the Poona
   Pact. It analyses the results of the elections to the provincial
   legislatures in British India that took place in 1936-1937 and 1945-1946
   under the Government of India Act, 1935, to concretely appraise the
   working of the Poona Pact. The article argues that reserved seats,
   primary elections and cumulative voting redeemed the ability of the
   Poona Pact to provide both descriptive and substantive representation
   for the `Depressed Classes'.},

   electoral performance: Evidence from an open-list PR system},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Considerable research argues that voters reward personal vote-seeking
   behaviors. The expected electoral gain would be the primary driver of
   MPs' action. Nevertheless, empirical evidence is scarce, and the
   findings do not always match the theoretical expectations. This article
   examines the electoral impact of personal vote-seeking behaviors,
   arguing in favor of integrating party electoral performance into the
   models. I also propose a new measure of electoral performance based on
   the evolution of MPs electoral results. Drawing on data from Finland,
   the findings globally support the theoretical arguments. MPs benefit
   from personal vote-seeking behaviors, primarily when their party
   improves its results. The findings have important implications for our
   knowledge of the personal vote and, more generally, the personalization
   of politics.},

Abstract = {It seems to have become an unquestioned standard in genocide research to
   abbreviate a very limited number of mainly social psychological studies
   to help explain that individuals commit violent acts in the context of
   collective violence. This exemplary review of adaptations of Solomon E.
   Asch's studies on independence and conformity hopes to reveal some
   fundamental problems of supposedly transdisciplinary genocide research
   and beyond: (1) Asch's originally very elaborate arguments are seriously
   abbreviated; (2) especially the scope of Asch's experimental research is
   not sufficiently contextualized as (3) are his psychological findings, a
   problem that (4) can be associated with a lack of references to the
   discussions in the disciplines consulted. These observations do not
   merely apply to the case under discussion but hint at fundamental
   problems of inter- or transdisciplinary research on violence.},

Abstract = {Do political parties electorally benefit from presenting ambiguous
   policy positions? We suggest that the electoral effect of position
   ambiguity on an issue depends on the salience of the issue to voters. We
   use data on political parties' party position, position ambiguity, and
   issue emphasis as well as survey data on voters' issue salience. We find
   that ambiguous party positions on an issue weaken the electoral support
   of people who put salience on the issue. However, position ambiguity
   does not alter the electoral support of people who do not consider the
   issue salient. Our results imply that the electoral effect of position
   blurring in Western Europe should be understood in the context of party
   competition in multi-dimensional issue space. They also imply that
   political parties may face a dilemma between policy flexibility and
   electoral loss by presenting ambiguous party positions.},

Abstract = {Everyone has multiple intersecting identities and belongs to several
   groups. In cases of genocide, how do courts deal with intersecting
   identities? Are they relevant for the identification of the victims?
   This paper argues that social identity theory may assist in the legal
   interpretation of the `religious group' of the law of genocide where
   individuals are targeted for their - perceived or real - membership of a
   competing religious group.
   According to the theory, personal (religious) identity is based on
   membership in significant social categories that lead to `us versus
   them' dichotomies, favouring the in-group over the out-group. Identity
   competition plays a central role in the inception and escalation of
   intergroup conflicts, including those that occur along religious fault
   lines. Genocide is a type of intergroup conflict but is not usually
   framed as such by international criminal lawyers.
   This paper discusses social identity theory, intergroup conflict,
   religion, and the case law on genocide. In exploring the relevance of
   social identity theory for the law of genocide, it argues that the
   current jurisprudential approach of blending group membership criteria,
   based on the `four corners' approach, is flawed. The cases of Rwanda,
   the Former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, India, and Myanmar exemplify the
   relevance of the theory.},

Abstract = {We ascertain whether citizens want to have smart ballots, that is,
   whether they appreciate having the possibility to express some support
   for more than one option (expression across options) and to indicate
   different levels of support for these options (expression within
   options). We conducted two independent yet complementary survey
   experiments at the time of the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries to
   examine which voting method citizens prefer, one with the real
   candidates in the states holding Democratic primaries and one with
   fictitious candidates in the whole country. In both surveys, respondents
   were asked to vote using four different voting rules: single, approval,
   rank, and point (score). After they cast their vote, respondents were
   asked how satisfied they were using each voting method. The findings are
   consistent in both studies: the single vote is the most preferred voting
   method. We show that this is a reflection of a status quo bias, as
   citizens' views are strongly correlated with age.},

Abstract = {The Arab world has historically had limited descriptive representation

   officeholders lead women citizens to become more engaged? Or could it
   depress engagement due to pervasive gender biases? To answer these
   questions, this paper uses a nationally-representative experiment in
   Tunisia. Unexpectedly, people were less likely to want to contact their
   representatives when primed to think of a mixed-gender group of
   officeholders compared to an all-women group. This pattern did not vary
   according to respondents' gender. Further analyses reveal that the
   effect was concentrated among Islamists, which is consistent with some
   Islamists' support for gender segregation. This finding encourages
   research examining women's political presence in conservative
   environments where gender segregation is common.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that political elites harbor more
   ideologically constrained issue attitudes and are more polarized on such
   issues than their mass counterparts. In contrast, the mass public is
   more polarized in its emotional reactions to political stimuli. How
   affective polarization among the mass public compares to affective
   polarization among elites is, however, an open question. Using items
   common to the Convention Delegate Studies and American National Election
   Studies, I compare the mass public to political elites when it comes to
   both affective and ideological polarization. I find that elites are more
   affectively polarized than the mass public and more affectively
   polarized than they are ideologically polarized, although mass affective
   polarization has increased over time. These findings provide context for
   understanding the extent to which the mass public has affectively
   polarized and demonstrate that elites, despite ideological capabilities,
   exhibit extreme emotional reactions toward political groups just like
   their mass counterparts.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest achievements of the EU is the freedom of movement
   between member states offering citizens equal rights in EU member
   states. EU enlargement and the COVID-19 pandemic allow for a critical
   test of whether EU citizens are indeed treated equally in practice. We
   test preferential treatment of EU citizens in two hypothetical choice
   experiments in Germany at two different time points: in the period
   before and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Theories of responses
   to threat suggest that the COVID-19 crisis should increase
   discrimination against mobile EU citizens. While our findings reveal
   sizeable discrimination based on nationality and language proficiency of
   mobile EU citizens, the findings also suggest that, contrary to
   expectations, discrimination did not increase in the initial COVID-19
   crisis period.},

Abstract = {In August 2019, the UK government's attempt to prorogue parliament for
   five weeks raised the question whether the UK's prorogation rules ought
   to be reformed. We place this discussion in comparative perspective by
   contrasting the UK's prorogation rules with (i) equivalent procedures in
   26 European democracies and (ii) recent changes in other areas of UK
   executive-legislative relations. These comparisons suggest that the UK's
   current prorogation rules are increasingly anomalous. They give
   governments significantly more power to suspend parliament than
   comparable European democracies, and are at variance with recent efforts
   to counterbalance the executive's wide ranging discretion in the UK.},

Abstract = {This article aims to assess the motivations, modifications and impacts
   of China's public goods approach by studying its energy financing in
   Southeast Asia. It argues that China's public goods approach of energy
   financing will help improve financing performance through sustainable
   development and multilateral cooperation. However, the approach is
   constrained by the lack of trust from the region, incompatible standards
   between China and other Western practices, and growing securitisation by
   the United States on Chinese economic activities.},

Volume = {83},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The US welfare state provides key benefits indirectly. The Affordable
   Care Act (ACA), for example, uses a package including exchanges,
   subsidies, and penalties to increase health insurance enrollment. Prior
   research indicates that indirect policies do not produce feedback
   effects on public opinion, but the ACA was unusually salient and
   complex. Can such indirect policies produce feedback effects, and are
   any such effects heterogeneous? Here, we use several data sets and
   inferential strategies to show that groups especially affected by the
   exchanges and the associated insurance mandate did shift their ACA
   attitudes, albeit in opposing directions and with more limited effects
   than descriptive analyses suggest. Those who experienced rising local
   prices became more opposed to the ACA, while those who stood to benefit
   from some changes to the individual markets became more favorable.
   Overall, positive changes in attitudes were offset by demographically
   concentrated, negative shifts among the uninsured.},

Abstract = {Sponsored international student mobility programs are important public
   diplomacy tools for governments. These programs' positive outcomes are
   usually taken for granted and are rarely assessed. International
   students' satisfaction with life in the host country is an important
   variable for their behavioral outcomes related to the host country. This
   study used data from two surveys of Global Korea Scholarship (GKS)
   recipients from 136 countries to examine the determinants of their
   satisfaction with life in Korea. We found that students' cognitive and
   affective evaluations of Korea, frequency of Korean-language social
   interactions, and perceptions of their treatment by Koreans because of
   their nationality or religion were significant determinants of GKS
   students' satisfaction with life in Korea. In terms of demographic
   characteristics, men, students from developing countries, and those
   majoring in natural sciences or engineering fields were more satisfied
   than their peers. We discuss the implications of these findings for
   public diplomacy. Related Articles in this Special Issue Ayhan, Kadir

Abstract = {When international conflict causes an authoritarian leader's popularity
   to soar, extant theories lead us to treat such ``rallying{''} as sincere
   preference change, the product of surging patriotism or cowed media.
   This study advances a theory of less-than-fully sincere rallying more
   appropriate for nondemocratic settings, characterizing it as at least
   partly reflecting cascading dissembling driven by social desirability
   concerns. The identification strategy combines a rare nationally
   representative rally-spanning panel survey with a list experiment and
   econometric analysis. This establishes that three quarters of those who
   rallied to Putin after Russia annexed Crimea were engaging in at least
   some form of dissembling and that this rallying developed as a rapid
   cascade, with social media joining television in fueling perceptions
   this was socially desirable.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in regional studies argue that geopolitical
   influence is one factor affecting the regional order. However, studies
   on geopolitical influence have yet to cover East Asia to explain East
   Asia's regional order. The quantitative approach to geopolitical
   influence studies still faces a methodological challenge because it uses
   an arbitrary weighting of geopolitical influence in developing an index.
   In order to address those challenges, this research deploys factor
   analysis as a non-arbitrary weighting system to measure the geopolitical
   influence of China, Japan, Russia, and the US in East Asia during the
   period from 2005 to 2018. Additionally, this research explores how the
   geopolitical influence of those countries affects East Asia's regional
   cooperation and integration. The research shows that: (1) China has been
   able to compete with the US for geopolitical influence in East Asia
   since 2014, and (2) Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and US geopolitical
   influence positively contributes to regional cooperation and integration
   in East Asia, with the US and China as the main contributors. The
   research highlights three possible causes to explain the results:
   China's regional infrastructure initiatives, rejuvenation of China's
   view on globalization, and the relative decline of US relations with the
   allies in the region.},

Abstract = {Can public consultations-gatherings organised to solicit constituent
   opinions-reduce the blame attributed to elected representatives whose
   decisions end up backfiring? Using two pre-registered survey experiments
   conducted on nationally representative samples of US respondents, we
   examine whether the effectiveness of consultations as a blame avoidance
   tool may be shaped by: (1) consultation characteristics, especially
   regarding whether or not representatives align their policies, either
   actively or passively, with constituent opinion; and (2) elected
   representative and constituent characteristics, especially regarding a
   representative's gender and constituents' gender attitudes. Results
   suggest that public consultations are indeed liable to decrease blame
   attribution, just so long as constituent opinion is not explicitly
   opposed to the representative's decision. Active alignment with
   constituent opinion, however, does not appear to be a requirement for
   decreased blame attribution-and effects related to gender and gender
   attitudes are also largely absent. These findings are important for
   scholars seeking to better understand blame attribution, clarifying how
   public consultations might help politicians to pre-empt blame by
   reducing clarity of responsibility.},

Abstract = {What are the origins of gubernatorial popularity? Past studies debate
   whether governors are substantively evaluated based on their performance
   in office, with some arguing that the origins of approval may be
   idiosyncratic to particular governors. These studies typically consider
   gubernatorial approval in a handful of states or patterns of approval in
   the aggregate. We improve on this research by drawing on a richer data
   source: the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We consider both
   individual-level and state-level explanations of gubernatorial
   popularity with a sample of over 300,000 respondents across the 50
   states from 2006 to 2018. We explore how party, policy outcomes, and
   government performance shape levels of gubernatorial approval. We show
   that people evaluate governors based on the ideological direction of
   policy outcomes in the states. When state policy outcomes align with
   their ideological preferences, people report higher levels of approval
   for the job performance of their governor. We also confirm the
   importance of party and state economic performance for gubernatorial
   approval.},

Abstract = {Small states have three strategic options when they are confronted by a
   rising power: balancing, bandwagoning, and hedging. With an increasingly
   powerful and assertive China as its neighbour, Taiwan, as a small state,
   is in such a conundrum. Employing survey data collected during the past
   two decades, this study examines how Taipei's cross-Strait policy has
   been closely associated with the public's preferences. Because Taiwan
   citizens reject a unification under Beijing's terms, the bandwagoning
   policy has never been considered as an acceptable strategy. A `pure'
   balancing policy is also unpalatable due to the enormous costs and
   associated risks. Instead, the island citizens are generally supportive
   of setting aside the sovereignty dispute with a rapprochement approach
   towards China. Hedging has thus become a preferred strategic option for
   most Taiwan citizens. The public's support for a hedging policy has
   shifted recently due to China's aggressive conduct and America's
   supportive policy towards Taiwan. Because Beijing's assertive behaviour
   is expected to persist and the Biden administration will remain
   supportive of Taiwan, Taipei's strategic choice is likely to have a
   stronger balancing component. The cold and tense cross-Strait
   relationship since 2016 is expected to continue beyond the tenure of
   Taiwan's pro-independence incumbent government.},

Title = {Do indicators influence treaty ratification? The relationship between
   mid-range performance and policy change},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {623-641},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Treaties are a valuable tool for policymakers because they are both
   legally binding on, and symbolically powerful signals of, commitments of
   states that ratify. Why states choose to ratify treaties is unclear,
   although social pressures appear to play some role. This article argues
   that global performance indicators can influence the ratification
   process, but that the effect varies depending on where states fall on
   these measures. In the mid-range of a scale, fast ratification has
   significant benefits and relatively few costs. However, indicators have
   less of a catalysing effect at the extreme ends of the scale, where the
   costs are higher and the benefits are lower. This article uses policy
   performance indicators as independent variables in duration analyses of
   the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption
   (2003) and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in
   Persons Especially Women and Children (2000). It finds states in the
   mid-range of the indicator are faster to ratify than states that are not
   ranked, whereas the other categories are statistically insignificant.
   These findings imply that indicators matter for those in the middle, but
   not as much for those at the extremes. This finding enriches our
   understanding of treaty ratification and has potential implications for
   performance metrics as a tool to promote policy change for those states
   in the middle, highlighting the strengths and limitations of indicators
   as a force for change.},

Abstract = {Does the demand for more direct democracy by populist parties have any
   implications for their internal decision-making? To answer this
   question, a novel large-scale research project analyses the 2017
   candidate selection of all Bundestag parties, including the populist
   Alternative for Germany. Some 1,334 individual nominations of seven
   parties are compared using quantitative indicators along three
   dimensions of intra-party democracy (IPD): competition between aspirants
   for candidacy, inclusion of members and nomination-related
   communication. It shows that the AfD is living up to its promise of
   practising grassroots democracy: in all results it ranks at the top by a
   wide margin. A new populist organizational model seems to have emerged
   following neither the classic hierarchical and leader-oriented mode of
   many other European right-wing populist parties nor the delegate
   assembly mode typical of German parties. Our further development of IPD
   concepts, newly elaborated measuring methods and surprising empirical
   evidence improve the understanding of democratic decision-making in
   populist parties.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the association between transnationalism,
   that is, interactions and cultural competences that cut across European
   Union (EU) member states, and supranational political engagement.
   Generally, it is thought that EU citizens' participation in EU politics
   is hampered by the perception that the EU is too distant and too
   technocratic. Against this backdrop, we propose that transnationalism
   contributes to reducing this perception, as transnational individuals
   feel part of a supranational community and are thus more likely to get
   involved in EU politics than if their cross-border experience is absent
   or poor. Generalised structural equation models with a latent variable
   of EU-level political involvement (based on cognitive mobilisation,
   efficacy, and self-reported voting in European Parliament elections)
   return significant associations with transnational experiences and
   practices.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between legislative constituency
   size and opinions about the US state government. I show that over the
   course of US history, the states have disconnected the size of their
   legislatures from population change, resulting in a growing constituency
   size in nearly every state. I argue that because district size
   structures the nature of constituent-legislator interaction and levels
   of district heterogeneity, size influences the effectiveness of
   legislator efforts to build trust and support, resulting in more
   negative evaluations of representative government. Using a unique data
   set of nine Pew Research Center public opinion polls on favorable
   opinions of US state governments from 1997 to 2012, I find that
   constituency size is indeed associated with more negative evaluations.
   This relationship cannot be explained by other probable causes like
   legislative professionalism, partisanship, opinions about the federal
   government, or population size alone. Legislative institutions appear to
   moderate how residents experience and evaluate state government.},

Abstract = {Youth have long been involved in informal peacebuilding, and the United
   Nations' recent adoption of the Youth, Peace and Security (YPS) Agenda
   makes space for more formal involvement. These policy developments echo
   scholarship highlighting gender as crucial to understanding the roles
   and experiences of young people across a range of conflict-affected
   settings. This understanding is necessary to ensuring gender-equitable
   youth peacebuilding efforts. Yet much remains to be done in theory,
   policy, and practice to pursue these ends. This work will necessarily
   involve considering the diverse roles gender may play in young people's
   everyday experiences of peacebuilding across a range of settings. The
   majority of the world's young people reside in Asia and the Pacific.
   Yet, more research on YPS is needed in the region, particularly when it
   comes to accounting for gender. Reflecting on existing research, this
   article considers learnings to date and seeks to develop a future
   research agenda.},

Abstract = {The relationship between religious belief and political voting behaviour
   remains controversial and is influenced by political and cultural
   contexts. This study explores the influence of religious belief on the
   political voting behaviour of urban residents in China based on urban
   sample survey data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) 2010
   and finds that both religious identity and religious behaviour have a
   significant positive association with political voting behaviour.
   Compared with those without religious belief, the probability of urban
   residents with religious belief voting in urban residents' committee
   elections is significantly increased. Urban residents who participate in
   religious activities more frequently are more active in voting in
   residents' committee elections. Buddhist beliefs, Taoism, and folk
   beliefs have a positive association with urban residents' voting in
   these elections, indicating that local religious beliefs promote these
   residents' political voting behaviour. This study supports that the
   relationship between religious belief and political voting behaviour in
   China is consistent with the theoretical understanding in a broader
   context.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the main lines around which the securitization of
   COVID-19 has been interpreted and used in Latin America. Starting from
   an understanding of securitization that incorporates a dialogue between
   the local and the global to interpret the specific characteristics of
   the process, the investigation observes the varied ways in which
   different countries in the region have adapted global security
   discourses. The main global security dynamics around COVID-19, the
   particularities of its main local counterparts, and the extraordinary
   actions legitimized as a result of them are analysed. It is argued that
   the variations in the constructions of the ``pandemic threat{''} by
   regional actors, carried out in isolation and read through different
   interpretive frameworks, are both a consequence and an aggravating
   factor of political disagreements between national leaders. In this way,
   the article seeks to make a general balance that serves as the basis for
   continuing the debate on the many aspects in which the current pandemic
   has affected regional security.},

Title = {The Effects of Agricultural Income Shocks on Forced Migration: Evidence
   from Colombia},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The forced migration literature has acknowledged violence as the main
   driver of internal displacement in the context of armed conflicts.
   Nonetheless, scant attention has been devoted to the role of income, a
   factor identified by the standard economic literature as the key driver
   of voluntary migration. This study aims to fill in this gap by
   investigating the impact of agricultural income shocks on the number of
   internally displaced persons fleeing from violence, in the context of
   the Colombian armed conflict. To address the possible endogeneity
   between forced migration and income, we use the standardized deviation
   of rainfall from its historic mean as an instrumental variable for
   municipal agricultural income. Our main results suggest that the
   elasticity of forced migration with respect to agricultural income
   shocks is unitary. This finding highlights the fact that forced
   migration is the result of a complex decision-making process where
   violence interacts with individual characteristics and environmental
   factors. Therefore, public policies aimed at reducing forced migration
   from rural to urban areas should develop comprehensive strategies that
   not only improve security conditions at the place of origin but also
   enhance agricultural productivity and provide access to risk-coping
   mechanisms for farmers.},

Abstract = {The compatibility in terms of domestic systems that embed specific
   values of particular legal traditions is a critical determinant of
   international cooperation. We analyze international cooperation on
   professional qualifications because a domestic qualification system best
   showcases its distinct approach to social governance. Civil law states,
   which value written rules and certainty, use paper examinations as a
   core component of competency assessment of professionals, and upon
   international cooperation they opt to harmonize paper examinations.
   Common law states regard track record as important in assessing
   competence, and they often mutually allow professionals from partner
   states who have a good track record to practice in their territory.
   Cooperation between civil and common law states is possible when both
   parties make a conscious effort to align their domestic systems. In this
   case, an international mechanism has features of harmonization and
   mutual recognition. We also consider how to generalize the findings to
   explain states' attitude toward inter-governmental organizations in
   general.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the scholarship on marriage migration and
   citizenship by drawing attention to an under-studied group of single
   marriage migrant mothers who are widowed, divorced, or separated from
   their citizen-husbands. It examines the ways in which nation-states
   regulate the dissolution of cross-border marriages and allocation of
   citizenship rights to single marriage migrant mothers. Drawing on the
   experiences of 25 mainland Chinese single marriage migrant mothers, this
   article unravels the dynamic process of citizenship negotiation between
   top-down state hegemony and single marriage migrant mothers' bottom-up
   resistance to the exclusionary immigration system in Hong Kong by
   claiming maternal citizenship through state discretion. As the article
   illuminates how discretion has been used as a strategic mechanism by
   both the state and single marriage migrant mothers to negotiate the
   boundaries and substance of citizenship, it offers insights into how the
   family becomes a critical site where citizenship is experienced,
   negotiated, and contested.},

Title = {Reactionary radicalism and the analysis of worker subjectivity in Marx's
   critique of political economy},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-299},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This analysis starts off from the contemporary relevance of the theory
   of `the radicalism of tradition', arguing that it presents a challenge
   to Marxism because Marxist work has not sufficiently attended to
   elements of a theory of worker subjectivity scattered in the critique of
   political economy. This theory is located on a lower level of
   abstraction than is commonly assumed and can be applied to subjective
   dynamics in labour militancy. However, this requires that some basic
   categories in Marx's critique are reconsidered, especially those that do
   not seem immanent to the capitalist social formation, categories that
   appear, and have mostly been read, as the ahistorical ground on which
   properly social forms arise. Therefore, apparently ahistorical
   categories pertaining to use value and concrete labour's use value for
   capital are explored to reconstruct a theory relating capital's positing
   of labour to contemporary militancies that appropriate tradition. In
   contrast to the view of tradition as external to capital, the view
   advanced is that `reactionary radicalism' relates to how capital, as
   totalizing social form, abstracts tradition. Furthermore, tradition is
   radicalized through a negative subjectivity inherent to the
   commodification of labour power and the real subsumption of labour;
   proletarian experience is a precondition of radicalized tradition.},

   relatively little has been written about that work. This article draws
   upon an analysis of committee witnesses and interviews with MSPs and
   officials to provide further understanding of how witnesses are
   selected, describe some of their characteristics, and consider how they
   contribute to committee inquiries. It suggests that while the Parliament
   has made progress in seeking evidence from beyond the `usual suspects',
   there would be further benefits in diversifying further the voices from
   which committees hear.},

Abstract = {The use of survey experiments has surged in political science. The most
   common design is the between-subjects design in which the outcome is
   only measured posttreatment. This design relies heavily on recruiting a
   large number of subjects to precisely estimate treatment effects.
   Alternative designs that involve repeated measurements of the dependent
   variable promise greater precision, but they are rarely used out of
   fears that these designs will yield different results than a standard
   design (e.g., due to consistency pressures). Across six studies, we
   assess this conventional wisdom by testing experimental designs against
   each other. Contrary to common fears, repeated measures designs tend to
   yield the same results as more common designs while substantially
   increasing precision. These designs also offer new insights into
   treatment effect size and heterogeneity. We conclude by encouraging
   researchers to adopt repeated measures designs and providing guidelines
   for when and how to use them.},

Abstract = {In federations and other regionalised arrangements, the search for
   co-operation may lead to a hierarchical alignment where the centre
   concentrates policy decision-making power. The use of conditional grants
   to build this kind of co-ordination can disguise its rather coercive
   character when opt-out clauses are counteracted by fiscal constraints
   that virtually force subnational adherence. Previous accounts on
   recentralisation in Latin America have overlooked this feature,
   particularly by mistakenly identifying the transfer of fiscal resources
   and responsibilities with authority over policies. The article adopts a
   configurational approach, focused on mechanisms, to reassess two
   Brazilian programmes redesigned in the 1990s and 2000s - the Fundamental
   Education Fund (Fundef) and the Basic Health Care Programme (Programa de
   Atencao Basica, PAB). Our evidence shows that both reforms followed
   hierarchical paths and received massive adherence of municipalities. We
   discuss how this kind of coercion in disguise is especially concerning
   in settings where some retrenchment of social expenditure is expected.},

Abstract = {The article uses the ontological security framework and the concept of
   liminality to analyze Belarus liminal status vis-a-vis Russia and the
   role it has played in Russia's ontological security seeking before and
   after the 2020 Belarus Awakening. It argues that while the entire
   near-abroad, and, in particular, Ukraine have been important in terms of
   Russia's post-imperial ontological security seeking strategies, Belarus
   occupies a unique position with respect to Russia's securitized identity
   because of its perfectly marginal or liminal status. This has to do with
   the fact that, in the Russian geopolitical gaze, Belarus has remained
   almost unseparated from the Russian Self. Furthermore, the 2020 protests
   challenged this status but did not entirely eliminate it, leading to a
   restructuration of Belarus' liminality.},

Abstract = {Immigration has historically been of low salience in Central and Eastern
   Europe. Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism
   than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East's limited
   politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of
   emigration and the presence of ethnic minority `others'. I argue that
   this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by
   domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the
   immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European
   Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member
   states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly
   related to anti-immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for
   those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are
   polarizing across the GAL-TAN dimension and by education. Hence,
   immigration is bolstering a pre-existing, socially structured divide
   around both nationalist and traditionalist values.},

Abstract = {This study explored the respective importance of compositional
   (individual) and contextual (neighbourhood) factors associated with the
   propensity to engage in formal volunteering among a nationally
   representative sample of adults in Wales, UK. To date, while certain
   contextual characteristics of local communities have been found to be
   associated with the propensity to volunteer, compositional
   characteristics of residents tend to be stronger predictors. Few studies
   to date have specifically explored associations with local volunteering
   opportunities. To address such gaps, this study examined the extent to
   which such opportunities and broader neighbourhood factors such as
   urban/rural status and deprivation impacted upon propensities to
   volunteer, adjusting for important compositional predictors of
   voluntarism. In summary, while volunteering was marginally associated
   with a measure of local voluntary opportunities, hinting that the odds
   of formal volunteering are greater among those living in areas with more
   local voluntary organizations, this association was not retained
   following adjustment for other factors. This suggests that much of the
   area-level variance is explained by spatial variations in compositional
   factors. Further research is needed to examine determinants of
   volunteering behaviour at a range of spatial scales by drawing on wider
   measures of volunteering opportunities, before the factors at play can
   be fully understood.},

Abstract = {Research into the possible consequences of lowering the voting age to 16
   used to be rather speculative in nature, as there were few countries
   that had implemented earlier enfranchisement. This has changed over the
   past decade. We now have a range of countries in different locations,
   mostly in Europe and South America, where 16- and 17-year-olds can vote
   in some or all elections. In many of those places empirical research has
   given us insights into the experiences of young people and the impact of
   those changes on political discussions. However, so far these studies
   have largely been conducted individually in each country, which makes
   comparisons difficult. This article summarises the key insights from
   empirical research across countries with lower voting ages. It
   identifies common patterns, but also highlights differences. Overall,
   the impact appears to not be negative and often positive in terms of
   political engagement and civic attitudes. However, the comprehensiveness
   of effects varies. The article offers some possible frameworks to
   understand differences, in particular by reflecting on the processes
   that led to voting franchise changes, but also indicates where gaps in
   knowledge remain, and what sort of research would be required to produce
   systematically comparable results.},

Abstract = {States have adopted a range of policies to address the COVID-19
   pandemic. Some, mainly democracies like New Zealand and South Korea,
   took quick health measures without curbing citizen rights. Others,
   especially those led by populists like Bolsonaro and Erdogan, denied the
   seriousness of the health crisis even as they curbed political and civil
   rights. El Salvador is virtually unique in its COVID-19 response,
   combining a strong rhetorical commitment to health measures with clear
   efforts to undermine democratic controls and rights. President Nayib
   Bukele adopted an early travel ban and publicly vilified those who broke
   curfew by sending them and all who tested positive to quarantine centers
   for 30 days. He derided and defied Constitutional Chamber decisions
   against such practices, ordered militarized actions, and crowded
   gang-affiliated prisoners together in humiliating ways that risked
   exposure to COVID-19. We examine how Bukele's policies conform to, and
   seemingly exemplify, Michel Foucault's theoretical concepts of
   biopolitics and disciplinary power. However, the Salvadoran case also
   challenges key features of Foucault's theory, suggesting the need to
   modify his Western assumptions about highly institutionalized states.
   Our analysis suggests that strong leaders can undercut citizen rights
   and agency, visible at the intersection of biopolitical social theory
   and democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {Interest in electoral integrity and the validity and accuracy of
   election results has come to the fore as a topic of concern both among
   politicians and academic researchers in the last twenty years. The
   literature has identified a number of key variables and processes
   associated with electoral fraud, and lower levels of integrity. However,
   one deficiency with this research is that it has relied on the
   perceptions of fraud and malpractice, rather than first-hand data on the
   extent of such behaviour. In this paper we report on the results of a
   novel small-scale survey of people in Britain in which respondents
   reported some of their direct experiences of electoral fraud in recent
   national elections. The results indicate that the rates of electoral
   fraud are currently around six to eight per cent, but that this rises
   for members of some ethnic minority groups. We end by raising another
   question: if we can identify victims of electoral fraud, how are we to
   redress this victimisation?},

   This article builds a novel theoretical framework on the role that
   democratic dissatisfaction and political knowledge play in shaping
   voters' acceptance of different types of electoral offers. We test the
   implications of the theory with a survey experiment conducted after the
   2019 local elections in Bulgaria. Our results show that low-knowledge
   voters and those who are dissatisfied with the performance of democracy
   and democratic institutions are more likely to accept clientelistic
   offers from politicians. The findings contribute to the literature on
   electoral clientelism and political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The original Fred Friendly Seminar was a Socratic dialog intended for
   expert debate on issues of ethics and public policy. I wanted to apply
   the format to inter-faculty learning on issues of international
   relations and foreign policy, so I proposed a type of hybrid scenario,
   combining the detail and self-reflection of a traditional seminar with
   the forward motion and iterative learning potential of a war game. I
   recruited my fellow faculty members at five International Studies
   Association (ISA) Annual Conferences and ran faculty participation
   scenarios on topics from water security to pandemics and public health
   to global warming and energy in the Arctic. This unique type of
   roundtable allowed faculty to familiarize themselves with the unique
   format and experience the scenario from the inside, as their students
   do. In this article, I will outline how and why Fred Friendly
   constructed the seminars, discuss how I modified them into the
   seminar/war game hybrid used for ISA, and discuss the lessons my fellow
   faculty and I learned from participating in the seminars.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {3},
Pages = {807-820},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Health crises can reveal the inability of governments to induce
   compliance with policy interventions. While lack of compliance is
   conventionally attributed to individual mistrust in government,
   resistance to such interventions is often found clustered among entire
   communities, particularly in ethnically divided societies. We account
   for such patterns by explaining how citizens adjust their responses to
   state authority according to their shared ethnicity with those in power.
   We assess the effect of ethnicity on citizen compliance with a public
   health advisory on HIV/AIDS issued by different authority types through
   a survey-based field experiment in the West African country of Guinea.
   Members of a politically marginalized ethnic group, the Peul, are
   significantly less likely to comply with a public health advisory from a
   national government representative, the president, when compared to
   local or religious leaders. We show that perceived ethnic discrimination
   conditions both trust in and compliance with different authority types.},

   citizenship? This article seeks to answer this broad question, studying
   citizenship through the representations it arises in citizens
   themselves. Using data from an exploratory and non-representative
   survey, I compare the representations of a group of French and Colombian
   citizens of citzenship, through word association and an exercise in
   textual statistics. The results highlight citizenship's consensus zone,
   while describing the particularities found among the respondents in
   relation to their declared nationality.},

Abstract = {Recent research in American politics demonstrates that despite
   gender-based partisan sorting, gender gaps in policy preferences persist
   within political parties-particularly among Republicans. Republican
   women report significantly more moderate views than their male
   counterparts across a range of policy areas. These gaps are largely
   attributable to gender differences in beliefs about the appropriate
   scope of government and attitudes toward gender-based inequality.
   Arguably, gender has become a more salient feature of American elections
   in recent years, and this heightened salience raises questions about
   whether these within-party gender gaps are stable over time or vary
   across campaign contexts. We use survey data from the 2012 and 2016
   American National Election Study to evaluate whether gender gaps in
   policy preferences are stable across elections or if the 2016 election
   context affected the magnitude of gender differences in policy
   preferences. We find that gender gaps in policy preferences within
   political parties are fairly stable across the two electoral periods.},

Abstract = {Civil wars affect the economic conditions of households by disrupting
   economic transactions and harming their psychological well-being. To
   restore basic conditions for local economic recovery in conflict-torn
   regions, the international community has only a limited number of tools
   at its disposal. We ask whether UN peacekeeping is one instrument to
   mitigate the negative effect of conflict on households' economic
   well-being. We argue that, by reducing violence and heightening
   perceptions of safety, UN missions (i) encourage labor provision and
   economic exchanges, and (ii) instill confidence by reducing the
   psychological impact of daily stressors. Combining high-frequency
   household survey data and information on subnational deployment of UN
   peacekeepers in South Sudan, we show that peacekeepers' military
   presence improves security (observed and perceived), which in turn
   revitalizes local economies and households' subjective well-being. These
   improvements ultimately boost households' consumption, partially
   countering the negative effect of ongoing civil wars by keeping local
   communities' economy afloat.},

Abstract = {Thinking about the State involves different processes, spaces for
   action, subjects, and also, feelings. Its interventions, as ``ways of
   doing{''}, are the product of positions on socially problematized
   issues. This paper reflects on the experiences and sociabilities, that
   social policies consolidate in millions of people who benefit from Cash
   Transfer Programs. It has the aim to describe the emotions of recipients
   of social policies, at the beginning of Social, Preventive and Mandatory
   Isolation in Argentina, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this,
   virtual semi-structured interviews on Facebook were carried out. This
   analysis allows us to describe the emotions connected to modifications

Abstract = {Photo identification (ID) laws are often passed on the premise that they
   will prevent voter fraud and/or reduce perceptions of electoral fraud.
   The impact of ID laws on perceptions of electoral fraud remains
   unsettled and is complicated by widespread confusion about current
   voting requirements. In the 2017 Virginia election, we fielded an
   experiment, with an advocacy organization, evaluating the effects of the
   organization's outreach campaign. We randomized which registered voters
   were mailed one of three informational postcards. After the election, we
   surveyed subjects about electoral integrity and their knowledge about
   election laws. We find that providing registrants with information on
   the state's photo ID requirements is associated with a reduction in
   perceptions of fraud and increased knowledge about voting requirements.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to discuss the relationship between
   information technologies in the face of the sanctioning processes and
   fiscal responsibility, which occurred in the territorial tax control
   bodies, spaces and which more resources are required in technology with
   specific purpose for this purpose, taking advantage of the moment of the
   validity of Legislative Act 04 of 2019 in Colombia. Methodologically,
   the documentary research design near the critical essay was used. To
   illustrate the arguments and views of the research team, it shows
   situations in which the administrative process of sanctioning and fiscal
   responsibility could be improved, emphasizing the hypothesis that the
   use of information technologies allows the strengthening of the
   fundamental right of due process of those investigated. It is concluded
   that, when technological tools are extended to the institutionality of
   the Colombian State, it is possible to have a better approach with
   citizenship, which generates a positive expectation in meeting their
   needs, being the essence of the Social State of Law to build at all
   times a democracy of results that transcends procedural formalities and
   expands social justice.},

Abstract = {Given the prevalence of riots throughout human history, the lack of
   normative theorizing about them compared to other forms of political
   violence is striking. The author hypothesizes that this is due to riots'
   extra-institutionality. Riots are extra-public because they involve the
   participation of crowds, rather than institutionalized groups such as
   parties or social movements. They are extra-state because they violate
   the state's monopoly on violence. Riots are extra-legal because they
   constitute a form of unlawful assembly. They are also
   extra-parliamentary because they operate outside the normal legislative
   process. This article considers justifiable reasons to resist each of
   these foundational institutions, and proposes provisional criteria for a
   justifiable riot. The author concludes by urging political theorists to
   further examine the normative dimension of riots.},

Abstract = {Public policy analysis (PPA) is a disciplinary field where multiple
   theories and methodological procedures converge. This research note
   addresses whether it is possible to organize knowledge in a way that
   philosophical assumptions, analytical frameworks and methods could be
   aligned. To this aim, Patrick Jackson's typology is used as an
   organizational scheme of the debates in philosophy of science. Based on
   this, we propose a distribution of PPA macro theories in correspondence
   with the four methodologies defined in Jackson's scheme: neopositivism,
   realism, analyticism and reflexivity. The purpose of this exercise is to
   make PPA theoretical proposals more accessible for researchers and, this
   way, to highlight their distinctive elements and practical implications
   for research methodologies. This will allow to visualize the potential
   paths that could lead towards more consistent, coherent and congruent
   research designs.},

Abstract = {Many people seek to increase practitioners' use of research evidence in
   decision making. Two common strategies are dissemination and
   interaction. Dissemination can reach a wide audience at once, yet
   interactive strategies can be beneficial because they entail
   back-and-forth conversations to clarify how research evidence applies in
   a particular context. To date, however, we lack much direct evidence of
   the impact of interaction beyond dissemination. Partnering with an
   international sustainability-oriented NGO, I conducted a field
   experiment to test the impact of an interactive strategy (i.e., a single
   conversation) on practitioners' use of research evidence in a pending
   decision. I find that the conversation had a substantial impact on
   research use relative to only receiving disseminated materials, which
   likely was due to increased self-efficacy. I also provide practical
   guidance on how researchers can apply this finding close to home by
   strengthening linkages with local decision makers.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {963-980},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most of the distributive politics literature focuses on how incumbent
   politicians allocate development resources in the absence of spending
   rules, and on the politicization of rules when they do determine
   distribution. What is less clear is whether politically neutral spending
   rules lead to neutral spending. Using new data on a long-running federal
   development fund and elections from Pakistan in a regression
   discontinuity design, the author presents strong evidence that the
   ruling party manipulated fund distribution to disproportionately benefit
   its co-partisans and punish the weakest opposition. Considering various
   factors, partisan bias is the most plausible explanation. These findings
   are important not only because the purpose of rules-based funds is to

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This article examines how ideational factors shape policy making during
   crisis conditions. Crises can generate `problem uncertainty', in which
   policymakers are uncertain about the nature of policy problems. Existing
   studies have linked such conditions to processes of policy learning. Yet
   crises can also trigger `policy urgency', where policymakers' preference
   for immediate policy action is paramount. This study suggests that
   bounded emulation, in which policymakers copy available solutions
   without learning, is related to perceptions of policy urgency. To probe
   the plausibility of the framework the study conducts a comparative
   analysis of value-added tax reform in Ontario and British Columbia,
   drawing on 41 semi-structured interviews, policy documents and news
   articles. The study finds that high uncertainty and moderate urgency
   facilitated policy learning in Ontario, while moderate uncertainty and
   high urgency fostered bounded emulation in British Columbia. The article
   identifies the implications of the findings for future research on ideas
   and policy change.},

Abstract = {It is well established that those who supported the winning side in
   elections report greater specific democratic support - they are more
   satisfied with the functioning of their democracy - than those who
   supported the losing side. This literature, however, has focused almost
   exclusively on winning the presidency or premiership. This project
   extends that literature to incorporate the effect of district election
   victories and defeats on citizens' democratic opinions using
   post-election surveys in three Westminster-style democracies: Australia,
   Canada, and Great Britain. It also includes two indicators of democratic
   institutional support: believing it matters for whom people vote and
   believing it matters who is in power. It finds that district-level
   results moderate the win-loss satisfaction gap induced by national
   election results. Winning in the constituency offsets the negative
   effect of electoral defeat; among national winners, however, the
   district result has limited impact on democratic attitudes.
   Constituency-level victories are less effective at mitigating the effect
   of national defeat on more diffuse democracy support.},

Abstract = {In 2020, the Sars-CoV-2 (also known as the COVID-19/Coronavirus) crisis
   resulted in the closure of most of Europe's borders, both external and
   internal. What consequences does this have for border regions as living
   spaces? This article uses the Danish-German border region as an example
   for the complex impact of the Sars-CoV-2 crisis on a European
   borderland. A special focus is placed on the region's reciprocal
   national minorities on either side of the border. This article shows
   that these groups have been most impacted by the nation state measures
   of restricting and controlling access across the border, as this has
   reduced their opportunities of kin-state contact and interaction.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {58},

Pages = {531-551},

Abstract = {MPs face a dilemma when it comes to deliberative mini-publics (DMPs): in
   a context of distrust, they may see it as an opportunity to
   re-legitimize themselves and solve complex policy issues. But it could
   also challenge the quasi-monopoly they used to have on political
   decisions and undermine the role of the Parliament and the primacy of
   elections. The article is found on 91 face-to-face interviews with
   French-speaking Belgian MPs sitting in federal or regional parliaments.
   First, we describe the profile of supporters of DMPs. We then identify
   three ideal-typical discourses: the power-sharing discourse, the
   consultative discourse, and the elitist discourse. The contribution of
   this article is twofold. First, it analyzes the argumentative frames
   used by MPs to assess deliberative mini-publics using a large number of
   interviews. Second, it demonstrates that their discourses depend on
   their evaluation of ordinary citizens' competence to participate and on
   their resulting vision of representation. Political actors mainly
   perceive DMPs as power-sharing instruments that would alter their
   elected position and the legitimacy of the election.},

Abstract = {An attempt of positioning, describing, and explaining
   high-education-low-income issue among skilled immigrants from Chinese
   mainland in Canada was conducted using Bourdieu's concepts of habitus,
   field, and capital. It is concluded that the issue is largely caused by
   habitus conflicts and transitions happened short after the recent
   Chinese professional immigrants arrived in Canada as well as devalued
   cultural capital and lost of social capital that they ever had in China
   before. Meanwhile, the study indicated that high-education-low-income
   issue universally exists among recent immigrants from various ethnic
   groups in Canada currently. Immigration, in Bourdieu's terms, was a
   course of devaluation and reproduction of capital that immigrants ever
   held before and will hold in the future. Potential success in
   immigration exists in sufficient preparation both psychological and
   physical for their habitus transition in advance and positively possible
   capital conversion both material and non-materials following their
   arrival of the new country.},

Abstract = {This article looks globally at the motivations behind attitudes to
   immigration. Such motivations have been typically conceptualised by
   academics either in terms of the `economic competition' or `cultural
   threat' that immigrants are perceived to pose to the individual or their
   `in-group'. We propose and test a third possibility: that support for or
   opposition to immigration is determined by one's perceptions of
   immigration's effects on social conflict. Using the 2017-2020 World
   Values Survey (WVS) for forty-nine countries, we show that: in most
   countries, globally, citizens are more likely to agree than disagree
   that immigration leads to social conflict; levels of concern about the
   effects of immigration on social conflict are higher than those
   regarding unemployment or culture in sixteen-disproportionately
   economically developed-countries; concern about social conflict is
   conceptually and distributionally distinct; belief that immigration
   leads to social conflict predicts immigration policy preferences; but,
   uniquely, is positively predicted by higher education. Our findings
   highlight the importance of institutional conflict resolution capacity,
   including those related to integration, for the politics of migration.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Drawing on 25 qualitative interviews, this paper attends to and
   critiques neoliberalism to demonstrate how management's enforcement of
   targets and the expectancy to overwork in various workplaces corrodes
   the relationship between managers and employees. First, the paper
   briefly charts how the shift from post-war Keynesian welfare state
   capitalism to neoliberalism in the global north placed renewed emphasis
   on maximising profitability, and what this meant for working methods and
   innovations that managers now use to make an organisation more
   efficient. This is often regarded as `management practices'. It then
   connects management practices to the political economy and therefore
   sheds further empirical light on how management practices under
   neoliberalism impact adversely on workers, generating psychological
   distress, instability, pressure and a negative working environment. The
   paper closes with a discussion of how managers potentially perform an
   ideological function, directing workers' attention away from
   neoliberalism and cementing capitalist realism; the negative ideological
   belief that there is no alternative to the current political economy.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic required prompt action from governments all over
   the world. In federal systems, it can be important or beneficial to
   coordinate crisis management between the various governments. The extent
   to which intergovernmental coordination occurred and the form it took
   (vertical or horizontal) varied across countries and regarding the
   measures taken. By examining the introduction and the subsequent easing
   of containment measures and the procurement of medical supplies in
   Australia, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland, this article identifies the
   circumstances under which intergovernmental coordination occurs.
   Surprisingly, the existence of strong intergovernmental councils did not
   lead to closer intergovernmental coordination. Governments coordinated
   more intensively when jurisdiction was shared, problem pressure was
   high, and measures were(re-)distributive in nature. Vertical
   coordination was more likely when vertical intergovernmental councils
   existed and powers were shared.},

Abstract = {The expansion of higher education across the globe changed the dynamics
   of social inclusion and exclusion during the last century. As a result
   of the increase in higher-education enrollment, societies have reduced
   social gaps in education and labor. Moreover, higher-education expansion
   policies have led to a diversification in the quality of
   higher-education institutions and workforce configurations, which has
   allowed for the increased participation of women in the education and
   labor market. Evidence on higher-education expansion has shown only a
   minor decrease in gender gaps in the labor market. One explanation is
   the presence of credential market configuration, where degrees signal
   social status. This research focuses on how educational credentialism
   affects the gender wage gap, using the CASEN Household Survey of Chile.
   It aims to assess the effects of a credential on earnings, using a
   regression framework and data set between 2013 and 2017. The results
   point to a differential effect of credentials across genders,
   interpreted as a systematic bias toward human capital pricings, with
   particular effects on the gender wage gap.},

Abstract = {Participation in the public debate constitutes one of the most evident
   avenues for political scientists to demonstrate the social relevance of
   the discipline. This article focuses on two questions: the types of
   roles political scientists adopt in their public interventions and the
   potential tensions between their public engagement and the epistemic
   norms regulating academic and research activities. We investigate these
   questions in the context of very salient political debates, involving a
   high degree of political confrontation, where basic political beliefs,
   values, identities, and interests are at stake. Focusing on the case of
   the public debate surrounding the Catalan independence crisis
   (2010-2018), we demonstrate that in this type of context, (1) political
   scientists mostly adopt a partisan stance in their public interventions,
   yet it is also frequent that this is combined with the presence of
   academic elements in their discourse; (2) demand side factors (media
   outlets' editorial lines) reinforce these partisan dynamics. These
   findings show that opportunities for increasing the social relevance of
   political scientists in these highly contentious contexts might come at
   the price of creating tensions that could erode the legitimacy of
   political science knowledge before the public.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the legislative activity of Aung San Suu Kyi,
   Myanmar's iconic dissident, during her inaugural tenure as opposition MP
   in the country's first post-junta parliament (2012-2016). How did such a
   totemic figure behave in a legislature dominated by an army-backed party
   and military-appointed MPs? What legislative tools did she use? The
   study draws evidence from Burmese-language proceedings of Myanmar's
   Union legislature and field interviews. The findings point to a largely
   marginal, yet disciplined, involvement of Aung San Suu Kyi in
   legislative business. She neither acted as party whip nor openly
   criticised government record or took disruptive action in the context of
   Myanmar's `discipline-flourishing democracy'. Yet, she joined policy
   debates through the occasional motion, used her position as a catalyst
   for engaging the government and the world, and successfully marshalled
   her party to win the next two general elections in 2015 and 2020. The
   findings have implications for understanding how the strategies of such
   near-mythical figure can explain subsequent electoral or political
   (mis)fortunes.},

Abstract = {This paper, based on ethnographic and documentary work, presents an
   overview of the political conflict that has arisen in Huexca, Morelos,
   Mexico, regarding the construction of a thermoelectric plant in the
   community, which has been going on for more than a decade of
   confrontation. Two fundamental issues will be analyzed: on the one hand,
   the difficult process of its imposing implementation and, on the other
   hand, the consequences of an authoritarian approach to the population.
   The failure to consult the local population generated internal dynamics
   that divided the population between those who sympathized with the
   project and those who did not, which has resulted in the impossibility
   of the plant's operation to date. This division is a perverse by-product
   of the implementation of large infrastructure projects, due to the lack
   of effective consultation to reaffirm and unify the populations in their
   acceptance or rejection.},

Abstract = {Stereotypes are powerful heuristics structuring decision-making, with
   research suggesting that gender-based stereotypes place women at a
   professional disadvantage. This paper tests whether attorneys' gender
   influences Supreme Court outcomes. We construct an attorney-focused data
   set combining personal and professional attributes with case-level
   characteristics from 1946 to 2016. Our approach brings clarity to
   previous findings, enabling a longitudinal analysis of women
   participation before the Court. We find that attorney gender does not
   influence party success. In doing so, we show that a more nuanced
   approach is needed when studying the intersection between judicial
   outcomes and attorney traits.},

Abstract = {Les menages obtiennent les biens et services necessaires au bien-etre de
   leurs membres en bonne partie dans la sphere marchande. La
   marchandisation des biens et des services est desormais largement
   etendue, bien que le bien-etre ne se reduise pas a la consommation
   marchande. Depuis 1969, les enquetes budgetaires canadiennes permettent
   d'evaluer les comportements de consommation ainsi que la structure des
   besoins des menages (regression du poids de l'alimentation et hausse du
   poids des postes transports, logement, loisirs et culture, protection et
   depenses diverses). L'analyse de la differenciation transversale et
   temporelle des comportements de consommation entre classes
   socioeconomiques revele que les menages aises accroissent leurs efforts
   budgetaires plus rapidement que les menages pauvres et de classes
   moyennes inferieures pour les depenses discretionnaires et afin de
   satisfaire de nouveaux besoins. Quand un poste de consommation augmente
   rapidement lorsque le revenu des menages s'accroit sur une longue
   periode, il est plus differencie socialement, tel qu'illustre par
   l'evolution des depenses pour le logement ou les transports.},

Abstract = {The day-to-day behaviors of undocumented immigrants are significantly
   affected when local law enforcement officials do the work of federal
   immigration enforcement. One such behavior, which has been widely
   discussed in debates over so-called sanctuary policies, is that
   undocumented immigrants are less likely to report crimes to the police
   when local law enforcement officials work with U.S. Immigration and
   Customs Enforcement (ICE) on federal immigration enforcement. However,
   the mechanism that explains this relationship of decreased trust in law
   enforcement has not yet been systematically tested. Do undocumented
   immigrants become less trusting of police officers and sheriffs when
   local law enforcement officials work with ICE on federal immigration
   enforcement? To answer this, we embedded an experiment that varied the
   interior immigration enforcement context in a survey (n = 512) drawn
   from a probability-based sample of undocumented immigrants. When local
   law enforcement officials work with ICE on federal immigration
   enforcement, respondents are statistically significantly less likely to
   say that they trust that police officers and sheriffs will keep them,
   their families, and their communities safe; will protect the
   confidentiality of witnesses to crimes even if they are undocumented;
   will protect the rights of all people equally, including undocumented
   immigrants; and will protect undocumented immigrants from abuse or
   discrimination.},

Abstract = {At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, both the federal government and
   local governments across the U.S. recommended that Americans engage in
   social distancing and other prosocial health behaviors (e.g. wearing a
   mask in public). While social scientists know a fair amount about
   compliance with these recommendations, we know less about why some
   people may have been more likely to comply than others. Building on
   insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more
   self-transcendent (i.e. more likely to put others' needs before their
   own) are more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health
   behaviors (PSHB). In a demographically representative survey (N = 1,015)
   conducted at the pandemic's outset, we find that self-transcendent
   people were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB; irrespective of
   partisanship and local COVID-19 transmission rates. Recognizing the
   limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging
   international and interstate phone-tracking data into opinion surveys.
   We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place
   a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to
   engage in social distancing. Our work suggests that while prosocial
   health recommendations are politically contentious, variation in
   compliance transcends conventional partisan disagreements.},

   experience},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {What affects public support for electoral reform? How does experience
   with different electoral systems affect people's willingness to support
   electoral reform? Given the salience of changes to election rules even
   when they are passed via the legislature and the increasing use of
   referenda as alternative mechanisms for change, these questions are
   critical to understanding when electoral reform will occur. I argue that
   experience (specifically, with an electoral system similar to that under
   consideration) affects public opinion by reducing uncertainty about the
   likely effects of reform and thus affects support for reform (although
   the direction of the effect depends on partisan bias). Moreover, I argue
   that experience is most important in the absence of strong party cues. I
   leverage subnational electoral system variation in the United Kingdom
   and find that experience does affect support for reform - negative
   experiences decrease support for reform. The results have implications
   for the possibility of electoral reform in the UK and beyond.},

Abstract = {International relations have always been related to a particular sense
   of living together, both as a concept and as an academic field shaped by
   some practices of being-together. The question of how international
   relations perceive a way of living together (as being-together in a
   common space) has been addressed from the early forms of
   post-structuralist quests by trying to deal with the issues such as
   inside/outside, identity/difference, but has not been intensely focused
   on the issue of common and its alternative perceptions by approaching
   the fundamental relationship between the ontological status of being-in
   and being-together. In this article, with focusing on how a particular
   way of being-in-a-common is related to a certain ontology of
   international relations, I will utilize French philosopher Jean Luc
   Nancy's re-writing of Heideggerian notion of Mitsein (being-with) in
   order to problematize the phenomenon of the international as an
   intermediate category that defines our meanings of living-together and
   our relationship with this world.},

Abstract = {The post-crisis reforms of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) have
   met with skepticism toward their democratic credentials. This certainly
   applies to the requirement to set up Independent Fiscal Institutions
   (IFIs). Drawing on Pettit's model of republican legitimacy, this paper
   argues however that IFIs can indirectly increase the democratic
   character of national fiscal policy while preserving Member States'
   autonomy. Such a democratic contribution is further facilitated by
   nationally differentiated implementation of the EU rules regarding the
   heterogeneous design and powers of IFIs. Based on a comparative analysis
   of selected Member States' ``elaboration discretion{''} in defining the
   organisation and the mandate of IFIs, the article highlights that these
   features reflect the variety of constitutional settings at domestic
   level. It is concluded that this heterogeneity amounts to a form of
   differentiated integration which allows for a better navigation of the
   trade-off between the persistence of fiscal policy externalities and the
   reduction in national autonomy.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article examines the forces shaping changes in the number of
   parties between consecutive elections. We argue that the transaction
   costs in electoral coordination depend on the turnout level in the
   previous election. The greater the number of peripheral voters entering
   the electorate, the less likely a substantial change in the distribution
   of partisan support in the subsequent election. The argument is tested
   using data for 313 parliamentary elections in 63 countries from 1990 to
   2011, and two cases studies of countries using compulsory voting (the
   Netherlands and Australia).},

Title = {What Countries Select More Experienced Leaders? The PolEx Measure of
   Political Experience},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1455-1464},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How can one assess which countries select more experienced leaders for
   the highest office? There is wide variation in prior career paths of
   national leaders within, and even more so between, regime types. It is
   therefore challenging to obtain a truly comparative measure of political
   experience; empirical studies have to rely on proxies instead. This
   article proposes PolEx, a measure of political experience that abstracts
   away from the details of career paths and generalizes based on the
   duration, quality and breadth of an individual's experience in politics.
   The analysis draws on a novel data set of around 2,000 leaders from 1950
   to 2017 and uses a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate PolEx. The
   article illustrates how the new measure can be used comparatively to
   assess whether democracies select more experienced leaders. The authors
   find that while on average they do, the difference with non-democracies
   has declined dramatically since the early 2000s. Future research may
   leverage PolEx to investigate the role of prior political experience in,
   for example, policy making and crisis management.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Whereas some federations reacted to the expanding international trade
   agenda by `federalizing' trade policy-making and allowing sub-federal
   governments a substantial involvement, others did not. Comparing Canada
   and the United States, this paper investigates the conditions and
   potentials of federalization on the case of public procurement
   liberalization. The first section argues that the institutionalization
   of intergovernmental relations depends on the incontestability of
   sub-federal claims to authority and the absence of cheaper alternatives.
   In the US, the availability of federal pre-emption and the possibility
   to exclude sub-federal competencies from international agreements acted
   as a brake on state involvement. In Canada, `watertight' provincial
   competencies and a non-representative second chamber enabled a gradual
   federalization. The second section argues that federalization holds the
   potential to increase constituent units' openness to procurement
   liberalization. While their deficient involvement has constrained US
   states' openness, federalization was instrumental in Canadian provinces'
   recently growing openness for international suppliers.},

Abstract = {The 2017 and 2019 general elections showed a strong bedrock of Labour
   support among the working age population and particularly the under
   thirties. This is a consequence both of long-term changes to the
   composition of class cohorts, political events, and the experience of a
   decade of Conservative governments, whose policies have shielded the
   retired and the elderly. These conditions have not changed and, under
   the impact of Covid-19 are, if anything, sharpening. The challenge of
   the Labour Party's new leadership under Keir Starmer is keeping hold of
   this crucial component of the party's electoral coalition while making
   inroads into Tory support. Initial movement in the polls suggests he is
   on course for achieving the latter, but positions taken on Black Lives
   Matter, the government's coronavirus strategy, and a managerialist
   oppositional style recalls the triangulation strategy associated with
   the Blair years. This article considers the possibilities and dangers of
   adopting this approach.},

Abstract = {Six electoral cycles since the implementation of Brazil's gender quota,
   just 15\% of the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies are women. We
   ask how parties' use of informal institutions mediates the effectiveness
   of the gender quota. Drawing on data from more than 4,000 state-level
   party organizations, we show that parties employ informal practices that
   intentionally and non-intentionally interact with gender equity rules to
   affect women's political representation: the intentional nomination of
   phantom candidates ({''}laranjas{''}) allows parties to comply with the
   letter of the quota law, without effectively supporting women's
   candidacies-to the detriment of women's election; meanwhile, the
   extended use of provisional commissions to minimize oversight on
   candidate selection poses an obstacle to the quota and women's
   candidacies and election more generally. Quota resistance characterizes
   an instance of both the likely inadvertent effects of informal
   institutions employed for non-gendered motivations and party leaders
   acting to preserve their own power.},

Abstract = {What factors shape European opinion on immigration? Past work has
   largely pointed to evaluations of various immigrant groups and the
   cultural, criminal, and/or economic threats they may pose to society,
   but has overlooked how evaluations of the broader political system
   matter. Using cross-sectional and panel data from the European Social
   Survey (ESS), we find that higher levels of political trust are
   associated with increased public support for allowing a variety of
   different groups to immigrate, including non-Europeans, Muslims, and
   Roma. We also find that political trust is positively associated with
   support for a generous and accommodating refugee policy. We attribute
   these findings to greater mass confidence in the political system's
   ability to protect the native population from any perceived
   immigration-related threats. Overall, these findings suggest that
   political trust, which is near historic lows, has important implications
   for understanding public opinion toward immigration, a highly salient
   issue in contemporary European politics.},

Abstract = {Political theorists are increasingly drawn to the recovery of
   anticolonial thinkers as global figures. Frantz Fanon is largely
   excluded from these discussions because of his presumed commitment to
   the nation-state and its territorialist assumptions. This essay claims,
   by contrast, that Fanon's writings reveal an alternative way of thinking
   about worldmaking, less as a question of political and economic
   institution-building spearheaded by leaders than as a multiscalar
   project that permeates the production of the built environment and the
   creation of selves. I show how Fanon challenges the dichotomy between
   the global and the national by seeking to transform not just the
   national scale in relation to the international, but also the corporeal,
   urban, rural, and regional scales of an imperially configured world. In
   order to read Fanon as a scalar thinker and to highlight aspects of his
   thought that have been relatively neglected, I draw on concepts from
   geography, and specifically scalar analysis, which, I demonstrate,
   allows political theorists to develop a richer understanding of the
   operations of power in colonial contexts and how they can be
   restructured to inaugurate more liberated ways of being human.},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-218},
Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {This article deals with Speculative Realism. After defining the
   positions of Graham Harman, Ray Brassier and Quentin Meillassoux - who,
   along with Iain Hamilton Grant, were its godfathers when this
   philosophical perspective was baptized at Goldsmiths College in 2007 -
   it examines them in relation to the question of negativity. More
   precisely, it claims that this type of realism, while reworking the main
   thesis of traditional realism as regards mind-independent reality,
   cannot give an adequate account of that negativity, even though it seeks
   to draw on it. And so, just as traditional realism could not think of
   negativity as not external, in its capacity as the difference between
   reality and its representation, so Speculative Realism cannot conceive
   of a negativity that penetrates into the being. The tension between
   realism and nihilism, between realism and the affirmation of nothingness
   as the initial horizon of Being, leads, rather overturning negativity
   into its opposite - into Being and determinacy. To solve this problem,
   Speculative Realism could have benefited from the lesson the modern
   dialectical thought had developed along Hegel's and Marx's trajectory.
   This could have taught Speculative Realism to think of negativity as
   Ursprung, as a conceptual foundation, rather than as Anfang, a temporal
   beginning. The development of the self-referential character of
   negativity, as is shown both by the transition from the doctrine of
   Being to that of Essence in the Science of Logic, and that of commodity
   to value in Capital, prevents any conceptual hypostatization.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {Across advanced economies, affordable housing shortages are pushing
   low-income voters out of cities. Left governments frequently exacerbate
   these shortages by eliminating public housing. Why does the Left pursue
   policies that displace its voters? We argue that the Left's long-term
   rebalancing towards the middle class and away from an increasingly
   stigmatized ``underclass{''} has significantly attenuated the trade-offs
   inherent in reducing affordable housing. Focusing on the UK, we
   demonstrate that by alienating low-income voters politically and
   reshuffling them across districts, housing crises have significant costs
   for Labour. Yet, drawing on interviews, we show that displacement is
   nonetheless compatible with electoral interests: the displaced make room
   for richer voters whom politicians believe will also support Labour. A
   quantitative analysis of Greater London's 32 local authorities and 624
   wards further documents trends in line with coalitional rebalancing.
   Taken together, our findings demonstrate that electoral foundations are
   key to understanding housing crises and gentrification.},

Abstract = {The world certainly is independent of our mind and our language.
   However, objectivity is a social product. It is formed when individuals
   confront each other and when their perspective exposes itself to
   intersubjective criticism and correction. In this conception the
   Hegelian thesis according to which ``the real is the spiritual{''}
   reappears. However, Hegel totally resolves the natural immediacy in
   conceptual mediation. A post-metaphysical realism inherits the Hegelian
   primacy of the spirit without presuming to resolve the natural given in
   sociality.},

Abstract = {Water has particular connotations, intrinsically related to a series of
   asymmetries over its control. It has been the subject of frequent
   disputes or controversies between nations and states over its
   domination, which the literature calls bio-politics, hydro-politics or,
   as we will call it here, hydro-hegemony. The objective of the article is
   to identify asymmetries of power in the Mekong River Basin by China,
   contributing to the academic debate on China's hydro-politics strategies
   with its riparian neighbors. We will methodologically support this
   research in the state of the art on power asymmetries based on water
   resources, emphasizing the unequal power relations between riparian
   states and discussing the hypothesis of the water war with the intention
   of introducing basic concepts of hydropolitics to a Spanish-speaking
   audience. The conclusions offered by this research arrive, once the
   geopolitical importance of water is discussed, at unilateralist
   approaches by China, rejecting binding commitments when these may
   collide with national interests of supply and control over the water
   resource in the Mekong River Basin.},

Abstract = {This article analyses some claims made about the Gaidheal identity in
   Scotland, with particular reflection on a distinct `sociolinguistic
   turn' within Gaidhlig studies and related research over the last two
   decades. Through critical analysis of a major sociological survey on the
   structuring of various markers in framing Gaidheal identity, a normative
   basis is provided to then assess other identity classifications made by
   some academics whose work is focussed on the single identity-marker of
   the Gaidhlig language. It is argued that identity claims predicated on
   the specific nature of the Gaidhlig sociolinguistic turn fail to capture
   the complex reality and living histories of actual Gaidheal identities
   (and claims on those identities), in particular, the socio-cultural
   importance of place-based practices and understandings. Recent proposals
   for a Gaidheal ethnolinguistic assembly may enable modes of articulation
   and recognition to develop which better capture those realities, as well
   as supporting societal and linguistic regeneration among the indigenous
   group.},

Abstract = {In the West African region, one conflict that has ravaged the nations
   since 2009 is the Boko Haram Insurgency which is located in Nigeria.
   This Islamist group is indisputably the most dangerous group confronting
   Nigeria today with their violent activities ranging from political and
   socio-economic to security and governance aspects. Boko Haram has
   managed to wipe out thousands of Nigerians since its inception in 2009,
   with an attempt to take power from the legitimate government of Nigeria.
   Boko Haram's ethnic, religious, and regional fault-lines do not only
   impact Nigeria but people beyond the borders of Nigeria. A quick review
   of the current ongoing scholarly debate on the activities of Boko Haram
   reveals that scholars have not paid much attention to the group's
   funding, recruitment, and major attacks in combination for better
   apprehension when reading. In cases where such has been analysed, it has
   been individually analysed and most of these studies are five-ten years
   old. Hence, such information needs an update to remain relevant in cases
   where they are still poised to be relevant. Therefore, this article's
   central objective is to analyse the three identified themes using a
   decolonial perspective. It argues that Boko Haram's ongoing campaign of
   terror is inextricably linked to the funding it continues to receive and
   strong recruitment tactics.},

Abstract = {How do voters in consolidating democracies see electoral integrity? How
   does election affect the change in perception of electoral integrity
   among these voters? What role does winning play in seeing an election as
   free and fair? Building on the theory of the winner-loser gap, we answer
   these questions using original two-wave panel surveys we conducted
   before and after three parliamentary elections in Southeast Europe in
   2018 and 2020. The article focuses on changes of perception of electoral
   integrity as a function of satisfaction with the electoral results in
   contexts where the quality of elections has always been at the centre of
   political conflict. We specifically explore the socialization effect of
   elections in environments with notoriously low trust in political
   institutions and high electoral stakes. The article goes beyond the
   ``sore loser{''} hypothesis and examines voters' both political
   preferences and personal characteristics potentially responsible for the
   change in perception of electoral integrity over the course of electoral
   cycle.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {During Jeremy Corbyn's period as leader, Labour was convulsed by a row
   over claims of widespread anti-semitism in the party, with Corbyn under
   sustained attack for his alleged complacency-and even connivance. The
   main purpose of this article is to help explain how the Corbyn
   leadership managed the `anti-semitism crisis'. The first section reviews
   the sequence of events, the key aspects of the crisis and the various
   steps taken by the Corbyn leadership. The article then analyses the two
   sets of factors which drove Corbyn's response. The second section
   utilises the concept of `schemas', cognitive shortcuts to shed light on
   how the leadership framed the problem of alleged endemic anti-semitism.
   It argues that the Corbyn leadership's schemas of Israel were integrally
   linked to those it held on anti-semitism and played a major role in
   determining the course of action it took. The third section contends
   that the Corbyn leadership's decisions and choices were also governed by
   its approach to party management, in particular by its two central
   precepts, `the adversarial frame of reference' and the `ethic of
   ultimate ends'. The overall conclusion is that the inadequacy of the
   Corbyn leadership's schematic understanding of anti-semitism and of its
   managerial precepts help explain its failure to resolve the
   anti-semitism crisis.},

Abstract = {In the face of a global demographic shift, an aging population and a
   `crisis' in adult social care (ASC), this study analyses over 3000
   pledges on ASC in political parties' manifesto discourse following the
   United Kingdom's move to a multi-level electoral politics in 1998/1999.
   Although often overlooked, attention to this formative phase of social
   policy-making reveals the discursive political antecedents of welfare
   interventions. The analysis shows a major increase in issue-salience and
   party politicisation of ASC policy. The discourse reveals political
   cleavages on welfare mixes and policy framing, and sub-state resistance
   to central government policies. Against the backdrop of the
   international rise of devolved governance, the present case is of wider
   international significance because it illustrates how the transition
   from state-wide to (quasi-)federal electoral practices gives rise to new
   territorial dynamics in the electoral discourse of welfare provision; in
   turn, promoting territorialisation, pressure for welfare state expansion
   and the rise of `sub-state' welfare regimes.},

Abstract = {The Labour Party has recently been advised to showcase its patriotism
   and let the electorate know it is proud to be British. This is never bad
   advice for a mainstream political party with designs on power and
   certainly Labour in the past has enjoyed electoral success when its
   redistributionist policies have sprung, at least in part, from an
   obvious love of country. There's a certain urgency, too, in the
   suggestion, since the Corbyn leadership convinced many former Labour
   voters that the party was careless about a British identity and perhaps
   even hostile to British interests. Nevertheless, it would be foolish for
   Keir Starmer's Labour Party to enter into a destructive competition with
   the Tories to see who looks better with the national flag. For reasons
   which the article explores, there are strict limits beyond which a
   social democratic party would not care to go in such a contest. But this
   ought not matter. Voters do not want to see Labour leaders telling them
   how patriotic they are. They are content to be shown. This article
   surveys the history and looks at some possibilities inherent in Labour
   and the patriot game.},

Abstract = {Why do some poor people engage in clientelism whereas others do not? Why
   does clientelism sometimes take traditional forms and sometimes more
   instrumental forms? We propose a formal model of clientelism that
   addresses these questions focusing primarily on the citizen's
   perspective. Citizens choose between supporting broad-based
   redistribution or engaging in clientelism. Introducing insights from
   social psychology, we study the interactions between citizen beliefs and
   values, and their political choices. Clientelism, political inefficacy,
   and inequality legitimation beliefs reinforce each other leading to
   multiple equilibria. One of these resembles traditional clientelism,
   with disempowered clients that legitimize social inequalities. Community
   connectivity breaks this reinforcement mechanism and leads to another
   equilibrium where clientelism takes a modern, instrumental, form. The
   model delivers insights on the role of citizen beliefs for their
   bargaining power as well as for the persistence and transformation of
   clientelism. We illustrate the key mechanisms with ethnographic
   literature on the topic.},

Abstract = {The parameters of modern knowledge systems are clearly showing fault
   lines-that if there is a continuation of the technological systems at
   the heart of development, neglecting the twin issues of ecology and
   equity-there is a serious threat to human existence. This article seeks
   to answer a specific question: in the context of the twenty-first
   century search of offering alternatives to the hegemonic development
   paradigm, what kind of knowledges of production in society could
   possibly be best developed at this point in history? It argues that the
   answer lies in `already existing knowledge systems (AEKS)', accompanied
   by critical thinking on production, distribution and consumption
   systems. Locating the production of knowledge in five spaces-historical
   context, policy formulation, political economic structures, forms of
   collective action and articulation of contested epistemologies-it argues
   that when AEKS are understood both in form and transformation in these
   spaces, that the possibilities they offer for substantial alternatives
   can be explored.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {587-605},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While it is widely accepted that negotiated settlements are prone to
   breakdown, our understanding of the processes through which signatories
   defect lacks precision. A growing qualitative literature recognizes the
   potential for rebel group fluidity, yet the conflict field's converging
   reliance on dyadic data obscures pathways of defection that result in
   splintering or merger in quantitative studies. An in-depth case study of
   a failed peace process in Uganda-which is misclassified in the extant
   data-helps to illustrate the ways in which excluded groups can lower the
   opportunity cost of defection for splintering factions, resulting in a
   strategic alliance. I test the generalizability of this argument against
   the full sample of rebel parties to settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa
   (1975-2015) using a large-N qualitative analysis of causal process
   observations (CPOs). The aggregated results provide strong evidence that
   the defection-by-alliance pathway is much more prevalent than previously
   recognized, accounting for more than one-third of all defections in the
   sample. Where settlements create shared incentives for stakeholders
   inside and outside the peace process to spoil, rebel elites appear more
   willing to bear the costs of an alliance with a rival, rather than
   surrendering under adverse conditions.},

Abstract = {This article adopts the concept of protagonismo infantil (children's
   protagonism) to argue that children's voices on gender identity need to
   be centred in order to fully empower trans and nonbinary children. In
   this field of children's rights, protagonismo infantil enables the law
   to act as a malleable frontier rather than as a rigid boundary. Topics
   concerning gender and sexuality do not feature prominently among the
   legal, social, and medical issues most widely discussed in terms of
   children's rights. When they are approached, such topics are treated as
   marginal, controversial, and divisive. The dominant approach is to deny
   and disregard any possibility for children's self-identification in
   terms of gender and/or sexual orientation, and to `wait and see' until
   an older age - in some cases, adulthood. Yet every child is sexed and
   gendered at birth by medical and legal practitioners and parents, and
   gender and sexuality are core aspects of every individual's sense of
   self and identity. Focusing mainly on the United Nations Convention on
   the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), this article encourages new debate on
   how children can be empowered to affirm their own gender identity
   through the use of protagonismo infantil.},

Abstract = {For decades politicians focused their campaigns on issues that primed
   feelings of normative or existential threat among voters. Whether
   national security, increasing crime rates, or civil unrest, these
   campaign appeals led voters to consider external political threats. We
   examined one particular issue, national security, and showed that
   Republican candidates in particular benefitted from campaigning on this
   issue. When the campaign context featured national security issues,
   Republican candidates benefitted as highly authoritarian Democrats
   increased their support of Republican candidates. Interestingly, similar
   appeals did not benefit Democratic candidates. We found that the
   political context raised perceptions of threat and increased the
   influence of authoritarianism among voters, but these perceptions were
   asymmetrical across partizan and psychological divides. This asymmetry
   led to drastically different candidate evaluations and political
   behavior.},

Abstract = {We develop a subjective measure of candidate ideology in political
   communication, based on human coders evaluations of ideological
   position-taking in campaign advertisements. Our dynamic measure allows
   researchers to track campaign strategies within an election cycle and
   across ideologically distinct groups of voters. As an application of our
   approach, we analyze candidates ideological brand building in US House
   and Senate elections in 2010 and find evidence that structural features
   of US elections constrain the ideological brands of congressional
   candidates. We show that Democratic Senate candidates represented
   themselves as ideologically liberal in areas that strongly supported
   President Obama in 2008, but moderated their ideological message in more
   competitive areas. By contrast, we find no evidence of strategic
   branding among Republicans. Our results reveal one way in which
   fine-grained observational measures of political communications
   illustrate strategic ideological posturing that existing measures based
   on campaign donations or roll call votes cannot identify.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on eight regional elections held in Italy in 2020,
   the year of the Coronavirus pandemic. It looks at both the January and
   September rounds. Even though these two sets of elections took place,
   respectively, at the end and at the beginning of two distinctive
   `phases', separated by the Covid-19 outbreak, they share some important
   characteristics. The discussion starts from a short overview of the
   events leading to the polling days, looking in particular at
   pre-election coalition building, the electoral campaigns and the
   positioning of key leaders. It then moves onto the analysis of the
   election results. It considers changes in political participation,
   support for the major parties, the strengthening of local and
   non-partisan lists, volatility and shifts in political representation.
   The overall pattern is one of increasing territorial complexity and
   fragmentation: regional elections now clearly follow a logic of their
   own, dominated more by local leaders than by national parties.},

Abstract = {Did the different public-health policies that Sweden and Denmark pursued
   in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic result in different levels of
   public trust in governments' and health authorities' ability to guide
   the two countries safely through the pandemic? How did the level of
   trust change as the pandemic unfolded? And were there any cross-country
   differences in the correlates of trust? Using three original
   representative surveys conducted in Sweden and Denmark between late
   March and late June, 2020, this article answers these questions. It
   finds that Danes consistently trusted their government and health
   authorities more than the Swedes did. While Swedish trust was
   politicized and shaped by ideology from the onset of the pandemic, this
   only later became the case in Denmark. The findings provide insights
   into popular evaluations of different public-health policies in two
   otherwise similar countries, with implications for future policy making.

Abstract = {The idea of the working class is often employed in political dialogue,
   yet its definitions are fraught. Working class has been identified with
   occupation, education, income or self-identification. We argue that
   economic precarity is an important aspect of working class status that
   is often not directly captured by other measures. We find that when
   asked, voters often suggest precarity as a defining characteristic of
   working class in the United States. Next, we show that high levels of
   economic precarity predict self-identifying as liberal, a Democrat, and
   disapproving of President Donald Trump even while controlling for an
   individual's race, gender, age, education and income. We also find that
   precarity has a persistent effect for white and non-white voters.
   Overall, we show that by ignoring precarity as an aspect of the working
   class, researchers are missing important aspects of how working class
   status is conceived in the United States.},

Abstract = {Considerable research assesses research success in political science.
   Yet this work has not considered widespread findings that scholars can
   follow various career research paths that complicate how we envision
   scholarly success. Further, we have no systematic information on these
   career paths in any scientific discipline. I present an empirically
   validated research career-path typology for political scientists who
   began their career in a research institution. The typology demonstrates
   that many scholars follow paths different from the most conventional
   expectations, and research success by measures of publications and
   citations is associated with only some of these paths. Thus, existing
   research on aggregate publications and citations likely addresses only a
   subset of the career paths revealed in this article. Understanding
   research activities in our profession requires consideration of the
   various career paths, their motivation, and their place in our research
   community.},

   consolidation (2008-2012) of the ``Nueva Accion Universitaria{''} NAU,
   an organization of students of the Catholic University of Chile that
   constitutes the main input from which the political party Revolucion
   Democratica is constituted (RD) in 2012. The hypothesis of this work is
   that the militant subjectivities forged within the framework of the
   political culture of the Catholic University of Chile are key to
   understanding some of the basic aspects of the configuration of the DR's
   political identity during its first stage.},

Abstract = {Do redistributive policies intended to mitigate the costs of trade
   reduce protectionist backlash? To understand the link between policy
   making and the electoral consequences of policy outcomes, we address
   this question using data on redistributive assistance to workers harmed
   by trade liberalization. By analyzing the 2016 US presidential primary
   and general election results, we show these redistributive policy
   benefits are associated with reduced support for
   then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump, who ran on an
   antiglobalization platform. These findings suggest redistributive trade
   assistance may have a political impact by mitigating support for
   protectionist platforms and antiglobalization rhetoric of presidential
   candidates. Our results suggest that the redistributive program we
   examine in this article may accomplish one of its objectives: to make
   trade liberalization more politically palatable. This article extends
   findings in the extant literature on anti-incumbency effects to suggest
   that policy outcomes affect electoral support for candidates with
   antiglobalization platforms.},

Abstract = {The Pi Sigma Alpha Undergraduate Journal of Politics (PSAJ), sponsored
   by the Pi Sigma Alpha National Honor Society, was founded in 2001 at
   Purdue University. After 20 years, much has changed in undergraduate
   research and publishing, but the benefits of producing a peer-reviewed
   journal remain the same. Undergraduate research has increased in
   prominence, and the journal has modernized to meet these
   transformations. This article describes the history, purpose, and
   operations of the PSAJ. Most important, a survey of former Editorial
   Board members, Pi Sigma Alpha Faculty Chapter Advisors, and published
   authors in the journal reveal attitudes toward operating an
   undergraduate journal, using undergraduate research in the college
   classroom, and publishing in a peer-reviewed journal, respectively. We
   conclude with calls to continue to encourage undergraduate research and
   to assign published undergraduate research in upper-level courses.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the role of national party organizations in
   American politics-specifically, the Democratic and Republican National
   Committees-has argued that political science research has thus far
   undervalued the importance of these organizations. These studies have
   noted the importance that party leaders-including presidents,
   Congressional leaders, and governors-place on the national committees'
   role in shaping a party brand. Notably, these studies are all
   qualitative historical accounts-perhaps because finding consistent
   quantitative data from within the DNC and RNC across time is complicated
   due to limitations in access to archival resources across both parties
   and time. I present a new quantitative data set measuring DNC and RNC
   activity on the basis of an external source: New York Times coverage of
   national committee activity in the period 1953-2012. I use this data to
   test the claim that, while ``party branding{''} is a core national
   committee goal, the DNC and RNC do not consistently engage in it. I find
   that monthly New York Times references of party branding operations
   decline for parties that hold the White House. Meanwhile, coverage of
   other service operations does not decline, suggesting committees step
   back their branding role when their party has control of the executive
   branch of the federal government.},

Abstract = {Disaster responses are political. But can citizens make useful disaster
   decisions? Potential obstacles are that such decisions are complex,
   involve public goods, and often affect other people. Theories of
   political decision-making disagree on whether these problems can be
   overcome. We used experimental economic games that simulate disaster to
   test whether people are willing and able to prevent disasters for
   others. Groups of players face a complex task in which options that
   might help vary in their riskiness. Importantly, although all options
   are reasonable, which option is most useful depends on the experimental
   condition. We find that players will pay to help, can identify which
   option is most useful across experimental conditions, and will pay to
   learn how best to help. Thus, players were able to make useful and
   costly decisions to prevent others from experiencing disaster. This
   suggests that, in at least some situations, citizens may be able to make
   good disaster decisions.},

Abstract = {Time has shown that attempts to transition to democracy in the Middle
   East and North Africa (MENA) following the Arab Uprisings were no minor
   feat. In their experiments with democratization, MENA countries faced a
   number of challenges that remain underexplored. Even though each
   county's path towards democratic transition is multifaceted and
   multicausal, in this article we set out to understand why attempts to
   transition to democracy have largely failed in post-uprising MENA with
   the unique exception of Tunisia. We do so by examining four
   post-uprising cases - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Yemen - from a
   comparative perspective focusing on the coercive power of the state. Our
   findings suggest that in the presence of weak state institutions that
   lose their monopoly over coercive means that constrain non-state actors,
   democratization tends to fail. Yet, even if state mechanisms are strong,
   challenges to democratic transitions can still persist, especially if
   such states house politically motivated security institutions, such as
   influential militaries, that favour authoritarian rule. Within the
   larger picture, this work also provides further inferences about the
   relationship between structural aspects of the state and processes of
   democratization.},

Abstract = {Studies on parochial altruism have insofar focused on the causes leading
   individuals to attack any outgroup on the behalf of one's group. Yet, we
   lack clues to understand why parochial altruists target specific groups,
   such as dominant groups in some contexts and minority groups in others.
   The present paper introduces an experiment to analyze the conditions
   under which individuals costly attack strong versus weak outgroups. In a
   first study, 300 participants played a repeated Inter-group Prisoner
   Dilemma involving multiple groups and inter-group differences in
   resources. Results show that individuals have a preference for targeting
   strong outgroups, but that attacks decrease when the inequality in
   destructive capacity between groups is high. Besides, individuals target
   weak outgroups when they are threatening their ingroup status. Decisions
   in the game correlate with participants' political ideology and Social
   Dominance Orientation. In a second study, we provide evidence that our
   results generalize to historical linkages between economic inequality
   and left-wing versus right-wing terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {Why do some indigenous groups achieve coethnic political representation
   while others do not? In this paper, I highlight the primary role of
   communal property in shaping indigenous representation. While scholars
   often laud the developmental benefits of communal land titling, I argue
   that formalizing collectively held land can inhibit indigenous
   coordination to achieve political representation. Where communal land is
   informally held, indigenous groups are more likely to invest in
   traditional institutions that facilitate collective action to elect
   coethnic candidates to political office. Conversely, titling communal
   property secures indigenous land access but in the process erodes
   traditional institutions that would otherwise promote collective action
   during elections. I test my argument using a multi-method approach that
   includes interviews and experiments with three-hundred Peruvian
   indigenous leaders, historical land-title data, and information scraped
   from mayoral candidate CVs. The findings suggest that the oft-cited
   economic benefits of collective property may generate negative political
   effects.},

Abstract = {This article takes up the scholarly debate on the relationship between
   populism and democracy and analyses the effect populist radical right
   parties (PRRPs) in government have had on the representative function of
   the Austrian parliament. Building on insights from theories of
   newsworthiness, we expect these parties to positively affect the
   visibility of parliament due to the increased conflict between governing
   and mainstream opposition parties, thereby increasing parliamentary
   accountability. Our analysis covers the period from 1994 to 2020, with
   PRRPs in government from 2000 to 2007 and again from 2017 to 2019.
   Empirical inference is based on the weekly coverage of the Austrian
   parliament's first chamber (Nationalrat) in a sample of four daily
   newspapers. The findings show that the first term in government did
   indeed have a positive and significant effect on media coverage.
   However, that this effect is not found for the second term suggests that
   its existence and size depend on the concrete political circumstances
   under which governments and media outlets operate.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, scholarship has sought to redress genocide studies'
   lack of attention to assaults against Indigenous group life in settler
   colonial contexts. While this scholarship has made important
   interventions into a field dominated by the Holocaust prototype, work on
   genocides targeting Indigenous peoples has still laboured under the
   shadow of this paradigm's norms, including the prioritization of
   time-intense direct violence enacted with explicit intent. Studies of
   settler colonial genocide have consequently tended to focus upon
   specific, temporally-bound historical policies and events despite the
   fact that such assaults are part of settler colonialism's persistent
   structure of invasion. In 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and
   Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada challenged this
   case-specific approach, arguing that violence against Indigenous women,
   girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people is part of a protracted, ongoing genocide
   against Indigenous nations. In this article, I expand upon the Inquiry's
   consideration of slower, less direct modes of group destruction. To do
   so, I draw upon scholarship on genocide by attrition-a concept not
   mentioned in the Inquiry's report. Despite their shared concerns,
   studies of genocide by attrition and settler colonial genocide have yet
   to engage each other substantially. I consider how cross-pollination
   between these fields helps to challenge restrictive equations of
   genocide with time-intensive direct violence. Additionally, I develop a
   framework for addressing the cumulative harms that accrue when multiple
   genocidal processes are waged upon Indigenous nations as part of settler
   colonialism's long emergency. Finally, I consider how settler colonial
   genocidal processes necessitate a more nuanced, knowledge-based
   interpretation of intent-an approach that illuminates how the
   consequences of protracted assaults become undeniable and, therefore,
   undeniably intended as they proceed in slow motion.},

Abstract = {The article reviews the selection of towns in England under the Town
   Deals scheme, a funding scheme set up in the summer of 2019. Under the
   scheme, 101 towns in England were selected from a long-list of 541 towns
   to bid for funding to improve local infrastructure. The findings show
   that Conservative-held areas (and in particular marginal
   Conservative-held areas) were much more likely to be selected for the
   scheme, and that this association remains-even when controlling for the
   ranks that civil servants awarded towns on the basis of qualitative and
   quantitative criteria. The findings call into question ministers'
   commitment, under to the Nolan principle, to take decisions
   `impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without
   discrimination or bias'.},

   findings from a new, original content analysis that concisely illustrate
   the most important implications of the framework. The content analysis

Abstract = {Religious minorities are victims of political isolation and persecution
   in societies, where they are subject to violence and discrimination.
   This study was undertaken in a terrorism-affected area to explore those
   elements that subjugate and suppress religious minorities' political
   participation and representation. To conduct an in-depth analysis, a
   qualitative inquiry was used for data collection and analysis. The
   researcher interviewed 13 Christians, seven Hindus, and six Sikhs, using
   a purposive sampling technique and a semi-structured interview guide.
   The primary data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique.
   The researcher found that some of the underlying factors behind the
   political persecution are leadership vacuum, political neglect,
   post-election negligence, vote dislocation, political ignorance, and
   political subordination. This study presented a framework for
   policymakers to solve minorities' political problems, and for
   researchers to better understand the minorities' political oppression on
   local and international levels.},

Abstract = {Data availability has long been a challenge for scholars of
   authoritarian politics. However, the promotion of open government
   data-through voluntary initiatives such as the Open Government
   Partnership and soft conditionalities tied to foreign aid-has motivated
   many of the world's more closed regimes to produce and publish
   fine-grained data on public goods provision, taxation, and more. While
   this has been a boon to scholars of autocracies, we argue that the
   politics of data production and dissemination in these countries create
   new challenges. Systematically missing or biased data may jeopardize
   research integrity and lead to false inferences. We provide evidence of
   such risks from Tanzania. The example also shows how data manipulation
   fits into the broader set of strategies that authoritarian leaders use
   to legitimate and prolong their rule. Comparing data released to the
   public on local tax revenues with verified internal figures, we find
   that the public data appear to significantly underestimate opposition
   performance. This can bias studies on local government capacity and risk
   parroting the party line in data form. We conclude by providing a
   framework that researchers can use to anticipate and detect manipulation
   in newly available data.},

Abstract = {The first presidential debate of 2016 was historic along a number of
   dimensions, including the first woman general election candidate and the
   first general election candidate in history with no political or
   military experience. Given the presence of the first woman nominee of a
   major party, along with dramatic gender differences in support for the
   candidates, we focus on the role of gender in shaping people's emotional
   responses to candidate messaging during the debate. Through the use of a
   controlled experiment, we measure changes in attitudes after exposure to
   the debate. In addition, we utilize facial expression software to
   explore real-time reaction to the candidates during the debate.
   Leveraging data generated during the debate by the facial expression
   software and as well as responses to pretest and post-test
   questionnaires, we find that men and women respond differently to
   candidates' messaging during the debate and these emotional responses
   influence post-debate evaluations.},

Abstract = {Strikes are a central tool of organized labor, yet existing research has
   focused on the economic consequences of strikes, rather than their
   political effects. We examine how labor actions by teachers, a
   well-organized group of public sector workers, affect mass attitudes
   about the strikes and interest in the labor movement more generally. Our
   context involves large-scale teacher strikes and walkouts in six states
   in 2018. Using an original survey in the affected states, we study the
   causal effect of strike exposure among parents whose children's ages
   place them in or out of school. Firsthand strike exposure increased
   parents' support for the teachers and for the labor movement, as well as
   parents' interest in labor action (though not necessarily through
   traditional unions). Our results highlight the importance of strikes as
   a political strategy for unions: not only can they build stronger public
   support for the striking workers but they can also inspire greater
   interest in further labor action among other workers.},

Abstract = {Relying on post-election surveys, we analyze how class and union
   membership condition voters' abandonment of mainstream Left parties and
   the alternatives chosen by former mainstream-Left voters in the period
   2001-2015. Inspired by Przeworski and Sprague's Paper Stones (1986), our
   analysis shows that Left parties face a trade-off between mobilizing
   workers and other voters and that unionization renders workers more
   loyal to Left parties that mobilize non-workers. By contrast,
   unionization does not render non-workers more loyal to Left parties that
   mobilize workers. Union membership increases the likelihood that workers
   who abandon the mainstream Left continue to vote. It also increases the
   likelihood that voters abandon the mainstream Left in favor of radical
   Left parties rather than Center-Right parties. Finally, we show that
   workers are more likely to abandon mainstream Left parties in favor of
   radical Right parties than non-workers and that union membership does
   not affect their propensity to do so. We conclude that reversing the
   decline of working-class organization should be a long-term objective of
   mainstream Left parties.},

Abstract = {The purpose of is article is to analyze the territorial dimension of
   peacebuilding included in the Peace Agreement with the FARC-EP. After
   almost four years since its signing, the situation of violence against
   former guerrilla combatants and social leaders shows the difficulties of
   the Colombian State to transform the territorial dynamics of the
   conflict. As it will be shown, this violence, in addition, has a notable
   peripheral component; for it mainly happens in the Colombian departments
   of the Northeast, the Pacific region and the South and the Southwest.
   Specifically, there come together the largest presence of criminal
   structures, almost all the coca-growing area and pressing dynamics of
   structural violence and institutional weakness. All these factors will
   be mainly addressed through the data offered by government sources and

Abstract = {European cross-border regions often display substantial political and
   economic activity. A key example is the French-German-Swiss Upper Rhine
   region, where three distinct national governance models come together.
   In this dynamic cross-border industry cluster, traditional
   political-administrative units often do not meet the functional needs of
   employers and (future) employees. This comparative institutional
   analysis refers to Varieties of Capitalism and Local Production Systems
   perspectives to explore the operations of this cluster. It finds two
   main patterns through which education and training are embedded in the
   cross-border context: on the one hand, the leveraging of distinct
   institutional advantages in the different parts of the region and, on
   the other, the creation of cross-border collective competition goods in
   the form of jointly provided educational institutions. Through these two
   strategies, local actors within the cross-border industry cluster can
   turn their peripheral location into an institutional advantage.},

Abstract = {Property rights of personal data have been advocated for some time. From
   the perspective of economics of law some argued that they could lower
   transaction costs for contracts involving personal data. This may be the
   case, but new transaction costs are introduced by propertization and the
   issue has not been settled. In this paper, I focus on a different and
   potentially more important aspect. In the actual situation, data
   collectors externalize costs and internalize benefits. An ownership
   regime that enables every citizen to hold a personal data account, like
   a bank account, and that gives people ownership rights over secondary
   use of personal data could correct these misallocations. I hope to shed
   new light on the normative implications of the issue by offering
   normative justifications for property rights of personal data (Sections
   2-4). Secondly, I present fundamental goals and building blocks of a
   property regime of personal data (Section 5) and, thirdly, I illustrate
   how income from personal data ownership could for instance contribute to
   financing pensions under proper regulation (Section 6).},

Abstract = {A collective regional identity is a favourable condition for the
   acceptance of majority decisions made at the regional level and for the
   delegation of competencies from the central to regional governments.
   Moreover, a regional identity can play an important role in times of
   global challenges. Regional attachment might generate a we-feeling and
   help individuals to cope better with a complex world. The same feeling,
   however, might also serve as a basis for exclusionary attitudes. In this
   article, we analyse regional identity at the Land level in Germany with
   data from the German General Social Survey. Our results show that
   regional identity is strong in both the eastern and western parts of the
   country, with people in the east, surprisingly, identifying with their
   respective Land slightly more than people in the west, even though the
   five eastern Lander were only established in 1990 after decades of
   centralist rule. Furthermore, the dark side of regional identity
   manifests itself only in eastern Germany, where a stronger regional
   identity tends to go hand in hand with a greater dislike of foreigners.},

Title = {The Europeanization of national elections. The role of country
   characteristics in shaping EU issue voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research has shown that voting in European elections is affected by
   domestic politics. However, in the last years, and particularly after
   the European debt crisis, also the EU has gained relevance and salience
   in national politics. In this paper we address the Europeanization of
   national elections and assess to what extent the characteristics of
   countries condition the intensity of EU issue voting. Using data from
   the European Election Studies and the Comparative Manifestos Project,
   our results demonstrate the importance of congruence between citizens'
   and parties' positions on the EU for the individual vote on the national
   level and show how this varies across countries. We provide evidence
   that EU issue voting is more intense in countries with more political
   influence in the EU as well as in countries that are net contributors to
   EU funds.},

Abstract = {Partisan gerrymandering and polarization have created an electoral
   landscape where Americans increasingly reside in congressional districts
   dominated by one party. Are individuals more likely to vote when their
   partisanship aligns with the partisan composition of the district?
   Leveraging nationwide voter file data and the redistricting process, we
   present causal evidence on this question via a longitudinal analysis of
   individual-level political participation. Tracking turnout before and
   after a redistricting cycle, where the boundaries of congressional
   districts change, we observe what happens when registrants experience a
   shock to the partisan composition of their district. We find turnout
   increases for individuals assigned to districts aligned with their
   partisanship as compared to individuals in misaligned districts,
   consistent with voters deriving expressive benefits from voting for the
   winning party. By demonstrating how districting influences political
   participation, our findings suggest a new implication of partisan
   gerrymandering that may clash with other democratic goals.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Referendums are often seen as a means to legitimize the outcome as the
   new norm and increase acceptance of the outcome. Do referendums actually
   have these effects? More precisely, do voters recognize the referendum
   result as the new norm? And do voters go as far as to change their own
   minds in accord with the referendum result? We explore these questions
   using a panel survey that we conducted in Ireland before and after the
   abortion referendum that was held on May 25, 2018. We find that, after
   the referendum, voters updated their norm perceptions in the direction
   of the referendum result. However, we find inconsistent evidence that
   the referendum convinced voters to change their personal opinions about
   abortion. The findings provide insights on the power and the limit of
   referendums in increasing policy agreement among voters.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the role the Bosnian Serb Assembly played in the
   process of socially constructing Bosniaks as ``Turks{''} during the
   period between October 1991 and December 1995. This process can be
   placed within the wider context of the genocidal policies pursued by
   agencies, institutions and organs under the sway of the assembly. The
   article argues that the assembly-both its individual members, and as an
   institution-played a central role not only in determining policies that
   ultimately led to genocide, but also in the process of
   reconceptualization of Bosniaks as cultural aliens whose very existence
   presented a mortal threat to the existence of the Serb people.},

Title = {Do young voters vote for young leaders?},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A growing body of literature shows that voters tend to vote for
   candidates who share their own sociodemographic profile. A key reason
   for this is because they believe those candidates are more likely to
   promote their preferences and interests. If political representation is
   important to voters, we might expect young voters to demand better
   descriptive representation by supporting younger politicians. Recent
   studies have found an age affinity for turnout and vote choice. However,
   none of these studies are comparative or focus on leaders. Using
   cross-national data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
   project, covering about 853,414 individual voters, 51 countries,126
   elections, and 639 unique leaders, I test the hypotheses that a leader
   is more popular among voters closer to them in age and that such voters
   are more likely to vote for them. I find some support for both
   hypotheses though the effects are very small.},

Abstract = {Research shows that ethnic identification increases on the eve of
   competitive elections in Africa, but does it do so at the expense of
   national solidarities? Do competitive elections exacerbate the negative
   expressions of strong ethnic attachments-coethnic favoritism, relative
   status concerns, and social distance to other groups? These questions
   are important because the latter attitudes and perceptions are linked to
   a host of ills in democracies. In this paper, I examine how the
   proximity and competitiveness of national elections influence ingroup
   favoritism, ethnic groups' status anxieties, perceived discrimination,
   and trust in Sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on six rounds of survey data
   for seventeen countries over 14 years, I find that national identities
   diminish in salience relative to ethnic ones as political competition
   increases, and that this is accompanied by heightened perceptions of
   ethnically-motivated discrimination, increased status anxieties, and
   lower levels of both inter-ethnic and generalized trust closer to
   nationally-competitive elections. Therefore, the electoral cycle
   strongly influences group anxieties in plural societies where political
   competition is high, and should be taken into account when designing
   measures to mitigate ethnic polarization in multi-ethnic states.},

Abstract = {What explains recurrent fluctuations in violence within militant groups?
   Temporal swings in the number of attacks perpetrated are common, but
   lack a general explanation. I provide evidence of cycles in attacks, and
   provide a theory of why organizational levels of violence vary serially.
   First, due to the contradictions of non-state violence, there exist,
   simultaneously, upward and downward pressures on its use. By
   ``contradictions,{''} I mean that violence is both beneficial and
   detrimental to an organization. It can secure public support and
   government concessions, but can also tarnish a group's reputation and
   invite retaliatory violence. Second, since the relative strength of each
   type of pressure (upward or downward) varies inversely with how much it
   is accommodated, organizations face disincentives to pause at high or
   low levels of violence. Groups that shift tactics to accommodate one
   pressure find they have activated another. For example, a group that
   curtails violent attacks to avoid government repression finds it lacks
   media attention. These pressures incentivize a reprise in violence,
   causing the up-and-down pattern to repeat. Finally, the cyclical pattern
   is reinforced by endogenous interactions between militants' political
   environments and their decision-making processes. I provide suggestive
   support for the arguments by examining the Basque group ETA.},

Abstract = {Recent work suggests personality affects the subjective psychological
   weight one attaches to an identity. This study extends prior findings
   showing a static effect on European identification in a single country
   by investigating whether a similar systematic relationship exists for a
   wider range of political-territorial identities (regional, national,
   supranational, and exclusively nationalist) across different country
   contexts (Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom) and over time
   (2012-2018). Original cross-national and panel survey data show that
   different traits predict both the type and degree of inclusivity of
   individuals' identity attachments. These results contribute to the
   growing scholarship surrounding personality's effects on EU support
   while underscoring the impact predispositions have on citizens'
   sociopolitical orientations. They especially illuminate the contrasting
   profiles associated with those who identify as exclusively nationalist
   versus supranational European.},

Abstract = {Strikes often lack a reasonable chance of success unless they violate
   some basic liberties (of contract, movement, etc.). This creates a
   dilemma for liberal democracies that recognize a right to strike: either
   the right is toothless, or the basic liberties do not have priority and
   so are not basic. Alex Gourevitch argues that grounding the radical
   right to strike in an interest in freedom resolves the dilemma. We point
   out an ambiguity in this solution: it either does not solve the dilemma,
   or it tacitly presupposes that there is no dilemma. However, we go on to
   show that a modified, dynamic conception of the radical right to strike
   can ground its priority, albeit at the expense of the basicness of
   certain static basic liberties. What is more, we argue that this
   generalizes to other forms of direct action, such as the recent Black
   Lives Matter blockades and those at Standing Rock.},

Abstract = {By extending the personalized presidency from the institution to the
   individual president while undercutting the bureaucracy's reliance on
   expertise and by attacking democratic norms and values, Donald Trump
   undermined both the executive as an institution and his own ability to
   govern. These elements of his presidential rhetoric are clarified with
   reference to Trump's relationships with the media, the executive branch,
   and the mass public, and are distilled in his handling of the global
   pandemic.},

Title = {Explanations of Institutional Change: Reflecting on a ``Missing
   Diagonal{''}},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Number = {1},
Pages = {218-233},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous research on institutional change has concentrated on two types
   of explanations. On one hand, the dualism of path dependency and
   critical junctures has advanced our understanding of how institutional
   change occurs due to sudden exogenous shocks. On the other hand, more
   recent critiques have established a better understanding of endogenous,
   gradual change. This article is motivated by observations that current
   research tends to overlook what I call the ``missing diagonal.{''} I
   argue that we need to disentangle the sources of a cause (exogenous vs.
   endogenous) from its time horizon (sudden vs. gradual). By
   cross-tabulating these two dimensions, the proposed typology of
   institutional change explanations is able to capture complex
   multilayered as well as sequential arguments of institutional change.
   The typology urges scholars to be more precise with their social science
   language of erosion and decay, while serving as a generator for an
   innovative research agenda on endogenous ruptures.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive research on international norms, our approach to
   measurement has not kept pace with theoretical advancements. Existing
   research often relies on single indicators to facilitate cross-national
   analysis or employs case-study designs that provide greater nuance but
   restricted scope. Given these limitations, this note argues that
   item-response theory (IRT) provides a framework for strengthening the
   link between our theoretical understanding of norms and empirical
   measurement of norm adoption. In turn, I develop a modified Bayesian
   model with substantively informed dynamic priors. The proposed approach
   is evaluated with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) equality norm,
   using 13 policies and laws across 196 countries (1990-2017). The results
   are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations while also
   providing new empirical evidence on the evolution of the norm across
   space and time. This note highlights the significant potential in
   greater interaction between both latent measurement approaches and
   scholarship on international norms.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Engaging a persistent puzzle on the decline in U.S turnout after 1896
   from which the nation never recovered, this paper tests the impact of
   strict registration laws and declining electoral competition on turnout.
   This study uses an original dataset on nineteenth century voter
   registration laws for 1880-1916. I estimate a panel model with state and
   year fixed effects to test the hypothesis that the shift in electoral
   behavior was a function of registration reforms and competition.
   Findings show that turnout dropped by as much as 6 points because of
   personal registration laws, whereas competition increased turnout by up
   to 10 points. I also analyzed two case studies at the county level. The
   results indicate that when registration laws became increasingly
   stringent with stricter identification requirements, turnout dropped by
   as much as 19 points. Findings suggest that electoral competition could
   mitigate the suppressive effects of strict voting laws on turnout.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how counterterrorism targeting terrorist leaders
   affects terrorist attacks. This effect is theoretically ambiguous and
   depends on whether terrorist groups are modeled as unitary actors or
   not. The paper exploits a natural experiment provided by strikes by
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) ``hitting{''} and ``missing{''}
   terrorist leaders in Pakistan. Results suggest that terrorist groups
   increase the number of attacks they commit after a drone ``hit{''} on
   their leader compared with after a ``miss.{''} This increase is
   statistically significant for 3 out of 6 months after a hit, when it
   ranges between 47.7\% and 70.3\%. Additional analysis of heterogenous
   effects across groups and leaders, and the impact of drone hits on the
   type of attack, terrorist group infighting, and splintering, suggest
   that principal-agent problems-(new) terrorist leaders struggling to
   control and discipline their operatives-account for these results better
   than alternative theoretical explanations.},

Abstract = {Social media giants stand accused of facilitating illegitimate
   interference with democratic political processes around the world. Part
   of this problem are malicious bots: automated fake accounts passing as
   humans. However, we lack a systematic understanding of which politicians
   benefit most from them. We tackle this question by leveraging a Twitter
   purge of malicious bots in July 2018 and a new dataset on Twitter
   activity by all members of national parliaments (MPs) in the EU in 2018.
   Since users had no influence on how and when Twitter purged millions of
   bots, it serves as an exogenous intervention to investigate whether some
   parties or politicians lost more followers. We find drops in follower
   counts concentrated among radical right politicians, in particular those
   with strong anti-EU discourse. This is the first set of empirical,
   causally identified evidence supporting the idea that the radical right
   benefits more from malicious bots than other party families.},

Abstract = {Identifying important policy outputs has long been of interest to
   political scientists. In this work, we propose a novel approach to the
   classification of policies. Instead of obtaining and aggregating expert
   evaluations of significance for a finite set of policy outputs, we use
   experts to identify a small set of significant outputs and then employ
   positive unlabeled (PU) learning to search for other similar examples in
   a large unlabeled set. We further propose to automate the first step by
   harvesting ``seed{''} sets of significant outputs from web data. We
   offer an application of the new approach by classifying over 9,000
   government regulations in the United Kingdom. The obtained estimates are
   successfully validated against human experts, by forecasting web
   citations, and with a construct validity test.},

Abstract = {The strategic communication of terrorist organisations and its influence
   on public discourse, particularly in the forced migrant context, is an
   under-researched area. This article argues that terrorist organisations
   have exploited their marketability in the radicalisation of public
   discourse. Their (non)discursive strategic communication has influenced
   public discourse, with impacts on policy and practice. Thirty-two
   interviews were conducted with civil society organisations and host
   communities, and complemented by eleven online refugee representations.
   In addition, the study drew from secondary case reviews of Al Shabaab
   and a former Islamist. The paper examines and presents key field
   research findings on the impact of strategic terrorist communication on
   refugees and host communities. Further, the paper highlights public
   representations of Islam(ism) and the disruptive character of Islamism
   brand management. The article additionally explores broader
   ramifications of terrorist communication on the concept of
   radicalisation. By examining the synergy between terrorist communication
   and the speech-acts of other actors, this article contends that besides
   being a useful concept, radicalisation is a social construct modelled by
   the perceptions, attitudes, opinions and actions of a coterie of actors.
   Overall, terrorist communication in rhetoric and action regulates public
   discourse that in turn inflames a reinforcing feedback loop of
   reciprocal radicalisation.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a theory that links issue salience and actor
   polarisation to the uses of learning heuristics in the policy process.
   In harking back to research on public policy, behavioural economics, and
   crisis management, we argue that policy makers use two learning
   heuristics when they update their policy ideas: policy-oriented learning
   and power-oriented learning. The article develops theoretical
   expectations that link issue salience and polarisation of actor
   constellations to policy-oriented and power-oriented learning. To
   illustrate the theoretical expectations, the article discusses EU
   anti-crisis policies dealing with the 2007-2009 global financial and
   economic crisis and its aftermath, as well as the responses to the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and the U.S. as pathway cases. Overall,
   this article contributes to the understanding of learning and the
   political uses of ideas in the policy process.},

Abstract = {Does the process of making a constitution affect the expansiveness of
   rights protections in the constitution? In particular, is more
   participation in constitution-making processes better for minority
   rights protections? While the process of constitution making and its
   impact on various outcomes have received significant attention, little
   is known about the impact public participation or deliberation in this
   process has on the scope and content of minority rights. Using a wide
   variety of data to empirically assess the relationship between
   constitution-making processes and the protection of rights for
   minorities, we find a positive relationship between participatory
   drafting processes and the inclusion of minority protections in
   constitutions under some conditions. The article's findings have
   important implications for understanding political representation and
   lend support to core arguments about the role of the public in
   constitutional design.},

Abstract = {Simulation methodology has moved toward using different types of
   real-world scenario-based learning constructs to improve applied
   understanding of political science concepts and theories. This type of
   active learning has become popular in the upper divisions of
   undergraduate and graduate political science. This reflection addresses
   the variance in approach to conducting simulations in federal and state
   general education courses at an open-enrollment community college.
   Defining the differences conducting these active learning assessments
   between two and four-year institutions enhances pedagogy at the two-year
   level and betters connection between these institutions and four-year
   counterparts. Students are assessed before the simulation and after to
   gauge progress and competency. At the conclusion, we offer views on how
   to design and implement simulations among a student population that is
   diverse academically and demographically.},

Pages = {333-355},
Abstract = {The concept of sovereignty and laicism still being instrumented into
   different projection to that's which have been conceived and used for
   through the french revolution and the old regime. This article is not to
   discuss that, but to delight how another concept deduced from it becomes
   antagonistic with it in the French context. Laicity referred to the
   French V constitution, or the act of 1905, it's not what it appear, and
   mostly known in the french literature, this article is to reject all
   that, and go toward an etymological construction of the concept into the
   french politics since XV century. Then to examination who and how the
   old regime, and the XIX century have been involved with the religious
   beliefs then to answer the questions: does the revolution have been laic
   or atheist? The answer is useful to go forward the examination of the
   french act of the separation of the State from the churches of 1905, and
   to determine if that act has been laic or atheist. The questions of how
   the idea of laicism has been reversed into the interwar period thus to
   the 1958 constitution to be developed in a further work, but the
   conclusion proposed here is the evidence of constitutional
   inter-contradiction and reversed usage of the concept which is being
   instrumented today further then a constitutional idolatry, but a
   constitutional nihilism.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the analyses of the impact of the
   Covid-19 on the global political economy. It does so through a
   qualitative content analysis of the key policy documents published by
   the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since the outbreak of the pandemic
   crisis. The IMF has been, historically, one of the main designers of
   international macroeconomic governance. The paper focuses on fiscal
   policy, which retains a central place in the strategy of the IMF to deal
   with the pandemic and especially for the post-pandemic recovery phase.
   The analysis of the documents of the IMF contributes (i) to appreciate
   the interpretation of the nature of the pandemic crisis through the
   lenses of a prominent international financial institution, (ii) to
   explore the policy strategy outlined to deal with the pandemic
   emergency, (iii) to assess possible changes at the level of policy, and
   accordingly, future directions in global political economy. Evidence
   suggests that fiscal stimulus, public investment and planning will
   likely have a prominent position in the future directions of the IMF
   policy advice.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Previous studies show that in multiparty systems the formation of
   minority governments can be a rational choice. To ensure survival and
   policy implementation, minority governments make concessions to
   non-cabinet parties. In this study, we empirically analyse the pay-offs
   given to support parties under minority governments. We argue that the
   content of support agreements is conditioned by support party type.
   Results are based on a two-stage empirical investigation: a text
   analysis of 10 explicit support arrangements for minority governments in
   Romania and a within-case comparison of two Romanian minority cabinets
   with different support arrangements. We employ an original data set of
   support agreements and elite interviews with former minority cabinet
   members. We empirically confirm that ethno-regional parties are mostly
   policy-seeking and target benefits for their specific groups. In
   contrast, mainstream parties make stronger claims for office
   distribution. The analysis challenges the widespread understanding that
   all support parties are mostly policy-seeking.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},

Number = {3},
Abstract = {Theoretical literature has two competing theories about the effects of
   corruption on society: the first group sees corruption as something that
   ``Greases the Wheels of{''} the administrative and economic systems of
   countries and the second group calls it something that ``Sands the
   Wheels{''} of those systems. This study examines the direct and indirect
   effects of corruption perceptions among Moroccan citizens on
   non-electoral participation using the fifth wave data of the Arab
   barometer, assuming the first group's ideas. The fifth wave of this data
   was obtained in 2018-2019 and surveyed 2400 Moroccan citizens. Testing
   the hypothesis through the SEM indicates that, first, corruption
   perception directly affects the citizens' negative evaluation of the
   government performance and increases the political distrust among
   citizens indirectly and significantly. Secondly, the results indicate
   that although perceptions of corruption by citizens do not directly have
   a significant effect on non-electoral participation, because all the
   mediating variables are significant, it can be argued that perceptions
   of corruption can have a positive impact on the expansion of
   non-electoral participation among citizens indirectly. It can happen
   through the variables of poor government performance and political
   distrust.},

Abstract = {During the economic crisis, the radical left, especially in countries of
   the European South, continued its course from marginality to mainstream
   while social democracy found itself trapped in its previous strategic
   orientations. This article examines the two political families in a
   relational and comparative perspective, focusing on the interaction of
   social democratic and radical left parties that evolved in a series of
   national cases (Greece, Portugal, Spain and France) and in particular
   within the political and electoral cycle of 2015-17. The ideological,
   programmatic and strategic responses of these parties to the critical
   juncture of the crisis, which mark a convergence or deviation in the
   paths of the two `enemy brothers', shed light on their political and
   ideological mutations, transformations and/or adaptations.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the conceptual and specific analysis of the
   emergence of the culture of legal techniques under the conditions of a
   new technological form. The identification and analysis of key types of
   culture of legal techniques, allows to show their specificity following
   typological groups. Its systemic unity, which has its specificities, can
   be considered as the second dominant of the culture of legal techniques.
   The article further offers a primary doctrinal definition of the concept
   of culture of legal techniques based on the identified dominant
   characteristics and manifestations of the culture of legal techniques,
   studied in the context of the search for ways of effective functioning
   of the system of power and powerless principles in the Russian legal
   system. This phenomenon is in the formation stage. The authors have used
   dialectical, historicalpolitical, formal-legal, and comparative-legal
   methods. It is concluded that a promising systematic understanding of
   the essence and meaning of the culture of legal techniques will help to
   improve the legal culture as a whole and thus increase the effectiveness
   of the law in modern society.},

Abstract = {In the Czech Republic, gender equality is an official policy goal, but

   policies of the 1990s. Women place a great deal of value on their
   education and careers, but the state does too little to improve
   conditions for their participation in business and politics.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},
Number = {133},
Pages = {29-54},
Abstract = {This article aims to explore how the Vichy regime offered an opportunity
   for some economists to revise their vision of the state in general and
   of its economic role in particular. This revision involved a reflection
   on their own position vis-a-vis the executive, especially by trying to
   underpin the economist's mission of expertise. This article will focus
   mainly on a small group of economists gathered around Francois Perroux
   (1903-1987), who was not only a notable intellectual figure in the
   regime, but also a leading scientific entrepreneur at the French
   Foundation for the Study of Human Problems. From this high position in
   the regime's scientific production, Perroux set up a Center for the
   Study and Theory of Economics in order to take the discipline a step
   forward-an experience that was indeed brief but that did continue in a
   new form after the Liberation. Focusing on Perroux's trajectory thus
   invites us to overcome the hypothesis of a ``Vichy parenthesis{''}
   regarding French economics.},

Abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, (im)mobility policies affected
   individuals' citizenship rights and movement within countries and across
   international borders. Prior to the pandemic, the mobility regime in
   South America was relatively open for regional migrants, bolstered on
   free residence and equal rights. In this analysis, we focus on human
   mobility and citizenship rights in South America by examining local and
   national government responses to Covid-19 between March and August 2020.
   Using databases, newspaper columns, government websites, and
   legislation, we outline the region's travel restrictions and exceptions,
   closures and militarization of borders, internal movement procedures,
   and economic subsidies to ease Covid-19's impact. While the regional
   mobility regime had already been under stress since 2015, exceptions to
   border closures and internal mobility further stratified people based on
   legal and economic statuses. Deeply affecting individual-state
   relations, access to mobility and citizenship rights such as labor,
   housing, and healthcare varied between nationals and non-nationals and
   between regular and irregular migrants. Reactions may have longer term
   effects, especially for Venezuelans, since the crisis created new
   inequalities and contradictions within the regional mobility regime,
   originally aimed at reducing them.},

Abstract = {Purpose is a constitutive element of torture under article 1 of the UN
   Convention Against Torture (UNCAT). It is increasingly and widely
   accepted as being the determinative aggravating factor differentiating
   between torture and forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or
   punishment (hereafter ``CIDTP{''} or ``ill-treatment{''}). Compared to
   the depth of discussion on other constitutive elements such as severity
   of pain and suffering and official capacity, the dimensions of purpose
   have remained relatively and unduly overlooked in scholarship on
   torture. As the significance of purpose as differentiator becomes
   increasingly established, there is a corresponding need to better
   understand its dimensions-particularly to question the rationale for
   having it mark an aggravation of state violence. This paper will draw
   and build upon the literature and jurisprudence pertaining to a
   functionality-oriented, teleological construction of torture, before
   situating the discussion in torture's broader ecology in order to
   critically examine and expand understandings of its purpose, bottom-up,
   situationally and institutionally.},

   federal/republican one. More specifically, this article will focus on
   Adat - norms of local customary law - in the traditional Chechen
   society. This study was developed in Karaganda (Kazakhstan) with the
   help of the data and information provided by the Chechen Veteran's
   Council in Kazakhstan and the vice-dean of the Law Faculty in Karaganda
   and it found out that conflicts can be addressed through the extension
   of existing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Does citizen approval of vote buying depend on the type of benefit being
   offered? I answer this question using data from a survey experiment
   conducted on a nationally representative sample of Nicaraguans in 2017.
   Nicaraguans report significantly lower approval of money-for votes
   exchanges compared to goods-for-votes exchanges. Furthermore, reported
   rates of vote buying are lower in the money condition (4.8\%) than in
   the goods-for-votes condition (7.8\%), even though the posttreatment
   question assessing vote buying experience was identical across
   conditions. This study echoes other work suggesting the need for care in
   designing questions about vote buying, as slight changes in question
   wording that prime participants to think about goods versus monetary
   exchanges can affect both citizen approval of the behavior and the
   reported prevalence of vote buying.},

   initially did not address the issue, right-wing populist actors claimed
   ownership by framing (presumably obligatory) mass immigration as a
   matter of social, cultural, economic, and not least political risk, and
   created an image of political and cultural elites conspiring to keep the
   issue out of the public sphere. Initially advanced via digital and
   social media, such frames resonated sufficiently strongly in civil
   society to politicize the GCM in various national public spheres. In
   this article, these dynamics are explored by comparing the
   politicization of the GCM in three EU member states, namely Germany,
   Austria, and Sweden. Using a process-tracing design, the article (a)
   identifies the key actors in the process, (b) analyzes how the issue
   emerged in social and other digital media and travelled from digital
   media into mainstream mass media discourse, and finally (c) draws
   comparative conclusions from the three analyzed cases. Particular
   emphasis is placed on the frames used by right-wing populist actors, how
   these frames resonated in the wider public sphere and thereby generated
   communicative power against the GCM, ultimately forcing the issue onto
   the agenda of national public spheres and political institutions.},

Title = {Planning: a glue for development coalitions? State actors' agency and

Abstract = {In this paper, I combine urban regime analysis and financialisation
   scholarships to uncover the role of planning and question the role of
   state actors in urban development processes. Through an analysis of
   CityLife in Milan and Tour and Taxis in Brussels, I argue that state
   actors have a strong agency in decision making as they own a critical
   resource: planning.
   My investigation reveals that, in projects characterised by uncertainty
   and internal conflicts, planning functions as a glue of development
   coalitions. Local governments mobilise it to bring together private and
   public interests, in order to achieve their agendas. Nevertheless, this
   glue function plays out differently in Milan and Brussels. While in
   Milan local administrations used planning to facilitate the anchoring of
   capital, in Brussels local governments enacted planning to shift the
   balance of power between them. This outcome reveals contextual
   differences that ultimately depend on local governance settings and
   planning systems.
   The comparison depicts the making of two different development regimes.
   CityLife indicates a financialised turn in governance, in which planning
   choices are driven mainly by economic - and financial - imperatives.
   Tour and Taxis symbolises an experimental entrepreneurial urban regime,
   a sort of ``laboratory{''} to test new governance and planning
   frameworks.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for
   backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument
   theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by
   measuring ``costs{''} exclusively through disapproval of a leader's
   handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately
   reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because
   Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such
   that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also
   argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We
   test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines
   approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the
   literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our
   secondary design allows us to alter the president's partisanship. The
   results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an
   important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for
   hypothetical leaders.},

Abstract = {Both the United Nations and the OSCE are working to improve their peace
   operations technologically. While the emphasis is more often placed on
   new collection tools (e.g., satellite imagery, UAVS, night-vision tools,
   etc.), the challenge remains to exploit the imagery and the copious
   other data that has been collected. By examining the software and
   evolving methods used by UN operations and the OSCE Special Monitoring
   Mission in Ukraine, we evaluate two often neglected steps of the
   information/intelligence cycle: analysis and dissemination. Lessons are
   drawn from both UN and OSCE experience in war-torn locations. Both
   organizations still need to establish strong and effective data-analysis
   and -sharing systems within their missions, and to find better ways to
   share information with the conflicting parties, and with humanitarian
   partners.},

Title = {Second chamber as a site of legislative intergovernmental relations: An
   African federation in comparative perspective},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {495-517},
Abstract = {South Africa, a country that does not recognize itself as a federation,
   has established a second chamber that is probably ideal for legislative
   intergovernmental relations. The National Council of Provinces is
   explicitly mandated to represent provincial interests. This is so both
   in terms of composition and the authority it enjoys in influencing
   national legislation. This article argues that the functioning of the
   second chamber tells a different story. The South African experience
   reveals that a properly designed second chamber may not deliver the
   desired result of facilitating legislative intergovernmental relations
   owing to internal operational rules that do not allow subnational
   governments to properly consider a bill, formulate a mandate that
   reflect subnational concerns and instruct their delegation to vote
   accordingly. Intergovernmental relations, as a result, continues to be
   the domain of the executive, denying the federation the benefit of an
   institution for intergovernmental relations that is open to public
   scrutiny.},

Abstract = {Subnational research (SNR) plays an increasingly prominent and important
   role in Comparative Politics. This article assesses the theoretical and
   methodological contributions of SNR. In particular it demonstrates the
   capacity of SNR to strengthen theory building by mitigating the problem
   of ``theory stretching{''} and shows its comparative advantage for
   crafting multilevel theories that provide stronger explanations of
   outcomes of interest. With regard to methods and research design, the
   article offers new research strategies and shows how SNR can be combined
   fruitfully with a diverse set of widely-used methodologies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the macro-micro dynamics linking party membership
   with protest participation. We theorise that institutional and
   extra-institutional engagement are mutually reinforcing and that party
   membership has a positive effect on party activism. We examine key
   ideational and structural factors identified in the literature to
   analyse the relative importance of various factors for party members'
   involvement. We look at micro-macro-level linkages by examining
   macro-level contextual variables as well as the extent to which these
   features mediate the individual-level effects. Our results suggest that
   party members support social movements for a variety of ideational and
   structural reasons but that strategic reasons are also important.
   Moreover, we find that contexts marked by more open political
   opportunities close the gap in social movement activism between party
   members and non-members suggesting that contexts with higher public
   spending as well as crises could be capitalised on to engage the wider
   public into political activism.},

   governments and gender inequalities. She was admired by both illustrious
   men and women of the time, becoming a role model who inscribed the New
   Woman ideal, proper of the Italian modern and progressist society of the

Abstract = {According to Hannah Arendt, the original matrix of totalitarianism is to
   be be identified in the contradictory logic feeding the nation-state. It
   is the relationship of tension between the universalistic value of the
   rule of law and democracy on the one hand, and a particularistic
   substance, based on the material character of a sense of belonging
   inspired by organic conceptions of the social bond, on the other. The
   thesis of the present article is that Hannah Arendt's reflections should
   not be limited to a tragic, but unrepeatable past. Contemporary
   sovereign and nationalist populism also tends to deny pluralism and
   political and identity differentiation. In the populist imagination,
   there is only room for a ``community of people{''} where relations
   between citizens are the expression of a prepolitical unity based on a
   sense of belonging inspired by organic conceptions of the social bond
   and which, in principle, therefore excludes every dissonant voice.},

Title = {Gender in the Climate-Conflict Nexus: ``Forgotten{''} Variables,
   Alternative Securities, and Hidden Power Dimensions},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {43-52},
Abstract = {The literature on the security implications of climate change, and in
   particular on potential climate-conflict linkages, is burgeoning. Up
   until now, gender considerations have only played a marginal role in
   this research area. This is despite growing awareness of intersections
   between protecting women's rights, building peace and security, and
   addressing environmental changes. This article advances the claim that
   adopting a gender perspective is integral for understanding the conflict
   implications of climate change. We substantiate this claim via three
   main points. First, gender is an essential, yet insufficiently
   considered intervening variable between climate change and conflict.
   Gender roles and identities as well as gendered power structures are
   important in facilitating or preventing climate-related conflicts.
   Second, climate change does affect armed conflicts and social unrest,
   but a gender perspective alters and expands the notion of what conflict
   can look like, and whose security is at stake. Such a perspective
   supports research inquiries that are grounded in everyday risks and that
   document alternative experiences of insecurity. Third,
   gender-differentiated vulnerabilities to both climate change and
   conflict stem from inequities within local power structures and
   socio-cultural norms and practices, including those related to social
   reproductive labor. Recognition of these power dynamics is key to
   understanding and promoting resilience to conflict and climate change.
   The overall lessons drawn for these three arguments is that gender
   concerns need to move center stage in future research and policy on
   climate change and conflicts.},

Abstract = {Despite the drastic reduction in the number of homicides in Medellin
   (from 6500 in 1991 to 591 in 2019) which has been categorized as social
   urbanism and internationally highlighted as a model, the other forms of
   crime do not relent. Violence intended for extortion is one of the most
   significant challenges to the development of cities besieged by mafias,
   such as Medellin. Relying on the empirical findings and intermediate
   analytical categories of three recent field investigations on urban
   extortion, this article introduces a conceptual perspective to identify
   how illicit and legal activities are amalgamated with each other, and
   with local dynamics. Violent protection, inherited from the
   confrontation of the Medellin drug cartel with the Colombian State, is
   strengthened by coercion intended for extortion. This systematic and
   widespread form of violence has allowed the amalgamation of the legal
   with the illegal in a growing number of social dimensions.},

Abstract = {Pakistan's geo-strategic location provides Beijing alternate routes for
   oil and gas supplies from the access to the energy-rich Persian Gulf
   region. In April 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and
   announced a US \$ 46 billion commitment to build a multifaceted network
   called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (the value of CPEC projects
   is worth the US \$ 87 billion as of 2020). CPEC project is the flagship
   of the One Belt, One Road initiative since it is a trunk passageway
   connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt in the north with the
   twenty-first century Maritime Silk Road in the south. CPEC is expected
   to further strengthen trade and economic cooperation in regional states.
   When the corridor is constructed, it will serve as a primary gateway for
   trade between China and the Middle East and Africa. This study revealed
   that CPEC has important impacts on the regional state's trade and energy
   security. It will create economic security for Pakistan more as compared
   to the energy and other issues.},

   world experience},
Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Abstract = {The development of digital technologies is forcing lawyers to analyze
   phenomena that have recently looked fantastic. This means that a
   phenomenon like smart contracts has ceased to be a theoretical idea of
   improving commodity monetary transactions and now needs a legal
   justification. In this article, we have analyzed smart contracts in
   terms of their belonging to digital technologies and the legal field,
   that is, how they can be equated with legal agreements, if they are
   their analogues, what application can it find given the legislation in
   the field of civil (contractual) law. The purpose of our study was to
   establish a link between smart contacts and their legal regulation, with
   the feature of smart contract implementation perspectives. The
   methodology used are systemic and formal-legal methods, as well as
   methods of analysis and synthesis. The results found highlight that a
   smart contract is a computer code that is entered into a blockchain
   network to execute a transaction, the usual expression of which is an
   agreement between the parties. From a legal point of view, smart
   contracts are only a part of ordinary agreements (contracts) under the
   practice of international and national law.},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that pocketbook considerations influence
   voting behavior in the United States and other developed countries and
   that incumbents can use targeted government benefits to win voter
   support. It remains unclear whether the general relationship between
   government spending and incumbent support also holds for means-tested
   welfare programs, however. I contribute to this empirical literature by
   taking advantage of the decade-long rollout of the American Food Stamp
   Program. The staggered timing of local program implementation allows me
   to credibly estimate the causal effect of this new benefit on election
   outcomes. Overall, I find that Democrats-at the center of the program's
   enacting coalition-gained votes when the program was implemented
   locally, apparently through mobilization of new supporters rather than
   the conversion of political opponents.},

Pages = {91-110},
Abstract = {The scaled post-electoral protests in Belarus raised a number of
   questions both in practice and in political theory. Was it just one more
   attempt at a ``color revolution{''}, or was I an outburst that can be
   logically explained in terms of internal contradictions and mistakes
   made by the authorities? Why did the level of political technologies
   used by the protesters, which was high, not affect the outcome of the
   Belarusian confrontation? Among the reasons for the latter, the author
   singles out the protest's failure at creating its own ``symbolic
   space{''} which could become a semantic and ``power{''} center, the
   failed attempts to split the ruling elite after which the enemy was
   declared as being ``the system as a whole{''}, and the negative concept
   of freedom adopted by the protest, which in fact goes back to Voltaire's
   tradition, within which freedom is ``something that was lost{''} when
   state emerged but not something that can be defined in a positive way.
   It is easy to see that within such a cognitive framework the enemy of
   freedom can be clearly identified (this being the state), but it is
   completely unclear what freedom is and how and at what point it can be
   obtained. The uncertainty of this concept quickly transformed into the
   certainty of nationalism, and the protest began to take shape as a
   ``confrontation of the new nation{''} with the ``obsolete state{''}. At
   the same time, there was not, and could not be, any positive program of
   ``tomorrow{''}. The state also suffered losses: ``pro-Belarusian{''}
   ideology (previously a synthesis of the concept of order and the concept
   of cultural nationalism) split, leaving the state with a ``naked{''}
   concept of order, while the protesters privatized nationalism. In
   addition, as part of the pragmatism of normalization in the West's
   direction after 2014, the Belarusian regime actually turned a blind eye
   to the loss of its own dominance in the information space. As a result,
   the struggle took the form of a confrontation between ``ideas without
   institutions versus institutions without a national idea{''}, i.e., the
   idea of a new nationalism and the idea of order. The latter turned out
   to be a win for the state and a loss for the protest: the protest idea
   eventually degraded to a simulacrum, the meaningful management of which
   is hardly possible. The author also questions how the ``reassembly{''}
   of the Belarusian political system can occur - it is supposed to start
   with the adoption of amendments to the constitution. The configuration
   of latter will most likely take the form of an increased role for
   parties, which runs the risk that the current confrontation may not be
   resolved but transformed, acquiring other forms. In this regard, Russia
   will have to add inter-party diplomacy to the institution of
   inter-parliamentary diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of peacebuilding highlight the importance of attending to
   people's local experiences of conflict and cooperation. This trend,
   however, raises the fundamental questions of how the local is and should
   be constituted and what the relationship is between institutions and
   individual actors of peace at the local level of politics. I turn to
   Hannah Arendt's thoughts to address these issues. Arendt's thinking
   provides a distinctive form of realism that calls for stable
   institutions but never depletes the spirit of resistance. Peacebuilding
   guided by this insight seeks to enable parties in conflict to voice
   their competing opinions by acting agonistically in public and to help
   them align their disruptive yet creative voices with a desire to
   establish and sustain common institutions. Thus, Arendt's thinking not
   only offers a way to increase sensitivity to local differences but also
   to provide direction to the politics of resistance. In the end, it
   offers a balanced insight into peacebuilding and local agency beyond the
   contemporary liberal and critical approaches to peace.},

Abstract = {The subject of this article is the relationship between state and church
   in post-Soviet countries. The authors claim that the term
   ``post-Soviet{''} is not a mere reflection of a chronological sequence,
   but is a concept with deep semantics. The nation states that came into
   being after the USSR collapsed in 1991 share a common institutional
   legacy. One of the manifestations of this legacy is their behavior in
   the religious field. The religious policies of the post-Soviet countries
   reveal significant similarities, despite the deep differences between
   the countries in terms of history and culture. In particular, the
   post-Soviet states belonging to the Islamic cultural realm demonstrate
   Soviet standards in their religious policy. However, the analytical
   identification of the ``post-Soviet model{''} of secularism is not to
   imply blindness to differences in the strategies of specific states in
   managing religion. Addressing these differences, the authors single out
   three basic types of post-Soviet secularism: ``authoritarian{''},
   ``neutral{''}, and ``ambivalent{''}.},

Abstract = {How do the costs of conflict influence public support for the use of
   force? Existing research finds that weapons that eliminate the
   possibility of military casualties, such as drones, increase popular
   support for engaging in conflict. We argue that this effect may be
   overstated because the choice of weapons technology is endogenous to
   conflict. Leaders may select to use drones in conflicts where the risk
   of harm to ground forces is especially high. To address this, we
   replicate and extend the research design of Walsh and Schulzke across
   three survey experiments. The key innovation in our experiments is that
   subjects are led to believe that the choice of attack type - drones or
   ground troops - is determined by weather conditions rather than
   strategic considerations. We find that support for military action does
   not differ across treatments in which subjects are told that the attack
   involves drone strikes or ground troops.},

   and the revolution},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {26},
Abstract = {Compagna, a four-page, four-column magazine, first appeared in Rome on 5
   March 1922. It was designed to be the platform of the central office of
   the Communist Party of Italy, a forum for use by women: workers,
   housewives, labourers and proletarians. It was, at least in the early
   days, a propaganda tool for the Communist revolution; it then, rather
   quickly, became a tool of anti-fascist resistance, before it ultimately
   disappeared. The editors were convinced that the transformation of the
   feminine condition was closely linked to that of the proletariat,
   following the example of the Russian Revolution. In this paper we will
   explore the contents of Compagna and analyse in greater detail the
   methods employed to educate women, sowing in them the seeds of
   revolution, as well as the idea of the connection between the resolution
   of the female problem and the victory of the proletariat. Our analysis
   will be limited to the period 1922-1925.},

Abstract = {Emotions are inseparable part of speeches of political leaders, however,
   they often continue to be omitted from discourse analysis, even though
   they can influence the political behaviour of citizens. The literature
   analysing emotions in discourse in speeches made by British leaders is
   still limited and this article attempts to fill this gap. It analyses
   the presence and evocation of emotions in 50 speeches in total delivered
   by the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, using the NVivo software
   for qualitative analysis. The article analyses speeches delivered
   between 9/11 and 2019 by Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and
   Theresa May. It finds that all of the analysed Prime Ministers use
   emotions in their speeches, both positive and negative. Even though each
   Prime Minister uses these emotions to a different extent, they all
   attempt to influence public opinion and gain support for
   counterterrorism policies. This demonstrates that Prime Ministers may be
   contributing to the problem by manipulating emotions and creating fear
   and hate in society.},

Abstract = {Spain is in the midst of a digital revolution. The quantitative effects
   of the digital revolution on employment remain highly uncertain,
   although we know that it will be important in the elimination of some
   ones, the creation of others and the transformation of many more. Based
   on the opinions of the protagonists in the current changes (experts,
   employers and trade unionists) and on the specialized literature, we
   have reviewed the main challenges that may affect Spain until 2025.
   Taking into account the country's weaknesses and strengths with regard
   to digitalization, we have assessed possible policies aimed to improve
   the quality and quantity of employment. To give more consistency to our
   analysis, we have studied the regulatory experiences of three European
   countries, Germany, France and United Kingdom, in the case of platform
   economies.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic brings about a new episode in the
   multi-layered political, economic and humanitarian crisis affecting
   Puerto Rico since 2006. The 14-years-long crisis has been marked by the
   U.S. and P.R. governments' imposition of a permanent state of exception
   to deal with an economic crisis, bankruptcy, hurricanes, swarms of
   earthquakes and a pandemic. This paper argues that uses of the state of
   exception and executive orders created a regime of permission for
   corruption, state-corporate crimes and human rights violations, while
   exacerbating the impact of the pandemic, and manufacturing the
   conditions for further disasters. The paper engages in a sociolegal
   analysis of the cases of corruption and state-corporate crimes in the
   procurement of COVID-19 test-kits and medical equipment, and the role of
   the pharmaceutical corporations in undermining PR's capacity to react to
   the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {On 29 September 1966, a large number of Ukrainians and Jews gathered at
   Babi Yar to commemorate the Jewish victims of the massacre of 1941. The
   communist party regime responded with repressive measures. Yet for those
   who took part, this demonstration of courage, humanity and dignity
   marked the beginning of a new relationship between Ukrainians and Jews.
   A public realm was created in which both groups were able to express
   their self-awareness. Jewish and Ukrainian thinkers realised that they
   shared a common fate. The speech given by Ivan Dziuba dedicated to the
   victims of Babi Yar had a strong impact on national Ukrainian thinking
   among dissidents and the diaspora for decades to come. And for many
   Jews, Babi Yar became a crystallisation point for their own national
   liberation movement.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the peculiarities of the application of legal
   liability for commercial contraband in accordance with the current
   legislation of Ukraine. In particular, the authors of the article
   investigate the feasibility of criminalization of the smuggling of a
   wide range of goods, and not only withdrawn from the circulation of
   things and forests, as recorded in the Criminal Code of Ukraine at this
   moment. In addition to a thorough analysis of the current legislation of
   Ukraine, the authors carried out a comparative analysis of Ukrainian
   legislation with the legislation of foreign countries, which helped to
   objectively assess the state of the studied issues in Ukraine. The
   methodology of the study includes general scientific methods, among
   which the methods of analysis and synthesis should be noted, as well as
   speciallegal methods, among which it is necessary to distinguish
   system-functional, and comparative methods. As a result of the study,
   the authors concluded that the criminalization of commercial smuggling
   (in connection with additional corruption risks and an increase in law
   enforcement agencies) is inappropriate. Thus, it is proposed to leave
   the current legislation of Ukraine in the investigational sphere in the
   current state and do not make any changes to it.},

Abstract = {Open science and open access to research data are important aspects of
   research policy in Austria. In the last years, the social sciences have
   seen the building of research infrastructures that generate data and
   archives that store data. Data standards have been established, several
   working groups exist and a number of activities aim to further develop
   various aspects of open science, open data and access to data. However,
   some barriers and challenges still exist in the practice of sharing
   research data. One aspect that should be emphasised and incentivised is
   the re-use of research data.},

Abstract = {It is considered important to rethink psychopolitics, the role it plays
   at the global level and how it affects the governance of Peru. If before
   it was used for scientific purposes and in disciplines such as
   sociology, education, psychology, among others, today, it transcended
   the political and the purposes have been reversed. The present study set
   out to analyze how psychopolitics is exercised in the Peruvian
   governance of the XXI century. A qualitative analysis was performed
   using the inductive method; For data collection, the technique of
   observation, documentary and bibliographic review was used. Three
   categories were analyzed: biopower, psychotechnology, and corruption in
   governance; For data validation, triangulation was used. It was
   concluded that psychopolitics is misused to increase corruption and
   normalize it; In other words, governance is hampered by corruption,
   therefore, it does not interact with the population and civil society
   organized in participatory democracy, because they are increasingly
   detached from politics with little or no citizen participation.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},

Pages = {283-301},
Abstract = {The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has tested the resilience of public
   institutions, already burdened by a deep and complex crisis (political,
   economic, managerial). This crisis has revealed a discrepancy between
   the needs expressed by the community and the solutions adopted to
   satisfy them. This has been accompanied by a progressive worsening of
   decision-making efficiency and weak implementation capacity in a context
   of increasing environmental uncertainty. It is in local institutions, in
   particular, that the greatest problems are revealed, because of many
   endemic negative factors: political fragmentation, reduced economic
   resources, new forms of poverty. Against the background of this
   scenario, our study aims to analyze the reaction of local institutions
   to the pandemic crisis by looking at both welfare and communication
   services. The objective is to identify key features in understanding the
   resilience of municipalities. In other words, their ability to react and
   adapt to change, which is essential not only to deal with emergencies,
   such as the pandemic, but also to make the institution itself
   sustainable. Our interest is focused on a specific dimension of the
   resilience of the municipalities, related to collaboration with the
   third sector. The pandemic has shown that the continuous activism of
   non-profit organizations has allowed for the continuation of many
   so-called ``ordinary{''} services, as well as the launch of several
   initiatives aimed at alleviating other social problems. The research
   has, first of all, an exploratory character that befits a new and still
   ongoing phenomenon. The basic questions concern the production of local
   welfare policies by municipalities. The data show different levels of
   ``interventism{''} and different modes of communication. On this latter
   point, we observe the presence of significant attention-seeking among
   Mayors as community builders able, on the one hand, to reinforce the
   spirit of solidarity and, on the other, to uphold respect for the rules.
   On the services side, three main models of response to the pandemic
   emerge, two of which refer to the public-private relationship in local
   welfare policies. Findings suggest that these different reactions will
   have consequences in the immediate future for the management of the
   pandemic crisis (still ongoing). Specifically, the tendency is to employ
   a management of services based on partnership-model, which means that
   public-private collaboration is a pillar of local welfare. This seems to
   entail a greater legitimacy for individuals or associations to
   participate in the formulation and implementation of policies.},

Title = {Contrasting Views of Citizens' Assemblies: Stakeholder Perceptions of
   Public Deliberation on Climate Change},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {76-86},
Abstract = {It has been argued that a `new climate politics' has emerged in recent
   years, in the wake of global climate change protest movements. One part
   of the new climate politics entails experimentation with citizen-centric
   input into policy development, via mechanisms of deliberative democracy
   such as citizens' assemblies. Yet relatively little is known about the
   motivations and aspirations of those commissioning climate assemblies or
   about general public perceptions of these institutions. Addressing these
   issues is important for increasing understanding of what these
   deliberative mechanisms represent in the context of climate change, how
   legitimate, credible and useful they are perceived to be by those
   involved, and whether they represent a radical way of doing politics
   differently or a more incremental change. This article addresses these
   gaps by presenting findings from mixed method research on prior
   expectations of the Devon Climate Assembly, proposed following the
   declaration of a climate emergency in 2019. The research compares and
   contrasts the views of those commissioning and administering the
   citizens' assembly, with those of the wider public. Findings indicate
   widespread support, yet also considerable risk and uncertainty
   associated with holding the assembly. Enabling input into policy of a
   broad array of public voices was seen as necessary for effective climate
   response, yet there was scepticism about the practical challenges
   involved in ensuring citizen representation, and about whether
   politicians, and society more generally, would embrace the `hard
   choices' required. The assembly was diversely represented as a means to
   unlock structural change, and as an instrumental tool to achieve
   behaviour change at scale. The Devon Climate Assembly appears to
   indicate `cautious experimentation' where democratic innovation is
   widely embraced yet carefully constrained, offering only a modest
   example of a `new climate politics,' with minimal challenges to the
   authority of existing institutions.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to consolidate the conceptual bases as analytical
   tools of a social research based on strong conceptions of language and
   action. This is carried out from the clarification of what can be
   understood as language and how this necessarily results in human action.
   Three fundamental components are developed for social research in this
   regard: beliefs, discourse, and behavior. Each of them is developed in a
   particular way, with examples of how they can be performed. The binding
   element of the whole proposal is the practical notion of reason, which
   not only specifies the conception of language presupposed, but also
   clarifies the scope of the research questions that are worth
   investigating in the field of social sciences.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {European Union gender equality policies have been increasingly
   interested in benchmarking and promoting higher representation of women
   in non-elected positions of power. While former Slovak government
   (2016-2020) achieved the highest proportion of women in ministerial
   positions as yet, according to EIGE's Gender Equality Index, Slovakia
   still occupies lower tiers of the index with respect to ``women in
   positions of power{''}. What is more, the available descriptive data
   does not answer questions concerning career trajectories and
   gender-based barriers, which may be experienced by women at Slovak
   ministries, let alone how these may be changing when the share of women
   in leading positions increases. The following study is inspired by the
   concepts of descriptive and substantial representation as it adopts the
   analytical approach of gender regimes in organizations to study formal
   and informal norms of gendered organizations. Results show that greater
   representation of women in leading positions moves the gender regime
   closer to one that favourable to women. However, the Slovak case study
   suggests, that even dominant or balanced representation of women in
   positions of power does not eliminate experiences with discrimination or
   gender stereotyping.},

Abstract = {The article bases and determines the principles of the formation of
   appropriate procedures for the provision of administrative services in
   the field of health care. The deductive methodology used ensures the
   formation of non-conflict statements on the principles built on European
   democratic values. The desirability of classifying these principles into
   three groups has been demonstrated according to the criterion of the
   limits of the formation of the fundamentals (principles) of regulation:
   general legal principles, regulatory principles of good governance.
   Improving existing legislation underpins the importance of taking into
   account the principle of legal certainty, which stipulates the need to
   avoid the priority of regulating procedures for the provision of
   administrative services in general and in the field of health, in
   particular through the use of statutes. It is concluded that the further
   development of e-government is proposed as one of the implementing
   directions of the European experience, as well as the experience of the
   United States and Great Britain in organizing the provision of
   administrative services in the field of health care.},

Abstract = {Research examining attitudes and behaviors of Americans during the
   COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on partisanship as a lens through
   which many Americans see the coronavirus. Given the importance of
   partisan affiliation and the degree of partisan polarization in the
   American society, that is certainly an important driver of public
   opinion, and a necessary one to understand. But an overlooked set of
   predispositions might also shape COVID beliefs and attitudes: populism.
   It is a worldview that pits average citizens against ``the elites{''}
   and, importantly in the context of a pandemic, it includes
   anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including
   scientists). We find that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs
   about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship. Furthermore, we find that
   conservative media consumption tends to be a stronger predictor of
   conspiracy belief among those high in populism than among those low in
   populism. We also show that these beliefs have consequences: those who
   believe the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are less likely to adapt
   behaviors recommended by public health officials.},

   OF SECESSIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {The collapse of two unions - the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia - has not
   only led to the need for a new world order to be formed and to the
   creation of more than two dozen UN member states, but also to the
   increase in the number of ethno-political conflicts by more than a
   dozen. Some of those that made attempts at secession have been joined to
   the metropolis through various tools, while the others maintained the
   status of a de facto state and are seeking to join the UN thereby
   becoming the states recognized by the international community and
   endowed with powers stemming from it. This process has been going on for
   nearly three decades, but for many this goal will not be achieved in the
   near future. Moreover, since the early 2000s, the intensified
   competition in forming a new world order has hardened the conflict
   resolution processes, since powerful countries try to use the conflict
   factor to influence the development of this competition. This not only
   impedes conflict resolution, but also complicates their study. Within
   studies of ethno-political conflicts and their resolution, it is
   especially important to assess the success of secessions, since this is
   directly linked to the purpose of that process. The assessment is often
   carried out through the method of comparative analysis. The article
   deals with both quantitative and qualitative models of such analysis. It
   demonstrates that although the problem is interdisciplinary, the legal
   component is sidelined in the analysis. To increase the effectiveness of
   such assessments, it is recommended to use a complex and
   interdisciplinary approach, conceptualizing the problem and its
   analysis, and taking into account all three components: legal,
   geopolitical, and ethno-cultural. In this case, the analysis will be
   carried out in two stages: a selection of comparable cases of secession,
   and an analysis of the necessary and sufficient variables.},

Title = {Scientific Knowledge Integration and the Implementation of the SDGs:
   Comparing Strategies of Sustainability Networks},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {164-175},
Abstract = {Although there is a broad agreement on the importance of scientific
   knowledge for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals,
   high levels of uncertainty and debate about what counts as knowledge
   challenge the use of research for political decision-making. Hence, the
   question arises, which strategies of scientific knowledge integration
   are adopted by science-based actor-networks that seek to enhance
   evidence in sustainability governance. In this article, I study the
   Sustainable Development Solution Network (SDSN) engaged in different
   institutional settings and policy fields. With a qualitative document
   analysis, I compare the overall structure, objectives, thematic focus,
   formal knowledge processes, and outputs of 22 national sub-networks of
   the global SDSN in order to elucidate how these initiatives integrate
   contested sustainability knowledge underpinning the implementation of
   the 2030 Agenda. My findings suggest that most SDSNs adopt
   solution-oriented knowledge integration strategies but also that
   networks in countries with better overall SDG performance tend to adopt
   assessment-oriented and learning-oriented strategies. In reflecting on
   these results in the context of the current literature on knowledge
   integration in sustainability governance, I argue that science-policy
   interfaces are shaped by the intentional and dynamic interactions of
   actors within their institutional setting and policy environment, and
   propose pathways for further research.},

Abstract = {Through a methodology of documentary and dialectical basis, in the
   article, the authors investigate the methodological foundations of the
   spatial development of the region, through the study of its content and
   conceptual instrument. In the same way, different points of view on the
   concept of ``region{''} are presented, the fundamental methodological
   elements of the formation and organization of the socio-economic
   development of the region are listed, characterizing the potential of
   natural resources and the socio-economic development of the municipal
   districts. Based on this information, the region's place in the social
   division of labor was determined, the development prospects of the
   districts were outlined, and the cause-and-effect relationships of the
   region's socioeconomic indicators were also established. By way of
   conclusion, everything indicates that the socio-economic development of
   the region under modern conditions is seen, in the first place, in
   self-sufficiency. Therefore, your accumulated potential must first be
   assessed to make a real assessment and then organize a search for the
   missing resources and funds. The use of a type of strategic management
   at all levels of management of the political system is the key to a
   balanced and successful development.},

Abstract = {In 2019, India made the unprecedented move of listing 1.9 million people
   in its northeast state of Assam as illegal migrants from Bangladesh in a
   new National Register of Citizens before passing the Citizenship
   (Amendment) Act, which overtly discriminates against the country's
   Muslim minority. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork, this paper
   investigates the reality of precarious citizenship under India's
   increasingly anti-migrant regime, particularly for Bengali-speaking
   Muslims. Going beyond the predominant notion that illegal migrants
   acquire documentary citizenship through fraudulent means after crossing
   the porous border between India and Bangladesh, this essay reveals a
   reverse scenario: those living with citizenship rights and in a regular
   social world are subjected to the gradual process of detection,
   detention and `deportability' in India. This paper employs the concept
   of precarious citizenship to unravel this complex and oscillating world
   of legality and illegality, citizenship and noncitizenship, and the
   predicaments of life as a Bengali-speaking Muslim in India.},

Abstract = {In 2018, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg began a school strike that
   quickly spread across the globe. After a ritual strike every Friday by
   school pupils to call for urgent action against climate change had gone
   on for several months, what had become Fridays for Future (FFF) called
   for various global days of action throughout 2019, bringing millions of
   people out onto the streets in the largest climate protests in world
   history. Drawing on unique protest survey data on FFF events across
   European cities in 2019, this article explores the structural bases of
   organized collective mobilization for climate justice. Nuancing
   narratives that focus on either the privileged background of climate
   justice protesters or the environmentalism of the poor, our results show
   the heterogeneity of the social composition of the protests, suggesting
   the need for cross-class alliances for mass mobilizations. Moreover, our
   analysis reveals that the social background of protesters shaped their
   attitudes regarding what institutions and approaches can be relied upon
   to tackle climate and environmental challenges. This suggests an
   important and under-studied connection between social background and the
   strategic choices of environmental movements.},

Title = {Electoral Responsiveness in Closed Autocracies: Evidence from Petitions
   in the former German Democratic Republic},

Abstract = {Contested elections are usually seen as precondition for constituent
   responsiveness. By contrast, I show that even uncontested elections can
   create incentives for autocratic regimes to address citizen demands. I
   propose that closed autocracies engage in cycles of responsiveness
   before uncontested elections to assure citizens of their competence and
   raise popular support. They do so to mitigate the short-term
   destabilizing effects of elections. Analyzing a unique dataset of
   petitions to the government of the former German Democratic Republic
   (GDR), I calculate that response times to petitions were up to 31\%
   shorter before the GDR's uncontested elections. Moreover, I introduce
   the concept of ``substantive responsiveness,{''} which focuses on the
   material consequences of responsiveness for petitioners, and show that
   petitions were 64\% more likely to be successful. The paper advances our
   understanding of electoral mobilization in closed regimes and
   contributes to an emerging research agenda on responsiveness and
   accountability in autocracies.},

Abstract = {In this article, we report findings of students' conceptions of values
   and impartiality in political science teaching in relation to research
   on epistemic beliefs. This field of research concerns students' beliefs
   about the nature of knowledge in different disciplines; beliefs that are
   central to learning disciplinary knowledge. Interviews were conducted
   with students after one semester of political science education,
   focusing on their experiences of values in teaching. Results show that
   students give contradicting answers regarding values and impartiality in
   political science teaching. They oscillate between different epistemic
   beliefs and they have an unclear understanding of the nature of
   knowledge in the discipline. Questions on the nature and limits of
   knowledge, therefore, need to be prioritized in political science
   education. If students are to become literate within their field, they
   need to become aware of the multiple epistemological underpinnings
   inherent in the discipline, and the ways these influence the discipline.},

Abstract = {The post-Soviet decades have brought about significant changes of the
   Russian social landscape. A countless number of civic initiatives
   engaged in charitable operation, legal assistance, education,
   environment, arts and culture, etc. have emerged across Russia.
   Self-help communities and effective crowd-funding for all kinds of
   purposes are evidence of public solidarity inconceivable in the Soviet
   state. The second half of the 2010s were marked by a rise in
   investigative reporting based on state-of-the-art data journalism and
   the rapid progress in social media. Apparently, the impressive rise in
   civil society has become a matter of growing concern for the Russian
   government, and in the past year, the Kremlin has stepped up
   persecutions of political activists and investigative media. This
   repressive surge is reminiscent of the events some four decades ago when
   the Soviet government undertook to radically eliminate the dissident
   movement. The activists of today may be different from the Soviet
   dissidents, but for now, they are just as defenseless vis-a-vis the
   state as the dissidents were.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to illuminate the interdependent relation and
   connectivity between state and regime known as the state-regime-nexus.
   To conceptualize the reciprocal institutional relation between state and
   regime and to deepen the understanding of the state-regime-nexus, I
   focus on law and legal order as one mutual linkage between state and
   regime in both democratic and autocratic regimes. To do so, this
   conceptual paper addresses two points that are part of the same topic:
   the relation between state, regime and law and different variants of
   legal order in democratic and autocratic regimes. This creates a
   theoretical basis to gain more conceptual and analytical clarity in the
   complex realm of the state-regime-nexus.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a post-Copenhagen approach to securitization theory
   in order to critically analyze the security policies developed by the
   People's Republic of China (PRC) that have targeted the Uyghur community
   in Xinjiang province. The article explores the relationship between the
   language of security and threat, which has been invoked by the PRC
   leadership, and its role in justifying every-day and exceptional
   security practices that have been enacted against the Uyghurs since the
   start of the 1990s. The article makes two important claims. First, the
   article argues that the securitization of the Uyghur has proved
   counter-productive, potentially creating the very security threat that
   the securitization of an issue is supposed to prevent. Second, the
   article suggests that the role of various audiences, both domestic and
   international, even in an authoritarian or illiberal state like China,
   play a key role in the securitization process and the legitimization of
   the security measures that have been enacted against the Uyghur
   community.},

Abstract = {The Spitzenkandidaten were meant to personalize European Parliament
   elections. This paper asks whether and through which channels the lead
   candidates were actually able to make themselves known among voters - a
   necessary precondition for any electoral effect. Combining panel surveys
   and online tracking data, the study explores candidate learning during
   the German 2019 European Parliament election campaign and relates
   learning to different types of news exposure, with a special focus on
   online news. The results show that learning was limited and unevenly
   distributed across candidates. However exposure to candidate-specific
   online news and most types of offline news helped to acquire knowledge.
   The findings imply that Spitzenkandidaten stick to voters' minds when
   they get exposed to them, but that exposure is infrequent in high-choice
   media environments.},

Abstract = {The paper explores mechanisms of transparency utilized by states to
   address security challenges caused by the development of autonomous
   weapons systems. The purpose of this paper is to answer whether
   transparency measures are able to ensure compliance with international
   humanitarian law in the context of autonomous weapons systems. The
   dogmatic and comparative methods were used to analyze the role of
   transparency in balancing international obligations with domestic
   interests. Because of domestic security, introducing new regulations on
   autonomous weapons systems is counter-productive. Transparency
   contributes to a better optimization of secrecy and information, while
   soft law, paradoxically, is better suited to widening common standards
   of conduct with weapon systems.},

Abstract = {How do involuntary interactions with authoritarian institutions shape
   political engagement? The policy feedback literature suggests that
   interactions with authoritarian policies undercut political
   participation. However, research in racial and ethnic politics offers
   reason to believe that these experiences may increase citizens'
   engagement. Drawing on group attachment and discrimination research, we
   argue that mobilization is contingent on individuals' political
   psychological state. Relative to their counterparts, individuals with a
   politicized group identity will display higher odds of political
   engagement when exposed to authoritarian institutions. To evaluate our
   theory, we draw on the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election
   Study to examine the experiences of Blacks, Latinos, and Asian
   Americans. For all subgroups and different types of institutions, we
   find that, for those with a politicized group identity, institutional
   contact is associated with higher odds of participation. Our research
   modifies the classic policy feedback framework, which neglects
   group-based narratives in the calculus of collective action.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces eight country-level datasets with >50,000
   observations that can be used to analyze novel comparative questions
   concerning party personnel strategies-how parties recruit candidates and
   allocate members across party, legislative, and cabinet positions. We
   make these datasets public to inspire comparative research, especially
   from an electoral systems perspective; electoral systems shape
   constituency representation and influence how parties recruit candidates
   and organize members in legislative and government bodies. In this
   paper, we first briefly review the relevant literature on electoral
   nomination and post-election appointment and then describe our
   motivations for constructing multi-country datasets that can be used to
   further comparative research. To illustrate the possibilities in these
   new datasets, we show how recruitment and placement of parliamentarians
   with particular personal characteristics correlates with their placement
   onto specific committees and cabinet posts. A conclusion identifies
   other areas of research that might benefit from using the party
   personnel datasets.},

Abstract = {Most authoritarian countries censor the press. As a response, many
   opposition and independent news outlets have found refuge on the
   Internet. Despite the global character of the Internet, news outlets are
   vulnerable to censorship in cyberspace. This study investigates
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on news websites in Venezuela and
   details how news reporting is related to DoS attacks in an attempt to
   censor content. For this empirical test, I monitored 19 Venezuelan news
   websites from November 2017 until June 2018 and continuously retrieved
   their content and status codes to infer DoS attacks. Statistical
   analyses show that news content correlates to DoS attacks. In the
   Venezuelan context, these news topics appear to be not only on protest
   and repression but also on opposition actors or other topics that
   question the legitimacy of the regime. By establishing these
   relationships, this study deepens our understanding of how modern
   technologies are used as censorship tools.},

Abstract = {How should social scientists measure institutional complexity? Formal
   (textually defined) institutional design-and particularly the complexity
   of formal institutions-is an important object of study across political
   science, law, and public administration. However, because of measurement
   constraints, existing work on formal institutional design focuses either
   on single policy areas or ``important{''} legislation, creating clear
   selection problems. In this article, I propose and validate a novel
   natural language processing approach designed to extract networks of
   institutional relationships from legal texts scalably. These
   ``implementing networks{''} offer a straightforward way to represent the
   institutional content of law and naturally suggest measures for
   quantities like institutional complexity. I then apply this method to
   measure institutional complexity in all American laws enacted from 1993
   to 2014. This approach reveals a surprising disconnect between partisan
   disagreement and institutional complexity among lower-profile
   legislation, which would have been difficult to detect without this
   approach.},

Abstract = {The literature suggests that the distributive allocations of local
   public goods help politicians secure support and thus contribute to
   political survival. We argue that the selective assignment of state-led
   infrastructure projects can bolster political control in peripheral
   areas by inducing the government's investment in essential
   administrative and security apparatus for project implementation and
   long-term state building. Drawing on a unique county-level dataset, we
   study the effects of poverty alleviation transfers in Xinjiang. We find
   that poverty alleviation was associated with significant increases in
   government spending on public management and security. In contrast,
   these alleviation transfers had a small and ambiguous effect on
   increasing agricultural production and reducing ethnic violence in the
   province. Our findings highlight the importance of comparing the
   capacity and welfare implications of distributive politics, as fiscal
   subsidies may change the actions of the leader's local agents more than
   altering the behaviors and attitudes of those who may benefit from these
   transfers.},

Abstract = {The American states offer a wealth of variation across time and space to
   understand the sources, dynamics, and consequences of public policy. As
   laboratories of socioeconomic and political differences, they enable
   both wide-scale assessments of change and studies of specific policy
   choices. To leverage this potential, we constructed and integrated a
   database of thousands of state-year variables for designing and
   executing social research: the Correlates of State Policy Project
   (CSPP). The database offers one-stop shopping for accurate and reliable
   data, allows researchers to assess the generalizability of the
   relationships they uncover, enables assessment of causal inferences, and
   connects state politics researchers to larger research communities. We
   demonstrate CSPP's use and breadth, as well as its limitations. Through
   an applied empirical approach familiar to the state politics literature,
   we show that researchers should remain attentive to regional variation
   in key variables and potential lack of within-state variation in
   independent and dependent variables of interest. By comparing commonly
   used model specifications, we demonstrate that results are highly
   sensitive to particular research design choices. Inferences drawn from
   state politics research largely depend on the nature of over time
   variation within and across states and the empirical leverage it may or
   may not provide.},

Abstract = {Does political repression extinguish public support for opposition
   demands? Protest emerges as a consequence of grievances and political
   preferences expressed as demands. Although the literature on the
   repression-dissent nexus has primarily focused on whether repression
   effectively deters dissenting behavior, a limitation is that researchers
   do not often distinguish between behavior and preferences. One possible
   implication is that although the observable protest behavior can be
   reduced by repression, underlying opposition demands may remain intact
   or even be strengthened. Hence, the question of why repression should
   alter public preferences remains theoretically under-investigated,
   because there is limited micro-level evidence that captures changes in
   opposition preferences induced by a repressive episode. We fielded
   comparable conjoint experiments before and after the enactment of the
   Hong Kong National Security Law in June 2020. Support for the demands
   was largely stable despite the sweeping powers of the law to curb
   protests, although some moderation of demands was observed. We outline
   avenues for future research on mechanisms and implications entailed by
   the effects of repression on preferences.},

Abstract = {Based on qualitative research conducted with women aged 60 and over, the
   paper presents a model of lived citizenship in older age. Four types of
   citizenship are proposed and analyzed, drawn from the women's
   everyday-life practices. The types incorporate the goals that drive
   daily action. Subsequently, our narrative analysis of the interviews
   examines the various forms of lived citizenship experienced by
   participants. The citizenship types reflect a variety of forms of social
   participation and affiliation with society. They also attest to the
   presence of social and gender inequalities that are still present and
   embedded in citizenship. Furthermore, the power relations, which
   generate a gap between dominant citizenship forms and more relational
   citizenship forms, need to be deconstructed to capture the polyphonic
   voices that help to build lived citizenship in later life.},

Title = {Cultural apocalypse and capitalist realism, the debate around the end of
   the/a world},
Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2021},
Number = {15},
Month = {DEC-APR},
Abstract = {In Capitalist Realism, Fisher intervenes in the debate on the end of
   history starting from an interpretation of the apocalyptic fiction
   Children of Men as a symbol of the current sterility of culture to
   innovate. From there, Fisher deploys the notion of ``capitalist
   realism{''} as a synthesis of the colonization of the cultural
   imagination by economic reason in neoliberalism. In this way, he
   re-actualizes Jameson's dictum that, today, ``it is easier to imagine
   the end of the world than the end of capitalism{''}. In this essay, I
   propose to put Fisher's theory in dialogue with that of the
   anthropologist Ernesto de Martino, who in his last and unfinished
   project tried to explore in depth the characteristics of the apocalyptic
   ethos in which the West was already immersed. De Martino develops a
   theory of apocalypse as an anthropological trope in dialectical terms,
   constantly oscillating between the risk of a definitive collapse of the
   existing universe of meaning and its eschatological reintegration into a
   new cultural order. According to his thesis, culture mobilizes a
   cyclical temporality in which, unlike Fisher's, the future as a project
   does not play a central role. Instead, the anthropologist understands
   culture as an organizing ethos that established a functional and
   specific intersubjective space. In this sense, cultural apocalypse has
   more to do with the impulse of refunding a common space than with the
   enclosure of the historical continuum. My aim is to show how the
   contrasted and combined analysis of these two discourses serves to
   reconceptualize the cultural crisis from a new perspective, contributing
   to the long debate on the end of history as a crisis of the political
   imagination in which Fukuyama, Jameson, Fisher himself and, much
   earlier, Benjamin have participated.},

Abstract = {The idea of ending endless wars has become a catchphrase widely used by
   Republicans and Democrats alike. Yet, despite this supposedly
   bi-partisan cause in American contemporary politics, American leaders
   have continued to immerse the US in wars overseas. It is within this
   context that international efforts and the former Obama administration's
   wish to broker a peaceful deal with Iran must be understood. Instead of
   building upon the Obama administration's successes, President Trump
   focused on how to derail the accomplishments of his predecessor. Now,
   while addressing the US's role on the global stage, President Biden must
   recognize that it is the US's responsibility to mend what was damaged by
   his predecessor.},

Title = {Intermediary Liability in the EU Digital Common Market - from the
   E-Commerce Directive to the Digital Services Act},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The European Union is committed to its transition towards climate
   neutrality and digital leadership, and synergies to be created in the EU
   Digital Common Market provide ample opportunities to achieve these
   goals: While from an economic perspective, the maximisation of market
   opportunities and the creation of a globally competitive digital economy
   are desirable, the transition must be technologically and ecologically
   sustainable and additionally compatible with established EU consumer
   protection standards. The latter is especially relevant in terms of the
   liability of online intermediaries for digital services, taking into
   account the rapid transformation of the digital architecture and the
   emergence of new major digital platforms for sales and services. This
   chapter, which is based on the Bachelor thesis handed in by Sander Sagar
   and supervised by Thomas Hoffmann for graduation at TalTech Law School,
   Tallinn University of Technology, intends to elucidate how the
   transition towards a common digital market is legally established in
   practice using as an example the adoption of the intermediaries'
   liability regime to a digitalized environment from the E-Commerce
   Directive to the Digital Services Act.},

Title = {When voting turnout becomes contentious repertoire: how anti-ELAB
   protest overtook the District Council election in Hong Kong 2019},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Under what conditions can voting turnout be transformed into a
   contentious repertoire? Based on the two case studies of the Umbrella
   Movement and the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement in Hong
   Kong, I compare how movement actors used the electoral arena to leverage
   their causes. I propose a new relationship between street and electoral
   politics - short-term mobilization that turns voting turnout into a
   contentious repertoire. I posit three necessary scope conditions for
   movements to perceive this electoral strategy as viable: (1) protest
   cycle precedes and/or overlaps with the electoral period, (2) election
   perceived to be competitive, and (3) closing of political opportunity
   window for street mobilization. I further argue that the tactics
   movements pursue in the electoral arena is conditional on the
   relationship between movement actors and political elites, and regime
   type. In democratic regimes where parties and elections are
   institutionalized and less volatile, movements are on a more solid
   ground to invest in a long-term electoral strategy with existing
   parties. Contrarily, electoral competition in authoritarian regimes
   tends to skew toward incumbent's advantage. Movement activists and
   political elites may seek short-term strategic mobilizations focusing on
   the election at hand rather than a long-term plan. This argument
   illuminates the common ground between collective action and voting, and
   thus bridging the two sets of literature for further engagement, as
   recent movements such as the Black Lives Matter and the Sunrise Movement
   in the United States and Navalny's anti-Putin movement in Russia are
   mobilizing their supporters to take on the electoral arena.},

Abstract = {Democracy manifests itself in a range of ways and is an imperfect,
   dynamic struggle for collective decision-making. This article discusses
   the multifaceted processes of deliberative democratic praxis found in
   traditional Maori society. Central to decision-making in te ao Maori,
   hui provide formal and informal structures for deliberative democracy,
   precedent setting, learning, and transformation through consensus
   making, inclusive debate, and discussion across all levels of society.
   Rather than coercion and voting, rangatira relied on a complex mix of
   customary values and accomplished oratory skills to explore issues in
   family and community meetings and in public assemblies. Decisions made
   through inclusive deliberative processes practiced in hui established
   evident reasoning and responsibility for all community members to uphold
   the reached consensus. This article claims that practicing deliberative
   democracy as a fundamental way of life, learned through ongoing active
   and meaningful participation throughout childhood, improves the
   integrity of democratic decision-making.},

Abstract = {Elected members of parliament (MPs) are supposed to represent their
   constituents and, thus, to have an accurate perception of citizens'
   policy preferences. It is often assumed that direct democracy
   instruments, such as the popular initiative and the referendum, have a
   positive impact on MPs' perceptual accuracy. This study assesses whether
   direct democracy has the expected positive effect in Switzerland. It
   measures how accurately MPs perceive their constituents' opinions on a
   variety of policy proposals through a parallel survey of 97 national MPs
   and 4677 citizens. Empirical evidence shows that MPs perceive policy
   proposals that have been subjected to a direct democracy vote more
   accurately. Furthermore, MPs have a higher perceptual accuracy if the
   policy proposal submitted to a popular vote was conflictual with a
   narrow ballot outcome. Direct democracy thus fosters political
   representation as popular votes constitute an important source of
   information and sustain MPs' ability to accurately assess citizens'
   preferences.},

Abstract = {As Brexit becomes reality, concerns are growing over environmental
   degradation due to differences in environmental policies on both sides
   of the border. At the same time, post-conflict peace occupied by
   neoliberal ideas remains fragile. However, there is no research that
   explores the nexus between environmental cooperation and peacebuilding
   in the Irish context. To narrow this loophole, first, this essay engages
   with the theory of environmental peacebuilding and sheds light on the
   role of environmental cooperation as an instrument for peacebuilding in
   post-conflict societies. Then, it proposes three models for
   environmental peacebuilding that likely fit in the Irish context. While
   not singling out one most feasible model, the paper concludes that the
   island of Ireland already has institutional arrangements and resources
   to implement any of the proposed models. Building a sustainable peace
   requires an approach to not only facilitate good relationships between
   divided human communities, but also resolve the human-nature conflict.},

Abstract = {It is well-established that value framing can be a powerful rhetorical
   tool for politicians to influence voters' expectations of policies and
   muster support. The effects that such policy framing may have on
   people's reactions to subsequent policy information, however, remain
   largely unexplored. This paper addresses this question by investigating
   whether value framing of policy proposals can influence the aspects that
   people consider important when they receive (and evaluate) information
   regarding policy outcomes, as well as their satisfaction with them. A
   survey experiment (N = 2378) demonstrates that, when individuals have
   been exposed to information on outcomes, they sometimes consider the
   framed values more important than the actual policy measures. The
   experiment also indicates that value framing may sometimes influence
   satisfaction with the outcomes. However, these effects are in the
   positive rather than the hypothesized (negative) direction. Both effects
   primarily appear when the frames are charged with humanitarian values.
   Implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Prior research on individual-level drivers of protest has primarily
   focused on legal protest. However, less is known about what makes people
   engage in unlawful protest activities. Building upon previous literature
   on the collective action dilemma, socialization on violent and high-risk
   social movements, and political psychology, we expect that illegal
   protest frequency varies at different levels of authoritarianism. We
   explore the relationship between authoritarian values and illegal
   protest by analyzing a two-wave panel survey data gathered in the US.
   The results of cross-sectional, lagged, and autoregressive ordinary
   least squares (OLS) regression models show that when controlling for
   legal protest and other relevant variables in protest behavior,
   authoritarianism predicts illegal protest following an inverted U-shaped
   relationship. In other words, average levels of authoritarianism predict
   more frequent engagement in illegal protest, while this frequency
   decreases as approaching the poles of the authoritarianism scale.},

Abstract = {Gaslighting brings its victims to doubt the sources of their evidence.
   This article holds that political gaslighting, by leading citizens to
   hold beliefs disconnected from the available evidence, poses a
   distinctive threat to democratic politics. But holding ``audacious
   beliefs{''}-beliefs that are ahead of the evidence-can serve as a core
   ingredient for democratic movements. This creates a dilemma for
   citizens, who must choose between two kinds of evidential policies. How
   can they protect themselves from gaslighting without rendering
   themselves insusceptible to the mobilizing efforts central to democratic
   politics? Citizens, then, face a standing challenge: to remain open to
   the bully pulpit while vigilant against the gaslighter's epistemic
   bullying.},

Abstract = {I explore the concept of militant democracy in the context of what
   appear to be persistent threats to the democratic order. I begin with a
   reconstruction of the concept with the intention of distinguishing and
   identifying its historical manifestations. I trace and document two
   constitutional devices that exhibit the pre-emption and illiberalism
   that characterizes militant democracy. The first device-party
   restrictions-is the prototypical example of the concept and is designed
   to pre-empt extremist intimidation. The second example-hardened term
   limits-is designed to pre-empt executive ambition. The latter form of
   bullying may be the most relevant threat, at least in modern Latin
   America and Africa. In one view, term-limit evasion accelerates a
   pernicious negative cycle in which constitutional non-compliance begets
   constitutional weakness, which in turn begets subsequent non-compliance.
   Such a negative feedback loop is a core problem in law. Militant
   democracy, the logic of which implies the entrenchment and protection of
   term limits, could potentially disrupt such negative cycles. The concept
   could also be useful as an intellectual defense of seemingly
   non-democratic means of protecting democracy.},

Abstract = {We characterize, more precisely than before, what Rawls calls the
   `analytical' method of drawing up a list of basic liberties. This method
   employs one or more general conditions that, under any just social order
   whatever, putative entitlements must meet for them to be among the basic
   liberties encompassed, within some just social order, by Rawls's first
   principle of justice (i.e. the liberty principle). We argue that the
   general conditions that feature in Rawls's own account of the analytical
   method, which employ the notion of necessity, are too stringent. They
   ultimately fail to deliver as basic certain particular liberties that
   should be encompassed within any fully adequate scheme of liberties. To
   address this under-generation problem, we provide an amended general
   condition. This replaces Rawls's necessity condition with a
   probabilistic condition and it appeals to the standard liberal
   prohibition on arbitrary coercion by the state. We defend our new
   approach both as apt to feature in applications of the analytical method
   and as adequately grounded in justice as fairness as Rawls articulates
   the theory's fundamental ideas.},

Title = {The representation of business interests during the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Spain},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2021},
Number = {57},

Abstract = {This article explains the representation of business interest during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The article describes how business interests get into
   the policy process across policy areas and political venues. Following
   previous studies (Dur and Mateo, 2016), the article argues the COVID-19
   pandemic did not alter business groups' position in the policymaking
   process. Business groups occupy a predominant role in the discussion of
   policy proposals vis-a-vis other types of groups during the COVID-19 in
   the governmental arena, and this is especially the case for economy
   related policies and agriculture affairs. In contrast, business groups
   occupy a secondary role in the parliamentary arena, especially for
   non-economic issues. The article also explains which business
   associations represent business interest during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   The empirical strategy relies on two datasets developed by the Quality
   of Democ-racy Research Group (www.q-dem.com) containing information
   about interest groups' mobi-lization in the Spanish Congress of Deputies
   and the Spanish government from March 2020 to March 2021.},

Abstract = {Historically, liberalism has tried to justify a separation between those
   dimensions of life that must fall within the domain of the public from
   those that must be considered private in order to preserve individual
   freedom in a context of reasonable pluralism. In this framework, the
   concept of public culture fulfills the function of articulating this
   dichotomy and defining its limits. This article analyzes this concept
   and aspires to two objectives. The first is to analyze the scope and
   ethical implications that this concept has in the thinking of Rawls and
   Nussbaum. The second is to present a series of criticisms of the ethical
   implications of Nussbaum's proposal.},

Abstract = {As far as we know, in the only writing that Horatio Gonzalez explicitly
   dedicated to the philosophy of Spinoza, he detects in a motif of the
   Theological-Political Treatise, in the biblical reading of Spinoza, an
   ambivalence of great fruitfulness for a thought of the popular, not
   exempt from baroque connotations around mathematics, poetry and madness.
   This is a text included in a collective book that gathers the
   interventions that took place in a meeting organized by Gonzalez himself
   at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires in
   1999. The present paper takes as its object this brief writing, and
   compares it with the question of the baroque in Spinoza, taking
   especially into account the study developed by Marilena Chaui at the
   beginning of The Rib of the Real: Immanence and Freedom in Spinoza.},

Title = {Austria and the Global Compact on Migration: the `populist
   securitization' of foreign policy},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {760-778},

Abstract = {Bridging arguments between securitization theory and populist
   communication, this article shifts attention to the strategy of
   `populist securitization'. It argues that populist parties may seek to
   `securitize' international political issues for the purpose of domestic
   political mobilization. Empirically, it demonstrates the relevance of
   populist securitization for the case of Austria's foreign policy on the
   Global Compact on Migration during the coalition government (2017-2019)
   between the populist radical right Freedom Party (FPo) and the
   conservative People's Party (oVP). The case study of the GCM elucidates
   the active interest populist parties like the FPo take in shaping
   foreign policy decisions that are close to their domestic political
   agenda. If successful, populist securitization can have a profound and
   sustained impact on the public perceptions of foreign policy issues and
   can create a sense of urgency about the need for an appropriate foreign
   policy response. In doing so, foreign policy becomes part of the game of
   domestic politics that can affect foreign policy decisions.},

Abstract = {It is common for combatants to deliberately force civilians to flee
   their homes, resulting in incalculable loss for millions around the
   world. Existing accounts suggest combatants displace civilians whom they
   suspect are loyal to their opponents. And yet violence is also
   frequently motivated by local actors taking advantage of war to pursue
   private interests unrelated to wartime loyalties. However, little
   evidence exists of these dynamics with respect to displacement. Drawing
   on theories of opportunistic violence, I test an account in which surges
   in demand for land create incentives for elites to prey on peasants for
   their land. Combining new municipal and survey data from the Colombian
   armed conflict, I find evidence that the expansion of a land-intensive
   industry-African palm oil-precipitated opportunistic displacement by
   elites and paramilitary allies. The results demonstrate how elites can
   take advantage of war to engage in private accumulation and have
   implications for transitional justice policy.},

Abstract = {How can governments implement foreign economic policies that are popular
   among political elites but unpopular among their voters? Studying
   international financial rescues, we argue that governments strategically
   frame policies in an attempt to minimize their expected political costs,
   which increases their ability to implement those policies successfully.
   We theorize that framing strategies allow governments to offer financial
   bailouts, and we test the resulting hypotheses using an integrative
   mixed-methods approach. We trace the underlying causal mechanism of our
   argument with a typical case study of the U.S. bailout of Mexico during
   the 1995 peso crisis, test whether a credible threat of migration
   increases the likelihood of bailouts using an original data set of
   bailouts by 36 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   (OECD) countries to 108 crisis countries over a span of 40 years and
   analyze a central assumption of our theory with a survey experiment on
   over 3,000 U.S. residents.},

Title = {Lock them up! Punitive aggression and populism as political vigilantism},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Populist leaders and movements are incredibly diverse, but one factor
   that most share is the tendency to pick fights. Populists often stir up
   conflict and use aggressive rhetoric that would destroy the reputation
   of mainstream politicos. Furthermore, many of these fights have little
   material benefit for base-level supporters, and often actively harm
   them. Yet populist militants generally reward combative behavior. Why is
   populism so conflict prone? And why do populists so often escape
   negative consequences for provoking damaging dustups? I argue that these
   sorts of conflict are driven by an emotional impulse that lies at the
   heart of populism: punitive aggression. Populists view political
   problems as the result of malign actions by hostile outgroups, and they
   perceive the state as either negligently allowing or actively abetting
   these actions. The failure of the state to punish the guilty breeds an
   intense and deep-seated desire to harm those seen as violating norms and
   values, regardless of the cost. Observational and experimental data are
   consistent with the hypothesis that, while the never-ending conflict
   typical of populism may harm its adherents' interests, it continues
   because it satisfies much more basic emotional and psychological needs.
   This paper suggests that confronting and challenging populists may be
   difficult because forceful responses will reinforce the bond between the
   leader and his or her followers.},

Abstract = {As experiential learning becomes more central to undergraduate
   education, we must find ways to use it in large classes and to teach
   students how to learn from experiences. This article uses a 2-year study
   of student perceptions of learning from short, in-class games and
   simulations to show that these active learning activities can be used to
   prepare students for experiential learning opportunities like
   internships, and exchanges. In short reflections, students are most
   likely to discuss their emotions, and in longer reflections, they are
   most likely to discuss learning theoretical concepts but also introduce
   discussions of career skills and skills they will need to make the most
   of experiential learning activities. The analysis also shows the various
   ways in which students discuss how they learn from games and
   simulations, with different assignments prompting discussions on
   theoretical concepts, emotions, career skills, and the connections
   between these, as well as reflections on how they learn from games of
   simulations. It demonstrates that students appreciate the value of games
   and simulations and learn how to write about experiential learning, both
   important objectives for scaffolding experiential learning in
   lower-division classes.},

Abstract = {Few denials of tolerance are more severe than rejection of the moral
   worth of another's way of life. In the U.S. today, many traditional
   religious believers, especially fundamentalist Christians, and many
   LGBQT+ persons see each other's ways of life as deeply evil in important
   respects. These gulfs probably cannot be bridged; but public policies
   can and should seek to accommodate all claims of conscience as far as
   this can be done without denying anyone meaningful possession of basic
   rights. By placing religious and moral consciences equally in a
   constitutionally ``preferred position,{''} governments can foster a
   wider sense that citizens are engaged in a shared enterprise of helping
   everyone to pursue their distinctive forms of happiness.},

Abstract = {How can political science classes best prepare undergraduate students
   for the field of peace and conflict studies (PACS)? We argue that
   well-designed experiential learning activities provide opportunities for
   students to embrace complexity and practice adaptability, fusing the
   theoretical and practical in ways that prepare them to engage in PACS.
   This article presents one such experiential learning approach: a
   conflict analysis activity. Through engaging in a messy learning
   process, students (1) gain an increased theoretical understanding of the
   complexity of conflict, (2) practice adaptability, and (3) increase
   their self-efficacy. We provide a step-by-step description of the
   Conflict Analysis Tool exercise and reflect on how well the activity
   enables the use of knowledge and skills relevant for PACS. Our goal is
   that the insights gained through our approach will be helpful to other
   educators-from PACS to international relations to American politics and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {How does state surveillance influence citizens' willingness to express
   political and social opinions? This article theorizes about different
   citizen responses to surveillance that fall on what we term the
   evasion-deception spectrum, including preference falsification,
   self-censorship, and opting out. We present the results from an
   empirical exploration of these responses, drawing on an online survey
   experiment conducted in Japan. In our survey, we use a novel
   experimental stimulus to assess whether individuals engage in different
   forms of evasion and deception when plausibly under government
   surveillance. The study finds that citizens are substantially more
   likely to opt out of sharing their opinions (by exiting a survey) when
   reminded of their government's capacity for monitoring. This occurs even
   despite implying a monetary cost (forfeiting payment for the survey) and
   in a fully consolidated democracy, where freedoms of speech and opinion
   are legally codified. We conclude by discussing the implications of this
   finding for democratic deliberation and citizen-state relations.},

Abstract = {Do Americans overestimate economic mobility? Using representative
   surveys of the public and local government officials, we assess claims
   of widespread misperceptions about economic mobility by measuring the
   accuracy of participants' perceptions of both relative and absolute
   mobility. Republican members of the public and government officials are
   more optimistic than are Democrats about poor children's chances of
   reaching the highest income quintile (relative mobility) and earning
   more than their parents (absolute mobility). Democrats also rate race
   and family wealth as more important to children's chances than do
   Republicans. However, partisan tendencies to overestimate or
   underestimate mobility are roughly symmetric despite differences in
   optimism; we only observe small and inconsistent differences in belief
   accuracy by party for both the public and local officials. Finally,
   accuracy is no greater for perceptions of state and local mobility than
   at the national level.},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Risk carries unique significance for democratic politics today as it
   faces the challenges of rising inequality, neoliberalism, and systemic
   racism. To show how, the article divides ``risk{''} into two
   complementary political models: a technocratic logic of risk allocation,
   concerned primarily with safety, and a forensic logic of risk
   attribution, concerned with holding risk takers to account. Both have
   had pervasive effects on a transformed welfare state, increasingly
   focused on ``personal responsibility{''} and privatized risk-management.
   But risk has also played a key role in the way post-1968 movements have
   organized and challenged the logic of privatization. Risk-based
   movements, the article argues, especially from the political margins,
   are key agents in promoting a new political form founded on risk
   attribution. The article focuses on the exemplary case of the American
   environmental justice movement in the 1980s-90s as it reframed social
   justice around three core demands: accountability from decision makers,
   equitable risk distribution, and broad participation in decisions about
   danger and communities' well-being.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated digital
   transformations in all spheres of public and private life, providing a
   strong incentive also for parliaments to adopt digital and remote
   working methods. The entry of the virtual paradigm into parliamentary
   work is part of a scenario already marked by a crisis of the traditional
   political representation model, also as a consequence of the
   disintermediation phenomena induced by the digital revolution. This
   article aims at investigating some conceptual links between the crisis
   of parliamentary representation and the digital transition and at
   analysing pros and cons of virtual/hybrid parliamentary proceedings and
   investigating with a non-empirical approach some potential systemic
   effects that could derive from maintaining them even after the current
   pandemic is over. Finally, the article suggests that the virtual
   challenge could encourage the evolution of parliaments towards new
   hybrid and network-based representation models which might help in
   providing a new centrality to legislatures in 21st century democratic
   systems.},

Abstract = {This article explores the differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
   on the productivity of male and female academics and whether the ongoing
   health crisis will exacerbate further the existing gender gap in
   academia in both the short and long terms. We present early evidence of
   the pandemic's disproportionate effect on women's research productivity
   using online survey data supplemented by interview data with regional
   and international female political scientists. The interviews and survey
   findings reveal gender disparities in perceived research productivity
   and service workloads during the pandemic. The results also shed initial
   light on the pandemic's impact on the research productivity of academics
   who are parents, especially among women.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The media's ability to freely gather and disseminate information remains
   a critical aspect of democracy. Studies link media freedom to other
   concepts including human rights, corruption, democratic peace and
   conflict, natural resource wealth, political knowledge and foreign aid.
   However, media freedom's many facets make it difficult for any single
   index to fully capture. To develop a more robust measure, this article
   treats media freedom as a latent variable and analyzes ten extant
   indicators by fitting an item response theory model. Utilizing a
   Bayesian approach, the model generates time-series, cross-sectional data
   on a bounded, unidimensional scale from 0 to 1 that measures media
   freedom in 197 countries from 1948 to 2017. After numerous validity
   checks, the authors utilize their new Media System Freedom data to
   replicate Egorov, Guriev and Sonin's (2009) analysis of media freedom
   and natural resource wealth. The findings indicate that the published
   results do not hold once the more robust measure is included.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis highlighted issues of trust in government and
   experts, as citizens were asked to accept restrictions on liberties in
   order to slow the spread of the virus. Based on a survey of 1992
   Australians conducted in May 2020, this paper reports on the attitudes
   of Australians toward the responses of their State and Federal
   governments to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, we found support for
   government responses differed with partisan alignment. However, when we
   controlled for values differences, we found that values predicted social
   distancing attitudes and behaviour. This oppugns the common conclusion
   in political psychology that party alignment is a proxy for values.
   Scientists were trusted more than political institutions or actors for
   accurate COVID-19 information, and likewise, traditional media were
   preferred to online sources. These findings have implications for policy
   communication when individual action is required to address collective
   goals.},

Abstract = {Inclusion is a central tenet in deliberative democratic theory and an
   important indicator of the quality of a deliberative mini-public (DMP).
   Empirical measures of deliberation assess the quality of a deliberative
   exchange according to criteria drawn from deliberative theory; the
   discourse quality index is one well-known example. Despite the
   importance of inclusion in deliberative theory, existing measures do not
   account for this aspect of deliberative quality. This paper introduces
   and uses a measure for assessing the inclusiveness of deliberation
   called ``deliberative uptake{''}. This paper describes the new measure
   and applies it to the case of Ireland's Convention on the Constitution,
   a forum in which both citizens and politicians were included as members.
   The results suggest that politician members were more likely to receive
   deliberative uptake for their ideas than their citizen counterparts. In
   addition, women and men received similar levels of deliberative uptake
   throughout the Convention.},

Abstract = {The international community invests heavily in democracy promotion, but

   leaders as either truly reform minded or pseudo-reformers, those who
   increase electoral system proportionality in order to receive
   international community benefits while engaging in electoral fraud. We
   hypothesize that the international community will be more (less) likely
   to detect fraud when leaders decrease (increase) proportionality,
   regardless of whether there is evidence of numerical fraud. Using a
   mixed-methods approach with cross-national and case study data from
   post-Communist states, we find that the international community is
   generally less likely to detect fraud following an increase in
   proportionality and vice versa. We suggest that democracy promoters
   over-reward perceived democratic progress such that pseudo-reformers
   often benefit.},

Title = {The Effect of Core Values on Support for Electoral Reform: Evidence from
   Two Survey Experiments},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {239-256},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A central tenet in the electoral systems subfield is that parties seek
   desired outcomes via the strategic adoption of electoral rules. Such
   partisan self-interest, however, is merely one explanation for reform: A
   second is that an actor may attempt to maximize her core values, which
   constitute her perception of the ``common good.{''} Although the extant
   literature has demonstrated the motivational power of core values, their
   effect on electoral rule choice has not been tested. Using a factorial
   experimental design that manipulates the partisan- and
   values-implications of a fictitious reform proposal, I find evidence in
   favor of core values: Not only do they have an effect net of partisan
   concerns, but they also attenuate the effect of partisan self-interest
   when the two predispositions countervail. The results provide evidence
   that partisan self-interest offers an incomplete picture: Actors
   hold-and pursue through electoral reform-objectives that are not
   immediately partisan in nature.},
