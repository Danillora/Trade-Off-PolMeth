Abstract = {Bernard Yack's The Longing for Total Revolution is not just an important
   study of an extremely influential strain of post-Kantian philosophy,
   which according to Yack culminated in both Marx and Nietzsche. It also
   exemplifies an unusual approach to the history of thought: a form of
   critical genealogy that, unlike the Nietzschean and Foucauldian
   variants, seeks intellectual charity by ascribing mistaken ideas not to
   non-ideational psychological or social sources, but to a web of beliefs
   that would have obscured from fully rational historical actors the
   mistakenness of the idea being genealogized. This approach to
   intellectual history can justify the history of thought on logical
   grounds that are unavailable to those who attempt to justify it on the
   basis of the inherent interest of the past or the usefulness of
   intellectual history in providing resources for present-day use.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Around the world, young activists are demanding stronger action from
   governments to address the climate emergency and to ensure
   intergenerational climate justice. An emerging strategy in this fight
   has been the use of litigation, particularly within human rights
   frameworks. This article analyses two current human rights-based climate
   cases brought by children and young people, Sacchi et al. v Argentina,
   Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey, a petition to the Committee on the
   Rights of the Child, and Duarte Agostinho \& Ors v Portugal \& Ors, a
   case pending before the European Court of Human Rights. It argues that
   these cases have the potential to advance the frontiers of both
   children's rights and environmental rights, as they offer an opportunity
   for human rights bodies to clarify a number of issues relevant to
   rights-based approaches to climate change. The cases also show the
   potential of climate litigation to empower young people and elevate
   their voices within climate decision-making.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies affect the lives of children and the rights that
   are specifically attributed to them by the United Nations Convention on
   the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), article 24 of the EU Charter of
   Fundamental Rights and many national constitutions. There is no doubt
   that the digital environment has enormous potential for the empowerment
   of children and their exercise of the UNCRC rights. Yet, children (and
   their parents) are expected to make difficult decisions about whether or
   not or how to use platforms, devices and services that function in
   complex and opaque manners and whose impact on the rights of the child
   are difficult to grasp. This is especially the case for data- and
   advertising-driven practices that intentionally deceive or manipulate
   children or that are based on pervasive tracking and inferences about
   children's behaviour, attention and emotions. Based on a legal study of
   the UNCRC, legislation and policy documents at UN, Council of Europe and
   European Union level, and scholarship, this article studies the extent
   to which duties and responsibilities rest on policymakers, platforms and
   service providers and regulators to uphold the best interests of the
   child as a primary consideration (Article 3 (1) UNCRC) and what this
   means for the digital spaces in which children grow up. In particular,
   the article explores how the application of the precautionary principle
   might better serve the best interests of the child and how this might
   require legal restrictions on certain practices, enhanced
   responsibilities for public and private actors, and stronger enforcement
   by regulators.},

Abstract = {Candidate characteristics have an important impact on voter choice, and
   scandals are found to negatively impact a political campaign. Yet the
   literature, with its focus on scandals such as financial and
   (consensual) affairs, has failed to look into how allegations of sexual
   assault and harassment may impact electability. This study analyzes the
   effect that allegations of sexual assault or harassment have on the
   electoral success of American politicians. Using an original survey
   experiment, we find that, on average, American citizens are less likely
   to support a candidate accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment.
   However, not all voters do so to the same magnitude. We find that
   Democrats are significantly less likely to support a candidate that
   faces such allegations. Republicans do not strongly penalize candidates
   facing allegations of sexual assault or harassment, especially if the
   candidate is identified as a Republican. We analyze open-ended survey
   responses to offer an explanation for such variation: a propensity to
   disbelieve women who speak out about sexual assault and harassment
   explains variations in why some voters may not change their opinion of a
   candidate based on an allegation.},

Title = {The (in)admissibility of family mediation in contexts of violence and a
   special refe-rence of the Portuguese regime},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {33},
Month = {APR-OCT},
Abstract = {Mediation is one of the alternative dispute resolution methods (ADR)
   that is considered especially suitable in the sphere of family
   conflicts. These are endowed with emotional characteristics that make
   them more appropriate to be held in a different context than in the
   judicial forum. And, at the same time, they are of a human complexity
   that requires a different analysis in the context of mediation. Also, it
   is true that not all family conflicts will be subject to mediation,
   which means the traditional justice forums (the courts) maintain all
   their relevance. However, the advantages of a `self-compositional'
   method are undeniable in the search for a solution that responds to the
   interests and desires of those who, in another time, shared another
   experience of proximity and intimacy.
   It is questioned whether a couple who have experienced violence may or
   may not be eligible for family mediation. The authors and practitioners
   of the mediation seem not to have the same position on this matter. It
   is important to perceive the arguments used in this divergence. Also,
   towards the end, we will pay special attention to the Portuguese case in
   this regard.},

   District of Columbia v. Heller},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-238},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This case study of the Second Amendment precedent, District of Columbia
   v. Heller, synthesizes insights from political theory, feminist legal
   theory, critical race theory, and American legal history to illustrate
   how Heller endorses a patriarchal theory of armed self-defense. The
   Court relies on the right of the ``head of household{''} to protect the
   home against invaders but ignores the crucial context of common-law
   coverture, which instantiates husbands as rulers of married women.
   Originalism promises that courts can execute a ``sacred{''} text, but
   Heller's selective and skewed originalism creates a right of armed
   self-defense that threatens women's ability to defend themselves against
   those who most frequently endanger them: known assailants in the home.
   Originalism does not provide neutrality; it conceals interpretation.
   Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism requires us to reify the
   historical context, and thus the legal inferiority of women and Black
   Americans at the time of the framing, ratification, and reconstruction
   of the Constitution. This case study casts doubt on both the practice of

Abstract = {What activates individuals' support for autocratic governments? Some
   suggest that the answer is perceptions of increased corruption and/or
   poor economic performance. We do not dispute this explanation but
   instead contend that it depends on individual differences in
   personality. We hypothesise that introverted and closed-minded citizens
   are generally resistant to democracy. When democracies appear unable to
   address problems, introverted and closed-minded citizens defer to
   authoritarian leaders for efficient solutions. We test our hypotheses
   with cross-national survey data from Latin America. Our findings have
   important implications for how we understand the roots of autocratic
   attitudes.},

   governance has expanded since the Cold War from defence and secret

   any policy area. This has driven parliamentary activity, with the effect
   that a much wider range of committees have done substantive work on
   security issues. The UK and Australia display similar levels of security
   parliamentarisation but of a different character due to differences in
   executive/legislative relations, party discipline, parliamentary rules

Abstract = {During the political process, the electorate needs to determine the
   competence of the government by both observing its policy decisions and
   acquiring information from the media. However, media reports are often
   criticized for not being independent and truthful. This paper discusses
   whether the public can determine the quality of a government from media
   reports. In other words, are media outlets more likely to act as
   watchdogs or just as ``yes men{''} to the government? This paper argues
   that, because of reputational concerns, the media usually avoid
   criticizing the government. The media only report truthfully when the
   expected competence of the government is sufficiently low and the
   probability for the voter to learn from other information sources is
   sufficiently high. Otherwise, media outlets-especially low-quality
   outlets-will pander to the government in their reporting. Policy bias or
   media capture is not required for the yes-man problem to prevail.},

Abstract = {This article argues that post-conflict consociational arrangements in
   ethnically divided societies incentivize moderation by political
   parties, but not policy differentiation outside the main conflict. This
   results in little policy-driven voting. Analysing party manifestos and
   voter survey data, we examine the evolution of party policy and cleavage
   voting under power-sharing in Northern Ireland 1998-2016. We find a
   reduction in ethno-national policy differences between parties and that
   ethno-nationalism has become less important in predicting vote choice
   for Protestants, but not Catholics. We also find little party
   differentiation in other policy areas and show that vote choices are
   largely independent of people's policy stances on economic or social
   issues. Our findings are thus largely consistent with a `top-down'
   interpretation of political dynamics.},

Title = {Did you see it coming? Explaining the accuracy of voter expectations for
   district and (sub)national election outcomes in multi-party systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The expectations of voters regarding election outcomes appear to be
   mostly influenced by their own political preferences. This raises two
   important questions. First, once partisan predispositions have been
   accounted for, how much do other variables like interest in the
   campaign, election news attentiveness, political knowledge, education or
   competitiveness help to explain one's ability at predicting election
   outcomes? Second, does one's level of sophistication moderate the link
   between political preferences and forecasting abilities? To answer these
   questions, I mobilize data from seven elections taken at the district
   and (sub)national levels. I also introduce a new measure of forecasting
   ability-the cumulative Brier score index. In most cases, variables other
   than preferences and knowledge have little or no influence on the
   accuracy of voters' expectations both at the (sub)national and district
   levels. Political knowledge is positively associated with citizens'
   forecasting abilities; however, it does not appear to moderate the
   preference-expectation link. This result contradicts findings from
   existing work and holds important implications for the study of citizen
   forecasting.},

Abstract = {How do stigmatized political preferences become normalized? I argue that
   the parliamentary representation of the radical right normalizes radical
   right support. Radical right politicians breach established social
   norms. Hence their supporters have an incentive to conceal that support.
   When the radical right enters parliament, however, its voters are likely
   to perceive that their views have been legitimized, becoming more likely
   to display their private preferences. I use three studies to test this
   argument. Study 1 employs a regression discontinuity comparing the
   underreport of voting for radical right parties (RRPs) above and below
   thresholds of parliamentary representation. Study 2 compares how much
   individuals report liking RRPs in post-electoral surveys depending on
   interview mode. Study 3 employs a difference-in-differences that looks
   into the underreport of UKIP vote before and after entering parliament.
   The results support the argument and highlight the role of political
   institutions in defining the acceptability of behaviors in society.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on framing which can be defined as a particular way of
   presenting information that affects how the message is understood and
   accepted. More precisely, in our research we investigate how comparisons
   to the concepts of an ideal politician (positive framing) and a bad
   politician (negative framing) influence affective evaluation and
   preference for a political candidate. The results of an experimental
   study showed that negative framing led to a higher affective evaluation
   and voting intention compared to positive framing. Furthermore, the
   juxtaposition of the candidate with the concept of a bad politician
   resulted in an increase in the preference for the candidate (compared to
   the initial measurement). The findings support the negativity effect and
   add to the discussion on comparative and negative advertising.},

Title = {Partisan Dehumanization in American Politics},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite evidence that dehumanizing language and metaphors are found in
   political discourse, extant research has largely overlooked whether
   voters dehumanize their political opponents. Research on dehumanization
   has tended to focus on racial and ethnic divisions in societies, rather
   than political divisions. Understanding dehumanization in political
   contexts is important because the social psychology literature links
   dehumanization to a variety of negative outcomes, including moral
   disengagement, aggression, and even violence. In this manuscript, I
   discuss evidence of partisan dehumanization during the 2016 U.S.
   Presidential campaign and demonstrate how a focus on dehumanization can
   expose new relationships between moral psychology and partisan identity.
   Using data from two surveys conducted in October of 2016, I show that
   partisans dehumanize their political opponents in both subtle and
   blatant ways. When I investigate the correlates of dehumanization, I
   find that partisans who blatantly dehumanize members of the opposing
   party prefer greater social distance from their political opponents,
   which is indicative of reduced interpersonal tolerance. I also find that
   blatant dehumanization is associated with perceptions of greater moral
   distance between the parties, which is indicative of moral
   disengagement. These results suggest that dehumanization can improve our
   understanding of negative partisanship and political polarization.},

Title = {An Exploratory Investigation of Traditional Stalking and Cyberstalking
   Victimization among University Students in Spain and the United States:
   A Comparative Analysis},

Abstract = {Traditional stalking and cyberstalking have become a significant legal
   and social issue in today's society. Although a sizeable body of
   research on stalking victimization and perpetration currently exists,
   very little is known about cyberstalking victimization. Relatedly, there
   is a dearth of comparative research on the topics of traditional
   stalking and cyberstalking. Examining the prevalence and nature of
   stalking victimization across national settings will allow for an
   exploration of the significance of social context in affecting victims'
   experiences as well as help highlight the competing influences operating
   in different contexts. Cross-national research on stalking will also
   provide an opportunity to consider a wide range of alternative options
   and solutions to the problem. The aim of this study is to compare and
   contrast the prevalence and nature of traditional stalking and
   cyberstalking victimization between American and Spanish university
   students. This study focuses on university students because there is
   evidence that they have a higher risk of becoming victims of stalking
   relative to the general population. Moreover, the comparative analysis
   undertaking in this study involves a country that has criminalized
   stalking for almost three decades (the United States) and a country that
   has just recently enacted an anti-stalking statute (Spain). Such
   analysis is warranted as it will allow the researchers to engage in
   critical analyses of current anti-stalking statutes and advocate for
   innovative, sensible, and effective solutions in addressing the crime of
   stalking. In addition to presenting the results, the policy implications
   derived from the study will also be discussed..},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Partisan dealignment has been frequently advanced as a pivotal driver of
   the personalization of voting behavior. As voters' long-term attachments
   with parties have eroded, it is argued that partisanship has lost
   importance relative to short-term factors, like voters' evaluations of
   party leaders. Such theoretical reasoning has been applied recurrently
   in research dedicated to explaining vote choice. However, we hypothesize
   that dealignment can downplay partisanship's impact vis-a-vis leaders in
   the same way regarding turnout decisions. This article aims at
   demonstrating the importance of voters' evaluations of party leaders in
   their probability to turn out in parliamentary elections through a novel
   data set pooling 52 national election surveys from 13 Western European
   parliamentary democracies between 1974 and 2016. The results confirm the
   increasing relevance of leaders in explaining turnout decisions and a
   decline of partisanship's mobilizing ability. These trends are further
   accentuated among individuals with a television-dominated media diet,
   demonstrating the role of media change in driving this process.},

Abstract = {Has the UK referendum to leave the EU (Brexit) affected territorial
   preferences within the UK? We draw on comparative theories of such
   preferences to address this question, as Brexit can be seen as a shock
   to a political unit. We test hypotheses in two key regions, Scotland and
   Northern Ireland, with original surveys fielded at a unique time
   (September 2019). We randomize making salient different Brexit scenarios
   and measure support for Scottish independence and unification with
   Ireland within each region. We find in Scotland the prospect of leaving
   the EU increases support for independence. This effect is pronounced
   among those who support the UK remaining in the EU. In Northern Ireland,
   religious background correlates highly with territorial views, and we
   find little evidence of Brexit or border-scenario effects. Our results
   contribute to the literature on decentralization processes and the EU,
   and provide evidence of when negative shocks affect such preferences.},

Title = {Legalize cannabis? Effects of party cues on attitudes to a controversial
   policy proposal},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article focuses on how party identity can shape policy support or
   opposition to the controversial issue of legalizing cannabis in Sweden,
   which is strongly opposed by the public. In a survey experiment (N =
   3612), we manipulated if a message that supported or opposed a policy
   proposal to legalize cannabis was presented by a representative of the
   own party or an outgroup party. Results showed increased opposition to
   the proposal when the ingroup party opposed the policy and when the
   outgroup party endorsed the policy. When the ingroup party endorsed the
   policy and when the outgroup party opposed the policy, attitudes to the
   policy were not influenced. We argue that prior attitudes moderate how
   ingroup- and outgroup party messages are processed and that voters do
   not blindly follow the party line. Only when the own party presents a
   position that coincides with the individual's prior position, are
   attitudes strengthened and voters follow the party line. Attitudes are
   also strengthened as a way to increase distance to a disliked outgroup
   party. When the party cue contradicts prior beliefs (ingroup-endorse;
   outgroup-oppose), the information is ignored, which allows individuals
   to retain their view of the party, be it positive or negative.},

Abstract = {The federal system has long been seen as one of the biggest obstacles to
   the digital transformation of the German state. With the enactment of
   the Online Access Act (OZG), a law that obliges all federal levels to
   offer their administrative services digitally in a joint portal network
   by the end of 2022, a new arena for multilevel collaboration has
   developed in Germany; the so-called digitalisation labs. The labs are
   intended to bring together representatives of all federal levels,
   external actors and citizens to promote problem-oriented policy design
   and the development of innovative policy solutions. Following a
   neo-institutionalist perspective and using the analytical concepts of
   multilevel governance and problem-solving, this paper investigates how
   the institutional settings, internal dynamics and actors' composition
   influence policy design processes in the labs. The empirical analysis is
   built on a qualitative case study of two digitalisation labs in the
   policy field `Immigration and Emigration', and based on ten expert
   interviews as well as an extensive document analysis. The paper
   concludes that, by promoting problem-solving, the institutional settings
   as well as the organisational design and actors' constellations have
   influenced the policy design process in several ways.},

Abstract = {In several world regions, democracy is in retreat. This retreat is
   taking place amid growing polarization in many countries, and analysts
   are increasingly concerned with the role that deepening political
   divisions play in processes of democratic decline. This article
   investigates the relationship between partisan polarization and
   deteriorating public support for democratic institutions. It leverages
   the case of Indonesia, a major third-wave democracy now in the midst of
   a democratic regression. Indonesia's political landscape has become more
   ideologically polarized in recent years, despite the strength of
   clientelist networks and low levels of party identification. Using four
   survey experiments, we find that Indonesians embrace illiberal
   interventions and abandon democratic institutions when exposed to party
   and leadership cues. These results suggest that political polarization
   may prompt citizens to abandon democratic norms even in democracies
   without strong partisan identities.},

Abstract = {In the 1930s and 1940s, personal diplomacy by U.S. presidents was still
   in its infancy, but it was central to the Good Neighbor policy in Latin
   America. To overcome years of mistrust, U.S. presidents, both at home
   and abroad, tried to personally convince their Latin American
   counterparts of their sincerity for more equitable relations. This
   article examines how Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and especially
   Franklin Roosevelt used leader-to-leader diplomacy to change perceptions
   of the United States in Latin America and usher in a new era in
   hemispheric relations. The diplomacy of the Good Neighbor policy also
   had implications for the presidency, as it foreshadowed what would
   become standard practice for modern presidents.},

Abstract = {Has the decline in traditional sources of local news contributed to the
   nationalization of U.S. elections? I hypothesize that local news
   coverage mitigates nationalization by providing voters with information
   that allows them to assess down-ballot candidates separately from their
   national, partisan assessment. The geography of media markets places
   some voters in a neighboring state's market and others in in-state
   markets. I demonstrate that residents of in-state markets have access to
   vastly more local television news coverage of their governor and U.S.
   senators, and this increased coverage translates into greater knowledge
   of these officeholders. Further, access to in-state television news
   substantially increases split-ticket voting in gubernatorial and
   senatorial races. Supplementary analyses provide strong evidence that
   the estimated effects are not the result of unobserved differences
   between residents of in-state and out-of-state media markets. These
   results imply that local news coverage attenuates the nationalization of
   elections even in the present polarized context.},

Abstract = {This study re-examines the international convergence in defence spending
   for 125 countries spanning 1985-2018. We employ the approach of Phillips
   and Sul, which tests for the existence of convergence clubs and the
   modelling of different transition paths to convergence. Our findings
   suggest no overall defence spending convergence at the world, income
   groups (except the low-income countries) and regional levels. However,
   we identify two convergence clubs using an iterative testing procedure
   and eventually (i) at world level, these two clubs exhibit convergence,
   and (ii) while taking into account Gross national income, geography and
   defence alliances/economic cooperation it is possible to make different
   number of convergence/divergence clubs. Contrary to previous findings,
   this study finds that the process of convergence in defence spending
   does not reflect the desirable emanations of defence policies sharing
   similar characteristics, at least in terms of the allocation of scarce
   public resources across the globe.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the local responses to mass schooling in the rural
   areas of Romanian Bessarabia and Soviet Transnistria (1918-1940). Both
   Romania and the USSR aimed at deeply transforming the local populations.
   Romania implemented schooling to assimilate ethnic minorities within the
   model of a nationalizing state, while the USSR adopted an inconsistent
   nationalizing policy, determinedly imposing compulsory education for all
   children. The resistance to schooling among ethnic minorities was less
   intense in Transnistria than in Bessarabia. In both cases, the state
   authorities abandoned, in the late 1930s, the schooling in minority
   languages for the benefit of the titular nationalities.},

Abstract = {Forming part of its wider counter-terrorism apparatus, the United
   Kingdom's ``Prevent duty{''} imposes a legal requirement on various
   sectors to show ``due regard to the need to prevent people from being
   drawn into terrorism{''}. Since its introduction in 2015, the duty has
   been subject to increasing empirical research, with a particular focus
   upon the education sector. There has been, however, a distinct lack of
   scholarly works that specifically explore the issue of far-right
   extremism within this context, reflected in the often-reluctant policy
   development in this area. This article directly addresses this gap in
   research by drawing upon the qualitative experiences of 39 respondents
   with responsibility for the implementation of the duty within various
   schools and colleges across Sussex. Thus, through an empirical
   exploration of the challenges and complexities attached to its
   enactment, this article is one of the first to offer insights into
   educators' negotiations of the duty in relation to far-right extremism.
   Within the data, three themes were particularly dominant: the
   normalisation and mainstreaming of far-right narratives; the associated
   challenges with the implementation of Prevent duty on the ground within
   classrooms; and considerations around the effective enactment of the
   duty. The findings demonstrate that addressing far-right extremism
   within schools and colleges is predictably problematic and closely
   reflects developments in wider society. It is also argued here that
   although addressing far-right extremism needs urgent attention, there
   should be a concerted effort to avoid the same oversights experienced
   with previous attempts at Prevent-related counter-terrorism.},

Abstract = {Does the populist radical right benefit from increased electoral
   mobilization? Integrating theories of political grievances with accounts
   of party competition in Western Europe, we contend that the populist
   right gains advantage from increased electoral mobilization, but that
   this effect is conditional on political disaffection. We draw on a novel
   panel dataset (2009-2019) of more than 10,000 German municipalities and
   city districts to study the implications of turnout surges as a function
   of pre-existing levels of political disaffection in a
   difference-in-differences design. The results demonstrate that turnout
   surges benefit the populist right ``Alternative fur Deutschland{''}
   (AfD) in contexts of widespread political distrust. In contrast,
   increased mobilization acts to depress its electoral fortunes in
   communities marked by low baseline levels of political disaffection. In
   shedding light on the interplay between political disaffection and
   electoral mobilization, this study has important implications for
   understanding the surge of the populist right in established
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Allegations of sexual assault and violence engulfed the confirmation
   hearings surrounding President Trump's Supreme Court nominee (and now
   Justice) Brett Kavanaugh. Our work examines congressmembers'
   communication concerning sexual assault and \#MeToo during this critical
   time of the Kavanaugh hearing and how this relates to perceptions of
   gender and partisanship today. While previous research demonstrated a
   strong role of gender in influencing which members discussed \#MeToo, we
   show that partisanship played a much larger role in discussions of
   sexual assault during this hearing. The findings highlight the shifting
   narrative surrounding the \#MeToo movement and how the multiple
   identities of members of Congress, namely partisanship and gender, can
   be activated and produce changes in how elites communicate about the
   issue, which may have broader policymaking implications.},

Abstract = {The promise of algorithmic decision-making (ADM) lies in its capacity to
   support or replace human decision-making based on a superior ability to
   solve specific cognitive tasks. Applications have found their way into
   various domains of decision-making-and even find appeal in the realm of
   politics. Against the backdrop of widespread dissatisfaction with
   politicians in established democracies, there are even calls for
   replacing politicians with machines. Our discipline has hitherto
   remained surprisingly silent on these issues. The present article argues
   that it is important to have a clear grasp of when and how ADM is
   compatible with political decision-making. While algorithms may help
   decision-makers in the evidence-based selection of policy instruments to
   achieve pre-defined goals, bringing ADM to the heart of politics, where
   the guiding goals are set, is dangerous. Democratic politics, we argue,
   involves a kind of learning that is incompatible with the learning and
   optimization performed by algorithmic systems.},

Abstract = {Many analysts are very pessimistic about French society, which is
   becoming increasingly individualistic, with everyone acting according to
   their own interests. In fact, individualism is very often confused with
   individualisation, i.e. the desire for autonomy in the conduct of one's
   life. These two attitudes are in fact quite opposite. Contrary to
   popular belief, individualism has been on the decline in France for the
   past 10 years, while individualisation is progressing very strongly. And
   above all, the more individualised you are, the less individualistic you
   are. The autonomy of the individual goes hand in hand with a stronger
   altruism. These attitudes are strongly linked to trust in others,
   left-right orientation, egalitarian values between men and women,
   politicisation and religiosity.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, the European Union has faced a multitude of challenges
   including the international financial crisis and the Syrian migration
   crisis. These not only created a crisis within the EU, leaving many
   wondering whether the European project would survive, but they
   highlighted the lack of solidarity amongst its member states. These
   issues would again be brought to the fore with the Covid-19 pandemic,
   which has been an especially challenging issue for Italy. The country
   was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis when it became the
   epicentre of the pandemic in Europe. For this reason, it requested the
   support of the EU to try to contain. However, the EU initially struggled
   to provide any support. This article evaluates the role of
   Europeanization in the EU's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and
   Italy's request for support. By evaluating speeches delivered by EU and
   Italian politicians; and by analysing the initial measures introduced by
   the various EU institutions, this study highlights that there was a
   top-down impact of Europeanization. In fact, the EU introduced various
   health and economic policies to help Italy and the other states
   struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic even though it did not act as
   swiftly as expected. The reason for this is that like its member states,
   the EU found itself unprepared to deal with the pandemic. The study will
   also highlight the limitations surrounding the concept of solidarity as,
   even though the Covid-19 pandemic challenged EU member states, they
   struggled to work together to contain the virus.},

Abstract = {The French economy is a relatively new entity, taking shape in the first
   half of the twentieth century. This article traces the history of its
   emergence. It shows the role of economics and economists in bringing it
   to light and, in so doing, giving it a surplus of existence. First, we
   follow the work carried out by economists in the interwar period to
   accumulate evidence of the consistency of this entity and to document
   its nature. Second, we show that it was only in the years following the
   Liberation that the French economy was truly constituted and publicly
   recognized, and associated with a new concern, that of finding the
   required means to orient and control it. Third, we argue that the
   formation of the French economy fostered a redefinition of the state,
   which found in it a new field of intervention, a new category of public
   action, destined to become central in the second half of the century.},

Title = {``Business as usual{''}: The Treaty of Lisbon and transnational party
   manifestos},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Treaty of Lisbon was a milestone in the enduring process of
   empowerment of the European Parliament and its connections to the
   European Commission. This latest reform of the Treaties, in force since
   December 2009, placed the only supranational institution whose members
   arc directly elected by all citizens of the EU (since 1979) on an equal
   footing with the Council as a co-legislator in around thirty additional
   policy areas. The Treaty of Lisbon also strengthened the European
   Parliament in terms of the annual and multiannual budgetary decisions,
   and it granted it the right to elect the President of the European
   Commission according to the results of the European elections. This
   article examines various possible effects of this major boost of the
   European Parliament, along with links to the European Commission in the
   manifestos issued by five European parties: the Alliance of Liberals and
   Democrats for Europe (ALDE), European Free Alliance (EFA), European
   Green Party (European Greens or EGP), European People's Party (EPP), and
   Party of European Socialists (PES). It studies variations from 2004
   onwards in the scope of the programmatic proposals regarding EU domains
   of power, the footprint in the manifestos of the transnational party
   organisations themselves, and eventually also of their candidates for
   the presidency of the European Commission. To do so, the twenty
   manifestos issued by the abovementioned parties for the 2004, 2009, 2014
   and 2019 European elections were content analysed. The results point to
   the lasting distance between these transnational parties and the
   European elections, despite the reinforcement of the role of the
   European Parliament over time.},

Abstract = {Currently, there is a global level of an interesting group of legal
   norms that recognize or grant to nature or a specific ecosystem, the
   status of Legal Personhood and whose purpose is environmental protection
   and conservation. In turn, this award or recognition has also been
   carried out through the judgements of the higher courts. The motivations
   may vary, depending on whether that ecosystem is conceived as a living
   being or as a protectable patrimony. In this article, cases of Latin
   America, North America, Oceania and Asia will be approached to finally
   provide some conclusions based on a comparative analysis regarding the
   main features and their possible effects.},

Title = {Equal Respect, Liberty, and Civic Friendship Why Liberal Public
   Justification Needs a Dual Understanding of Reciprocity},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-19},
Abstract = {This paper critically discusses the generally recognized dualism in the
   interpretation of the moral basis of public reason. We argue that in
   order to maintain the complementarity of both liberal and democratic
   values within the debate on public reason, the arguments from liberty
   and from civic friendship cannot be considered in isolation. With regard
   to the argument from liberty, we contend that because the idea of
   natural liberty is an indispensable starting point of liberal theory, no
   explanation of the justification of political power can do without it.
   In particular, we focus on the requirement of reasonableness and show
   that we should retain the epistemic aspect of the reasonableness of
   persons. Perhaps the main reason for this is to be found in the
   criterion of reciprocity which provides the deepest justification of the
   respect for people's liberty - that is, the liberal aspect of liberal
   democracy. At the same time, however, we argue that reciprocity also
   provides the grounds for responding to the criticism that the
   essentially liberal approach fails to adequately take into consideration
   the role of political community. Because reciprocity may also be
   interpreted as being based on civic friendship, it provides the
   resources to respond to such criticism. It thus supplies the normative
   background also for the second, democratic pillar of public reason. We
   then critically examine the newly emerging approach built predominantly
   on the argument from civic friendship, arguing that by prioritising the
   civic friendship interpretation and, at times, tending to completely
   abandon the liberty-based one, it overlooks the indispensability of
   liberty-based considerations for the criterion of reciprocity. We
   conclude that in order to adequately capture the common
   liberal-democratic basis of public reason, both interpretations of
   reciprocity must be linked within a comprehensive account.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {In the context of current discussions about changes in the political
   systems of new democracies in Central Europe and the strengthening of
   nationalist or authoritarian tendencies in present Hungary, the issue of
   shaping new political systems after the end of Second World Waris also
   being updated. It is at least useful to rethink the reasons why the
   vision of a new, so-called ``popular democracy{''}, originally
   positively perceived by both the domestic and foreign public, eventually
   ended not only unsuccessfully, but even by building a new, non
   -democratic, or even totalitarian regime. This study analyzes the
   process of forming a new political and economic system in Czechoslovakia
   and Hungary after the Second World War. The contribution will be, on the
   one hand, a historical analysis that respects the contemporary internal
   political and international political contexts that existed in both
   countries in 1945. At the same time, the contribution will be a
   political analysis comparing the similarities and differences of
   development in both countries. It will focus on the transformation of
   political elites in both countries as a result of the Second World War,
   as well as the fundamental transformation of the institutional framework
   in which the events took place. At the theoretical level, the study is
   based on the use of the concept of so-called hybrid democracy by L.
   Gilbert and P. Mohseni, where we will verify the presence and role of
   the socalled ``guardianship institutions{''} in both post-war regimes.
   At the same time, the study is also based on the theoretical concept of
   the typology of political change by A. Stepan. The results show how he
   played a negative experience with the pre-war political-economic order
   and the transformation of the mentality of both national societies
   during Second World War as a significant argument in the radical changes
   in the political and economic system in both countries. Attention will
   also be paid to factors that have failed in both countries to attempt to
   build a ``new type{''} of post-war democracy in these countries.},

Abstract = {Ronald Inglehart's Human Development Theory has argued for 50 years that
   economic development promotes the social mobilization needed to drive an
   intergenerational cultural change beneficial to democracy. From this
   perspective, highly developed societies would be those with the best
   cultural conditions for democratization and the advancement of
   democracy. Thus, this article seeks to carry out a theoretical debate
   about the understanding of Inglehart and his collaborators about
   capitalism and social welfare. It highlights that, due to its
   normativity oriented to the defense of liberal democracy, the Theory of
   Human Development treats capitalism in a benevolent way and does not
   give centrality to social policies in the trajectory of democracy it
   describes. At the end, the possibility of this theory being framed as
   neoliberal progressive is debated.},

Pages = {205-223},
Abstract = {The objective of the study was to identify the legal mechanisms for the
   protection of the family rights of the child and to outline the main
   problems of their implementation. The child's family rights system was
   found to contain the child's intangible basic rights, which establish
   his or her legal status in the family. This system includes the child's
   right to life, name, citizenship, knowledge of his parents, care of
   parents, coexistence with parents, preservation of his identity and
   citizenship, free expression of his own views. It states that the
   protection of the family rights of the child and the legal relations of
   parents and children is based on four principles. It is determined that
   the practical solution of issues related to the exercise of the family
   rights of the child is regulated by international law, which makes it
   possible to resolve issues related to the legal relationship between
   parents and children at the inter-State level. It is concluded that
   perspectives on legislative support for the family rights of the child
   demand further empirical research, as well as a theoretical and
   methodological justification for determining the legal mechanisms of
   their practical implementation.},

Abstract = {Through a documentary methodology close to legal hermeneutics, the
   article reveals the main problematic aspects of the detection,
   investigation, and combat of crimes against sexual freedom and the
   inviolability of children, as well as highlights the main positions of
   the European Court of Rights in this regard. Ukraine is currently
   actively discussing the prospect of a comprehensive and stable juvenile
   justice system, so protecting the rights of the child from the
   usurpation of sexual freedom and inviolability is an important part of
   ensuring its functioning. The work aims to establish the characteristics
   of detection, investigation, and prevention of crimes against the
   freedom and sexual inviolability of the child and, suggest ways to solve
   the main problems. The result of this work is to identify specific
   features of the detection, investigation, and combat of crimes against
   the freedom and sexual inviolability of the child, while determining the
   importance of investigative and preventive actions considering the
   psychological characteristics of children, proposing ways to improve the
   existing system of protection of sexual crimes. It is concluded that the
   prevention of these crimes requires multidimensional legal and political
   action.},

Abstract = {The paper raises the issue of age-based marginalization reoccurring in
   political discourse produced by political elites in the time of the
   pandemic crisis. Discursive identity of the elderly population in a
   central European post-election spacetime is under focus, within a
   framework of theories of discourse in crisis. Lexicometric analysis of
   core media coverage of political discourse in Slovakia carried out upon
   the corpus of mainstream electronic press and a reading of its results
   is the objective of the empirical part of the study. The scope is to put
   forward a critical insight into short-term evolution of dominant
   vocabulary item series and into collocation patterns stressing the
   connotative features of prominent elements of discourse co created by
   political and mediatic actors. The results show recurrent denomination
   practices with a strong tendency towards negative connotative load of
   dominant label words. Individual and group identities deserve to be
   further studied as socially undermined discursive constructs accessible
   through selected discrete elements.},

Abstract = {From a normative and interdisciplinary approach, a critique of
   liberal-representative democracy is made based on the principal-agent
   model, which entails identifying a conflict of political interest that
   vitiates representative government. It is then shown how this conflict,
   in different versions, appears in theories of political science, public
   administration and law, and that its resolution repeatedly implies a
   certain separation of powers. Based on this analysis, a new foundation
   for democracy is proposed, consisting of direct popular ownership of the
   political system, which can be institutionalized in a Citizens' Power.},

Abstract = {Democracy is a chimera for many who feel that she will never knock on
   her doors. But that democracy is already part of a past when it comes to
   seeing science move forward and the world begins a gap between those who
   have and those who do not have in every sense of thinking and acting of
   the human. In these new times of social media-fed cyber millennialism on
   the one hand and laboratories on the other hand, the new war for those
   who master thought will be fought at the bit level and Artificial
   Intelligence. This is where neurocracy begins its journey as -perhaps-
   the new way of living and living together. The objective of this essay
   is to make known how this new way of thinking, feeling, and acting of
   human coexistence is entering into our daily work. The results obtained
   when thinking about the work, is of having shown that the middle maas
   and AI have arrived to stay in an increasingly dystopian planetary
   scenario.},

Abstract = {In May 2020, a ruling of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC)
   questioned the legality of the Bundesbank's participation in the
   European Central Bank's (ECB's) Public Sector Purchase Programme.
   Applying elements of a principal-agent analysis, this article analyses
   how the FCC ruling presents us with a new understanding of the
   relationship between the ECB, other EU institutions and Eurozone member
   states. Existing principal-agent analyses of the ECB focus upon its
   relations with other EU-level institutions and point to the limited ex
   ante control mechanisms and efforts to reinforce ex post control
   mechanisms-notably European Parliament oversight. The FCC ruling and the
   ECB's reaction demonstrate the relative importance of national level
   controls over the ECB agent. This article understands the role of
   private plaintiffs in Germany as a form of `fire alarm' on ECB
   policymaking against the background of weak ex post controls at the
   EU-level.},

Abstract = {The problem of the sustainability of the political system is one of the
   most pressing issues in Political Science. The wave of social and
   political upheavals that took place in the 21st century in various
   countries requires studying the factors that determine the ability of
   modern political systems to maintain their essential features in case of
   undesirable conditions. Today it is already obvious that the
   sustainability of the political system, mechanisms and principles of its
   functioning depends not only and, perhaps, not as much on the
   socio-economic sphere, the development of democratic institutions or the
   presence/absence of a destructive external influence, as it is often
   assumed. Rather, intra-systemic characteristics play a key role.
   The multidimensionality of the manifestation and the multifactorial
   nature of the formation of stable political systems not only determine
   the possibility of a huge number of definitions of sustainability, but
   also give rise to considerable difficulties in measuring it.
   The authors analyze the political system of Kazakhstan using the
   sustainability index that they developed earlier. The study shows that
   throughout most of the post-Soviet history of the country, the level of
   the sustainability of its political system was above average, and now
   Kazakhstan already surpasses Russia and Ukraine in this parameter and is
   approaching Belarus. Moreover, if the existing trends continue, the
   sustainability of the political system of Kazakhstan in the short term
   will only increase. According to the authors' conclusion, this trend is
   hard to reverse unless there is a force majeure in the global economy or
   new military and political threats emerge, which the republic will not
   be able to tackle without resorting to the help of allies.},

Abstract = {The main goal of the paper is to identify statistical relations between
   selected economic indicators and political party preferences. The sample
   contains 7 political parties, and we monitor the development of their
   preferences through two agencies (FOCUS and AKO) conducting regular
   surveys of electoral preferences. We monitor their dependence relation
   through a set of selected key economic indicators: Average monthly
   wages, GDP index, GDP in millions of EUR, Unemployment in \%,
   Unemployment in thousands, Consumer prices and Inflation. The observed
   period covers a total of 52 months from the beginning of the year 2016
   to April 2020. The results show a statistical dependence between
   specific economic indicators and the development of preferences of
   political parties that were active in the government from March 2016 to
   March 2020. The form of dependence shows itself as indirect, which means
   a positive balance development of economic indicators, but on the
   contrary, a negative development of electoral preferences of Smer-SD,
   SNS and Most-Hid political parties.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Number = {133},

Abstract = {The introduction to this special report reviews the intertwined history
   of the state and economics in the twentieth century. It examines the way
   in which the affirmation of the state as an economic actor was linked to
   the institutionalization of economics as an academic discipline and to
   the extension of its objects to the study of the state itself. The
   contribution of economics to the construction of the state is considered
   at the level of the policy instruments informed by economic knowledge,
   as well as at the level of the more general (often competing)
   representations that have emerged from it and have helped to legitimize
   the transformations of its scope of intervention. The presentation of
   the contributions-focused on France, but also on (post-) Soviet Russia
   and international organizations-questions the redefinition of the
   (economic) role of the state until the ``neoliberal turn,{''} as well as
   the transformations of economic expertise and of the mediations between
   the political-bureaucratic and scientific fields that underlie them.},

Abstract = {With the privatization of the internet in 1995, capital managed to
   contain the digital common, to classify it as private property, and to
   generalize and extend the digital common of the private internet to the
   world community as universal private property. Since that time,
   individual capitals with a share in the ownership of the digital common
   as universal private property have taken on the mantle of digital
   landowners. Pursuant to their becoming digital landowners, capitals like
   Facebook and internet service providers have drawn account holders onto
   the universal private property of today's global internet, casting them
   in the role of digital peasant tenant-cultivators. This tenantry has
   promoted conditions ripe for the establishment of a feudal mode of
   agrarian exploitation that expresses itself through the establishment of
   digital sharecropping, the taking of digital ground rent, and the
   extraction of tribute.},

   prospects for further decentralisation and local government reform in
   Ukraine, taking into account the Polish experience. Such methods as
   dialectical, historical, systemic, functional, formal-legal, comparative
   and predictive are used to prove that these countries had roughly the
   same political and administrative-territorial conditions at the start of
   reforms but have achieved different results and now meet new specific
   challenges forcing each country to use the political will of all
   citizens to continue reforms.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyse the nature and evolution of the role played
   by labour market organisations in the making of European gender equality
   policy. It highlights three distinct sequences of public action: a
   relationship marked by mistrust until the end of the 1980s, then with
   the development of European social dialogue and until the end of the
   2000s, a constrained relationship, and finally the most recent period is
   that of an impeded relationship: the social partners privileged
   institutional position is being questioned which reduces their capacity
   to play a central role in the development and orientation of gender
   equality policy, moreover their restricted conception of the principle
   of gender equality contributes to hindering the development of
   transformative measures.},

Abstract = {The people of the European Union perceive the field of defence and
   security more through the national security than the security of the
   Union as a whole. The aim of the study is a legal analysis of security
   after the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty. To this end, the study sets out
   the basic starting points for the adoption of this primary document of
   the European Union, analyses the change it has brought about in the
   competences of the European Union and acquaints the reader with the
   classification of its competencies, with emphasis on security. At the
   same time, it deals with the method of monitoring of respect for the
   division of competences between the Union and the member states, as well
   as the peculiarities that primary law of the European Union connects
   with this area of social relations. The presented analysis shows that
   there would be no fundamental change in the issue of the common security
   policy brought about by the Lisbon Treaty in the near future. This could
   only be caused by a major change in global security policy that requires
   an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {31-50},
Abstract = {Social science long identified modernization with territorial
   integration and functional differentiation, but within
   territorially-bounded states. Globalization theories at the end of the
   Cold War projected this to the world level, with the `borderless world'.
   This is better conceptualized as a rescaling and selective rebounding of
   social systems at multiple levels, above, below and across the state
   system. This has posed again an old question about the relationship of
   function, community and territory. It is an essentially contested matter
   and can only be appreciated if we accept that all three elements are
   constructed and mutually constituted. There can be no neutral and
   uncontested spatial fix, since the definition of territory and the
   drawing of boundaries has huge implications for the distribution of
   wealth and power. Rescaling is above all a political matter.},

Abstract = {The military suppression of the Prague Spring was a turning point.
   Protagonists from back then and historians agree that the crackdown was
   accompanied by enormous disillusionment. In global historical terms,
   1968 was a defeat for socialism and a part of the left's decline. The
   left showed itself unable to come to terms with the causes in a critical
   manner. It sought refuge into melancholy or cynicism. Some seek to toss
   the Prague Spring on the ash heap of history. But working through the
   grief and the memory of that era's yearnings and experiments could

Abstract = {The world system is undergoing a period of transfonnation and
   refragmentation, the disintegration of a single political space into
   spheres of influence formed by the great powers. India, which forms such
   a sphere around itself, is faced with the problem: a serious economic
   and military lag behind China, trying, following the ideas of the Indian
   elites, to achieve hegemony in Southeast and South Asia and the Indian
   Ocean region. To fend off these attempts, India has put forward two
   concepts: Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) and the
   Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).
   The article is devoted to the analysis of the problems that New Delhi is
   trying to solve with the help of these concepts, and the consideration
   of the very process of their implementation. The author notes that both
   SAGAR and IPOI are not developed strategic documents, but a type of
   `vision' typical for Indian foreign policy discourse. At the same time,
   the active assistance provided by India to the countries of the Indian
   Ocean region within the framework of SAGAR demonstrates that India
   perceives these countries as part of its sphere of influence and is
   trying to tie them to itself both politically and economically. On the
   contrary, the concept of ITOI aims to form partnerships and informal
   alliances with ASEAN countries and Australia. The author believes that
   Indian regional concepts are of interest to Russia. allowing it to use
   the Indian experience and to participate in Indian initiatives.},

Abstract = {The employment of China's tertiary education system's graduates is
   considered, on the one hand, as a prerequisite for the implementation of
   the strategic goal set by the Chinese leadership - turning the country
   into a global center for the development of new knowledge and
   technologies by 2035, and on the other, as a factor of ensuring social
   stability. The analysis shows that an increasingly serious problem is
   the contradiction between the prevailing ideas in Chinese society about
   importance of ``high scholarship{''} and the structure of vacancies for
   graduates of universities and higher professional colleges in the labor
   market; between the ideas of graduates about what kind of knowledge and
   skills are in demand by employers, and the requirements imposed by
   employers on applicants while searching for qualified personnel.},

Title = {Why More Civil Society Will Not Lead to Less Domination: Dealing with
   Present Day State Phobia through Michel Foucault and Neo-Republicanism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {258-275},
Abstract = {The notion of civil society, as an ontologically distinct sphere,
   separated from the state thereby serves as an antidote to the sovereign
   power of the state. Since the 1990s, we have seen reforms and
   organizational structures that advances the role of the market as well
   as the civil society along with a voluntary sector, often with the
   deliberate attempt to disrupt the power of the state and to tame the
   Leviathan through the promotion of networks, partnerships, co-governance
   and collaboration. This can be understood in terms of a present day
   state phobia and builds on a liberal conception of negative freedom
   understood as non-interference. Yet if we take Foucault's theorizations
   of power as omnipresent as it disrupts the power/freedom dichotomy we
   need to find alternative ways to cope with relations of power in order
   to not let them deteriorate into relations of domination. I argue in
   this article that neo-republican ideal of non-domination can be combined
   with Foucault's insights on the nature of power. If correct, a continued
   promotion of more civil society involvement and partnerships between
   public and private actors provides a false insurance to diminish
   domination in contemporary societies.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {71-96},
Abstract = {Has the situation of fundamental rights changed in times of the corona
   pandemic? One thing is certain: the protection of basic rights is not a
   one-way street that begins with the individual, but a promise of the
   Basic Law that must be implemented by all state powers. The legal system
   as such, not just the legal status of the individual, should be a free
   one. In the last few months, even the case law of the lower courts and
   the Federal Constitutional Court has proven to be rather pale. The merit

Title = {TRANSFORMATION OF THE REGIONAL POLICY OF RUSSIA AND CHINA UNDER THE
   CONDITIONS OF UNEQUAL DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONS (1980-2020): A COMPARATIVE
   HISTORICAL STUDY},

Abstract = {Studying the experience of the regional policy of modem Russia and China
   in eliminating and leveling the disproportionate phenomena of
   socio-economic development of individual regions provides an opportunity
   to compare and determine the most effective tools and conditions for
   combating uneven trends in spatial development, based on a historical
   retrospective of the internal regional dynamics of two neighboring
   states. The purpose of this article is a comparative and consideration
   of the evolution of the regional policy of Russia and China in the
   context of the increasing unevenness and disproportionality of the
   internal regional development of the two countries in the modern period
   of history. The complex structure of the research involves the use of a
   comparative historical method, a systems approach. a retrospective
   method. The research is based on the texts of Russian and Chinese
   authors, as well as documents in Chinese. The main factor that increased
   the unevenness of regional socio-economic development in both China and
   Russia was the transition to the use of market relations instruments
   within the framework of spatial development. A characteristic feature of
   the spatial development of the Russian Federation and the PRC in order
   to combat disproportionate trends in the situation of the regions was
   the preparation of spatial development strategies with the participation
   of the expert community. Only in the PRC were these strategies
   correlated with national goals for China to achieve the level of
   developed countries of the world by 2049, on the one hand. and on the
   other hand, to ellectively use the comparative advantages of individual
   provinces. cities. etc. In Russia, the experience in developing
   strategies for spatial development was guided by the current state of
   affairs in the development of a resource-based economy, the creation of
   supporting regions, ``locomotives{''} of growth. The key instruments of
   the regional policy of Russia and China to eliminate internal unevenness
   in the development of regions at different stages of regional history
   were projects to strengthen individual support regions, to attract
   various types of state support for spatial development. If in Russia
   financial transfers of state support were the main means of solving
   problems of regional inequality, then in China the system of measures
   for the development of regions also included private investment.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {1014-1035},
Abstract = {The literature of social movement outcomes is engaged with the study of
   social change. However, social movement theories limit the explanatory
   potential of social movements' political outcomes, only in relation to
   policy and institutional change. Therefore, they do not pay attention to
   the various political qualities which emerge from protest cycles and
   move away from institutional arrangements. Against this backdrop, the
   paper suggests approaching social transformations as changes in
   boundaries. Boundaries define, each time, the limits of social settings
   and describe organizational and identarian aspirations of social change
   in daily life. Periods of crises are characterized by intense
   transformations, which overcome the old and create new boundaries. Based
   on qualitative field research conducted in more than 50 social movement
   organizations in Greece, between 2016 and 2017, the paper analyses the
   mechanisms that facilitated the enlargement of social movements'
   cognitive and structural boundaries, towards service-oriented
   repertoires of action. By studying social movement outcomes through
   boundary transformations, the paper challenges the rigid categorizations
   of movement outcomes and unravels the interactions among their personal,
   cultural and political aspects. As such, it demonstrates the need for
   social movement theories to consider non institutional political changes
   of daily life, within the study of movement outcomes.},

Abstract = {The Karamat Watan (March of Dignity) was the largest protest
   mobilisation in Kuwaiti history. From late December 2011 to 2014 this
   social movement pressured the government in the streets to reform the
   parliamentary system. The results of these protests were unprecedented,
   forcing a Kuwaiti prime minister to resign for the first time in in
   history and publicly challenging against the country's ruler. Yet the
   protest movement largely failed, largely due to a loss of public
   support. Why did the Karamat Watan protest movement lose support from
   the public in Kuwait? The literature on the Gulf and Kuwait in
   particular focus on payoffs as a way of explaining acquiesance, yet
   payoffs in 2011 and 2012 had almost no impact on protest mobilisation.
   Instead, it may be more normative issues that kept protesters away: the
   unrealistic and aggressive demands of protest organisers for regime
   change. This article focuses on the legitimacy, or lackthereof, of the
   government and regime to explain the failure of the ``Arab Spring{''}
   protest movement in Kuwait, looking at how consent and normative
   concerns impacted the decision of protesters to leave the streets. Data
   was collected through semi-structured interviews with citizens who
   participated in the protests, interviews with dozens of members of the
   opposition leadership, and group surveys at 13 tribal diwaniyas that
   highlight a cross-section of protesters' opinion. The research presented
   demonstrates that public support for the social movement may have in
   part failed largely because the movement was unsuccessful in framing
   that it could govern if it was successful. Public support was also
   limited by protest tactics including disrupting modes of transportation
   and livelihood. At the heart of protesters' concerns was the lack of a
   substantive opposition they could believe in and poor opinions on the
   quality of leadership in Karamat Watan. This article fills a gap in the
   literature by developing a clearer understanding of legitimation in a
   rentier state, Kuwait, and by providing dense empirical data to back it
   up. The utility of this approach is important considering that the
   failure for many social movements to frame grievances in a way that
   mobilizes the population, a common pattern in the region.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {6},
Pages = {42-59},
Abstract = {Arab Nationalism (AN) is a broad ideological and political movement that
   played a key role in the liberation of the Arabs initially from Ottoman
   rule, then from European domination, and ultimately in the emergence and
   development of a whole array of independent Arab states. The article
   offers a radical new take on the current state of this movement, whose
   adherents have been in power in Syria for almost six decades. A review
   of the movement's genesis undertaken by the author reveals that the
   Levant-Iraq zone has been a major feeding ground for the advent and
   elaboration of the united Arab nation concept, which formed the backbone
   of the ideology and politics of one of the three AN Pan-Arab segments -
   Baathism. It is ascertained that for its survival, as a ruling party
   movement in Syria, a matter of paramount importance is the historic
   memory, that has played a much more prominent part in politics in
   Oriental countries than in the West. From an overview of the AN
   historical heritage, two tides of the Arab Awakening are singled out,
   and the role played by the personalities who devised the fundamental
   secular tenants of the Pan-Arab ideological and theoretical background
   is highlighted. In this context, the author identifies a continual trend
   underlying strained relationships between AN and the Levant, on the one
   hand, and the Ottomans, thereafter the Turkish nationalists of nowadays,
   on the other hand, meanwhile the modern slogan of the latter ({''}Five
   States - One Nation{''}) is practically a replica of the chief AN slogan
   ({''}One Arab Nation{''}). The article analyzes the evolution of the
   dichotomy: Qawmism (Pan-Arab Nationalism) - Watanism (particular,
   country-wise patriotism). Despite the fact that the Pan-Arab ideas have
   apparently suffered a crushing defeat, under conditions of glorification
   of the nation-state model, there are substantial prerequisites in the
   Arab world for its integration, that provide an impetus for AN to get
   back on track in the foreseeable future. However, this would require an
   ideological transformation of AN and for it to adopt its hybrid, or
   rather convergent variety, in order for it to meet the challenge of
   overcoming the antagonism between Qawmism and Watanism.},

Abstract = {At present, there is no common perception in modern science and
   international political practice of what the world (international) order
   (legal order) is. The article analyzes the relevant points of view. It
   is concluded that by referring to the relevant provisions, generally
   accepted in the framework of the general theory of law and the theory of
   international law, it is possible to get close enough to the solution of
   this problem. The article also examines other problems related to the
   essence of the concepts of the world (international) order and its types
   (world public order, world legal order and global world legal order),
   and also the varieties of social norms of the international regulatory
   system, the results of the implementation of which shape the
   corresponding orders. Special attention is paid to the fact that, in
   contrast to the widespread perceptions, all three types of world order
   are neither a set of international relations, nor a set of norms
   regulating such relations. According to the theory of international law,
   they are the result of the implementation of the requirements of certain
   norms of the international regulatory system aimed at managing
   international public relations. In addition, various factors influence
   the state of a particular type of international order (including a
   change in the hierarchy of states depending on their role in the
   international political and/or economic system, the formation of new
   centers of power, a change in bipolarity, polycentricity or
   monocentricity of the world, the emergence of multilateral integration
   formations. the activities of international multilateral institutions,
   etc.), but they should also not be confused with international orders
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Criminal policy is part of state policy, defining the main objectives
   and means to influence crime through legislative activities related to
   change, first, criminal, criminal-procedural, criminal-executive
   legislation. Through a scientific methodology of a documentary nature,
   the objective of the research is to analyze the criminal and legal
   policy of the State in the fight against crimes related to bribery and
   other illegal remuneration. It should be noted that the criminal policy
   of crimes related to bribery and other illegal remuneration is currently
   in crisis. It is concluded that there is a tendency to increase the
   range of criminal acts related to illegal remuneration, to broaden the
   scope of the criminal regulation of liability for illegal remuneration
   by making changes and additions to the composition of offences related
   to illegal remuneration, and to criminalize new types of acts related to
   unlawful remuneration, which is associated with the assessment of the
   role of illegal remuneration as a particularly dangerous criminal
   phenomenon, which has a significant negative impact on protected public
   relations.},

Abstract = {The transnational nature of COVID-19 created expectations of
   regionally-led initiatives to address this global challenge. The
   pandemic has transcended health issues accounting for several political
   and socioeconomic implications. This study seeks to investigate four
   regional organisations' responses during the `first wave' to unravel
   regionalism's role in a time of crisis. To do so, the method of
   comparative analysis has been employed. ASEAN, EU, AU and MERCOSUR, four
   distinct organisations were selected to evaluate their responses in
   terms of crisis management efficacy, level of solidarity, promotion of
   multilateralism and international actorness. The findings highlight each
   organisation's successes and shortcomings while indicating the limits of
   regional cooperation in effectively responding to outbreaks of
   infectious diseases. This empirical analysis shows that regional
   responses were limited and mainly facilitated national policies. This
   further indicates regional organisations' inability to have a more
   proactive role in crisis management, boost their actorness and advance
   more inclusive and responsive global governance.},

   how the subnational dimension interacts with other attributes such as
   gender, race, and rurality to produce a diverse landscape of
   disadvantage and privilege. This article uses the intersectionality
   approach to show the enormous differences in illiteracy and school
   non-attendance among groups composed of different combinations of these
   attributes in Peru, Colombia, and Chile. To better understand the effect
   of the subnational dimension on these differences, the article applies
   the Oaxaca-Binder decomposition and identifies what portion of the
   regional gaps is due to different demographic compositions across
   regions. This analysis motivates a theoretical reflection on the nature
   of subnational inequality based on distinguishing a compositional and an
   intersectional component and identifying possible causal factors of
   both.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Pages = {165-178},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the characteristics of the legal regulation of road
   safety in different countries of the world. In addition, current issues
   in the field of road safety are revealed, which can be conditionally
   divided into several groups. Such issues include legal regulation; the
   structural organization of legal regulation: personnel, material,
   technical and financial support. The key directions of the state policy
   of different countries of the world in the field of ensuring road safety
   are identified, as well as new principles for the formation of criteria
   to guarantee road safety. It analyses the positive experience of some
   countries in the field of road safety. In particular, the experience of
   China, Japan, and some European countries in the field of ensuring road
   safety could be considered by other countries at the same time as the
   legal regulation of road safety. It is concluded that, to improve the
   efficiency of the legal regulation of road safety, a systematic approach
   is required, including the development of objective indicators, the use
   of systematic and evidence-based measures aimed at preventing road
   accidents and reducing the severity of their consequences.},

Abstract = {Contemporary dictionary-based approaches to sentiment analysis exhibit
   serious validity problems when applied to specialized vocabularies, but
   human-coded dictionaries for such applications are often labor-intensive
   and inefficient to develop. We demonstrate the validity of
   ``minimally-supervised{''} approaches for the creation of a sentiment
   dictionary from a corpus of text drawn from a specialized vocabulary. We
   demonstrate the validity of this approach in estimating sentiment from
   texts in a large-scale benchmarking dataset recently introduced in
   computational linguistics, and demonstrate the improvements in accuracy
   of our approach over well-known standard (nonspecialized) sentiment
   dictionaries. Finally, we show the usefulness of our approach in an
   application to the specialized language used in US federal appellate
   court decisions.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to such a pressing problem as separatism, mainly
   in Ukraine (Donbas region). Some experts say that separatism is a
   problem of the past, but the author emphasises that the XXIst century
   will be the century of an identification factor increase that will
   influence nationalistic issues. It is emphasised that separatism could
   be catalysed not only by domestic factors but also by exogenous ones,
   especially nowadays, when the structure of the world is being changed by
   influential actors in foreign affairs. The article contains an analysis
   of the reasons for military conflict that broke out in 2014 in the
   Donbas region and still goes on. The author analyses the exogenous
   influence of the Russian Federation on the political situation in
   Ukraine. The analysis covers Russian influence on politics, economy,
   culture and religion in Ukraine. Besides, for the first time in the
   Political Science field, the author presents a separatism revealing
   formula that can help central governments foresee and prevent possible
   separatism conflicts in future.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Intercultural adaptability as a resource to strengthen collaboration and
   alliance between different cultural groups is an element that currently
   stands out due to its effectiveness in the formation of multinational
   contingents. However, historically this situation has manifested itself
   through procedures that do not exist today due to the regulation of
   uniform in the armies. Thus, strategic transvestism as an effective
   resource to generate new forms of collective representation in conflict
   situations is a phenomenon that has served in some contexts to
   performatively endorse the commitment of intercultural alliances. Based
   on a comparative analysis of three historical cases (Lawrence of Arabia,
   Alexander the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte), its application and results
   are analyzed according to the degree of xenophilic commitment and
   integrative approach that its protagonists developed. The results show
   that the adoption of traits that define the appearance of the other from
   integrative attitude helps establish a shared cross-identity that
   promotes collaboration. However, the achievement of the involvement of
   the other in a plane of mutual appreciation does not prevent resistance
   from arising within the cultural group itself when seeing in this
   transvestism a threat to integrity and cultural unity. Thus, on the
   contrary, in contexts where strategic transvestism is used without
   abandoning a xenophobic attitude or from an colonialist stance, the
   other group considers this apparent performative adaptation as a
   simulation or trickery that emphasize the conflict.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {99-112},
Abstract = {The results of the authors' research concerning local (urban) youth
   identity, alongside the manner in which it develops into constructive
   socio-political practices, are presented in this article (based on
   materials from the Krasnodar Territory). The authors describe urban
   youth identity as a part of the subjective space influencing the
   organizational forms and content of local youth socio-political
   practices and their participation in power relations. The theoretical
   model includes parameters of youth as a specific socio-demographic group
   such as a special stage of socialization, attitudes towards social
   mobility, type of organization, number, etc. The content of local
   identity and the parameters of the city as an identification object were
   taken into consideration. The conceptual model also includes practices
   of social activity in which local identity is realized, a system of
   factors influencing the process by which local identity actualizes,
   forms, and changes, and mechanisms for converting local identity into
   social practices. Empirical research showed that local (urban) identity
   informs the social and territorial identities of urban youth, and its
   character depends on the size of the city and the category of young
   people. The authors describe the semantic space of the city (the
   attitude towards the city) and the features of its configuration in
   different age groups. The direct and inverse models of converting the
   meanings of local (urban) identity into the socio-political practices of
   young people and their dialectical nature were revealed. Three trigger
   zones actualizing local identity and converting it into socio-political
   practices were characterized (a zone of direct conversion, a zone of
   potential conversion of local identity into constructive practices, and
   a zone of potential conversion of local identity into destructive
   practices). The administrative, political, public, and network
   mechanisms for converting local (urban) identity into constructive
   sociopolitical practices of youth were identified and described.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {1+},
Abstract = {The article starts from the idea that the struggle for recognition is
   structured in the egological matrix of ethics, so it is the I who
   determines to the Other how the procedural structure of
   self-recognition, legal recognition and social recognition should take
   place. This structure prevents the Other from self-determining and
   proposes, philosophically, only an immediate necessary change. In order
   to propose the struggle for recognition in the first ethics, the ethics
   that enable the Other to determine the behavior of the Self, a critical
   analysis is made of the theory of the struggle for recognition based on
   the Levinasian philosophical framework of the first ethics. It is
   concluded that the idea of the struggle for recognition in the first
   ethics is possible and capable of allowing, with the inversion of
   meaning, that the Other determines both as reconciliation and as
   redistribution the struggle for recognition in order to establish a
   slow, visceral and capable of a revolution in the coming of time.},

   Analysis. Some Contributions Arising of the Argentine Experience},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The most important analyses of the varieties of capitalism in Latin
   America reflected on the hierarchical and predominant character of
   transnational capital or the strategic centrality of the state in its
   neo-developmentalist version compared to its neo-liberal precedent.
   However, given the persistence of the usualperipheral structural
   characteristics (in particular, economic transnationalization) and the
   `right turn', it is possible to point out disregard of the
   historical-structural trajectory of Latin American countries and the
   neoliberal hegemonic context as having impeded a more adequate
   interpretation of recent Latin American experiences. With reference to
   the Argentine experience, the work suggests that the deepening of the
   transnational domain and the marginalization of other productive actors
   such as SMEs should not be seen as an institutional failure, but as a
   specific form of state operation in the peripheral context. In this
   regard, this analysis connects state intervention with the role of
   international organizations (for example, the World Bank
   orInter-American Development Bank) as diffuser nodes of ideas and policy
   approaches focused on a `correct competitiveness' that has induced the
   state to act conditionally on behalf of the transnational domain of the
   domestic productive structure.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the problematic aspects of
   the judicial executive process, considering its properties and the
   classification of its stages. The methodological basis of the study are
   the general and special methods of scientific knowledge (inductive,
   analytical, hermeneutic, systemic and others). The results of the study
   include the analysis of scientific approaches to the essence,
   properties, classification of stages of the executive process and
   argumentation of theoretical proposals and informed practices. Moreover,
   the authors' conclusions on certain topics are set out, a new original
   definition of ``stages of the executive process{''} and their original
   new classification is based. The practical importance of the results is
   that the conclusions and proposals made significantly enrich procedural
   science during the implementation of judicial decisions; it will be
   useful for the subjects of enforcement proceedings (implementing agents,
   parties to enforcement proceedings) in the exercise of their procedural
   rights and the performance of their procedural functions. The
   conclusions presented based on the analysis can be used to generalize
   executive practice.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on research in geography, linguistics, and political
   science to explain the incidence of language regions and their effect on
   regional authority. It conjectures a chain of mechanisms beginning with
   the physical and political barriers to human interaction and culminating
   with contemporary patterns of regional authority. Using data on 1767
   regions in 95 countries, it finds causal power in the claim that the
   linguistic distinctiveness of a region reflects the ratio of internal
   interaction to external interaction. Finally, the effects of a language
   region for regional authority depend decisively on the openness of the
   political regime.},

   Metagovernance Norm and Its Global Health Implementation},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {152-163},
Abstract = {SDG 17 calls for the international community to ``strengthen the means
   of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable
   development,{''} emphasizing the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships
   for achieving the SDGs. Policy documents are replete with statements on
   the necessity of `meaningful' engagement, especially with civil
   society-without clarifying what `meaningful' stands for. In this
   article, we develop an analytical approach to partnership as a form and
   norm of metagovernance. Partnership as a metanorm is about the roles and
   relations of different sets of actors. We suggest operationalizing the
   concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability
   and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of
   partnership in terms of `meaningfulness.' We apply our analytical model
   to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being for All
   (GAP), a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to
   accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030
   Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of
   implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of
   partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as `meaningful' with respect
   to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer
   lessons for attaining normative standards of `meaningfulness' and
   highlight implications for future research on partnerships.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the analysis of the complex dynamics behind
   the construction of EU memory politics in the European Parliament by
   focusing on an understudied group of actors: Italian Members of the
   European Parliament (MEPs). Italian MEPs so far have remained on the
   margins of most of the main European Parliament initiatives regarding
   memory politics. The only exception to this rule could be observed
   during the accession process of Slovenia and Croatia. This article
   contextualises all instances of mnemonic activism of the Italian MEPs in
   the period 1999-2019. It investigates the specific narratives put
   forward by Italian actors and their embedding in the wider European
   memory framework by studying debate protocols, motions for resolutions,
   parliamentary questions and minutes of working group meetings in the EP.},

Abstract = {During the years of economic crisis and austerity, and the subsequent
   economic growth dependent on real estate and tourism, housing has
   returned into the spotlight on the political agenda in Southern European
   countries and cities, where activists and social movements scaled up
   their struggles and created bridges with institutional actors, fostering
   policy change. The latter, however, did not happen in Italy. In this
   article, based on exploratory case study research carried out in the
   city of Turin, we present three themes that help explain what we call
   the `absent politicization' of housing in Italy during the last decade:
   a multi-actor, multilevel housing policy capable of defusing specific
   problems; the absence of bridges between politicized and institutional
   actors; and the role played by party-politics, with attention to
   `populist' Movimento 5 Stelle in power in Turin. By focusing on
   differences with Southern Europe, we contribute to overcoming
   dichotomies that have long dominated comparative housing studies; and
   contribute to linking housing studies with contentious urban politics in
   the post-crisis years.},

Abstract = {How has populism transformed party systems in Europe? I survey the
   varieties of populism, the sources of their support and the different
   ways that they appeal to voters. I use data from the Chapel Hill Expert
   Survey to explore whether populist parties are intensifying competition
   on the cultural dimension, accelerating the decline of mainstream
   parties, and increasing polarization. I argue that while left and center
   populist parties have upended existing structures of competition, it is
   longstanding conservative parties, remodeled using ethnopopulism, that
   have been the most consequential for the substance of political
   competition and the trajectory of domestic politics. I consider the
   behavior of incumbents and argue that varieties of populism should shape
   our expectations of what happens when populists rule: While left
   populist parties in power over the last decade have tended to become
   more ordinary, sometimes even shedding antiestablishment and anti-EU
   positions, ethnopopulist parties in power have used harsh
   ``us-versus-them{''} appeals, misinformation, and democratic backsliding
   in their pursuit of more power.},

Abstract = {As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the
   principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved to take the
   form of a contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development
   and the people's ever-growing need for a better life. In order to meet
   this need through institutional construction, it is necessary (1) to
   promote high-quality development, building a modernized economy so as to
   meet the increased material and cultural needs of the people; (2) to
   achieve a sense of gain, happiness and security among the people through
   scientific institutional construction; (3) to satisfy people's new needs
   for democracy, the rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and
   environmental protection through efficient institutional construction;
   (4) to establish and steadily improve a national system of basic public
   services to ensure universal access to childcare, education, employment,
   medical services, care of elderly people, housing, and social welfare
   assistance, and to continue to advance towards common prosperity for all
   of Chinese society; (5) to provide better education, more stable jobs,
   higher incomes, more reliable social security, more advanced heath care,
   more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment,
   and to allow the younger generation to grow, work and live in better
   conditions through comprehensive, fully-fledged institutions and an
   enhanced governance system.},

Title = {Killing representative democracy? Party switching and MP's replacements
   in the Polish parliament},
Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {39-52},
Abstract = {Studies concerning the dynamics of party systems between parliamentary
   elections are usually based on legislative party switching analyses.
   This issue was considered and proved in some Western European case
   studies as well as in some comparative analyses dedicated to the
   parliaments in the consolidated democracies. But the personal structures
   of the parliaments in the East-Central European countries are impacted
   by more than just party switching processes. In this article we propose
   adopting a broader concept of intraparliamentary volatility, which
   includes both party switching and replacements of parliamentary
   mandates. Using data from a full term, 2011-2015, we reconstructed
   chronological changes in the personal structure of the lower house of
   the Polish parliament, placing them on a specially created timeline with
   the intervals marked for each month and distinguishing between change
   resulted from party switching and replacement of parliamentary mandate.
   During the period we analyzed the number of independent deputies and the
   number of parties in the parliament increase alongside with the
   approaching of the next election. We claim this indicates a stable level
   of intraparliamentary volatility - immanent for the party systems
   between parliamentary elections - but this could rise when some special
   occurrences (i.e. other types of elections or splits within the relevant
   political party) take place.},

Abstract = {Do politicians tend to adopt unpopular policies when the media and the
   public are distracted by other events? We examine this question by
   analyzing the timing of executive orders signed by U.S. presidents over
   the past four decades. We find robust evidence that executive orders are
   more likely to be signed on the eve of days when the news is dominated
   by other important stories that can crowd out coverage of executive
   orders. This relationship only holds in periods of divided government
   when unilateral presidential actions are more likely to be criticized by
   Congress. The effect is driven by executive orders that are more likely
   to make the news and to attract negative publicity, particularly those
   on topics on which president and Congress disagree. Finally, the timing
   of executive orders appears to be related to predictable news but not
   unpredictable ones, which suggests it results from a deliberate and
   forward-looking PR strategy.},

Abstract = {The use of simulations has increasingly gained momentum as a way of
   captivating students' attention and enhancing learning in the classroom.
   However, despite its increasing use as a teaching tool, only recently
   have scholars increasingly empirically considered how the use of
   simulations may impact student learning. Moreover, whereas qualitative
   studies argue that simulations help student learning, mixed-methods, and
   quantitative research have been more divided on the impact of
   simulations. This study, therefore, sets out to investigate how
   simulations contribute, or not, to student learning in an American
   Foreign Policy classroom. Specifically, we analyze the use of the
   Council on Foreign Relations' Model Diplomacy simulations. We collect
   data through observation of participants, the use of pretests and
   post-tests, and surveys, and find support for the idea that simulations
   in the classroom contribute to student learning.},

   Exploring New Possibilities in a Classroom Experiment},

Abstract = {The social sciences increasingly utilize film as a teaching tool. This
   is reflected by a growing amount of publications on the topic, which are
   predominantly reporting positive results. Incorporating the medium seems
   to allow for more adaptive and engaging ways of teaching. Judging from
   the existing literature, however, its application in the classroom still
   lacks variety. Therefore, this article attempts to fully uncover the
   plethora of possibilities film offers. Focusing on international
   relations (IR), it outlines a framework which was developed for an
   introductory level course, and reports on the practical experiences that
   were made with it. When designing the course concept, the meta-theory of
   Critical Realism was used to explore the complex relationship between
   film, teaching and the subject matter of IR. It is argued that there are
   at least four educational functions of film which should be taken into
   account when teaching IR (or other subjects): productive, demarcating,
   creative and pedagogical. The participating students were supposed to
   discover and reflect on those functions during the course. Thus, instead
   of merely using film as a supplement to enhance learning effects, the
   relationship between film and IR itself functioned as a thematic
   leitmotif. Combining four feature films, accompanying literature and
   classroom discussions, this explorative attempt at teaching IR yielded
   promising results.},

Abstract = {The article proposes the notion of emotional attrition to capture the
   process through which activists working in high-risk environments may
   develop a lasting state of emotional exhaustion caused by protracted
   exposure to adversarial conditions. Combining insights from clinical
   psychology and the sociology of emotions, it outlines a novel framework
   to understand the relationship between activism, emotions, and
   disengagement. We argue that activists can develop an emotional state
   characterized by dispiriting emotions and disengaging attitudes that
   affect their well-being and ability to sustain their activism. This
   argument is grounded on an in-depth analysis of more than 130 interviews
   with local human rights activists in Colombia, Kenya, and Indonesia. By
   examining their experiences and pressures in relation to the arena of
   repression, their immediate social circle, and the broader
   sociopolitical and cultural context, we shed light on the complex
   intersections between activists' emotional challenges and the range of
   contextual and strategic factors shaping their work and lives.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of external economic intervention on political
   support and economic evaluations? We argue that economic interventions
   systematically worsen support for governing institutions and much of
   this is mediated through updating economic perceptions, at least during
   the Eurozone crisis. We evidence this with two analyses. First, we
   provide the first quasi-experimental evidence to show that intervention
   worsened both political support and economic evaluations. Second, we
   conduct a mediation analysis using Eurobarometer data to quantify how
   much of the effect of intervention is mediated by economic evaluations.
   This has broader implications for understanding how citizens react to
   international integration, international cues, and the process of
   forming judgements of political support.},

Abstract = {This study examines the influence the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), on
   national identity. Taking the case of the 2019 ESC which took place in
   Israel, this study employed a longitudinal design to examine its impact
   on different aspects of the national identity of Israeli Jews. The
   findings showed some substantives differences between those exposed to
   the contest and those not and conflicting trends in the contest's
   influence on the public: cultural patriotism and increased chauvinism,
   on the one hand, and some cosmopolitan affects, on the other. The
   article discusses these findings in light of theories on national
   identity and mega-events.},

Abstract = {Is authoritarian power ever legitimate? The contemporary political
   theory literature-which largely conceptualizes legitimacy in terms of
   democracy or basic rights-would seem to suggest not. I argue, however,
   that there exists another, overlooked aspect of legitimacy concerning a
   government's ability to ensure safety and security. While, under normal
   conditions, maintaining democracy and rights is typically compatible
   with guaranteeing safety, in emergency situations, conflicts between
   these two aspects of legitimacy can and often do arise. A salient
   example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, during which severe
   limitations on free movement and association have become legitimate
   techniques of government. Climate change poses an even graver threat to
   public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly
   authoritarian approach. While unsettling, this suggests the political
   importance of climate action. For if we wish to avoid legitimating
   authoritarian power, we must act to prevent crises from arising that can
   only be resolved by such means.},

Abstract = {Since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic
   in early 2020, several countries have moved from non-pharmaceutical
   interventions in combatting the Covid-19 pandemic to developing vaccine
   acquisition strategies. Many developed countries adopted strategies to
   secure and stockpile vaccines. Pharmaceutical firms used their
   bargaining power to negotiate steep vaccine prices in developing
   nations. Vaccine nationalism and the predatory behavior of
   pharmaceutical firms make the case for temporarily lifting intellectual
   property protections a morally compelling one. African countries must
   work together to build vaccine manufacturing capacity through scientific
   cooperation, development of human capital, and nurturing of value
   chains.},

Abstract = {This study examines interest groups' involvement in the policymaking
   process by asking the following questions: Which political and
   non-political actors do interest groups target? What are the attitudinal
   and behavioral components of their strategy? We focus on new Southern
   European democracies that have been understudied in terms of interest
   group politics. Based on an original cross-national survey administered
   in Greece, Portugal and Spain, with responses from approximately 600
   interest groups, this study argues that the attitudinal and behavioral
   dimensions are partially distinct components that need to be
   distinguished. The findings show that although groups mainly target
   governmental actors to defend their interests, parties are still
   considered important intermediaries to influence public policies.
   Moreover, organizational resources are the most significant explanatory
   factors that shape the relations between organized interests and
   policymakers, while cross-country differences do not seem to be of great
   relevance.},

Abstract = {The consensus view among political scientists is that the subjective
   social status of low-skilled workers has declined over the last decades,
   and this status loss of the working class is seen as contributing to the
   rise of the radical right. We examine the micro-foundation of this claim
   by tracing the evolution of subjective status for different social
   classes in Europe and the US. We use all available survey rounds of the
   International Social Survey Programme 1987-2017 and replicate findings
   with the European Social Survey 2002-2016. While unskilled workers
   perceive their status to be lower than members of the middle class
   everywhere, we find no relative or absolute fall in their subjective
   social status over time. Unskilled workers were at the bottom of the
   status hierarchy in the 1990s and 2010s. Our findings throw doubt on the
   narrative that sees workers' falling subjective social status as a
   prominent driver behind the rise of the radical right.},

Abstract = {Focusing on selected ``Western{''} conceptions of democracy, we expose
   and normatively evaluate their conflictual meanings. We unpack the white
   democracy of prominent ordoliberal Wilhelm Ropke, which comprises an
   elitist bias against the demos, and we discuss different assessments of
   his 1964 apologia of Apartheid South Africa. Our critical-historical
   study of Ropke's marginalized meaning of democracy traces a neglected
   anti-democratic continuity in his work that is to be contextualized
   within wider elitist (neo)liberal discourses: from his critique of
   Nazism in the 1930s to the defense of Apartheid in the 1960s. We provide
   an alternative, marginalized meaning of democracy that draws on Marxist
   political science. Such a meaning of democracy helps explain why liberal
   democratic theory is illequipped to tackle anti-democratic tendencies
   re-emerging in liberaldemo- cratic polities.},

Abstract = {In the current context of crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we
   observe a rearrangement of federative relations in Brazil, in force
   since the Federal Constitution of 1988. With the vacuum left by the lack
   of action by the federal government, new action arrangements have been
   designed by the other entities of the federation, by the states and
   municipalities. In this context, this paper aims to map the
   intergovernmental relations developed during the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Brazil based on the actions of the states. For this, we analyzed the
   regulations elaborated by the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal
   District and published in the Official Gazettes of these states between
   February and December 2020 were analyzed.},

Abstract = {States exert significant control over many different types of electoral
   institutions that influence the tone and direction of political
   representation in American democracy. Yet almost nothing is known about
   the consequences of the institution that has the greatest singular
   impact on the turnout and composition of the electorate: election
   timing. We argue that off-cycle elections will tend to produce
   governments that are not well-aligned with the political preferences of
   their median constituent. To empirically test this expectation, we
   examine the relationship between election timing and mass-elite
   congruence across local school district governments. Leveraging
   variation in election timing across districts within the same state, we
   find that board members are more likely to hold political preferences
   that are aligned with their constituents when boards are elected in on-
   versus off-cycle races. We conclude by discussing the implications of
   these findings for the study of representation and election timing,
   suggesting some possible avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {There is no doubt that technology has shaped democracy. However, it is
   also the legal rules concerning technology which have shaped and have

   democratic rules is what we need. There are libertarians today who
   deliberately design technological systems in a way that makes control by
   democratic states increasingly difficult. However, there is sufficient
   counter power and engagement, at least in Europe, to ensure that
   democracy functions and we work together to produce rules that are
   sensible for the future of democracy and confirm the supremacy of
   democracy over technology and business interests.},

Abstract = {Since 2015, the Canadian Senate has undergone a series of reforms
   designed to make it more independent, ideologically diverse, and active
   in the legislative process. We use loyalty scores and vote scaling
   algorithms to situate the voting behaviour of senators, focusing
   primarily on the 41st and 42nd Parliaments (2011-2019), the period just
   before and after the changes, respectively. We find that the reforms
   have led to a loosening of party discipline across all parties and
   caucuses but that independent senators appointed under the reformed
   process are the most likely supporters of the government's agenda. We
   also find that the Senate has become more willing to use its formal
   powers.},

Abstract = {Contemporary American politics is notable for its high levels of anger
   and partisan antipathy. While these developments are attributable in
   large part to societal-level sociopolitical trends, I argue that they
   are also the result of politicians' deliberate and strategic attempts to
   elicit mass-level anger. In this paper, I analyze over one million
   tweets sent by members of the 116th Congress to demonstrate that
   political elites do appeal to anger and that the angriest of these
   appeals are most likely to come from the most ideologically extreme
   Members of Congress - that is, the most liberal Democrats and the most
   conservative Republicans. I further show that this relationship is
   stronger for Democratic politicians, and that authoring tweets with a
   greater amount of anger generates more engagement. The results suggest
   that as long as politicians have an incentive to appeal to mass-level
   anger, the divisions characterizing American politics are likely to
   persist.},

Abstract = {Despite increased understanding of Indigenous environmental values,
   governments still fail to respectfully incorporate these values into
   environmental policy. Deliberative democratic theory can help to better
   understand this problem. First, by recognising Indigenous democracy as a
   distinct deliberative system and drawing attention to this `invisible'
   democratic contribution to the larger democratic system. Second, the
   resistance of Indigenous environment policy to openly address Indigenous
   environmental values, can be understood as weakness in transmission
   between Indigenous peoples and the settler state. Third, Indigenous
   deliberative forums linked to the state may help overcome some of these
   barriers in environment policy. Deliberative democracy draws attention
   to environmental relations between Indigenous peoples and the state not
   simply as Indigenous policy making but as democracy making.},

Abstract = {Non-state armed groups (NSAGs) are a prominent phenomenon in the
   discourse on security in Africa. They serve as either anti-state agents
   orchestrating violence or fill security void by complementing state
   security. This paper analyzes the activities of the Civilian Joint Task
   Force (CJTF) as a variant of non-state armed groups within the context
   of community-based counterterrorism initiative in Borno State, Nigeria.
   Data were collected through interviews and focus group discussion in
   selected communities affected by Boko Haram. The findings revealed that
   the use of the CJTF yielded positive results as they helped the military
   in intelligence gathering, knowledge of the landscape, translation of
   the local language, and identification of Boko Haram members within the
   community and in combat operations. Challenges, such as the
   highhandedness and deceitful nature of some members, hampered the
   utility of the CJTF. The paper concludes that the CJTF as a
   community-based response to security underscores citizens as active
   agents, not mere passive victims in the fight against terrorism.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about the public policy success of measures taken
   in response to COVID-19 from health, political and economic
   perspectives. However, considerably less effort has been put into
   evaluating the coronavirus public policy responses according to moral
   frameworks. This seems somewhat surprising given that coronavirus
   responses were principally motivated by moral considerations -
   especially concern for the vulnerable. The main contribution of this
   study is to show how the inclusion of a specifically moral lens can
   contribute to new learning and policy refinement. To do so, I employ the
   natural law principle of subsidiarity which is chiefly concerned about
   what is required to balance human dignity against the common good -
   precisely the values most in tension during the pandemic. I conclude
   with some observations on the importance of adopting a moral lens as
   part of a broad multidisciplinary approach to assessing public policy.},

Abstract = {This article is about Indigenous territorial title and land rights, and
   specifically those of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg Nation. In 1983, the
   Algonquins of Pikwakanagan, residing in the province of Ontario,
   petitioned the Crown to recognize Algonquin territorial title and rights
   to 36,000 square kilometres of their natal homelands in the Ottawa River
   watershed. With negotiations beginning in the early 1990s, an
   Agreement-in-Principle was developed and ratified in 2016, the
   penultimate step to the largest modern treaty in Ontario's history. In
   this article, we examine the argument for moral rights to territory, not
   in terms of the Canadian or international legal order, nor even through
   examining the documents and voice of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg, but
   through the lens of an argument that has been advanced as the basis of
   the international territorial rights of states. We argue that the
   justifications for state rights territory-grounded in the considerations
   that ensue from an analysis of occupancy groups-provides a stronger
   claim to territorial jurisdiction and title in the case of the Algonquin
   Anishinaabeg Nation than the competing claim by the Canadian state.},

Abstract = {How does poverty influence political participation? This question has
   interested political scientists since the early days of the discipline,
   but providing a definitive answer has proved difficult. This article
   focuses on one central aspect of poverty-the experience of acute
   financial hardship, lasting a few days at a time. Drawing on classic
   models of political engagement and novel theoretical insights, I argue
   that by inducing stress, social isolation, and feelings of alienation,
   acute financial hardship has immediate negative effects on political
   participation. Inference relies on a natural experiment afforded by the
   sequence of bank working days that causes short-term financial
   difficulties for the poor. Using data from three million individuals,
   personal interviews, and 1,100 elections in Germany, I demonstrate that
   acute financial hardship reduces both turnout intentions and actual
   turnout. The results imply that the financial status of the poor on
   election day can have important consequences for their political
   representation.},

Abstract = {Through a systematic review of the paradigm of contemporary social
   science research, this paper explores the changes that technologies and
   algorithms bring to traditional social science methodology. There is a
   large amount of literature discussing how the application of newly
   developed technologies provides new solutions to old problems, but
   little research has been done on how they reshape old problems into new
   ones. Specifically, how does the development of research tools
   restructure the criteria for a good study and determine the right
   questions to ask, and how do computer simulations and artificial
   intelligence reform social science methodology by changing our
   presuppositions about humans and society? This article intends to fill
   the gap by analyzing the evolution of social science methodology and its
   epistemological impacts.},

Abstract = {This paper examines Russia's actions in Libya in the context of its
   pursuit of great power status. Drawing on a theoretical framework of
   Social Identity Theory, which had been developed and popularized in IR
   by the scholars Larson and Shevchenko, the article argues that Russia's
   Libya policy consists of two strategies. First, it pursues social
   creativity through versatile diplomacy, which has positioned it as an
   invaluable mediator. Moreover, Russia relies also on social competition
   by supporting Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar. While these strategies
   raised Russia's profile, the ultimate success of status-seeking
   strategies depends on the recognition by the higher-status holders.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a novel theoretical framework to account for the
   combined effects of regime type and patterns of executive authority on
   legislative party unity. We argue that broad presidential legislative
   powers favour coordination between the president and legislative parties
   under pure presidentialism, whereas under semi-presidentialism, strong
   presidents increase the potential for intra-executive conflict,
   submitting parties to cross-cutting pressures. We expect higher levels
   of legislative authority to increase party unity under presidentialism
   but decrease under semi-presidentialism. Moreover, when presidents are
   endowed with limited legislative authority, semi-presidentialism
   produces higher levels of party unity than presidentialism, but for
   sufficiently high levels of legislative authority there should be no
   difference across regime types. Our analyses of 1,586 pooled
   observations for 72 democracies from all regions of the world using the
   V-Dem measure of party cohesion demonstrate that presidential
   legislative authority, in combination with regime type, is indeed a key
   predictor of party unity.},

Abstract = {While it is a point of agreement in contemporary republican political
   theory that property ownership is closely connected to freedom as
   non-domination, surprisingly little work has been done to elucidate the
   nature of this connection or the constraints on property regimes that
   might be required as a result. In this paper, I provide a systematic
   model of the boundaries within which republican property systems must
   sit and explore some of the wider implications that thinking of property
   in these terms may have for republicans. The boundaries I focus on
   relate to the distribution of property and the application of types of
   property claims over particular kinds of goods. I develop this model
   from those elements of non-domination most directly related to the
   operation of a property regime: (a) economic independence, (b) limiting
   material inequalities, and (c) the promotion of common goods. The limits
   that emerge from this analysis support intuitive judgments that animate
   much republican discussion of property distribution. My account diverges
   from much orthodox republican theory, though, in challenging the primacy
   of private property rights in the realization of economic independence.
   The value of property on republican terms can be realized without
   private ownership of the means of production.},

   Public Reactions to the Kenyan Supreme Court's Role in the 2017 Election

Abstract = {Public support is central to the emergence of judicial power.
   Conventional wisdom holds that citizen commitment to democracy and the
   rule of law sustains this support. An implication is that such
   commitments should protect courts from partisan backlash following
   contentious rulings. But this remains largely untested. The Kenyan
   Supreme Court's historic 2017 elections rulings provide an unusual
   opportunity to test this expectation. After annulling the incumbent
   president's victory, the Court upheld his controversial repeat-election
   win. With data from a national panel survey-conducted before and after
   the repeat election-we find important partisan-based
   withdrawals/increases in judicial-power support. There is no evidence
   that democratic principles attenuated partisan backlash; some were
   associated with its amplification. However, partisan losers maintain
   moderately high support despite backlash. Results advance debates about
   public support for judicial power and provide new evidence about public
   reactions to assertions of judicial authority in new democracies and
   electoral autocratic regimes.},

Abstract = {We explore the effects of a particular facet of separation of
   powers-namely, the executive's independence from the legislature-on
   maintaining a norm of legislative restraint in which antagonistic
   factions refrain from passing laws that infringe on their rival's
   liberties. Our main result establishes that executive independence may
   sometimes undermine and at other times facilitate legislative restraint,
   depending on the probabilities with which the factions hold legislative
   and executive power. Our results contribute to the larger game-theoretic
   literature exploring the effects of political institutions; our results
   also contribute to the literature exploring how institutions designed to
   protect liberty affect tacit cooperation among rival factions.},

Abstract = {Domenico Losurdo traveled to Beijing for the first time in the 1970s,
   when (Western) Maoism thrilled a large number of Western progressive
   intellectuals. But when these intellectuals turned away from China-which
   they accused of having consolidated an ``illiberal totalitarian
   political regime{''} but also of having ``restored capitalism{''}-by
   contrast Losurdo remained a friend of China. For him it was from the
   Chinese experience and its ability to survive the end of the USSR that
   one could draw inspiration to confront the most important event in the
   life of an entire generation: the radical crisis of Marxism and the
   defeat of the communist movement in the West. Western Marxism, born out
   of the shock of the First World War, is characterized by a utopian
   messianism prone to anarchism (the thesis of the extinction of the
   state, for example, or the claim of an immediate cancelation of borders,
   or hostility towards economy and technology). In China, on the other
   hand, Marxism has become the basis of national awareness and the
   consequent liberation struggle. Once political independence is reached,
   however, the revolution continues today in order to achieve economic
   independence. Hence the need for a re-elaboration of the same Marxian
   category of class struggle.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author focuses on Henri Lefebvre's critique of
   urban functionalism, whose ``founding father{''} is recognized as Le
   Corbusier. The aim is to explain how Lefebvre studied urban
   functionalism in order to develop an innovative critique of the Fordist
   modernity that developed in France following the Second World War. For
   the French sociologist, investigating urban functionalism thus meant
   investigating, from the spatial point of view, the way in which the
   capitalist development of the last century was modernized.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to analyse the impact of three forms of
   involvement in organized civil society - as `participant', as `member'
   and as `volunteer' - on self-assessed quality of life when checking for
   coherence between the three forms of participation. The article is
   inspired by both Lim and Putnam's claim that close social networks
   around meaningful and identity-bearing activities increase self-assessed
   quality of life and Stebbins' claim that life satisfaction is an
   essential by-product of `serious leisure'. This article utilizes data
   from a digital survey study conducted among adult citizens in Denmark,
   which 2514 citizens answered. The questionnaire contained a broad range
   of questions regarding participation in leisure activities, membership
   in associations, engagement in voluntary work, subjective
   life-satisfaction, self-assessed health and social background of the
   respondents. The statistical regression analysis shows a correlation
   between volunteering in general and self-assessed quality of life, but
   the correlation is relatively weak. However, the analysis does not show
   a significant correlation between the quality of life and membership in
   an association and participation in `serious leisure'. Of the other
   variables included, self-assessed health, in particular, contributes to
   explaining the variation in the self-assessed quality of life.},

Abstract = {The recent wave of electoral success for right-wing populists has
   coincided with an increase in political scandals as well as a new,
   neo-populist type, of scandals. Thus, it has been argued that the public
   might have become increasingly numb to scandals and that scandalous
   behaviour by populist politicians is often neglected as part of their
   `typical' behavior. In this article, we explore how involvement in
   neo-populist scandals affects the public's trust in individual
   politicians and whether this effect is moderated by the politician's
   party affiliation - both populist and non-populist - and party
   preferences of citizens judging a scandal. We also compare the effects
   with two other types of traditional scandals, involving financial
   misconduct or an extra-marital affair. Two factorial vignette survey
   experiments (N = 1,000 and 1,577) were carried out in 2017 and 2019 to
   explore whether and how neo-populist scandals affect trust in
   politicians under varying circumstances. The key findings are that
   neo-populist scandals clearly have negative effects on trust for a
   scandalous politician but the judgement of scandals are subject to
   strong partisanship effects. Thus, supporters of a populist party do not
   see a scandalous behaviour by a populist politician as harmful for their
   trust in that politician. This effect is not evident among supporters of
   a traditional party when `their' politician is involved in a scandal.
   Populist supporters also tend not to see scandals in general as
   especially harmful to their trust in politicians, regardless of type of
   scandal nor affiliation of a scandalous politician.},

Abstract = {Since the institutionalization of biodiversity conservation in the
   1980s, co-management has been employed as an economic policy for
   regulating the joint use of natural resources. However, barriers to its
   effectiveness may at times arise, as when imported initiatives are
   poorly acculturated to local needs. Inspired by contributions on the
   commons, globalization, and critical policy studies, we examine lapses
   in co-management and related natural resource governance practices,
   using a systematic review of policy publications on nature-reliant
   communities in the global South and North. The conclusions propose
   options through which a ``localized co-management{''} may help enhance
   the inclusion of local/indigenous people in making decisions concerning
   the use of natural resources.},

Abstract = {Decree powers are common to presidential systems; they are rarely found
   in parliamentary ones. We analyze decree powers in one such rare
   setting: India. We show that bicameral minority governments in India
   systematically use ordinances to circumvent parliament and prosecute
   their legislative agendas. They promulgate more ordinances, enact less
   legislation, and often repromulgate lapsed ordinances. These patterns
   suggest that, with bicameral minority governments, the locus of
   lawmaking shifts to the executive branch. While both majority and
   minority governments invoke ordinances, the latter do so systematically
   to get around their parliamentary deficit. In the hands of minority
   governments, then, the mechanism effectively helps to defy the will of
   the parliamentary majority. This suggests that the ordinance mechanism,
   originally introduced in the Indian constitution for limited purposes,
   has blossomed into a distinct source of-and forum for-parliamentary
   lawmaking.},

Abstract = {The present work explains the link that Carl Schmitt establishes between
   legal understanding and understanding in general, as well as the
   significance of this link for the history of philosophy. Schmitt states
   in various works that legal understanding in a broad sense coincides
   with the understanding in general. The extension operates on the basis
   that in the understanding in general there is something similar to the
   legal understanding, namely: a tension between a pole of the ideal (i.e.
   of the mind's elaborations) and a pole of the real: of concrete
   situations. This Schmittian extension marks a relevant moment in the
   history of philosophy. His position remarkably resembles later
   hermeneutical considerations by Hans-Georg Gadamer, which have not been
   noticed until now.},

Abstract = {While concerns about the public's receptivity to factual information are
   widespread, much less attention has been paid to the factual
   receptivity, or lack thereof, of elected officials. Recent survey
   research has made clear that US legislators and legislative staff
   systematically misperceive their constituents' opinions on salient
   public policies. This study reports the results from two field
   experiments designed to correct misperceptions of sitting US
   legislators. The legislators (n = 2,346) were invited to access a
   dashboard of constituent opinion generated using the 2016 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study. Despite extensive outreach efforts, only
   11 per cent accessed the information in Study 1 and only 2.3 per cent
   did so in Study 2. More troubling for democratic norms, legislators who
   accessed constituent opinion data were no more accurate at perceiving
   their constituents' opinions. The findings underscore the challenges
   confronting efforts to improve the accuracy of elected officials'
   perceptions and suggest that elected officials may indeed resist factual
   information.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long debated the positive and negative consequences of an
   aware public for the quality of governance in modern liberal
   democracies. This article extends this debate to the context of
   constitutional review by exploring how public awareness can limit the
   effective exercise of review by courts lacking strong public support.
   Incorporating aspects of both the legitimacy and separation of powers
   theories on judicial power, the author argues that public awareness
   weakens the efficacy of such unpopular courts by creating an electoral
   incentive for governments to defy adverse rulings, even when doing so
   may lead to punishment from other institutional stakeholders. The
   article develops a simple formal model that identifies how and under
   what conditions public awareness can influence an unpopular court's
   decision making. An analysis of rulings issued by the Court of Justice
   of the European Union finds support for the model's empirical
   implications.},

Abstract = {By way of Rhetorical Political Analysis, this article argues that May's
   rhetoric on Brexit undermined her statecraft and with it her capacity to
   deliver Britain's departure from the European Union. Utilising Jim
   Bulpitt's (1986) conception of statecraft, our analysis reveals how
   May's rhetoric prioritised party management and the politics of support,
   but in so doing yielded political argument hegemony to Brexiteers,
   impeding the passing of her Brexit deal and damaging her capacity for
   governing competence. We evidence these arguments by analysing the
   appeals to ethos, pathos and logos in May's key speeches between July
   2016 and July 2019, ranging from her first as Prime Minister to her
   last.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Pages = {589-615},

Abstract = {In response to the advance of right-wing populism in many Western
   democracies, political economists have sought explanations for political
   disaffection in the socioeconomic dislocations wrought by globalization,
   deindustrialization, and automation. Distrust of institutions and elites
   has been identified as a consequence of open markets and neoliberal
   governance. While affirming the public trust as a cornerstone of liberal
   democracy, this article directs analysis of the contemporary condition
   to a broader set of uniquely psychosocial and cultural dynamics. We
   identify sentiments ranging from disillusion to defiance that are now
   fueling a runaway politics narrowly defined around race, ethnicity, and
   national identity. We examine the stakes of eroding public trust in
   historical and theoretical perspective through an analysis of key works
   of Karl Polanyi, John Maynard Keynes, and E. H. Carr. Drawing parallels
   to their assessments of the interwar period, we argue that today's
   resentment politics is not singularly the product of economic hardship
   or even institutional failure, but emerges also from a breakdown of the
   social and cultural ties that underpin liberalism-a ``delicate order{''}
   built in part on sublimated psychosocial understandings of agency and
   community. Democracy again hangs in the balance.},

Abstract = {While youth suffrage is widely debated, the causal effects of being
   eligible to vote on adolescents' political attitudes are less well
   known. To gain insights into this question, we leverage data from a
   real-life quasi-experiment of voting at 16 in the city of Ghent
   (Belgium). We compare the attitudes of adolescents that were entitled to
   vote with their peers that just fell below the age cut-off. We also
   examine the effects of the enfranchisement at 18-years-old. While we
   find an effect of youth enfranchisement on attention to politics, there
   is no evidence for an effect of enfranchisement on political engagement

Abstract = {How does the changing information environment affect the degree to which
   voters make independent decisions for different offices on their
   ballots? Leveraging the gradual roll-out of broadband internet across
   the United States and across congressional districts, this study uses
   within-district variation over four election cycles to examine the
   effects of internet access on voting behavior in US legislative
   elections. The results show that the expansion of broadband resulted in
   less split-ticket voting and a lower incumbency advantage because voters
   exposed to increased high-speed internet voted in a more partisan
   fashion. Consistent with work demonstrating the effect of the internet
   on local news consumption, the results suggest that the change in the
   information environment resulting from enhanced internet access led
   voters to prioritize national considerations over local considerations.
   This has important consequences for not only how voters act, but the
   resulting incentives that elected officials confront.},

Abstract = {Why does public trust in traditional leaders vary dramatically across
   African countries? This article argues that trust in traditional leaders
   is higher in cases where: (1) the French colonial authority did not
   interfere in traditional structures and allowed leaders to operate
   outside of the colonial apparatus (as opposed to the British practice of
   augmenting the authority of traditional leaders to extract on behalf of
   the Crown within the colonial structure); (2) leaders in the
   post-independence era were not hostile towards traditional leaders; and
   (3) citizens believe traditional leaders play a positive role in meeting
   local needs vis-a-vis contemporary elected officials.},

Abstract = {The cultural dimension has been considered as an important site in
   exploring Chinese citizenship. This article examines cultural
   citizenship-making practices with a focus on rural-urban migrants and
   local radio. Since the opening-up reforms of 1979, Shenzhen, located in
   southeast China, has attracted many migrant workers and has grown into a
   prosperous migrant city. As such, Shenzhen provides a compelling case
   study in examining the relationship between media, radio in particular,
   and cultural citizenship-making in the Chinese context. Using content
   analysis and case studies, this article explores the ways in which
   Shenzhen was represented on radio during the 1990s and 2000s - key
   decades in the city's development - through a study of two specific
   radio genres: news radio and late-night talk-back radio. By exploring
   listener involvement in late-night talk-back radio, the article analyses
   the practices that were employed by migrants to satisfy their desire for
   inclusion and recognition. This article suggests that migrant listeners'
   affinity for radio was a vital component of the cultural
   citizenship-negotiating trajectory in the history of the urbanisation of
   Shenzhen. The discussion of radio, representation and inclusion has
   implications for contemporary debates surrounding citizenship in the
   digital age.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate South Korea's free trade agreement (FTA)
   initiative with priority given to the government's motives under the
   institutional structure. Two broad approaches have elaborated political
   leaders' motives for making a particular trade policy. The social
   concerns approach assumes that trade policy reflects political leaders'
   welfare concerns for the general public and its desire to achieve
   various national and international goals. In contrast, the self-interest
   approach presumes that political leaders tend to support a particular
   trade policy depending on whether the policy increases or decreases
   their real political incentives. By investigating structural changes of
   the FTA agency in South Korea, this study found that FTA motives work in
   different ways under different institutional structures.},

Abstract = {Understanding when and why White racial attitudes change is important
   for understanding their politics. Critically, surveys reveal Whites'
   views of Black Americans have been changing recently, an important
   result given conventional wisdom that these are stable orientations. I
   test four possible explanations for these shifting views: genuine
   attitude change, social desirability, partisan expressive responding,
   and changing racial attitude measure performance. Importantly, these
   explanations produce observationally equivalent survey toplines. To
   adjudicate between them, I use the measurement equivalence framework and
   examine how Whites answer the racial resentment measure. Evidence from
   multigroup confirmatory factor analysis models supports genuine attitude
   change. Substantively, this suggests these changes may have important
   political implications. Methodologically, it suggests partisan
   expressive responding may have limits, indicates social desirability
   pressures have not changed how Whites answer at least one racial
   attitude measure, and offers additional validity evidence for the racial
   resentment measure.},

Abstract = {Why did the Myanmar military initiate mass atrocities in Rakhine state
   alongside radical democratic reforms? We argue that the atrocities in
   Rakhine were driven by intra-military rivalry. The transition to
   democracy was a generational transition of the military leadership that
   brought pre-existing rivalries within the military to the fore. As is
   common to military regimes, Myanmar military elites rely on regional
   support bases. The democratic transition coincided with a transition of
   power from generals with a Western support base - e.g. Shwe Mann - to
   generals with an Eastern support base - e.g. Thein Sein and Min Aung
   Hlaing. We argue that atrocities can strengthen control over security
   services by raising militias, locking rival units in the execution of
   the violence, and restructuring units under a new command. We
   demonstrate how atrocities in the Western Rakhine province served to
   consolidate power over the western faction of the military and allowed
   General Hlaing to consolidate.},

Abstract = {The processes of modern urbanization across the Global South have
   generated an intense debate. While mainstream researchers view it as
   largely inclusive and advocating for slum development, critics argue
   that this process has an inherent tendency to displace slum. Given this
   perspective, the authors show that there is, in fact, a change in the
   location of Indian slums and the slum population from city centers to
   city fringes, where fringes are found to be significantly and
   consistently unprivileged in terms of an array of infrastructural
   facilities in and around the slums. This paper also argues that the
   typical process of urbanization and increasing urban inequality is
   inducing this changing location of slums. The analyses indicate a forced
   relocation of the slum population away from the city centers towards an
   inferior standard of living on the city fringes. This paper uses Indian
   slum-level data for 2001-2012, undertakes various advanced statistical
   analyses, and presents a basic theoretical framework.},

Abstract = {The suggestion that individuals should be considered disadvantaged, and
   consequently entitled to compensation, only if they consider themselves
   disadvantaged (Dworkin's `continuity test') is initially appealing.
   However, it also faces problems. First, if individuals are routinely
   mistaken, then we routinely fail to assist the deserving. Second, if
   individuals assess their circumstances differently then the state will
   provide different levels of assistance to people in identical
   situations. Thus, should we instead ignore individuals' convictions and
   provide assistance that some, at least, do not feel they need? One set
   of cases where this dilemma is salient are those in which disabled
   individuals disagree over whether they are disadvantaged. Focussing on
   these, I argue that despite objections, individuals should have a voice
   in determining whether they are disadvantaged. However, I contend that
   our goal should not be ensuring continuity with individuals' ethical
   convictions (concerning the pursuits they deem worthwhile or valuable),
   but their convictions regarding whether they are relevantly
   disadvantaged (whether they have what they are entitled to).},

Abstract = {This paper uses a case study of Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United
   Front to help explain when and where non-state armed groups (NSAGs) use
   violence, and what type of violence such groups use. The first part of
   the paper compares `ideological' and `instrumental' theories and finds
   strong support for `instrumental' explanations, particularly
   contestation theory. The second part of the paper seeks to explain the
   patterns of contestation, which the existing scholarship treats as an
   independent variable, and finds that the patterns of contestation are
   explained by the interaction of the state and NSAG's policy goals.},

Abstract = {In this article Amy Allen, Rainer Forst and Isaac Reed debate the four
   dimensions of power, as framed by Mark Haugaard, in The Four Dimensions
   of Power, and Haugaard responds. This discussion involves the following:
   the relationship between agency and authority; ideology and
   acquiescence; power-over, power-to and power-with; structural
   constraint; bias and exclusion; the distinction between deep and shallow
   conflicts; the concept of reification; foundational Truth claims and
   modest truths; how social ontology or being-in-the-world relates to
   power; a pragmatist account of democracy as nonzero-sum power and its
   normative grounds; and a discussion of the relative value of theories.},

   political capture},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {779-795},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The research question of this article is to what extent have populist
   governments in Austria, Italy and Poland affected the bureaucratic
   autonomy of career diplomats? The starting hypothesis is that populist
   governments have a structural conflict with career diplomacy and are
   tempted to reduce their power through political capture. The case
   studies of populist governments are as follows: in Austria, the
   coalition between the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPo) and the
   Christian-Democratic Austrian People's Party (oVP) between and December
   2017 and May 2019; in Italy, the coalition between the two populist
   parties Five Stars Movement (M5S) and the League (La Lega) between June
   2018 and September 2019; in Poland, the national-conservative coalition
   in which the Law and Justice Party (PiS) is dominant since October 2015.
   The first part explains why there is a structural conflict between
   populist governments and career diplomats. The second part analyses the
   case of a successful political capture of career diplomats by a populist
   government in Poland. The third part contrasts the previous statement by
   showing the lack of political capture of career diplomats by populist
   governments in Austria and Italy. Finally, the fourth part demonstrates
   why in the case of populist governments at power, career diplomats are
   often seen as an insurance to international partners, that populist
   governments themselves may have an interest in considering positively.},

Abstract = {Day to day governance of civilians is not solely the purview of states.
   Rulemaking, rule-enforcing, and goods and services provision are central
   components of governance, yet in many instances it is non-state actors
   who assume these functions. We advance the study of governance by rebel
   groups engaged in armed confrontation against state governments. We
   identify five key areas of research where the field of rebel governance
   is best poised to go: the study of multi-level governance, rebel use of
   self-constraining or hand-tying behaviors, synergy between institutional
   form and domestic legitimacy, the nuanced role of territorial control in
   governance, and short- and longer-term impacts of rebel governance on
   post-conflict outcomes. In each area, we draw attention to the lessons
   already learned, interrogate key assumptions in existing work, raise
   arguments that remain under- or uninvestigated, and focus on the next
   frontier in the exploration of rebel governance. Learning more about the
   ways that rebel groups govern informs our understanding of armed
   conflict and its resolution, as well as provides broader lessons about
   the study of governance.},

Abstract = {Vietnam used to be isolated from the international community but has now
   become the Southeast Asian country with the most strategic partnerships
   with other Indo-Pacific countries. In Vietnam, over the past decade,
   `strategic partnership' has also become a popular concept in the
   country's foreign policy and media. However, the current literature does
   not yet include significant study on Vietnam's new foreign policy
   practice. This article attempts to fill the gap by examining Vietnam's
   use of `strategic partnership', how Vietnam defines the term and how its
   partnerships operate in practice. By examining case studies of three
   strategic partnerships between Vietnam and India, Japan, and the
   Philippines, this article argues that the way Vietnam views strategic
   partnership shares quite a few common features with existing studies'
   definitions. It also concludes that the country has rapidly forged
   strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific more than any other Southeast
   Asian country because of both external factors and internal demands.
   Despite limitations, SP is a valuable political and diplomatic tool for
   Vietnam.},

Abstract = {While municipal elections are of less importance than national ones, the
   study of local election communication shows that there are cases when
   political actors frame them as first-order elections. In 2019, the
   opposition managed to challenge the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance in
   Hungary, and gained mayoral offices in strategically important places.
   In the campaign, PM Viktor Orban `s party stressed the importance of
   local elections, utilizing a complex conspiracy theory. They argued that
   the stakes were high because Hungary's sovereignty was at risk. In this
   article, I evaluate the findings of a content analysis conducted on 86
   speeches that were performed as part of the ruling party's election
   campaign with a special focus on topics and character remarks.},

Abstract = {Cabinet committees are important sites of executive politics in Canada.
   This article examines the extent to which two representational
   attributes-gender and region-determine influence, as a function of
   cabinet committee structure. Employing a dataset of ministers under the
   three most recent prime ministers, I find that female ministers are less
   likely than male ministers to be influential in terms of connections to
   other ministers, to belong to the core of most influential ministers and
   to be represented on the most powerful committees or chairing
   committees. However, there is evidence of improvement over time. While
   regional representation is an imperative in cabinet making for Canadian
   prime ministers, its role in determining ministerial influence within
   committees is not evident: ministers from less-represented regions are
   no more likely to be influential than other ministers. This analysis
   highlights a neglected but central arena for social representation in
   Canadian government.},

Abstract = {We investigate how the international investment regime turned into an
   investment vehicle. Through the process called third-party funding,
   financiers back international legal claims by firms against countries
   and in turn seek a share of any potential award. More generally, we add
   to debates on how international regimes evolve and at times generate
   unanticipated consequences. Building off work on the sociology of
   fields, we argue that institutional change can occur when individuals
   from different fields interact. Each field has its own local practices
   and beliefs about how governance institutions like international regimes
   function. When professionals from one field analyze problems in another,
   they use the tools from their native field. If potential solutions
   provide material and status benefits for the dominant actors in the
   targeted regime, cross-field coalitions can form and change the targeted
   regime's practice. As hedge funds in the finance field and lawyers in
   the international law field sought to reinvent themselves after the 2008
   financial crisis, they teamed up to make Investor State Dispute
   Settlement a speculator's game. Theoretically, we embed theories of
   regime change within larger social relations, highlighting the
   importance of informal interactions among regime operators for the use
   and function of governance institutions. We underscore the role of field
   interdependence as actors engage in contestation across social and
   political domains. Empirically, we demonstrate the way in which
   financialization has had far-reaching consequences that extend well
   beyond traditional economic sectors, reconfiguring the practice of
   international law.},

Abstract = {Supply management is a long-standing agricultural policy in Canada that
   applies to dairy, poultry and eggs. To date, there exists no academic
   research on the correlates or dynamics of public support for supply
   management. We use data collected from the Digital Democracy Project's
   study of the 2019 Canadian election, including results from a
   between-subjects framing experiment, to show that support for supply
   management is most opposed by economic conservatives. However, we find
   support to be highly malleable by framing: it increases when respondents
   are primed to think of the policy as away of protecting farmers and
   decreases when they are primed to think of its costs to consumers.
   Contrary to expectations, framing effects are not stronger when messages
   are ideologically congenial or among those with high levels of policy
   knowledge. If anything, effects are stronger among those with lower
   levels of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Why do targets of social movement activities respond to movements in the
   ways they do? Many factors play a role in shaping targets' responses to
   social movement activities. This article focuses on one particular
   factor: targets' perceptions of social movement claims. The article
   argues that a target's understanding of a social movement's claims helps
   shape its response, which, in turn, shapes the evolution of the social
   movement. Two cases of social mobilization, one in response to water
   privatization in Bolivia and the other in response to rising corn prices
   in Mexico, serve as a lens through which to explore these issues. In
   each case, differences in how public authorities understood the
   movements' claims help explain why they reacted in starkly different
   ways to the emerging movements. Where officials appreciated the symbolic
   value of the good at stake, they acted quickly to curtail resistance.
   Where officials failed to grasp those meanings, they dismissed the
   potential for widespread mobilization and inadvertently accelerated
   movement growth.},

   in political communication is a necessary ongoing consideration in all
   expert analysis of political communication in order to avoid important
   excesses of politics ranging from injustice to genocide. The key
   antidote to achieving ethical rather than unethical conduct in political
   communication is a careful praxis of discursive complexity. As the 21st
   century intensifies its attachments to vehicles of communication rooted
   in artificial intelligence, we as expert practitioners must intense our
   pedagogy and research toward the encouragement of human dissent. The
   potential mismanagement of public opinion could through technological
   savvy unleash nightmares comparable or suprassing the Third Reich in the

Abstract = {The political autonomy of Chinese provinces derives from their economic
   independence. After the 2008 economic crisis, budget deficits increased
   significantly in most Chinese provinces, making them more reliant on
   financial support from Beijing. Provinces suffering high deficits will
   lose their political clout in both local and national politics.
   Therefore, provinces with large deficits tend to be less resistant to
   the enforcement of the law of avoidance and underrepresented in the
   Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. We find that in
   provincial standing committees, the members who are native or have more
   birthplace ties are more likely to be ranked behind the outsiders,
   especially so in provinces with a high level of deficits. We also find
   that provincial-standing-committee members from high-deficit provinces
   have a low possibility to obtain seats in the party's Central Committee.
   These findings confirm the close relationship between economic
   independence and political autonomy of Chinese provinces. In addition,
   we find that the logic of economic independence cannot depict the whole
   picture and that regional pluralism is also an important concern when
   the party manages its provincial leadership teams.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new dataset on regionalist actors' territorial
   demands and frames in Europe. The FraTerr dataset advances on existing
   datasets by proposing a more fine-grained understanding of regionalist
   actors' territorial demands, and is the first to provide comparative
   data on how these are framed. Methodologically, it develops an original
   coding scheme for the qualitative content analysis of political
   documents. Empirically, this approach is applied to a comparative study
   of regionalist parties and civil society actors in twelve European
   regions. A preliminary analysis of the data provides new evidence of the
   complexity of regionalist actors' territorial demands and the
   multi-dimensional nature of their framing strategies. The dataset has
   implications for the study of regionalist actors and issues, and for
   broader scholarly efforts at estimating political actors' territorial
   issue positions and framing strategies.},

Abstract = {According to Steven Lubet, documentation freezes facts in time. For this
   reason, it is, he thinks, more reliable than other kinds of evidence.
   That makes it especially useful for fact checking. However, this is not
   a realistic way to read for evidence in documents. It ignores or
   downplays a crucial fact that inheres to all paperwork, which
   ethnographers have long heeded: documents do not report on facts; they
   render them. Ethnographically informed readings of paperwork that attend
   both to facts and to how they are rendered are, by contrast, realistic.
   In this contribution, I discuss why and illustrate with reference to two
   studies of policing and law in Thailand.},

Abstract = {Recent work highlights the importance of pre-modern political practices
   for explaining persistent institutional features, including
   representative democracy. Typically, this argument is institutional in
   nature-pre-industrial practices are hypothesized to either bolster or
   retard the transmission of democratic institutions. This article
   proposes a separate channel through which legacies of early statehood
   continue to impact the prospects of democratic governance. Using survey
   data from Africa, we document a positive relationship between early
   statehood development and support for autocratic rule among ordinary
   Africans. This finding is robust to a wide range of pre- and
   post-treatment covariates, country and survey round fixed effects, as
   well as an instrumental-variable design. The identified relationship is
   particularly prominent in respondents from precolonially centralized
   ethnic groups in former British colonies, suggesting the importance of
   locally surviving traditional institutions for propagation of norms that
   owe their origins to precolonial autocratic socialization.},

Title = {Figuring out political rhetoric: a quantitative content analysis of the
   use of rhetorical figures on the 2018 Flemish municipal election day},

Abstract = {Recent decades of research into political discourse and political
   rhetoric have revealed how language and rhetorical figures in particular
   are employed by politicians to shape political realities and persuade
   voters. However, little is known about the overall use of figures beyond
   metaphors. Therefore, a quantitative content analysis was conducted on
   the use of figures by Flemish politicians to explore which figures were
   used and how political (election result and political affiliation),
   speaker-related (seniority and renown) and delivery context factors
   (organization level and presence of the press) might influence this use.
   Our sample revealed both a great variety and frequency of figures beyond
   metaphors. Our findings also suggest a gap between rhetorical theory and
   practice as the range of figures studied most in literature does not
   accord with the figures found in our sample. Moreover, striking
   similarities were observed in figure use across speeches, as half of the
   used figures were repetitions. Although the figure use was not dependent
   of the political context or speaker-related factors, it was dependent of
   the delivery context, which suggests the existence of rhetorical
   registers. These findings might suggest that instead of being mainly
   strategic, the use of figures could also reflect a shared cultural view
   on political speech making. Theoretical and practical implications for
   rhetorical speech analysis are discussed and illustrated.},

Abstract = {Most studies of public opinion towards the European Union focus on
   attitudes regarding the past and present of the European Union. This
   study fills a gap by addressing attitudes towards the European Union's
   future. We expand on a recently developed approach measuring preferences
   for eight concrete future European Union scenarios that represent the
   ongoing political and public debate, employing original survey data
   collected in 2019 in 10 European Union countries. We assess
   cross-national differences in the distribution of future European Union
   preferences, as well as in citizens' motivations to prefer different
   variants of Europe in the future. The findings show citizens'
   fine-grained future European Union preferences, which are meaningfully
   related to common explanations of European Union support. We also find
   cross-national differences linked to countries' structural position
   within the European Union.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic challenges a workable American federalism. The
   Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves plenary
   responsibilities to states for promoting health and well-being; but
   states and their local governments suffer from a significant lack of
   resources and interjurisdictional competition during major emergencies.
   In this article, I argue that a president has significant constitutional
   and statutory authority for pandemic preparedness and, by law, is
   responsible for leading a coordinated national response necessary to a
   pandemic. The article outlines the constitutional and statutory
   authorities available to President Trump and assesses how he used those
   powers to address the pandemic. It is argued that early, decisive
   national coordinative systems for containing and mitigating the virus;
   testing, tracing, contacting, and isolation protocols; data collection
   standardization; procurement and distribution of supplies; and planning
   vaccine eligibility and distribution could have reduced the state and
   local government disadvantages early in the pandemic, saving lives and
   boosting the economy.},

Abstract = {Following the coalition literature highlighting intraparty politics
   (e.g., Giannetti and Benoit 2009; Laver 1999; Strom 2003), I address the
   well-known ``portfolio allocation paradox{''} (Warwick and Druckman
   2006) by introducing a new model of government formation based on two
   main assumptions. First, no actor has a structural advantage in the
   negotiations leading to government formation. Second, all actors who can
   deprive the coalition of a majority (or other critical threshold size)
   must be included in the negotiations-not just parties. Whereas standard
   bargaining models are inconsistent with Gamson's Law, the model proposed
   here implies that equilibrium portfolio allocations should be mostly
   Gamsonian but with a small-party bias, as the empirical literature has
   long found. Empirically, I show that my model outperforms the
   literature's standard specification (due to Browne and Franklin 1973).
   Moreover, one of the model's new predictions-that candidate-centered
   electoral rules should promote more Gamsonian portfolio allocations-is
   supported.},

Abstract = {While the UNHCR promotes voluntary repatriation as the preferred
   solution to refugee situations, there is little understanding of
   variation in refugees' preferences regarding return. We develop a
   theoretical framework suggesting two mechanisms influencing refugees'
   preferences. First, refugees' lived experiences in their country of
   origin prior to displacement and in their new host country create a
   trade-off in feelings of being anchored to their origin or host country.
   Second, firsthand exposure to traumas of war provides some refugees with
   a sense of competency and self-efficacy, leading them to prefer to
   return home. We test these relationships with data from a survey among
   Syrian refugees hosted in Lebanon. We find refugees exposed to violence
   during the war have a sense of attachment to Syria and are most likely
   to prefer return. Refugees who have developed a detachment from Syria or
   an attachment to Lebanon are less likely to prefer return.},

Abstract = {Despite a century of efforts to constrain money in American elections,
   there is little consensus on whether campaign finance regulations make
   any appreciable difference. Here we take advantage of a change in the
   campaign finance regulations of half of the U.S. states mandated by the
   Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. This exogenously imposed
   change in the regulation of independent expenditures provides an advance
   over the identification strategies used in most previous studies. Using
   a generalized synthetic control method, we find that after Citizens
   United, states that had previously banned independent corporate
   expenditures (and thus were ``treated{''} by the decision) adopted more
   ``corporate-friendly{''} policies on issues with broad effects on
   corporations' welfare; we find no evidence of shifts on policies with
   little or no effect on corporate welfare. We conclude that even
   relatively narrow changes in campaign finance regulations can have a
   substantively meaningful influence on government policy making.},

Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that voters' choices are shaped by
   assessments of the state of the economy and that these assessments, in
   turn, are influenced by the news. But how does the economic news track
   the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality?
   Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of US
   news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly
   and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households,
   with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further,
   we present evidence that this pro-rich bias emerges not from pro-rich
   journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the
   media's focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the
   relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings
   yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral
   patterns and demonstrate how distributional biases in the economy
   condition economic accountability.},

Abstract = {Do political institutions moderate the effect of environmental stress on
   social conflict? We posit that while the frequency of social conflict in
   developing agrarian states can increase during drought, democratic
   competition reduces conflict and can facilitate cooperation, reversing
   this effect. This hypothesis is tested on a sample of all districts in
   India over a period from 2001 to 2014. The dependent variable captures
   the number of crimes perpetrated against scheduled castes-so-called
   ``untouchables{''}-and scheduled tribes-India's Indigenous groups-during
   a given district-year. When the effect of drought is moderated using a
   local electoral competition index, findings show that although droughts
   increase the frequency of social conflicts where political institutions
   are weak, they reduce it where political institutions are strong. The
   results are robust to alternative operationalization choices. Our
   findings, thus, have relevance both to scholars of the climate-conflict
   nexus and to policymakers working to address climate change's effects.},

   The construction of the hegemony of the people without the indigenous
   voices},

Abstract = {In Latin America, the relationship between populism and environmentalism
   is intrinsically linked to extractivism. The commodities boom that the
   region experienced during the early 2000s was accompanied by the
   resurgence of populism in the region and the emergence of
   socio-environmental conflicts led by indigenous environmental movements.
   Despite the fact that Latin American populism supposedly represents
   unprotected groups, there has been a general failure on the part of
   these governments to incorporate the visions and demands of the
   indigenous peoples. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) assumed Mexico's
   presidency in 2018. In this context, his reliance on extractive
   industries as a lever for socioeconomic development and criticism
   towards neoliberalism has led many analysts to place him under the
   populist umbrella. AMLO has developed a discursive strategy consisting
   of dividing the political field into two antagonistic parts: `the
   people', whose demands and interests are supposedly defended by his
   popular project and `the conservatives', the corrupt elite. This article
   explores the way in which AMLO has reacted to the indigenous
   environmental movements and his discursive strategies to face the
   contradiction of constructing the hegemony of the people without
   incorporating indigenous voices. The article develops a frame analysis
   applied to AMLO's discourse on a large-scale energy project: Proyecto
   Integral Morelos (PIM). It concludes that, as with other populists in
   the region, AMLO has been shown to be incapable of articulating the
   indigenous environmental opposition into his national project.},

   Rescue During Genocide},

Abstract = {During the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, some individuals risked their lives
   to save others. While much research has analyzed why people rescue
   during genocide, no studies have systematically analyzed the
   post-conflict consequences of engaging in such actions. This article
   begins to fill this gap by treating rescue as a case of behavioural
   boundary crossing, or individual defection from the expectations of a
   behavioral script. We rely upon 45 in-depth interviews with Rwandan Hutu
   who rescued Tutsi and who also did not participate in genocidal
   violence. Our findings indicate that rescue may be tied to both positive
   and negative social and economic consequences, from gifts and public
   recognition to stigma and threats. We suggest that many of these
   consequences result from the fact that Hutu who rescued went against the
   expectations of their group. As the positive consequences were often
   driven by Tutsi and the negative consequences were driven by Hutu, we
   also suggest that such consequences are tied to fault lines between
   groups in Rwandan society. Our work consequently aligns with and extends
   previous research finding that the genocide produced, reinforced, and
   augmented social cleavages in Rwanda.},

Abstract = {Partnerships remain NATO's only external policy instrument in an
   illiberal world. However, NATO needs to differentiate more clearly
   between its partners and intensify security cooperation with like-minded
   states to mitigate the threats posed by Russia and China. Henrik Larsen
   proposes the following differentiation: `Advanced Partners' in Western
   Europe and the EU, stressing the benefits of their technological
   strengths and shared values to bolster joint resilience capacity;
   `Enhanced Partners' in the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe, focusing
   on the need to improve governance and resilience vis-a-vis illiberal
   powers; and `Worldwide Partners', prioritising both NATO's southern
   periphery, to manage regional instability, and the Asia-Pacific, to
   counter threats posed by the rise of China. Partnership reform should
   accompany a reflection about the role of resilience in NATO's security
   and defence portfolio.},

Abstract = {Democratic societies increasingly look into gender quotas as a means to
   increase women's representation in politics. Yet even as women occupy
   more seats, meaningful barriers may remain to their incorporation in the
   legislature. Our paper draws on quantitative and interview data from
   Portugal to explore patterns in women's legislative participation before
   and after the adoption of a gender quota. While the gender gap in floor
   time decreases post-quota, important gender imbalances remain. After the
   quota, women remain underrepresented in the most politically salient
   legislative debates and are subject to stigmatization in floor access.
   Our findings suggest that gender quotas chip away at, but do not
   shatter, glass ceilings for women in politics.},

Abstract = {Does the Republic depict a conspiracy? The ostensible impetus for
   discussing profound political change behind closed doors is a desire to
   discuss the meaning of justice, not to replace a political order with a
   new one. But the dialogue takes place during the Peloponnesian War, when
   fears of plots sporadically consumed an eroding Athenian democracy.
   Arguments about political instability and instances of plotting
   reverberate throughout dialogue that takes shape in this suspicious
   climate. Whether Socrates makes us privy to a conversation about a
   political world that does not exist or presents us with a strategy for
   talking about revolution undetected remains unresolved. I argue that
   Athenian fears of secret power and revolution express themselves in the
   style and arguments of the Republic and suggest that already at the
   origins of democratic practice, critics like Plato were concerned with
   theorizing the subtleties of democratic erosion.},

Abstract = {To deter gerrymandering, many state constitutions require legislative
   districts to be ``compact.{''} Yet, the law offers few precise
   definitions other than ``you know it when you see it,{''} which
   effectively implies a common understanding of the concept. In contrast,
   academics have shown that compactness has multiple dimensions and have
   generated many conflicting measures. We hypothesize that both are
   correct-that compactness is complex and multidimensional, but a common
   understanding exists across people. We develop a survey to elicit this
   understanding, with high reliability (in data where the standard paired
   comparisons approach fails). We create a statistical model that
   predicts, with high accuracy, solely from the geometric features of the
   district, compactness evaluations by judges and public officials
   responsible for redistricting, among others. We also offer compactness
   data from our validated measure for 17,896 state legislative and
   congressional districts, as well as software to compute this measure
   from any district.},

Abstract = {We analyse public perceptions and misperceptions of European integration
   in the context of the Brexit referendum in the UK. Erroneous information
   about the EU was salient in the public domain before the referendum, but
   the prevalence of EU related misperceptions among voters has not yet
   been examined much. We use a population based survey that was conducted
   before the referendum to measure misperceptions in two domains: the role
   of the EU for the British economy and EU related costs. Hypotheses to
   explain misperceptions are derived from the public opinion literature
   and political psychology. Most voters hold misperceptions and this
   includes Euroskeptics as well as individuals who support the EU. Yet,
   misperceptions vary in systematic ways. Individuals with more education
   are less ill informed. In line with motivated reasoning, citizens'
   perceptions are also biased by their predispositions: while many voters
   hold misperceptions, the magnitude of misperceptions that portray the EU
   negatively is greater among Euroskeptics.},

Abstract = {This article builds on Marxist-feminist analyses of the links between
   the household, the economy, and the state through a discussion of
   recycling, pointing to the ways the unwaged work of household waste
   sorting contributes to capitalism's crisis-prone dynamic of
   overaccumulation. Household waste sorting is an instance of work
   transfer - a reorganization of labor and day-to-day life by the state
   and industry in which production is shifted from industry into
   households without compensation. A periodization of `waste regimes'
   reveals how the state management of waste both mirrors and is implicated
   in accumulation regimes, their crises, and their resolutions. The
   current recycling crisis demonstrates the contradictory nature and
   futility of recycling in capitalism, and the specific manner in which
   the work transfer involved in household waste sorting contributes to
   accumulation and crisis.},

Abstract = {This study explores media coverage of migration in Russia during the
   first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed and coded
   articles published in six mainstream Russian newspapers and on one
   popular news site between March 1 and June 30 of 2020. Our results
   confirm key findings of the literature on media and migrants in Russia
   over the last decade, including the frequent portrayal of migrants as a
   security threat, a focus on legality and illegality, and the absence of
   a migrant voice. However, contrary to our expectations, not all sources
   significantly covered the topic of COVID-19 infections among migrants.
   Overall, our paper contributes to a growing literature examining the
   securitization of migrants in non-Western contexts and initiates a
   discussion of how a pandemic might exacerbate this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Entrenched inequalities in political participation have made the
   questions of who participates and when, why, or how some of the most
   frequently asked and researched in political science. Building on
   existing comparative research, this article focuses on civic education
   in English secondary schools and, in particular, the ability of related
   interventions to close participation gaps normally seen by sex,
   ethnicity and socio-economic status. Analysing original survey data
   collected from more than 350 students in 17 maintained secondary schools
   located in six regions of England, this article evaluates the impact of
   four types of civic education (curricula lessons; open classroom
   climate; participatory activities; and political contact) on three
   participatory outcomes (expressive political behaviours; voting
   intentions; and anticipated high-intensity participation). Descriptive
   and inferential analyses suggest (a) cumulative quantities of civic
   education are positively associated with youth political participation;
   (b) open classroom climate may close known inequalities in young
   people's expressive and electoral participation whilst political contact
   with politicians and political institutions may widen those
   inequalities; and (c) civic education may currently accelerate
   inequalities in young people's political ambition. These findings raise
   important and immediate challenges for policy-makers who are concerned
   with improving young people's civic engagement in England and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The death of Francisco Franco started a period of political uncertainty
   in Spain. The heirs of the regime needed to introduce reforms to
   maintain the power: they had to give an answer to the urgent political
   demands of that moment while keeping the political control of the
   situation in front of the democratic opposition. The regional question -
   the answer to the demands of decentralization and recognition of
   regional identities- was an important space to develop post-Francoist
   projects of decentralization. Catalonia, where projects of autonomy and
   decentralization had a long tradition and a strong popular support was a
   perfect place to implement these projects. That is the reason why
   Minister Manuel Fraga and his political proxies initiated a process
   aimed at creating an ``Special Regime for the Catalan Provinces{''} that
   was actually a renewed version of the historical ``Mancomunitat de
   Catalunya (1914.1925){''}. Fraga implicated himself and also important
   representatives of Catalan Francoism. The non-published documentation
   conserved by Mr. Juan Echevarria Puig, an active member of the
   Commission created by Fraga that worked in 1976 and 1977, allows us to
   know in depth this last reincarnation (failed but influential) of
   Francoist regionalism.},

Abstract = {Venezuelan migration has been a fundamental topic of the Colombian
   political agenda in the last few years; multiple discourses have emerged
   surrounding this phenomenon, many of them are produced and reproduced by
   media, since they occupy a starring role in the fight for meaning
   construction. Media discourses often invoke emotions, as these are
   transcendental to generate interpretation and action frameworks inside
   people's mental schemes. This turns emotions into an ideal tool for
   power exercise. This paper aims to show, by means of the analysis of 48
   news and reports of Colombia's most read newspaper, El Tiempo, the way
   emotionality was evoked to discursive construction about migration and
   migrants between 2018 and 2019, years in which flow of immigrants grew
   exponentially.},

Abstract = {A primary challenge for researchers that make use of observational data
   is selection bias (i.e. the units of analysis exhibit systematic
   differences and dis-homogeneities due to non-random selection into
   treatment). This article encourages researchers in acknowledging this
   problem and discusses how and more importantly - under which assumptions
   they may resort to statistical matching techniques to reduce the
   imbalance in the empirical distribution of pre-treatment observable
   variables between the treatment and control groups. With the aim of
   providing a practical guidance, the article engages with the evaluation
   of the effectiveness of peacekeeping missions in the case of the Bosnian
   civil war, a research topic in which selection bias is a structural
   feature of the observational data researchers have to use, and shows how
   to apply the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), the most widely used
   matching algorithm in the fields of Political Science and International
   Relations.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the voting behavior of Swiss members of parliament (MP) using
   newly collected individual, district, and cantonal level data, we show
   that both electoral disproportionalities and the insurgent parties'
   electoral potential are important determinants of MP voting behavior on
   the adoption of proportional representation (PR). However, in contrast
   to the prominent electoral threat thesis, the insurgent party's high
   electoral potential decreases the probability that MPs of established
   parties support PR. The reason for this relationship is partisan
   redistricting, whose relevance has so far been largely ignored in the
   literature. We demonstrate that adapting electoral district boundaries
   for political reasons, if possible in a given institutional context, can
   be a powerful alternative to the adoption of PR, because it allows
   established parties to retain parliamentary majorities even as an
   insurgent party's electoral potential increases.},

Abstract = {How does support for opposition parties grow in dominant party systems?
   Most scholarship on the rise of competitive elections in dominant party
   regimes focuses on elite defections from the ruling party and
   coordination by opposition parties as key explanations, but there is
   less focus on how politics at the local level contributes to opposition
   victories. This article argues that effective service delivery in local
   government helps opposition parties grow support in local elections.
   Examining the case of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in South Africa, this
   article provides a systematic analysis of local elections and opposition
   party performance. Using an original data set of electoral, census and
   spatial data at the lowest electoral unit in South Africa (the ward),
   this article shows that in the areas where it is the incumbent party,
   support for the DA grows as the delivery of basic services to non-white
   households improves, and when DA-run wards outperform the neighbouring
   ones run by the ruling African National Congress party, support for the
   DA increases in neighbouring wards. Overall, this study contributes to
   our understanding of how local politics erode dominant party rule.},

Abstract = {After years of gridlock on the issue, a bipartisan group of members of
   Congress struck a deal in 2020 to restore eligibility for inmates to
   access Pell Grants. Evidence indicates that college education programs
   in prison reduce recidivism and, consequently, state corrections
   expenditures, but legislators in prior decades feared that voters would
   resent government subsidy of college classes for criminals. To assess
   the contemporary politics of the issue, we analyze data from a framing
   experiment embedded in the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study. We find that Americans, on average, neither support nor oppose
   the proposal to restore inmates' Pell Grant eligibility; however,
   exposure to arguments about the proposal's benefits to inmates in
   particular and American society more broadly both increased subjects'
   support. We further explore how this framing effect varies across
   political partisanship and racial resentment. We find that both frames
   elicited a positive response from subjects, especially among Democrats
   and subjects with low or moderate racial resentment.},

Abstract = {Though the demographic characteristics of judicial nominees in the
   United States have gained increased political attention in recent years,
   relatively little is known about how they affect public opinion toward
   judicial nominees and courts. We evaluate these relationships in the
   context of race and gender using a conjoint experiment conducted during
   a recent vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. We find consistent evidence
   that Americans are more supportive of coracial nominees, particularly
   among white Republicans and Black Democrats, but no evidence of a
   similar effect on the basis of gender. Our results have important
   implications for theories of descriptive representation and suggest
   limits to its use as a means for generating political support for
   judicial nominees.},

Abstract = {Human dignity has become a central legal concept throughout the world
   and is increasingly used in judicial decisions in many countries that do
   not include it in their national legislation. However, due to the
   acknowledged vagueness of the concept, academics and judges have
   identified many difficulties in its implementation and the specific
   challenges it poses to the rule of law. Consequently, from a documentary
   methodology this article tries to develop and propose, from the analysis
   of different philosophical approaches to the definition of human
   dignity, a series of principles that can be applied in judicial
   decisions to achieve a deep common understanding of the usefulness of
   human dignity and, at the same time, tries to solve problems that are
   now widely recognized, both by supporters and critics of the judicial
   use of this concept. It is concluded that the concept of human dignity
   must have a decisive influence on the formation, not only of substantive
   law but also of procedural law. It must become a criterion for the need
   for measures to prevent the abuse of procedural rights, the distortion
   of justice and the deliberate evasion of its main task.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the process of criminal
   prosecution of people accused of committing crimes against the banking
   sector in the Russian Federation. Detecting such crimes, identifying the
   people who committed them in and compensating for the damages caused by
   such acts is the most difficult task for law enforcement officials in
   Russia. The most important part of these activities are procedural
   questions about the timing of the commencement of criminal proceedings
   and the procedure for their implementation in pre-trial proceedings. The
   methodological basis of this research is formed by the processing of the
   results of criminal cases, the results of surveys of researchers and
   detectives, members of the educational and methodological group of the
   Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. The authors have
   proposed the drafting of article 5, paragraph 55, of the Code of
   Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation and its corresponding
   amendments to article 11. It is concluded that these contributions will
   make it possible to carry out the procedural work on compensation for
   damages caused by a crime in a much more effective manner.},

   Americans' Attitudes Toward the Supreme Court},

Abstract = {Contemporary US Supreme Court nominations are unavoidably and inevitably
   political. Although observers worry that political contestation over
   nominations undermines support for qualified nominees and threatens the
   Court's legitimacy, there is little empirical evidence to support these
   claims. The authors argue that political contestation over judicial
   nominations provides cues that shape the public's impressions about
   nominees and the Court and polarizes public opinion across partisan
   lines. Data from a conjoint experiment administered in the first days of
   the Trump presidency support this argument. Political rhetoric
   attributed to President Trump and Senate Democrats substantially
   polarized partisans' views of nominees and evaluations of the Court's
   legitimacy, with Republicans (Democrats) expressing significantly more
   (less) favorable attitudes. Additional analyses suggest that
   contestation generates divergent partisan responses by affecting views
   about the nominee's impartiality. These findings challenge existing
   perspectives that depict attitudes toward the judiciary as resistant to
   partisan considerations and have important implications for the Court's
   legitimacy in a polarized era.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, Colombia has gone through a long and complex process
   with a view to the demobilization of armed groups; perhaps the most
   important goal being that demobilized persons achieve full
   reincorporation into civilian life in all its spheres, and thus reach
   the desired reconciliation with themselves, with the community and with
   the State. In line with the above, the objective of this article is to
   make a documentary review of the different concepts and understandings
   associated with reconciliation and how it constitutes a key input that
   contributes to the construction of peace, but not before clarifying some
   theoretical elements in the framework of Disarmament, Demobilization,
   Reintegration (DDR), expanding the point of reference.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the waxing and waning of loyalty in German
   citizenship. The paper focuses on three areas where loyalty historically
   played a role: military service, requirements that naturalisation
   candidates commit to support and uphold constitutional values, and
   debates over exclusive loyalty and dual citizenship. There is an
   asymmetry between loyalty and disloyalty. Germany no longer requires
   young male citizens to demonstrate their loyalty through military
   service. Nonetheless, perceived disloyalty, such as military service for
   a foreign state or terrorist militia, can result in loss of citizenship.
   Citizens are not required to show loyalty to the constitutional order
   but engaging in activities to undermine the constitutional order is
   incompatible with becoming a naturalised German citizen. For dual
   citizenship there is continued opposition due at least in part to
   concerns over divided loyalties but increasing toleration in
   bureaucratic practice. The revival of loyalty requirements in the late
   1990s and after 2001 is a reaction to perceived failures of immigrant
   integration. Evolving human rights norms help explain the relaxation of
   loyalty requirements after 1945 but not their recent revival. Debates
   over political loyalty as well as dual citizenship show distinct
   partisan differences. Finally, both Hitler and the Weimar Republic cast
   long shadows.},

Abstract = {Congress hears more and more from everyday citizens. How do modern
   Congressional offices use this information to represent their
   constituents? Drawing on original interviews and a survey of
   Congressional staff, we explore how representation works in practice
   when new data and tools, such as databases and downscaled public opinion
   polls, are available. In contrast with established theories that focus
   on responsiveness, we show that representation is a two-way street.
   Congressional offices both respond to incoming constituent opinion and
   reach out to elicit opinions from stakeholders. Offices record
   correspondence into databases, identifying the most salient issues and
   the balance of opinion among correspondents. They tend not to use polls
   on policy. To understand the opinions of electorally influential
   constituencies, staffers also proactively reach out to stakeholders and
   experts in a practice we call provoked petitioning. If the Washington
   pressure system is a chorus, Congressional staff often serve as
   conductors, allowing well-resourced and organized constituents,
   including interest groups, to sing with the loudest voices. While
   Congress has some new tools and strategies for representation, its
   modern practices still reinforce existing biases.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic severely threatens refugees: Most refugees live in
   developing countries with poor health care systems, the lockdowns left
   many refugees without income, border closures prevented forced migrants
   from their right to seek asylum and anti-refugee sentiment as well as
   insecurity in refugee settlements increased. Building on past refugee
   research and reports on refugee-related challenges during the Covid-19
   crisis, we explain how bad sanitation, inadequate accommodation,
   additional restrictions of movement and employment and language barriers
   increase grievances among refugees and tensions between refugees and
   host populations. Particularly in large and overcrowded settlements
   these issues can lead to violent conflict, as we demonstrate with a case
   study of the Moria refugee camp in Greece. Yet, the impact of Covid-19
   on refugees generally lacks politicization, and many governments are
   reluctant or unable to provide adequate housing and sanitation to
   refugees. We present policy recommendations for improving refugee
   protection amidst Covid-19, including not only the prevention of further
   spread of the virus but also that of insecurity.},

Abstract = {This research note investigates women's political participation and
   political influence as donors for contests typically neglected by
   American politics researchers: gubernatorial elections. Our original
   study of individual contributions (2000-2018) finds that women are
   underrepresented as donors to gubernatorial elections with large
   differences across the two parties. Moreover, gendered patterns indicate
   that women - of both parties - tend to be more financially supportive of
   women gubernatorial candidates than men. Men outnumber women as donors
   in both primary and general elections and outpace women in the total
   amount contributed. Meanwhile, men outnumber women as gubernatorial
   candidates and unlike other levels of office, women are not increasing
   as a share of governors. We argue that women's political voice, as
   expressed through contributions, is missing from these important state
   elections, with implications for public policy and women's descriptive
   representation.},

Abstract = {Who is most likely to consider diverse representation desirable?
   Previous literature typically emphasizes the importance of partisanship
   and group identity congruence (i.e., women representing women) in
   influencing attitudes about descriptive representation. Alternatively,
   we test whether the racialized politics that emerged in 2016 might now
   shape views about representation by members of underrepresented groups.
   Using data from the 2016 ANES, we examine attitudes toward increasing
   the number of women and Hispanic representatives. Rather than
   partisanship or identity congruence, our results point to the primacy of
   racial attitudes, linked fate, and feminism in shaping views about
   diverse representation. Indeed, even when examining attitudes about
   increased representation by women, we find strong evidence that opinions
   are now racialized. We argue for a more expansive understanding of
   support for descriptive representation, which may reflect an
   individual's opinions of marginalized groups and structural inequities
   more broadly.},

Title = {Mobilizing party activism: A field experiment with party members and
   sympathizers},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Electoral mobilization and persuasion are often characterized as
   two-stage processes, where parties activate their core supporters, who
   then mobilize and persuade larger shares of the electorate. While there
   is a lot of research on the second stage of this process, the
   mobilization and persuasion of the wider electorate by party activists,
   there is little causally identified evidence on whether party elites can
   encourage campaign activism among party members and sympathizers. To
   address this question, we conducted a randomized field experiment in
   cooperation with the Swiss Social Democratic Party in the context of the
   2015 cantonal elections in Ticino. The experiment consisted of the
   randomized administration of telephone calls to members and strong
   supporters of the party, while their self-reported campaign activism and
   attitudes towards the campaign were measured in a two-wave online panel
   survey. Against expectations, we record null effects on various measures
   of campaign activism, including on the mobilization of relatives, and
   friends. The results raise questions about omitted variable bias in
   observational studies of party activism that consistently report large
   positive effects of party contact on the campaign activism of members
   and sympathizers.},

Abstract = {Media critics frequently complain about the tendency of reporters to
   cover political news using partisan conflict or partisan game frames,
   which describe policy disagreement as sites of partisan conflict where
   the parties can score ``wins{''} or ``losses.{''} Such frames, thought
   to decrease trust and increase partisan polarization, may be
   particularly dangerous when used in the coverage of public health crises
   such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We report a survey experiment where 2,455
   respondents were assigned to read coverage of the pandemic that was
   framed in non-partisan terms, in terms of partisan conflict, or as a
   game where one party was winning and the other losing. Contrary to
   expectations, we find no effect of these frames across a broad range of
   opinions about and actions related to the pandemic, with the exception
   of a small negative effect of partisan game-framed coverage on the
   desire to consume news about the pandemic. These results suggest that
   partisan framing may not have negative effects during a public health
   crisis or, alternately, that such effects are difficult to detect in
   real-time using traditional survey experiments.},

Title = {Modeling ideological polarization in democratic party systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There are mounting claims that increasing ideological polarization is
   reshaping democratic party systems with important effects on the
   functioning of electoral politics, the correlates of voting choice,
   turnout, and even the representativeness of government. Yet, our
   knowledge of what causes party system polarization is still developing.
   The primary research goal is to systematically combine and test existing
   theories predicting levels of party system polarization across 21
   established democracies. Polarization levels have generally risen since
   the mid1990s. A pooled model finds that characteristics of the electoral
   system and the party system largely determine the continuity of party
   system polarization. Polarization levels also appear linked to
   short-term factors such as citizens' declining confidence in the economy
   and increasing concerns about immigration. The conclusion discusses the
   implications for party systems and politics in affluent democracies.},

Abstract = {This article explores the importance of constructions of temporality
   within the UK government's discourse on the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis
   across the first six months of 2020. Drawing on over 120 official texts,
   it traces the emergence of discontinuous, linear, and cyclical
   conceptions of time in representations of the virus' pasts, presents,
   and futures. Three arguments are made. First, constructions of
   temporality were fundamental to the social, political, and historical
   positioning of the virus. Second, these constructions were
   constitutively important in producing, explaining, justifying and
   celebrating the UK government's response to the virus. And, third,
   tensions and inconsistencies between these constructions of temporality
   highlight the contingent, and constructed, character of official
   discourse, pulling into question the inevitability of the UK's response
   and opening opportunity for critical intervention.},

Abstract = {Brazil, the largest slave society in the Americas, proposed a
   citizenship in its 1824 Constitution that had no race-based criteria.
   The nation remained steadfastly committed to slavery, however, importing
   nearly 800,000 enslaved Africans illegally after the transatlantic slave
   trade was abolished in 1831. The silences and ambiguities in Brazil's
   terms of citizenship were precisely what enabled the nation to exclude
   Africans and keep many in illegal captivity. I focus on two groups of
   Africans, those who remained illegally enslaved, and those who had been
   `rescued' from illegal slave ships and granted special status as `Free
   Africans.' I compare their condition to that of indigenous Brazilians
   who were similarly enslaved illegally and excluded from citizenship on
   implicitly racial terms. By revealing how citizenship denial is integral
   to the history of freedom, their condition offers a necessary critique
   to studies of the `Age of Emancipation.'},

Abstract = {This article introduces a special issue of West European Politics on the
   COVID-19 crisis. It first sets out the dual challenge to democratic
   principles and democratic performance that the COVID-19 pandemic has
   posed to European liberal democracies. Three bodies of scholarship are
   especially relevant in framing this dual democratic challenge: those
   that provide accounts of policy, institutional and legitimacy crises;
   accounts of the governance of emergencies and of emergency politics; and
   accounts of political turbulence and organisational and policy
   responses. The articles that comprise the special issue provide
   comparative empirical insights into first reactions, with a focus on the
   responses by political decision-makers, European publics and the EU.
   Assessments of the likely longer-term, potentially transformative
   effects of COVID-19 on the principles and performance of European
   liberal democracies will need to draw on both sectoral and systemic
   perspectives, with a focus on the organisation and operation of public
   authority and the state.},

Abstract = {Violent clashes between Fulani and Dogon have recently escalated in the
   Seeno plains in central Mali. After failing to defeat a ``jihadist{''}
   insurgency dominated by Fulani, the Malian army has sponsored and
   trained a Dogon militia, which has systematically attacked Fulani
   villages, and again caused counterattacks. In addition, internal
   conflicts within Fulani and Dogon society have emerged. This
   demonstrates the complexities of the current crisis in Mali and how
   simplistic narratives about its causes are unhelpful. It also shows how
   views of the enemy as ``terrorists{''} or ``jihadists{''} are dangerous
   and able to further fuel violent conflicts.},

Abstract = {Optimists hope for the best possible outcome, while pessimists plan for
   the worst. We investigate how people's predispositions to be optimistic
   versus pessimistic shape how they approach politics. We argue that an
   optimistic personality is a psychological resource that contributes to
   the practice of good citizenship behaviors. Using responses from the
   2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project and the 2018 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study, we demonstrate that people with optimistic
   personalities are more politically engaged and participatory than those
   with pessimistic dispositions. Optimists express more positive views of
   the American people, the government, and national symbols as well.
   Because optimists have a more positive outlook toward the nation's
   future, they help contribute to levels of diffuse support for government
   and its symbols. While we might worry that optimists hold an unrealistic
   view of the political world, we find little evidence that dispositional
   optimism is associated with less accurate perceptions of political
   realities.},

Abstract = {Does a large influx of asylum seekers in the local community lead to a
   backlash in public opinion towards foreign populations? We assess the
   effects of asylum seeker presence using original survey and macro-level
   municipality data from Austria, exploiting exogenous elements of the
   placement of asylum seekers on the municipality level. Methodologically,
   we draw on entropy balancing for causal identification. Our findings are
   threefold. First, respondents in municipalities receiving asylum seekers
   report substantially higher exposure on average, but largely without the
   stronger contact that would allow for meaningful interaction. Second,
   hostility towards asylum seekers on average increased in areas that
   housed them. Third, this backlash spilt over: general attitudes towards
   Muslims and immigrants are less favourable in contexts with local asylum
   seeker presence, while vote intention for the main anti-immigration
   party is higher. Our findings go beyond existing work by examining
   contact directly as a mechanism, by showing a backlash effect in the
   medium term, and by focusing on a broad set of attitudinal and
   behavioural measures. Our results point to a need to design policy
   interventions that minimise citizen backlash against rapid migration
   inflows.},

Abstract = {Different groups on the left have invested a variety of cultural
   meanings in the image of the British miner and the mining community.
   Tracing these over time, this article suggests that mythologised images
   of the solidaristic miner and the `traditional' mining community flatten
   and simplify our understanding of the past, and of change over time in
   Britain's coalfields in the era of deindustrialisation since the
   mid-1950s. Oral history interviews conducted in the coalfields suggest
   that while much has been lost-most importantly, decent jobs, strong
   local economies and certain community ties-there have also been gains,
   such as growing egalitarianism in gender roles. Finally, the article
   suggests that an industrial strategy, but more importantly, a raft of
   policies such as community wealth building and Foundational Economy
   strategies are needed to bring back some of what has been lost while
   also working with the grain of more positive social changes.},

Abstract = {During international crises, trust in government is expected to increase
   irrespective of the wisdom of the policies it pursues. This has been
   called a `rally-round-the-flag' effect. This article examines whether
   the COVID-19 crisis has resulted in such a rally effect. Using
   multi-wave panel surveys conducted in Austria and France starting from
   March 2020, in the article it is examined how government trust was
   affected by the perceived threats to the nation's health and economy
   created by the pandemic as well as by the perceived appropriateness of
   the government's crisis response. A strong rally effect is shown in
   Austria, where trust was closely tied to perceived health risks, but
   faded away quickly over time. Perceptions of government measures
   mattered, too, while perceived economic threat only played a minor role.
   In France, in contrast, a strong partisan divide is found and no rally
   effect. Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at:

Abstract = {This paper estimates the economic impact of terrorism at \$US 33 billion
   in 2018. In the 18 years from 2000 to 2018, terrorism cost the world
   economy \$US 855 billion. This model follows the methodology of the 2019
   Global Terrorism Index and uses a bottom-up cost accounting approach to
   aggregate the cost of four indicators that result from the incidents of
   terrorism. The four indicators include terrorism-related deaths,
   injuries, property damage and GDP losses. The findings of this paper
   show that global terrorism peaked in 2014 with 33,555 deaths globally
   and a consequential economic impact of \$US 111 billion. From 2011 to
   2014, terrorism-related deaths increased by 353\%, and terrorist
   incidents rose by 190\%. The 100 incidents with the highest economic
   impact from deaths and injuries are included in the analysis. The
   September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States stands as the incident
   with the highest economic impact accounting for deaths and injuries only
   at \$US 40.6 billion, this is followed by the Sinjar massacre in Sinjar,
   Nineveh, Iraq at \$US 4.3 billion.},

Abstract = {The article aims to reflect critically on the role of violence and, in
   particular, of global wars in the analysis of world-systems, turning to
   other theoretical perspectives, such as structuring and critical
   geopolitics, to better understand the issue. In this way, we can assert
   that the struggle for supremacy is not necessarily a struggle for
   hegemony, which would inevitably result in periodic world wars as a
   prelude to the rise of great powers to hegemonic status. Hegemony refers
   more to the rules and practices that constitute a geopolitical order
   than to a certain hierarchical ordering of states. There is no general
   pattern of explanation for all wars: both global power configurations
   and the interrelationships between the local and the global must be
   taken into account.},

   harmless and responding with a way of assuming theoretical practice, the

Abstract = {This article contends that an important driver of turnout is the
   national stories embraced by citizens. We suggest the notion of `story
   incentive,' whereby adopting a group's story components - those that
   connect the past, the future, and prominent national characters -
   motivates individuals to participate in that group's political
   activities. Leaning on narrative theories and studies on voter turnout,
   we develop and test hypotheses regarding the effect of story components
   on the likelihood of voting. Our measurements of story incentives are
   based on election surveys and encompass Denmark, Israel, the
   Netherlands, the UK, and the US. The results support the main
   story-incentive hypothesis. We discuss the theoretical ramifications of
   the connection between adherence to national stories and voter turnout.},

Abstract = {Why do some advanced capitalist democracies experience relatively higher
   economic growth rates? In this paper, it is argued that
   complementarities between varieties of coordination and systems of
   social protection can help explain differences in long-run economic
   performance. Testing the explanatory power of the original varieties of
   capitalism (VoC) model and the welfare production regime (WPR) model,
   the article finds that long-run economic growth is conditioned by the
   extent to which systems of social protection are complementary to
   varieties of coordination. Using time-series cross-section data on 17
   OECD countries from 1974 to 2009, the article finds strong support for
   the hypothesis that coordinated market economies with decommodified
   welfare states achieve relatively higher economic growth rates in the
   long run. The WPR model moreover seems better at explaining economic
   growth compared with the classical VoC model. The welfare state is
   therefore argued to be crucial in understanding the economic effects of
   varieties of coordination.},

Abstract = {We study the impact of compulsory voting in Brazil, where voting is
   mandatory from age 18 to 70 and voluntary for those aged 16, 17 and 70+.
   Using a survey sample of 8008 respondents, we document voter confusion
   about how the age criterion applies. Some people falsely believe that
   what matters is one's age in an election year rather than on Election
   Day. Next, we perform a regression discontinuity (RD) analysis of
   compulsory voting among young voters with register-based data from six
   Brazilian elections (2008-2018). We find that the effect of compulsory
   voting is seriously underestimated if we focus solely on the
   discontinuities prescribed by the law. Our findings carry important
   implications for studies adopting the RD design where knowledge of the
   cutoff is expected of the units of interest (like those about compulsory
   voting) and confirm that compulsory voting is a strong institutional
   arrangement that promotes greater electoral participation.},

   Symposium on Power Without Knowledge},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {1-31},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge builds a critical
   epistemology of technocracy, rather than a democratic argument against
   it. For its democratic critics, technocracy is illegitimate because it
   amounts to the rule of cognitive elites, violating principles of mutual
   respect and collective self-determination. For its proponents,
   technocracy's legitimacy depends on its ability to use reliable
   knowledge to solve social and economic problems. But Friedman
   demonstrates that to meet the proponents' ``internal,{''} epistemic
   standard of legitimacy, technocrats would have to reckon with the
   heterogeneity of people's ideas, which he presents as one of two aspects
   of a political anthropology of ideational beings. The other aspect is
   ideational determinism: the shaping of our conscious actions by our
   interpretations, and of our interpretations by ``ideational
   exposures{''} (which are, to some extent, heterogeneous). For the most
   part, our symposiasts agree with this anthropology or leave it
   uncontested, but they fall back on democratic theory to point toward
   alternatives to technocracy. This raises the question, which Friedman
   does not ask, of whether his political anthropology undermines a certain
   brand of democratic theory: the liberal brand that attaches respect to
   people's opinions as products of ``free reflection,{''} i.e., as
   underdetermined.},

Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {353-365},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Information is a critically important, yet hard to measure, component on
   policy innovation across state governments. Widespread use of broadband
   has made it easier for governments to observe other actors, increasing
   the amount of policy information, while also diversifying the sources of
   information available to policymakers. This should translate into making
   governments more innovative over time and quicker to adapt to
   challenges. At the same time, the Internet may disrupt previous existing
   flows of information by decreasing the importance of geographic
   proximity and creating more nationalized or global information networks.
   We argue that the growth of broadband has made states more innovative
   over time, while also reducing the reliance on neighboring state
   adoptions for policy solutions as the information environment becomes
   both richer and more nationalized. We estimate a pooled event history
   analysis on hundreds of policies comparing the treatment period
   (2000-2016) with a control condition (last two decades of the 20th
   century) and find that states with higher broadband subscriptions are
   more innovative overall and less reliant on geographic contiguity for
   policy solutions. The growth of information flows due to digital
   communications has led to states becoming more innovative while also
   operating in a more nationalized network.},

Abstract = {Does the potential for a successful private sector career induce
   legislators to leave office? How does this affect the representation
   voters receive? I show that when former US senators-who now work as
   lobbyists-become more successful, currently serving senators with
   similar characteristics are more likely to take private sector
   employment. I replicate all results on data from the House. A number of
   tests suggest that senators react to the opportunity costs of holding
   office. Investigating selection effects, I find that legislative
   specialists are attracted the most in the Senate. Preliminary evidence
   suggests that the least wealthy respond most strongly in the House. This
   suggests that the revolving door shapes the skill set of legislators and
   the representation voters receive.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This article asks how CSOs engage with policymakers in advancing policy
   change on women's rights in the Philippine context where political
   dynasties are prevalent. It draws primarily upon interviews with leaders
   of women's organizations, former leaders, directors, and current staff
   of the policy agency involved in the advocacy work for the Magna Carta
   of Women, which is regarded as the Philippine version of the Convention
   on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
   Findings reveal that while CSOs used formal spaces such as official
   meetings and dialogues, CSOs also used informal modes of engagement:
   personal relationships, intermediaries, and reciprocity. Informal modes
   provide CSOs with the opportunity for sustained and long-term engagement
   as they develop personal bonds with policymakers which may extend beyond
   the term of office or appointment period.},

Abstract = {Many young people are unprepared to encounter misleading news and
   information that they find online. As civic educators, we are able to
   teach them the media literacy skills required to navigate this
   environment and critically evaluate the information. These lessons may
   be well-suited to the research methods classroom, where students will
   learn to both consume and produce research. Lessons must follow best
   practices, however, or they may lead students to double-down on
   misinformed beliefs that align with their ideological predispositions.
   Current research suggests these lessons should involve discussion and
   group work or activities that allow students to explore alternative
   explanations and address their questions and are sensitive to the manner
   in which they consume and evaluate news and information. This article
   summarizes current research on the topic and provides examples of
   practices I use in methods classes.},

Abstract = {This project adopts theories of gendered and racialized professionalism
   to make visible and evaluate gender, race, and congressional staff as
   key and intersecting forces in the function and outcomes of legislative
   institutions. Drawing upon more than 60 interviews conducted with
   high-level women staffers who worked on Capitol Hill over the past 5
   decades, it documents the influence of gender, race, and intersectional
   identities on staffers': experience of and adaptation to Capitol Hill;
   role in mediating the representation process; and engagement in
   institutional intervention. First-person accounts are used to
   demonstrate the utility of these theoretical frameworks for studying
   political professionals and to suggest future research that is attentive
   to legislative professionals, identity, and representation in political
   institutions.},

   capitalist mode of production. We review the fundamental works of
   Marxism dedicated to its study and we note the permanence of a current
   problem in the fact that what it is constitutive nation peculiarities
   tends to be conceived as existing externally to capital. We argue that
   this result in thinking nations as if each one of them were bearer of
   the general potentialities of the capitalist mode of production and

Abstract = {The object of this article is the little studied history of the Peasant
   Leagues created by the Communist Party of Brazil after 1945. I point out
   some of the reasons for the little interest that scholars have dedicated
   to such Leagues, in contrast to what was observed with the study of
   those that arose in Pernambuco in the following decade. I also indicate
   how, even after the party was declared illegal in May 1947, some Leagues
   continued to function. I also analyze how such activities were impacted
   by a gradual radicalization, crystallized in the ``1948 Manifesto{''}.
   This analysis was based on party documents, editorials published in the
   press and police reports. In addition to put into context the
   information obtained from the political scenario, an attempt was made to
   specify the different attempts to take over these entities.},

Abstract = {Citizenship, a fundamental political idea, exists in many forms in the
   United States. In this study, I apply the analytical strategies of
   American political development to examine the evolution of Cherokee
   constitutional citizenship law since 1827. The lack of political
   development studies on Cherokee governance presents a unique opportunity
   to identify foundational and second-story ideas underpinning Cherokee
   political thought. I contribute to the ongoing discussion of indigenous
   political development by creating a new theoretical framework for
   interpreting and analyzing durable shifts in Cherokee citizenship law.
   As America expands and diversifies, alternate, nonliberal views of
   citizenship increase in political relevance. Understanding why certain
   laws exist and where they came from is crucial for cultivating political
   engagement, engaging in productive discourse, and creating humanizing
   policies.},

Abstract = {The work addresses an almost unknown chapter in the saga of young Latin
   American students to strengthen the foundations of anti-imperialism and
   workers' struggles in Latin America. In August 1936, in the Mexican city
   of Guadalajara, the Ibero-American Congress of Socialist Students was
   held, which created the Confederation of Socialist Students of Indo
   America, CEADA, which existed between 1936 and 1939. At this meeting
   students from various countries of the continent converged to create an
   anti-imperialist and anti-fascist front of struggle against the advance
   of the interventionist policies of the United States and of fascism in
   the Western world. The article analyzes the ideological and political
   elements that were played out in this context and the effects it had on
   the young politicians who gathered at the continental event.},

Abstract = {Free school meals policy have been implemented globally as a mechanism
   to promote academic and nutritional equity. This study critically
   examines the management and challenges of free meal programs in four
   major countries: India, the USA, Japan, and South Korea. Through a
   comparative analysis, this article evaluates the governance structures
   of the programs. The study identifies a range of challenges faced by
   each country, including logistical complexities, socio-cultural
   barriers, and economic constraints. Despite their differences, the
   findings emphasize the importance of strong governance networks,
   sustained collaboration among key stakeholders-such as government
   agencies, educational institutions, and local communities-and
   context-specific policy adaptations. These elements are essential for
   overcoming challenges and ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability
   of free school meal policy initiatives. While addressing the primary
   objectives of health and education, these programs can contribute to
   broader social benefits.},

Abstract = {We team teach an interdisciplinary political science and literature
   course titled ``Violence and Reconciliation,{''} with case studies on
   the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in South Africa and on
   debates about whether to develop a TRC in Northern Ireland. The course
   culminates in a two-week simulation in which students role play the
   experiences, strategies, and needs of victims, perpetrators, legal
   teams, government officials, and NGOs in the aftermath of a horrific
   event that has torn a society apart. We assessed the simulation through
   pre- and post-simulation writing exercises as well as observations of
   insights revealed by students during negotiations. We believe the
   simulation is an effective tool for helping students move from a
   scholarly engagement with the processes of restorative justice to
   employing them in response to hatred and violence. This article
   describes the simulation for use or adaptation in other courses.},

Title = {Sticks and carrots for peace: The effect of manipulative mediation
   strategies on post-conflict stability},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mediation is widely used to settle armed conflict and interstate crises.
   However, the debate over the most appropriate and effective mediation
   strategy is still ongoing. In particular, manipulative mediation is
   controversial, with some research indicating that heavy-handed mediation
   may buy short-term peace at the expense of an instable long-term
   situation. This paper re-evaluates these claims. We discuss how existing
   theoretical arguments either do not imply long-term instability or
   implicitly make unrealistic assumptions to explain possible long-term
   problems of manipulative strategies. We re-examine published empirical
   evidence for problematic long-term effects of manipulative mediation in
   interstate crises. We demonstrate statistically that this evidence
   actually implies a different conclusion and instead supports our
   theoretical argument: manipulative mediation is associated with
   substantively greater stability compared to unmediated cases, although
   this effect weakens and becomes statistically insignificant after
   several years. Interestingly, non-manipulative mediation appears to be
   uncorrelated with post-crisis stability, based on our analysis.},

Abstract = {This article examines the origins and early activities of the Democratic
   and Republican Governors Associations (DGA and RGA, respectively) from
   the RGA's initial founding in 1961 through the 1968 national nominating
   conventions. I argue that the formations of these organizations were key
   moments in the transition from a decentralized to a more integrated and
   nationally programmatic party system. The DGA and RGA represent
   gubernatorial concern for and engagement in the development of national
   party programs and the national party organizations. Governors formed
   these groups because of the increasing importance of national government
   programs on the affairs of state governments and the recognition on the
   part of governors that national partisan politics was having critical
   effects on electoral outcomes at the state level, through the
   reputations of the national parties. To varying extents, the governors
   used these organizations to promote the national parties and contributed
   to national party-building efforts and the development of national party
   brands.},

Abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) challenges political
   theorists to think about data ownership and policy makers to regulate
   the collection and use of public data. AI producers benefit from free
   public data for training their systems while retaining the profits. We
   argue against the view that the use of public data must be free. The
   proponents of unconstrained use point out that consuming data does not
   diminish its quality and that information is in ample supply. Therefore,
   they suggest, publicly available data should be free. We present two
   objections. First, allowing free data use promotes unwanted inequality.
   Second, contributors of information did not and could not anticipate
   that their contribution would be used to train AI systems. Our argument
   implies that managing the ``global information commons{''} and charging
   for extensive data use is permissible and desirable. We discuss policy
   implications and propose a progressive data use tax to counter the
   inequality arising.},

Title = {The disappearance and the struggles between history the memories
   battles: the case of Bautista van Schouwen Vasey},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This research describes and analyzes disappearance in the civic-military
   dictatorship (1973 - 1990) context in its relationship with the history
   and the memories battles The hypothesis attends to the fact that the
   tensions between the disappearance and the lack of historical records on
   political thought and action, as well as the memories in dispute, hinder
   the consolidation of transformative social practices and the
   organization of political forces in response to problems of the present.
   Considering both the distinctions between history and memories, as well
   as their overlaps, the case of Bautista van Schouwen Vasey, member of
   the Central Committee of the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria
   (MIR), is presented as a paradigmatic example that reveals the tensions
   between, on one side, the historical record about political projects for
   social change and its transmission, on the other hand, the battles
   between memories that still perpetuate oblivion and those that promote
   collective memories as social practices. A qualitative documentary
   method is used, which includes the review of files, analysis of primary
   testimonial and secondary sources of the type academic, audiovisuals,
   and the press of the time. The results confirm that the disappearance
   has been disconnected from the historical political motive, which poses
   challenges to history and memories in view of its effects today.},

Abstract = {Social groups often differ in vote choice, but differences vary
   significantly between elections. Recent work argues that political
   parties shape group differences by the policies they propose. I posit
   that differences also depend on how parties use group-based appeals.
   This proposition is tested with a unique data set on group-based
   appeals, policy-based appeals, and voter preferences in Britain from
   1964 to 2015. Focusing on social class as one prominent group
   membership, I show how class differences in vote choice respond to
   policy-based as well as group-based class appeals: the gap between
   voters from opposing classes widens or narrows depending on how much the
   Labour Party emphasizes ``old{''} symbolic ties to workers and ``new{''}
   ties to businesses. These effects are robust and compare to the policy
   effects highlighted in previous work. Overall, this implies a revised
   view on how political parties influence the social divisions of
   electoral politics.},

Abstract = {The certification market has experienced an unprecedented rise after the

   how the technical nature of these instruments has given way to
   co-regulation for efficient adaptation to continuing changes with regard
   to a wide range of products, services or systems. To this end, we aim at
   providing a holistic overview of almost every standards that affect the
   privacy and data protection dimensions, specifically those that derive
   from the international reference standard ISO/IEC 27000 (series),
   specifically, ISO/ IEC 27001 (Information Security) and 27701 (Privacy
   Information Management). Standards that represent a first relevant
   starting point framed within the proactive responsibility, providing
   organisations with some effective instruments to demonstrate GDPR
   compliance.},

Abstract = {I analyze a model in which an incumbent ruler designs a rule for
   propaganda disclosure that reveals information about her competence to
   her allies and opponents. A message that increases beliefs about the
   incumbent's competence is considered as propaganda. I show that for
   propaganda to be persuasive, it must be limited in frequency. I also
   demonstrate how various features of the environment affect the frequency
   of propaganda. Propaganda increases in frequency as the incumbent's
   allies become more dependent on her and as her opponents become weaker.
   Further, there is a non-monotonic relationship between the strength of
   the conflict of interest between both her allies and her opponents and
   the frequency of propaganda. As conflict increases, the frequency of
   propaganda decreases up to a threshold beyond which increased conflict
   is associated with more frequent propaganda.},

Abstract = {In a large number of countries in Africa, biometric identification
   technologies have become a key element of voter registration procedures.
   Based on an in-depth study of biometric voter registration in Chad, a
   country marked by a long history of political violence, the article
   explains how the technology has been construed as a ``solution{''} to
   address a situation labelled as a political crisis. To make sense of the
   unlikely introduction of biometrics in Chad, two main elements are
   considered: the socially constituted belief in the potential of
   biometrics and - paradoxically - the unfulfilled promises and
   fallibility of that same technology. Combining the literature on
   biometrics, election technologies, and liberal democracy promotion, the
   analysis concludes that biometric voter registration is a disciplining
   technology. In addition to capturing the personal data of individuals,
   it fosters the framing of democracy in narrow technological and
   procedural terms.},

Abstract = {Contemporary studies mostly understand populism as a reaction to the
   failures of representative liberal democracies. Yet populism existed at
   the very inception of modern democracy before it became liberal. I
   contend that, during the French Revolution, conflicting claims of
   popular sovereignty gave rise to populism, which was instantiated in the
   Jacobin theory of Robespierre. The rapid transformation of Jacobinism in
   the years of the attempted birth of modern democracy (1789-94) tracks
   the theoretical question at the heart of populism: How can sovereignty
   be represented for a divided people that have yet to be united in order
   to exist?},

Abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the comparative historical literature on
   the development of American and European federal macroeconomic
   government institutions, spawned by the 2010-12 Eurozone crisis. The
   literature has two major shortcomings, namely a lack of agreement on
   relevant periodization and a lack of causal explanations about the
   sources of the processes being compared. My claim is that the most
   relevant comparison is between the first half of the twentieth century
   for the USA and the period beginning in the 1980s for the European
   Union. The reason for this is the underlying and profound socio-economic
   process of the corporate reconstruction of American and European
   capitalisms, which I identify as the root cause of the development of
   federal macroeconomic government institutions in both polities.},

Abstract = {The topic of abortion has been among the most salient and polarizing
   issues on the European continent since the 1960s. However, abortion
   referendums have not received much attention from political
   scientists-to date, there is no comparative analysis of such popular
   votes. This article goes beyond the usual models of single case/country
   analyses and examines nationwide referendums on this policy in four
   European countries from the last four decades. The analysis focuses on
   twelve referendums and aims to identify the factors behind the
   pro-choice or pro-life outcome of a referendum by exploring the impact
   of relative consensus within the parliament, support of the head of
   government and medical experts, and the level of secularization of the
   country. The findings suggest that these factors have a substantial
   influence on the outcome.},

Abstract = {This paper explores an alternative mechanism for understanding the
   drivers of the nomination of women for elective office in single-member
   electoral systems. Previous research has generally examined two sources
   of gender-based politics: party ideology, with leftist parties being
   more female-friendly than rightist parties, and the strategic nomination
   of candidates depending on whether the party is expected to win or lose
   in the district, with women more likely to be used as `sacrificial
   lambs' in hopeless contests. We argue that the nomination of male and
   female candidates across districts reflects an interdependence of party
   strategies - in particular, the actions of the main opposition party. We
   hypothesise that when the trailing party is not committed to gender
   equality, its equilibrium strategy in a given district is the nomination
   of a candidate of the same gender as that of the front-running party.
   Secondary data from 1,017 single-member Australian districts and more
   than 2,000 candidates from 2001-2019 confirm our hypothesis.},

Abstract = {As populist radical right parties muster increasing support in many
   democracies, an important question is how mainstream parties can
   recapture their voters. Focusing on Germany, we present original panel
   evidence that voters supporting the Alternative fur Deutschland
   (AfD)-the country's largest populist radical right party-resemble
   partisan loyalists with entrenched anti-establishment views, seemingly
   beyond recapture by mainstream parties. Yet this loyalty does not only
   reflect anti-establishment voting, but also gridlocked party-issue
   positioning. Despite descriptive evidence of strong party loyalty,
   experimental evidence reveals that many AfD voters change allegiances
   when mainstream parties accommodate their preferences. However, for most
   parties this repositioning is extremely costly. While mainstream parties
   can attract populist radical right voters via restrictive immigration
   policies, they alienate their own voters in doing so. Examining position
   shifts across issue dimensions, parties, and voter groups, our research
   demonstrates that, absent significant changes in issue preferences or
   salience, the status quo is an equilibrium.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes respond to threatening student movements with
   repression and censorship. In many cases, failed movements are
   effectively erased from public memory. Do such movements affect
   long-term attitudes? We use a survey of college graduates to measure the
   impact of a failed student movement. Some of our respondents began
   college immediately before a major protest; others started after the
   movement had been suppressed. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity, we
   find that individuals who attended college during the movement are
   significantly less likely to trust the government, more than 25 years
   later, than individuals who enrolled after the protests. The effects are
   strongest for trust in the central government, and weakest for local
   government. These results are robust to a range of specifications, and
   show that the experience of mass mobilization and state repression can
   have a long-term impact on public attitudes, even if the event in
   question remains taboo.},

Abstract = {The political science discipline has recently engaged in contentious
   debate about the value of ``research transparency,{''} particularly for
   research with human participants. The discipline is also holding vital
   conversations about research ethics and is rekindling dialogue about
   different ways of knowing. We offer an integrated account of how the
   actions that scholars who conduct human participant research take to
   respect ethical principles (which vary by research substance and
   settings), and their epistemological commitments (which vary across
   researchers), influence openness, a broader concept than
   ``transparency.{''} These principles and commitments shape scholars'
   openness practices simultaneously-both independently and in
   concert-serving as a prism through which multiple features of a research
   project are refracted, and resulting in a scholar's inclination and
   ability to pursue openness in different ways and to different degrees
   with the audiences of her work. We also show how ethical principles and
   epistemological commitments can not only constrain and prevent openness,
   but also animate and require it. We suggest that scholars pursuing
   openness ethically, and in ways that honor their epistemological
   commitments, represents good social science, and we offer strategies for
   doing so. To develop our argument, we focus primarily on two research
   methods, ethnography and interviews, and on openness toward two
   audiences, human participants and research communities. Our account
   illuminates how the heterogeneity of human participant research makes it
   inappropriate, indeed impossible, to develop blanket rules for pursuing
   openness. Throughout, we highlight the importance of reflexivity for the
   ethical conduct of, and for being ethically open about, political
   science research.},

Abstract = {Why do some states largely comply with their self-reporting obligations
   in international institutions, while others fulfil them only
   irregularly? In this article, I conduct the first large-N analysis of
   self-reporting that comprises several important areas of international
   cooperation. This analysis relies on an original and large dataset that
   covers self-reporting within 25 universal arms control, environmental
   and human rights agreements. The empirical results find little evidence
   for an intuitive view that the support of states for the respective
   treaties and the conformity of state policies with the general goals of
   those treaties drive compliance with self-reporting obligations.
   Instead, the article reveals that this compliance is mainly influenced
   by the reporting behaviour of the country's regional peers and by
   national economic and administrative capacities.},

Abstract = {Most political systems consist of multiple layers. While this fact is
   widely acknowledged, we know surprisingly little about its implications
   for policy-making. Most comparative studies still focus exclusively on
   the national level. We posit that both ``methodological nationalism{''}
   and ``methodological subnationalism{''} should be avoided. We argue
   instead that in multilevel systems national and subnational governments
   jointly affect policy-making. Their respective influence is, however,
   conditional on the distribution of policy authority. Moreover, we
   identify power asymmetries, as subnational governments hardly affect
   policy-making in centralized systems whereas national governments shape
   subnational policy-making even in decentralized polities. Empirically,
   we study the case of education policy. Novel data on regional education
   spending, regional and national governments' ideology, and regional
   authority over education in 282 regions in 15 countries over 21 years
   reveals strong support for the interplay between ideology and the
   distribution of authority across levels. We conclude by sketching a
   resulting research agenda.},

Abstract = {An influential body of research on American public opinion since the
   mid-1980s has found economic self-interest to be, at best,
   inconsistently and weakly related to social and political attitude
   formation. This article argues that this conclusion is related to a
   dearth of analysis of the potential effect of economic insecurity on
   American public opinion. It is argued that respondents' perceptions of
   their own economic insecurity capture the extent to which not acting
   self-interestedly can result in hardship-causing economic loss.
   Empirically, it is shown-through standard regression techniques and more
   stringent coarsened exact matching (CEM)-that economic insecurity has a
   systematic and strong effect on the redistributive, class, and racial
   attitudes of Americans; an effect that often rivals or supersedes the
   effect of sociotropic and symbolic attitudes. It is also shown that
   affective economic insecurity-one's worry or anxiety regarding the
   potential of future economic hardship-and cognitive economic
   insecurity-an individual's more or less dispassionate estimate of future
   economic hardship-often have distinct and complementary effects in
   determining public opinion, even when both measures are included in the
   same model. The evidence presented here makes it clear that existing
   measures and conceptualizations of economic self-interest-and the body
   of empirical work that discounts economic factors in American public
   opinion-need to be rethought in light of economic insecurity.},

Abstract = {In today's United Kingdom, Islamophobia is as contested as it is real.
   Challenging this contestation, this article presents findings from ten
   small-scale, qualitative studies that seek to evidence and better
   understand the lived, tangible experience of Islamophobia in real-world
   spaces. To do so, this article briefly explores the development and
   incidence of Islamophobia in public and political spaces and how
   contestation has ensued. From here, the findings draw out how Muslims
   experience Islamophobia in their everyday lives, ranging from instances
   of verbal abuse through threats and intimidation to physical assault and
   violence. As part of this exploration, new insights are afforded into
   the role and impact of terrorist attacks on hate crimes, geopolitical
   and military conflicts, the content of Islamophobic abuse, and the
   rapidly changing nature of that, which shapes and informs tangible forms
   of Islamophobia. In doing so, this article concludes by contextualizing
   the realities of Islamophobia within the far from conducive public and
   political spaces of the UK. This article makes a timely contribution to
   and improves knowledge about Islamophobia in today's UK.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between local government
   dissemination of COVID-19 information and partisanship. The unit of
   analysis is all official county government websites in the United
   States. In particular, we investigate if there is a correlation between
   the overall partisanship of a county and whether a county government's
   website (1) mentions COVID-19 and (2) provides safety instructions
   concerning COVID-19. We hypothesize that mass partisanship will impact
   the probability that a county government's website provides information
   related to the coronavirus. We find that a larger share of Democratic
   voters in a county is associated with an increase in the probability
   that a county government's website mentions COVID-19 and provides safety
   instructions for its residents. The results hold even after controlling
   for population density, internet subscriptions and COVID-19 cases and
   deaths. The finding indicates that citizens' access to information, even
   on matters of public health, are partially a consequence of
   partisanship.},

Title = {Digital disconnection and university teaching online in times of
   pandemic for COVID-19: an illusion more than a reality},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The declaration of the state of alarm about the COVID-19 pandemic has
   meant that work activity is carried out in a telematic way, in the
   collectives in which it has been possible. One of them is the university
   sphere, in which the teaching staff has moved from the classroom to the
   virtual world. The right to digital disconnection provided for in
   Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on Personal Data Protection and
   Digital Guarantee leaves many issues in the air that make it difficult
   to implement this right, together with its lack of development within
   the university. In this paper we intend to reflect on what has been more
   an illusion than a reality, addressing its shortcomings, limitations and
   lack of guarantees of this right, since in this scenario that we have
   lived we have not been able to disconnect at any time. We have to take
   into account that the scenario that we have encountered has not been
   accompanied by measures, instructions, or protocols in which the right
   to digital disconnection is contemplated, and that the increase in hours
   dedicated to online teaching has been much higher than if it had been
   face-to-face teaching. Issues such as the difficulty of reconciling work
   activity with family life in a framework of virtual activities with a
   continuous, excessive connection to the internet determines that it is
   necessary to establish legal and personal limits for the exercise of
   this right to digital disconnection and that have recently been
   determined in the Royal Decree-Law 28/2020, of September 22, on distance
   work, and the Royal Decree-Law 29/2020, of September 29, on urgent
   measures regarding teleworking in Public Administrations and human
   resources in the National Health System to face the health crisis caused
   by COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Various studies explored under which conditions junior coalition
   partners are able to have an impact on foreign policy outcomes. However,
   these parties do not always manage to get what they want. In this
   situation, they face a dilemma: defecting or staying? In the Italian
   context, as far as Military Operations Abroad (MOA) are concerned, the
   latter option has invariably prevailed. In particular, Italy's
   involvement in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo (1999) and Operation
   Unified Protector in Libya (2011) raised considerable contestation from
   junior partners that did not result in the termination of the respective
   cabinets. Employing extensive qualitative data, including a set of
   original interviews with relevant policymakers, this article aims to
   understand why junior partners did not defect in these two cases. The
   empirical findings highlight a variation in parties' motivations
   according to their ideological leaning: while extreme-left parties were
   afraid of being punished by their own voters for leaving the cabinet
   because of the participation in the operation in Kosovo, the far-right
   and autonomist Lega Nord did not consider opposition to the military
   intervention in Libya as a salient issue. Therefore, the article has
   considerable implications for the research agendas on the party politics
   of military interventions and government termination.},

Abstract = {Is realism in political theory compatible with utopianism? This article
   shows that it is, by reconstructing a highly restrictive realist
   approach to political theory for guiding legislation and public policy,
   drawn from the work of Adam Smith, and showing how it can accommodate
   Piketty's utopian proposal for a global tax on capital. This shows not
   only that realism and utopianism are compatible; but how realist and
   utopian political theory can be carried out in concrete cases. This
   moves debates to more interesting questions of which forms of utopianism
   are permissible within which forms of realism; contributes to moving the
   contemporary realism debates from a Methodenstreit to questions of how
   it can and ought to be done; and contributes to an important
   contemporary debate about the permissibility of utopian proposals for
   political and economic reform in general and Piketty's proposed global
   tax on capital in particular.},

Abstract = {The visual social media platform Instagram is a popular tool for
   political image building. Drawing on image management theory as well as
   right-wing populist and visual communication, this study explores how
   eight European leading politicians of right-wing populist parties
   present themselves on Instagram. The aim is to provide a first insight
   into relevant characteristics and patterns of their Instagram
   communication. The approach is twofold: A comprehensive visual content
   analysis (N = 724) is followed by hierarchical clustering on principal
   components. Three types of messages were identified, the most important
   ones being the creation of a professional image and the demonstration of
   closeness to citizens. Surprisingly few of the categories considered as
   relevant for right-wing populist communication were detected. At the
   individual level, politicians differ in the messages they emphasize.},

Title = {How do voters perceive ideological congruence? The effects of winning
   and losing under different electoral rules},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The degree of ideological congruence between citizens and their elected
   representatives is an important feature of democratic systems of
   government. A long tradition of literature has examined the ideological
   linkages between citizens and governments, often drawing attention to
   the differences (or lack thereof) in congruence across different types
   of electoral systems. Previous research has largely relied on
   aggregate-level measures of ideological congruence, such as the
   ideological distance between the position of the median voter and the
   government. We turn our attention here to how congruence relationships
   are perceived by individual voters, and how the perceptions of
   congruence may vary across electoral system types. This individual-level
   measure of ideological congruence is important in that individual-level,
   rather than aggregate-level, congruence has been shown to influence
   other outcomes such as citizen satisfaction with democratic performance.
   We expect electoral ``winners{''} - those who voted for a party that
   entered government - to perceive greater ideological congruence between
   themselves and the government compared to electoral ``losers{''}. We
   expect this effect to be stronger in majoritarian systems where
   political competition takes place primarily between two parties, than in
   proportional systems where electoral losers are more likely to receive a
   proportional share of representation. We test these expectations by
   estimating random-effects regressions of perceived individual-level
   congruence using data from 54 elections held in 23 democracies included
   in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). The results
   provide consistent support for our expectations. Electoral winners in
   all types of electoral systems perceive greater ideological congruence
   between themselves and the government, and this effect is stronger in
   majoritarian systems.},

Abstract = {Although Maluku's Ambonese people have been included and excluded on the
   basis of religion and ethnicity by the Indonesian state, it is religious
   identity that is politically salient. Despite the best efforts of
   Maluku's elites to cultivate ethnic solidarities, Ambonese identity not
   become politically relevant. Why is this the case? I argue that Ambonese
   ethnic identity did not become politically salient because the quotidian
   institutions and practices that mediate the lived experience of ordinary
   Ambonese reinforced attachments to religious communities, rather than
   ethnic ones. For this reason, Ambonese have weak attachments to ethnic
   categories. This article therefore highlights that 1) looking at the
   state yields only a partial account of identity formation, and 2)
   focusing on the quotidian processes of identity formation helps explain
   both the depths of emotional attachment to particular identities and the
   precise mechanisms enabling the continuity of these identities.},

Abstract = {Elections affect the division of resources in society and are occasions
   for political elites to make appeals rooted in voters' self-interest.
   Hence, elections may erode altruistic norms and cause people to behave
   more selfishly. We test this intuition using Dictator Games in a
   lab-in-the-field experiment involving a sample of more than 1000
   individuals in Kenya and Tanzania. We adopt two approaches. First, we
   experimentally prime participants to think about the upcoming or most
   recent elections and find that this priming treatment reduces how much
   money participants are willing to give to other players. Second, we
   compare results obtained across lab rounds in Kenya taking place right
   before the country's 2013 national elections and eight months prior, and
   find that selfishness is greater in the lab round more proximate to the
   election. Our results suggest that elections may affect social behavior
   in important-and previously unrecognized-ways.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a surge in women occupying positions of
   political power. This has been welcomed in part as a means of achieving
   better policy outcomes for women. We interrogate this proposition,
   developing a ``gendered accountability{''} framework to explain when and
   how female representation promotes the implementation of policies that
   women prioritize. Our empirical analysis applies this framework to
   sub-Saharan Africa, home to the largest recent expansion in women's
   political representation. We find that increased female representation
   in the legislature is robustly associated with reduced infant and child
   mortality as well as greater spending on health. Effects are magnified
   when women are more active in civil society and appear primarily in
   countries that have gender quotas and proportional electoral systems.
   Thus, while female representation can lead to improved policy outcomes
   for women, the process is not automatic and is unlikely to occur absent
   key institutional and societal conditions.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many studies have shown that political efficacy, interest in politics,
   and political knowledge are strongly related to political participation.
   In most analyses, these variables are described as having a causal
   effect on participation. In this paper, we examine the extent to which
   the relationship between political attitudes and participation is
   confounded by familial factors. By using the discordant twin design,
   which relates within-pair differences in political attitudes to
   within-pair differences in political participation, we are able to
   examine the relationship net of confounding factors rooted in genes and
   the early rearing environment. Using four samples of monozygotic twins
   from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark, we find that the
   relationship between political attitudes and political participation is
   confounded to a large extent. This study makes an important contribution
   to the literature on political attitudes and political participation
   given the longstanding idea that attitudes cause political
   participation. Our findings also have practical implications for those
   interested in elevating levels of political participation. In addition,
   they have important implications for how scholars theorize about, model,
   and examine political participation in the future.},

Abstract = {This paper compares different strategies of legitimation deployed by the
   nationalist movements in the Balkans and Ireland in the 19th and early
   twentieth century. In contrast to the traditional accounts that posit
   nations and empires as mutually exclusive projects, I show how imperial
   and nationalist discourses can reinforce one another. The paper zooms in
   on the changing dynamics of imperial and national legacies by exploring
   how specific social movements strategically deploy concepts such as the
   `small' or `greater' nation to facilitate different nationalist
   projects. By contrasting the historical experiences of the Balkan states
   and Ireland I show how geopolitical and historical contexts shape the
   complex and contradictory relationships between imperial and the
   national projects.},

Abstract = {While Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge offers a welcome
   corrective to the technocratic statism that dominates modern politics,
   Wittgenstein's view of language suggests that the problem of ideational

   Friedman's ``exitocracy{''} is as epistemically demanding as ordinary
   technocracy and thus cannot provide an alternative to it. Anarchism,
   however, might provide a more consistent alternative to technocracy.},

Abstract = {This article reviews recent research on pastoral resource conflict in
   the context of security crises across Sudano-Sahelian West and Central
   Africa. The goal is to improve understanding of the linkages between
   resource-related grievances, conflict escalation, and regional outbreaks
   of violence. The review focuses on factors perceived to play a role in
   violent conflicts across the region, including climate change, resource
   scarcity, and the political forces that mediate their relationships with
   violent conflict. Future research must draw from a wider body of
   literature to understand the relationship between resource access and
   drivers of conflict such as exclusion and perceptions of justice.},

Abstract = {This paper examines (1) the extent to which migration policies vary at
   the subnational level in the Federal Republic of Germany and (2) how the
   policy variance between the German Lander can be explained. Going beyond
   existing work, we propose a multidimensional measurement concept that
   distinguishes six different dimensions of migration policy at the state
   level: (1) the type of accommodation, (2) the type of services provided,
   (3) health care, (4) admission practices, (5) deportation practices, and
   (6) state positioning in the context of ``safe countries of origin{''}.
   Moreover, we analyze possible paths to explain the differences between
   the states, using a fuzzy-set QCA analysis and draw on a theoretical
   framework that combines party politics, socioeconomic context, and the
   attitudes of the population as conditions. Our results show that there
   are substantial differences between the federal states. We also find
   that the party political composition of the government in different
   paths is an important condition for the existence of restrictive or
   permissive migration policies. In not a single causal path of the fsQCA
   analysis is it possible to explain restrictive or permissive migration
   policy without taking party ideology into account-a result that clearly
   speaks for the high relevance of the party political composition of the
   government. In contrast, the attitudes of the population in each state,
   migration policy and socioeconomic conditions seem to play only a minor
   role.},

Abstract = {The concept of neoliberalism has been central to critiques of the
   dominant social order over the last 20 years. The use of the term itself
   is often a focus of repetitive debates, between those who affirm its
   conceptual validity and those who highlight its vagueness. Informed by
   Laclau's concepts of antagonism and heterogeneity, this article offers a
   theoretical account of how the term is articulated, especially in
   left-wing discourses (including scholarly discourses) that prioritize
   neoliberalism as an object of critique. I affirm the use of
   neoliberalism as a critical shorthand for naming an oppressive social
   order, but also highlight the potential political and strategic problems
   with catch-all critiques of neoliberalism from within a radical left
   imaginary. I suggest another mode of critiquing neoliberalism that is
   cultivated through an ability to talk about how different social
   phenomena that might be one-dimensionally named as `neoliberal' could be
   reconstituted in a coherent anti-neoliberal programme.},

Title = {The international politics of amour propre: Revisiting Rousseau's

Abstract = {Realism, constructivism, and liberal institutionalism share the
   assumption that states are rational and self-maximizing actors. While
   these theories disagree as to whether states prioritize military power
   or economic wealth, they converge around the notion that states pursue
   these goods rationally and predictably. Complaints against and threats
   of defection from prominent international security and trade regimes,
   including NATO and the EU, raise doubts about states' rationality and
   predictability. Perhaps these theories' shared assumption about rational
   action has become an impediment to understanding state behavior and
   institutional cooperation. To enrich and to expand the conversation
   within international political theory, my article turns to Rousseau's
   international political thought. Rousseau anticipates central arguments
   in each of the major traditions of IR theory but locates political
   self-interest in the sub-rational passion amour propre rather than in
   reason itself. Rousseau exemplifies a more nuanced way to understand the
   irrational roots of political motivation and the limits of international
   order. My paper traces the international implications of amour propre
   through Rousseau's key texts on international politics and turns to his
   ``Letter to Philopolis{''} as a way to re-frame Rousseau's account of
   political responsibility.},

Abstract = {Electoral competition is a cornerstone of representative democracies.
   However, measuring its extent and intensity constitutes a challenging
   task for the discipline. Based on multilevel conceptualizations, we
   discuss three different measures of political competition (electoral
   volatility, vote switching, and voters' availability) and their relation
   to each other. We argue that electoral volatility and vote switching as
   indicators of electoral competitiveness tend to misestimate the degree
   of competition in multiparty systems. As an alternative, we propose
   focusing on the individual's propensity to vote for different parties,
   i.e. electoral availability. Using data provided by the European
   Election Studies, we compare availability to electoral volatility and
   vote switching in the framework of necessary and sufficient conditions.
   Our regression results show that operationalizing electoral
   competitiveness based on voter availability - which is increasingly
   retrievable from cross-national voter surveys - helps to avoid type-II
   errors, i.e. identifying competitive elections as less or
   non-competitive.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of radical and populist parties has stimulated renewed
   discussions about the resilience of parliamentary democracy in Europe.
   This work contributes to this debate by analysing the extent to which
   positive parliamentarism, the prime minister's parliamentary dissolution
   powers, the government's power to table votes of confidence and the
   majority requirements for votes of no confidence serve as `shock
   absorbers' moderating the effect of ideological polarisation in European
   parliaments. Fitting several Cox Proportional Hazards models to data for
   752 cabinets from 28 European democracies between 1945 and 2019, the
   well-established finding that the restrictiveness of the constructive
   vote of no confidence mitigates the destabilising effect of strong
   extreme parties on non-electoral cabinet replacements is confirmed. More
   counter-intuitively, the absence of positive parliamentarism reduces the
   risk of non-electoral cabinet replacements when ideologically extreme
   parties are strong.},

Abstract = {The survey addresses three key reform debates relating to devolution in
   Wales. These concern first, the case for the further devolution of
   powers, notably those over criminal justice and policing; second, the
   defence of Wales' devolved powers in the context of Brexit; and third,
   the rooting of devolution in new constitutional ideals, primarily the
   Welsh government's preferred model of the UK as a voluntary association
   of nations, or the alternative pressed by the independence movement. In
   each case, there are strong pressures within Wales for resolutions which
   sustain and develop devolution; and in the case of independence, have
   the potential, with reform debates elsewhere, to transform the UK Union.
   However, there are also grounds for reflecting on the contested nature
   of further change, the long road that a case for independence may yet
   have to travel, and the interests of UK government.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump came to the presidency claiming a unique proficiency in
   negotiating deals. Once in office, however, he floundered. He adopted a
   passive approach to agenda setting, putting him in a reactive mode.
   Although he received high levels of support from Republicans in both
   chambers of Congress and although their leaders kept votes that he might
   lose off the agenda, Congress passed little significant legislation at
   his behest. The president received historically low levels of support
   from Democratic senators and representatives and could not win
   congressional assent for new healthcare policy, immigration reform, or
   infrastructure spending. Government shutdowns and symbolic slaps at his
   foreign policies characterized his tenure, even with his party in
   control of the legislature. He was even less successful after Democrats
   gained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.},

Abstract = {The election of Donald Trump as president in 2016 arguably represents
   the most unanticipated election outcome in contemporary American
   politics. Using three nationally representative surveys of the American
   electorate, this article analyzes the predictors of candidate support
   during the 2016 presidential campaign. At issue in the analysis is the
   question of whether Trump's popularity was tied primarily to ideology
   and principled support for Trump's issue positions or whether instead it
   was inspired by emotions and populist anger at the federal government.
   The results of the analysis inform our understanding of candidate
   support in two important ways. First, the results show that individuals'
   policy preferences on issues, particularly immigration, played an
   influential role in shaping their attitudes toward Republican and
   Democratic candidates during the presidential campaign. Second, the
   results show that while support for Trump was strongly associated with
   anger toward the federal government, such sentiment failed to increase
   support for any other candidates in either party. Taken together, these
   results suggest that Trump was able to leverage populist anger for
   political advantage in ways that other candidates were not and that such
   anti-elitism played an important and underappreciated role in explaining
   the outcome of the presidential election.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to conduct a comparative legal study of
   Ukrainian and international standards of criminal liability for
   corruption offences and their prevention. The research methodology
   includes the following methods: system-structural method,
   formal-dogmatic method, historical method, grouping method,
   comparative-legal method, legal modeling method and others. As a result,
   the peculiarities of anti-corruption regulatory-legal provisions and
   police practice in the states analyzed are clarified, with the selection
   of relevant positive and negative trends, principles of construction of
   anti-corruption policy, specificity of the conceptual apparatus, etc.
   Emphasis is placed on the need to further harmonize Ukrainian
   legislation with international agreements and the practice of their
   implementation. It is concluded that negative trends in foreign
   countries have been found to be the result of non-compliance with
   relevant commitments to combat and prevent corruption.},

Abstract = {The lack of sufficient energy resources in the EU region has made this
   region dependent on imports. The crisis in 2006 and 2009 was an alarming
   signal for the EU. These crises have led the EU to take serious steps in
   the field of energy. The main research findings were to find answers the
   following research questions: First, why is it difficult to establish a
   common energy policy for the EU? Second, how does the EU pursue a policy
   for a competitive energy market and ensuring the security of supply? The
   main aim of the EU to diversify energy routes and to make more
   competitive prices in the energy market. However, Azerbaijan is a
   strategic and reliable partner for the EU because of its geographical
   position and energy resources. Energy resources in the Caspian Sea are
   important to the EU and Azerbaijan is the ideal destination for the
   transportation of these resources. Thus, after many years the EU has
   taken an important step on behalf of energy security by implementing the
   SGC project in the frame of cooperation with Azerbaijan.},

Title = {The coup that wasn't. The last Bolivian state crisis and the limits of

Abstract = {In the light of the events in Bolivia referring to the ousting of
   President Morales towards the end of 2019, a huge international polemic
   emerged as to whether the accurate description of these events was a
   coup d'Etat. This article concludes that, independently of personal
   inclinations, to opt for the coup d'Etat variant is misleading. The
   analytical problems faced with the Bolivian case seem to stem not only
   from the hasty way in which scholars dealt with the facts behind the
   events, but also from the fact that the very coup concept may have
   reached its own cognitive limits. In order to overcome these limits the
   article expands the conventional threefold scheme
   (target/perpetrators/tactic) for defining a coup by adding the variable
   of the partial legal order concerning the political regime of the
   country. Given that definitionally the concept of a coup d'Etat implies
   the breaking of this order, it is argued to use the concept of
   restauration of the state instead of coup, if the anormal disruption of
   a president's period coincides with the fact that the mentioned order
   was already broken.},

Abstract = {From a documentary methodology close to legal hermeneutics, the article
   examines the problems of gender inequality; in particular, the study
   focuses on the problems of gender inequality in the Ukrainian National
   Police. The concepts and main stages of formation and development of
   gender policy in Ukraine are analyzed. The factors contributing to the
   emergence of gender inequality in the Ukrainian National Police have
   been studied. These include, firstly, the unequal position of women and
   men in society due to gender stereotypes. The article analyzes the
   components, characteristics, and functions of the mechanism for ensuring
   gender equality in the Ukrainian National Police. Particular attention
   is paid to the legal basis for ensuring gender equality in the
   activities of the Ukrainian National Police. To this end, the normative
   framework aimed at ensuring gender equality in the Ukrainian National
   Police was analyzed. It is concluded that, despite significant changes
   in the content of the laws to establish the principle of gender
   equality, there is still a long way to go to achieve effective equality.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to structure conceptual approaches for
   the establishment, development and improvement of the formation and
   functioning of (civil) public management systems in Ukraine and the
   Republic of Poland, as well as the identification of ways and methods to
   improve national mechanisms for the implementation of the state
   personnel policy, based on the modern positive Polish experience. The
   positive experience of modelling an effective public (civilian) service
   management system in Poland that can be used in Ukraine to solve its
   problems has been systematized. Materials and methods were used from the
   analysis of documentary sources. The basis was the dialectical method of
   knowledge of the facts of social reality, on which formal and
   comparative legal approaches are largely based. Conclusions indicate
   that ways and directions for further reform of the management system in
   the field of public service in Ukraine, include the further integration
   of the national public service model, and management mechanisms in this
   area to the standards of the single administrative area within the
   framework of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European
   Union.},

Abstract = {The article suggests that the gender politics advanced by the young
   female members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the family sphere
   after the 2013 military-led coup challenges the movement's ability to
   re-emerge from repression based on traditional patriarchal values and
   principles. A patriarchal division of labour, epitomized in women's
   position in the family, sustains the Brotherhood in times of repression
   and in its absence. The research shows that the circumstances of
   repression against the movement have caused women to reconsider the
   Brotherhood's patriarchal structures, with potential consequences for
   the organisation. The article does so by analysing women's articulations
   of their role in the family and in marriage relationships. Using love as
   an analytical lens, the article argues that women's demand for love in
   marriage suggest their desire to commit the Brotherhood to attending
   women's needs, desires and aspirations.},

Abstract = {The first decades of the XXI century were marked by the active
   development of information and communication technologies, including in
   electoral and political spheres. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a
   powerful additional impetus to these processes. The practice has become
   ahead of regulation, both nationally and internationally. The lack of
   unified legal enactments regulating the digitalization of socially
   significant procedures (primarily in the electoral sphere) is a
   constraining factor in the development of political processes of a new
   reality. The author is sure that it is necessary to unite the efforts of
   legislators, relevant public and international organizations to develop
   improved rules for political life of society in the digital environment,
   where the balance of guaranteed rights and freedoms of citizens will be
   maintained, on the one hand, and a high level of security, reliability
   and efficiency of new technologies, on the other hand.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {70},
Pages = {44-65},
Abstract = {In this research the objective was to analyze justice considering the
   optics of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, from a comparative perspective.
   A documentary review of the bibliographic material on Rawls' Theory of
   Justice (1975) and Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia (1988) was carried
   out, also considering the knowledge of different experts on the subject.
   It is qualitative research of descriptive type, with a methodological
   design of theoretical, documentary, and diachronic cut. In relation to
   the data collection technique, the registration or registration of
   author, documentary and content references was used. As a result, it was
   possible to establish an analytical comparison referring to some
   outstanding criteria on the notion of justice, especially in relation to
   how the ownership and distribution of wealth is assumed, according to
   both philosophers, the action of the State, for Rawls of great inherence
   and for Nozick of minimal participation. It can be concluded from this
   analysis that there are antagonisms between these two philosophers
   because for Rawls justice is framed in a social egalitarianism, where
   society is something ideal, abstract, while Nozick assumes it within the
   thought of conservative liberalism, considering a real and concrete
   society.},

Abstract = {Based on three basic models of interest policy (regional corporatism
   model, regional pluralism model and mixed model) and in the context of
   regional development and the development of civil society, we analyze
   the regional social dialogue in Slovakia. The empirical part of the
   study consists of a comparison of two analogous researches of actors of
   regional social dialogue in Slovakia from 1999 and 2020. Research
   findings and analyzes confirm that in Slovakia, regional social dialogue
   has not been yet institutionalized in any of the mentioned models.
   Actors in the regional social dialogue cooperate mainly in the regional
   labour offices employment committees (which follows from the Employment
   Services Act) and on an ad hoc basis. They evaluate critically the
   regional social dialogue in Slovakia and demand its legislative
   regulation, definition of its competencies and financial support.},

Abstract = {Social networks played a fundamental role in the development of the
   public debate in the electoral process of the 2016 plebiscite in
   Colombia. The dissemination of content of different nature, through
   videos on the social network Facebook, sought to persuade audiences
   regarding their intention to vote, the legitimacy of the process and the
   values at stake. This article shows the results of a quantitative
   analysis, and a qualitative content analysis, within that universe of 20
   political leaders of the Si and No political alliances during the
   campaign to endorse or deny the peace agreements in Colombia in 2016.
   The results demonstrate strategies of persuasion based on the use of
   culturally resonant values, the weight of the prestige and legitimacy of
   the issuers and the relevance of the use of emotions for the electoral
   political mobilization.},

Abstract = {The conception of financialization and the impacts of the oil market
   will be presented in this work from an alternative perspective.
   Financialization will not be analyzed as a dominance of finance over
   industry, as if these two sides of the productive process were
   dissociated. Financialization will be understood as a moment of
   expansion of a mechanism of domination, reaching not only the state-form
   and enterprise, but also the own constitution of the social being as an
   ``individual capitalist,{''} being part of the process of constitution
   of form-value. Oil, from production to the market, cannot be seen only
   in a reduced view of its high incomes. Oil must be understood as a
   social relationship. Oil from the 1980s onwards became one of the
   central elements of support for the US dollar, therefore, of support for
   the international monetary system. In addition to this new social role
   of sustaining the international currency that oil now has, this
   commodity also incorporates a determined form of social relation through
   its imposition as an energy source. Therefore, the main purpose of this
   paper is to show how both financialization and recent developments in
   the oil market are part of the actual constellation of the forms of
   capitalist social relations.},

Abstract = {The development of anti-Fascism in Italy was a laborious and difficult
   process: whereas a few had grasped the true nature of Fascism, many
   others believed Fascism to be a temporary phenomenon or that it might be
   transferred into the frame of legality or `normalised'. What made a
   large part of Italian intellectuals wait and see? Why did anti-Fascism
   reach its turning point only as late as 1924-1925?},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify problems related to the
   establishment of criminal liability for providing inaccurate Edu
   information about the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic, and propose the
   ways to solve them. To aim involved the following Maria methods:
   systemic approach, descriptive statistics, comparative approach,
   descriptive analysis, pragmatic approach, and forecasting. The
   effectiveness of health authorities' response to outbreaksReisttaesvu of
   diseases depends on the completeness and accuracy of the information
   disseminated. lddetu DrHumter In fact, national legislations do not
   provide criminal liability for providing hiiloomr inaccurate information
   about the epidemiological situation in a pandemic. Therefore, there is a
   need to develop Interim Guidelines to ensure the accuracy of information
   on the epidemiological situation in a pandemic. A rule that criminalizes
   the provision of inaccurate information or the dissemination of
   inaccurate information about the incidence in an epidemic and/or
   pandemic, should be one of the rules on liability for crimes against
   national security, and should be punishable by imprisonment for a
   certain period and deprivation of the right to hold certain positions
   and engage in certain activities. This study is not exhaustive and opens
   up prospects for further research in this area.},

Abstract = {We analyze a citizen-candidate model of elections between an incumbent
   and challenger to investigate the logic of interest group influence on
   election outcomes through campaign advertising. Whereas the incumbent's
   position is known to voters, the challenger is relatively unknown, and
   groups may allocate spending (either directly through independent
   expenditures or indirectly through campaign donations) to advertise the
   challenger's position. We prove that equilibria can feature either
   positive or negative advertising, but not both at the same time: ex ante
   evaluations of the challenger by the median voter determine which kind
   of advertising will arise. In a positive advertising equilibrium, only
   challengers located in a centrally located spending interval are
   advertised and win, while in a negative advertising equilibrium,
   challengers who are too extreme are targeted and lose. The analysis
   sheds light on the determinants of political advertising and voter
   beliefs, and it emphasizes their endogeneity with respect to the
   parameters of the model, e.g., the incumbent's location, prior beliefs
   of voters about the challenger's location, and the effectiveness of
   advertising technology. Moreover, it illuminates the preconditions for
   positive and negative advertising, and indicates circumstances in which
   one tactic is more likely to be employed than the other.},

Abstract = {The cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M\&A) have long been a worthy
   measure for Chinese enterprises to enhance their capabilities on their
   path to becoming globalized. However, the various motives adopted by
   these enterprises towards cross-border M\&As, tend to generate diverse
   effects on their performance. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the
   cross-border M\&A performance of the participant companies pertaining to
   their particular motives can result in devising rationalized and
   science-oriented M\&A activities. Being cognizant of the constant
   reforms in regulatory policies and market conditions has conditioned the
   Chinese enterprises to have a more realistic approach in their
   cross-border M\&A activities. The Belt and Road Initiative demonstrates
   incredible prospective for cross-border M\&As as well as investments.
   Meanwhile, as transnational trading stays invigorated by an ever more
   globalized economy, these M\&A activities function as powerful catalysts
   for the strong development of China's national economy. However, the
   Sino-American trade dispute has escalated into a full-blown trade war
   since July 6, 2018, and has severely compromised the cross-border M\&A
   campaigns and globalization strategies practiced by Chinese enterprises.
   Hence, a comprehensive analysis of the cross-border M\&A performance
   projected by various Chinese enterprises working with different motives
   can contribute to the determination of suitable M\&A strategies for
   companies, under the ongoing economic conflict.},

Abstract = {The end of the Cold War, as well as the collapse of the Soviet Union,
   posed new greater challenges and risks for the ``Global North.{''}
   Terrorism-doubtless-seems to be one of them. Over the recent years, and
   particularly after 9/11, terrorists changed the focus of their attacks.
   While classic terrorism targeted important persons such as politicians,
   chief police officers, or celebrities, modern terrorism planned attacks
   on leisure-spots spaces, tourist destinations, and lay-persons. This is
   particularly troublesome for policymakers (who are in charge of
   orchestrating all-pervading models to preserve homeland security) and
   for field-workers who are seriously punished when they are in contact
   with radicalized cells. For this reason, specialists traverse for many
   problems to understand the complexity of terrorism as well as the
   motivation of young lone-wolves to attack societies where they are
   native. The present conceptual research focuses not only on the borders
   of travel literature but also the colonial stereotypes forged during the
   European expansion to draw and model an ``alterity{''} strictly limited
   to the ideals of the Enlightenment. In a nutshell, the allegories
   revolving around the ``lone-wolf terrorism{''} continues the imprint of
   the ``archetype of the noble savage{''} coined in 18th century.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {284-303},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the multiple significations of the
   ``frontline{''} metaphor in the UK during the first ten months of
   COVID-19. We argue that the term ``frontline{''} has operated as a
   performative frame, which has helped to produce the very notion and the
   materialization of the ``COVID-19 frontline{''} and keyworkers. Showing
   how the UK government has repeatedly cited this metaphor, we outline the
   contradictory effects it has generated through an interplay of
   hyper-visibility and opaqueness. The frontline metaphor has been used to
   justify the government's injection of massive amounts of public money
   into the economy, render hyper-visible workers who had previously been
   invisible, whilst generating a sense of civic responsibility.
   Simultaneously, however, the metaphor has created a smokescreen for
   corrupt practices, deflecting attention away from resource-starved
   health and social care infrastructures and intensifying forms of
   ``everyday bordering{''} and ``everyday racism{''} that deepen
   structural injustices in the UK.},

Abstract = {In the Czech Republic, China policy has been hotly debated for many
   years. The background to the discussion was initially the violent
   stifling of the human rights movement in Beijing in 1989 and the
   peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia that same year. It is no
   coincidence that the Czech media dedicates its attention above all to
   Tibet and Taiwan. The Czech Republic's first president, Vaclav Havel,
   who was a personal friend of the Dalai Lama, still represented a
   credible concept of solidarity with the powerless. Over the past two
   decades, however, the debate has deteriorated. Now, vociferous criticism
   of China serves almost only to boost the domestic standing of
   politicians. Symbolic gestures are supposed to demonstrate fearlessness
   in the face of a great power. China experts can hardly get a word in.
   The Czech Republic lacks a foreign policy strategy to improve the actual
   human rights situation in China.},

Title = {Racism and Islamophobia in the Discursive Market of the Spanish Left},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Despite the assumption that the Left is in itself anti-racist, in
   discourses and political practice of the Spanish Left, the fight against
   racism has often had a limited space that only expands in a temporary ,
   way, and its presence has been even more marginal in analytical
   literature. Islamophobi a, a form of specific racism against Muslim
   people or considered as such, has not received particular attention. The
   political space after 15 M has inherited these characteristics. However,
   since recent times, there has been a greater interest in racism and
   anti-racism in the discursive market of the left, as well as an
   incipient interest in islamophobia, due to a series of factors analyzed
   in this article according to the internal logic of both the political
   field and the specific field of leftist activism.},

Abstract = {We analyze the results of a neighbor-to-neighbor, grassroots
   get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drive in Virginia, in which unpaid volunteers
   were encouraged to contact at least three nearby registered voters who
   were likely co-partisans yet relatively unlikely to vote in the 2017
   state election. To measure the campaign's effectiveness, we used a
   pairwise randomization design whereby each volunteer was assigned to one
   randomly selected member of the most geographically proximate pair of
   voters. Because some volunteers unexpectedly signed up to participate
   outside their home districts, we analyze the volunteers who adhered to
   the original hyper-local program design separately from those who did
   not. We find that the volunteers in the original program design drove a
   statistically significant 2.3\% increase in turnout, which was
   concentrated in the first voter pair assigned to each volunteer. We
   discuss implications for the study and design of future GOTV efforts.},

   insights for making lifelong learning policy more effective},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {192-214},
Abstract = {In pursuit of sustainable, human capital-centric growth, Singapore
   initiated a lifelong learning policy of SkillsFuture Credit (SFC) which
   enables citizens to advance their skills in an autonomous and flexible
   manner. However, the results so far indicate that the SFC outcomes are
   not aligned with the policy goals it set out to achieve, as the
   participation rates remain subpar, and program implementation is dotted
   with fraudulent claims. This study aims to gauge the effectiveness of
   SFC both in achieving its primary policy goals and an overarching
   objective of building a culture of lifelong learning in Singapore. In
   doing so, this study relies on perspectives of the main stakeholders of
   SFC using the framework of policy feedback and policy-learning effects.
   The findings show that while most respondents are satisfied with the
   SFC, low participation rates are largely driven by structural barriers
   of time and financial cost. In addition, there exists a mismatch between
   the government-driven pragmatism rhetoric in lifelong learning and the
   personal aspirations of respondents towards self-development.
   Policymakers may benefit from the findings of this research by
   recalibrating their approach through investing in more diverse,
   high-quality courses, ensuring the value of the course certificates for
   employability, and improving the outreach efforts.},

   of Bakhtinian thought to study the novel of the Colombian armed conflict
   and the interactions that take place in the classroom when this kind of
   literary works is read. Methodologically, it makes a review of the texts
   published on behalf of the author to gather and interpret some of their
   notions. As a result of the process, it makes a detailed description of
   the selected theoretical categories while reflecting on their relevance

   campaign{''}},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {At the end of April 2021, the Moscow state prosecution petitioned for
   Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and its regional offices to
   be officially declared ``extremist organisations{''} and for them to be
   prohibited. The petition is based on the anti-extremism law of 2002. The
   vague concept of extremism makes it easier to abuse the law. It serves
   as a basis for preventing citizens from exerting their human and civic
   rights. The measures taken against Navalny's organisations are part of
   the intensified suppression of the opposition. At the end of May, a new
   law was passed. Now, anyone can have their passive right to vote
   withdrawn if they have been declared an ``extremist{''} in the past. The
   ultimate aim here is the suppression of society. Putin's presidential
   regime is on the threshold of becoming a dictatorship.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {70},
Pages = {22-43},
Abstract = {This research analyzes the effects of public policies and programs
   implemented by the Argentinian government between 2003 and 2019, to
   strengthen the institutional management of tourism. The main objective
   is to generate critical thinking and offer -from a theoretical
   perspective of the sociology of public policies- a set of guidelines
   that help mitigate conflicts, improving the effectiveness of programs
   and the quality of management. The analysis of public policies and the
   operational sequential method are used as an approach. The results
   provide a situational diagnosis that details the institutional advances
   of the period and pending problems. Regarding them, a set of proposals
   for improvement is defined. As a conclusion, it may be said that the
   Argentinian tourism sector has advanced towards a certain institutional
   consolidation, motivated by the Law 25,997/05. However, there are still
   unsolved structural problems, such as (i) the lack of information,
   internal control, and accountability; (ii) the incorporation of
   technologies and new government paradigms, (iii) and the achievement of
   a federalism that allows a more balanced and inclusive territorial
   development.},

Abstract = {Extensive research into the dynamics of the social movements has
   contributed significantly to the recognition that the political and
   geographic preconditions underlying the emergence of the feminist
   collective identity are important factors in the possibilities of
   feminist organizing. Therefore, the aim of the article was to analyse
   the intersection between political and personal, historical and
   contemporary aspects of narrating identity in the local context and to
   gain insight into how feminists reflect on their collective feminist
   identification in the light of the post-socialist history. The study
   builds on narrative interviews with 26 women, who reflect on the
   historical background of the Czech feminist movement in which they
   engage nowadays. The research results discuss distinctive features of
   post-socialist countries, e.g., non-activism, unwillingness to express
   committed consent in relation to feminist movement and its continuity,
   the negotiation of western and local feminism and limits of the
   construction of the collective identity. This article is intended to be
   a selective summary - linking theoretical concepts, which have been
   extensively discussed but have been not substantiated by practical
   statements, to the contemporary state of feminist organizing. My effort
   was to contribute to the debates on the specificity of women's
   experience in post-socialist societies and analyse the framework of how
   we think about historical implications of local feminism within the
   context of ``western{''} feminism.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to discuss the need to introduce a
   presumption of consent for the transplantation of organs and other human
   anatomical materials in Ukraine. Therefore, the object of the study is
   the presumption of consent for organ transplantation. The authors of the
   article have used methods of deduction, analysis and synthesis,
   comparative, and legal methods. The need to make amendments to the
   legislation of Ukraine regarding the introduction of the presumption of
   consent for the transplantation of organs and other human anatomical
   materials from a person and the feasibility of the practical
   implementation of these changes, namely, mean a major improvement and
   elimination of problems in the field of transplantation. It is concluded
   that at present one of the main problems governing the matter is the
   absence of presumption of consent for transplantation in Ukrainian
   legislation and, at the same time, the lack of significant funding of
   the medical sector, together with the low awareness of the rights of
   actors involved in organ transplant processes.},

   hacienda located in the surroundings of Popayan, the economic and
   political centre in the former society of masters and landowners of the
   province of the same name. He led the first movement of Indians against
   the land relations, a form of servitude, and for the recovery of
   communal lands or resguardos, as they are known in Colombia. He
   developed a long-silenced political thought. The ``Quintiada{''}, as the
   highest form of resistance to the dissolution of the cultural identity
   of the Indians, and their political ideals, are the precursors of the
   contemporary Colombian and Latin American indigenous movement.},

Abstract = {Embedded in the theory of political gnosticism and drawing upon a
   qualitative content analysis of 246 pieces of news released by state
   media, this article examines a means of legitimating anti-democratic
   measures deployed during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in
   Poland. The research aims to identify and explain the nature and origins
   of justification frames for quasi-militant democracy. The main argument
   is that journalists of the most popular state television, TVP Info, used
   political gnosticism to legitimate quasi-militant democracy. They
   exploited fears of losing one's life and health to convince citizens
   that the limitations of civil liberties are germane to survival and
   development. The research shows that the occurrence of all essential
   components of political gnosticism, used to justify anti-democratic
   actions in state media, is one of the indicators of anti-democratic
   changes in the political structure. It also provides insight regarding
   the theory of democratic erosion at a level of freedom of the press by
   offering evidence confirming the counter-democratic nature of
   quasi-militant democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {Women hold less than 10 percent of chief executive positions worldwide.
   Understanding how women democratically access these posts requires
   theorizing how they gain resources from established parties to mount
   viable electoral campaigns. We argue that in stable regimes marked by
   representational malaise parties respond to gendered incentives and
   nominate female candidates. Drawing on Latin American cases, we show how
   diverse parties nominated women in order to signal change or novelty, to
   credibly commit to ``feminine{''} leadership and issues, and to mobilize
   female voters. A negative case depicts how a lack of representational
   critiques can fail to incentivize parties to back women instead of men.
   Our focus on gendered incentives provides a new framework that places
   political parties at the center of questions about women's electoral
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {While gender gaps in political participation are pervasive, especially
   in developing countries, this study provides systematic evidence of one
   cultural practice that closes this gap. Using data from across Africa,
   this article shows that matrilineality - tracing kinship through the
   female line - is robustly associated with closing the gender gap in
   political participation. It then uses this practice as a lens through
   which to draw more general inferences. Exploiting quantitative and
   qualitative data from Malawi, the authors demonstrate that
   matrilineality's success in improving outcomes for women lies in its
   ability to sustain more progressive norms about the role of women in
   society. It sets individual expectations about the gendered beliefs and
   behaviors of other households in the community, and in a predictable way
   through the intergenerational transmission of the practice. The study
   tests and finds evidence against two competing explanations: that
   matrilineality works through its conferral of material resources alone,
   or by increasing education for girls.},

Abstract = {Based on a detailed study of the return of national-level planning in
   Argentina as embodied by COFEPLAN, the national planning council, we
   develop a conceptual framework to analyse the possibilities and limits
   of steering in governance. We lean on the theoretical apparatus of
   evolutionary governance theory and use the concepts of goal dependency,
   interdependency, path dependency and material dependency (effects in
   governance) to analyse the reality effects of strategy (effects of
   governance). Methodologically, our study relies on archival work and
   semi-structured interviews with planning scholars and public officials
   from different levels of government. We show that, although material and
   discursive reality effects were abundant in the evolution of Argentine
   planning policies, dependencies and discontinuities undermined both the
   central steering ambitions of the government and the innovative
   potential of the new planning schemes. The dramatic history of the
   Argentine planning system allows us to grasp the nature of dependencies
   in a new way. Shocks in general undermine long-term perspectives and
   higher-level planning, but they can also create windows of opportunity.
   The internal complexity and the persistence of Peronist ideology in
   Argentina can account for the revivals of national-level planning in
   very different ideological contexts, but the recurring shocks, the
   stubborn difference between rhetoric and reality, the reliance on
   informality, created a landscape of fragmented governance and often weak
   institutional capacity. In that landscape, steering through
   national-level planning becomes a tall order.},

Abstract = {The present article seeks to expose the problems arising from the
   normative acts adopted in Italy to deal with the Covid-19 health
   emergency, those pertinent to Constitutional principles. It is
   emphasized here that the Italian Constitution does not contain, unlike
   other experiences nearby, an exact definition of the state of emergency
   or exception, which allows an open reading of the taking of ``measures
   necessary for the reestablishment of public order and safety{''} and of
   the suspension of the effectiveness of the fundamental rights provided
   for. We investigate the governing concepts for the declaration of the
   state of emergency and the interventions made at the level of the civil
   protection code by means of decree-laws. Thereby, the numerous measures
   of the state of emergency caused by the pandemic form the catch that
   gives rise to conflicts with fundamental rights, from the right to free
   movement or health to even political participation. Finally, it is
   highlighted that these infractions give rise to the recognition of
   minority agendas that had been neglected in society and that suffered
   aggravation due to the impacts of the health crisis, such as the
   situation of women, prisoners and foreigners.},

Title = {Privatization without Capitalism: The Social Relations of Property in
   Post-Communist Transitions},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-40},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The literature on post-communist transitions has tended to conceptualize
   privatization with an emphasis on the state: private property is secure
   when the state surrenders its claims to ownership. This approach-though
   justified and often fruitful-is limited. Private property under
   capitalism is about more than the state. There are different forms of
   private property and not all of them characterize successful transitions
   to capitalism. Drawing on Marx'sCapital, I argue that a defining feature
   of private property under capitalism is the regulation of social
   relations between capital and labor. In contextualizing post-communism
   within historical transitions to capitalism, I seek to highlight the
   specificity of private property under capitalism and suggest that
   successful privatization is not the same as a successful transition to
   capitalism. Through a comparative study of land privatization in Russia,
   Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, I claim that while privatization
   might be necessary for a transition to capitalism, it is not sufficient
   unless accompanied by peasant dispossession.},

Abstract = {Direct and indirect criminological risks of the use of robotics are
   analyzed and issues of responsibility of the manufacturer
   (developer)and/or owner (user) of robotics are discussed for acts
   committed with their participation. This essay discusses promising areas
   of legal research related to robotics and its corresponding legal
   regulations. The definition of robotics is based and proposed as all
   categories of robots in their broadest sense, regardless of their
   purpose, degree of danger, mobility or autonomy, as well as
   cyberphysical systems with artificial intelligence in any form. It is
   proposed to recognize socially dangerous acts committed with the use of
   robotics as crimes committed in a generally dangerous way, if there are
   grounds for doing so. It is concluded that the commission of acts
   through robotics is capable, in certain cases, of creating a plurality
   of crimes in the form of a real aggregate. The expanding powers of State
   security bodies, which can carry out the functions of state policy
   development, legal regulation, control and supervision in the field of
   robotics application, have been verified.},

Abstract = {Against the historical-conceptual background of EU social policy and
   evolutionary governance, this article analyses the approach with which
   the EU propagates social investment policies. Social investment,
   understood as an active rather than passive way of social protection,
   has become a salient instrument for reinvigorating the EU's social
   dimension, especially in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. By
   means of a large-scale document analysis, we develop four EU social
   investment propagation approaches (reference, objective, tool, and
   action) according to how active (passive) and concrete (abstract) the
   EU's intervention in social investment is. The results show that the EU
   mainly propagates social investment with an active approach, i.e.,
   policy recommendations targeted at national governments. In terms of
   substance, the EU's treatment of social investment is based on labour
   activation policies backed by skills development and job search support
   policies, which is consistent with the main purpose of social
   investment.},

Title = {European Financial Governance: FTT Reform, Controversies and
   Governments' Responsiveness},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {208-218},
Abstract = {The Eurozone crisis exposed the incompleteness of the Economic and
   Monetary Union's governance framework thereby prompting the promotion of
   a multitude of reform packages and proposals. This simultaneously
   induced conflict among EU governments on both design and content of such
   reforms. In case of the financial transaction tax (FTT) proposal, which
   failed to garner consensus among member governments, it illustrates
   Ireland's disapproval clashing with favorable German and French stances.
   While these governments aligned on the necessity to reform, the process
   of harmonizing EU financial governance proved rather difficult. In
   analyzing governments' variation of reform support or opposition, the
   societal approach to governmental preference formation is employed. This
   is considerably conducive in directing academic attention to the role of
   two explanatory variables, domestic material interests and value-based
   ideas, in shaping governments' reform positions. This article
   encompasses a comprehensive comparative account of domestic preference
   formation and responsiveness of three EU governments (France, Germany
   and Ireland), in the case study of the FTT, and demonstrates that the
   two societal dynamics are prone to have played a role in shaping
   financial reform controversies. By building on and contributing to
   Eurozone crisis literature, this approach seems appropriate in analyzing
   financial governance reform due to the crisis' domestic impact resulting
   in increased public salience, issue politicization and an advanced role
   of elected politicians.},

Abstract = {Russia's political future will be decided by what happens to Navalny.
   The Putin regime has destroyed the state as a public institutional
   structure and has privatised it for its own purposes. It controls and
   sterilises the political space itself and through increasingly harsh
   repressive measures attempts to deny citizens and society their rights.
   Alexei Navalny is the only politician who despite this situation was
   able to act publicly and develop a countervailing power, and who
   attempted to win back the political space for society. His decision to
   return to Russia, despite an attempt on his life and the threat of
   incarceration, is an act of enormous ethical and political significance.
   Navalny demonstrates utter courageousness at a time in which the regime
   is trying to break up protest, intimidate society and disseminate fear
   once again.},

Pages = {279+},
Abstract = {The Czech Republic is by far the most developed country in East Central
   Europe. Measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita, it is on
   a par with Italy and Spain and lags only slightly behind France. Exports
   have contributed to this to a large extent. In order for the past three
   years' of positive development to continue, something must change.
   Structural problems in the export sector mean that the Czech Republic is
   not fully using its economic potential. Companies under Czech ownership
   have failed or been unable to replace the still significant role of
   foreign capital, which in many branches maintains a dominant position.
   Prague politicians have also so far refused to put forward a suitable
   policy of investment promotion that would contribute to the Czech
   Republic reaching its full developmental potential. Without overcoming
   these problems, the country will not succeed in breaking through into
   the group of above-average developed countries within the European
   Union.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to conduct an experimental study and provide
   evidence for systemic rehabilitation of student youth with
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychodiagnostic methods that are
   valid and reliable with standard test forms were used. It was stated
   that psychological protective mechanisms such as displacement,
   regression, substitution, compensation, and reactive formation were more
   active in psychological youth with PTSD (n=112). Assimilation (n=38;
   33.93\%), accommodation (n=48; 42.86\%), and disharmonious (n=26;
   23.21\%) disorders were identified. A comparison of the control and
   experimental groups was carried out. A cluster structural model of
   respondents' PTSD types was constructed. Respondents with a high level
   of PTSD manifestations were shown to have excessive internal tension,
   dysphoria, explosiveness, and a low level of integration with the
   environment. It was established that the proposed systemic
   rehabilitation is an essential component of working with the affected
   contingent. It was generalized that the application of experimental
   results from the study of health technologies operationalizes the
   educational process's work with students who have experienced
   posttraumatic stress disorder.},

   COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {142-164},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the comparative historical analysis of the
   military component in China's foreign policy in Africa. A brief
   historical sketch of China's African policy after the end of the World
   War 11 helps to understand the roots of the impressive strengthening of
   its political and economic influence on the African continent between
   2000 and 2020. Special attention in paid to the causes of political
   instability in many African countries, the military and political role
   of the United States on the Black Continent, UN peacekeeping activities
   and the participation of the Chinese military troops in special
   operations of this international organization.
   The authors conclude that there is a gradual evolution of the
   interpretation of the concept of responsible power, which holds a
   prominent place in the official foreign policy doctrine of the PRC. The
   article explores the genesis of this concept during the reign of the
   three Chairmen of the PRC Jiang Zemin (1993-2003). Hu Jintao (2003-2013)
   and Xi Jinping (after 2013), and discusses the stages of the formation
   of Chinese political-military doctrine, which is detailed in White
   papers of the Chinese State Council (2015, 2019, 2020).
   The article analyses the implementation of the military-political
   doctrine of the PRC in Africa, the creation of the first foreign
   multifunctional military base of the PRC in the Republic of Djibouti,
   and the transition of China from a bilateral model of relations with
   African countries to block diplomacy in the context of ensuring the
   collective security of participants in political associations.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1332-1365},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A burgeoning literature shows that international trade and migration
   shocks influence individuals' political attitudes, but relatively little
   is known about how international financial shocks impact public opinion.
   This study examines how one prevalent type of international financial
   shock-currency crises-shapes mass political attitudes. I argue that
   currency crises reduce average citizens' support for incumbent
   governments. I also expect voters' concerns about their own pocketbooks
   to influence their response to currency crises. Original survey data
   from Turkey support these arguments. Exploiting exogenous variation in
   the currency's value during the survey window, I show that currency
   depreciations strongly reduce support for the government. This effect is
   stronger among individuals that are more negatively affected by
   depreciation, and it is moderated by individuals' perceptions of their
   personal economic situation. This evidence suggests that international
   financial shocks can strongly influence the opinions of average voters,
   and it provides further support for pocketbook theories.},

Abstract = {This article locates the emergence of new thinking on the left around
   work, age and assets within the lineage of `class composition' analysis
   arising from the autonomist movement in mid-twentieth century Italy.
   With reference to contemporary debates around electoral and political
   strategy within the Labour Party, the article critically appraises the
   potential applicability of this extra-parliamentary `militant
   methodology' for the present day identification of ontologically and
   epistemologically privileged class actors and political subjects in a
   first past the post parliamentary system. Noting the resemblance of such
   approaches to the orthodox Marxist `gravedigger thesis', which reads off
   from economic relations the existence of agents of social
   transformation, the article argues that this analytical and strategic
   framing represents a flawed approach for Labour and the wider left.
   Other approaches are needed to navigate successfully the pluralist
   construction of consent through coalition building and compromise on
   which parliamentary politics rests.},

Title = {Teaching Political Science Research Methods Across Delivery Modalities:
   Comparing Outcomes Between Face-to-Face and Distance-Hybrid Courses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {What delivery modality is most effective in teaching undergraduate,
   political science research methods? Using systematically collected data
   from two academic terms and employing a quasi-experimental design, this
   paper explores variation in learning outcomes between face-to-face and
   distance-hybrid course offerings. Variation in the dependent variable is
   observed through measuring attrition (drop or failure), course
   performance among those who pass, and course satisfaction. While any
   evidence of difference in attrition rates is marginal when controlling
   for sex, age, university experience, a background in similar coursework,
   or whether the course is taken by a major, there is no evidence that
   modality predicts performance among those who successfully complete the
   course. Distance-hybrid learners are less satisfied with the class
   overall, unless you control for knowledge gains, math anxiety, and
   especially social presence. Perceptions of a learning community predict
   satisfaction for learners across both modalities, but when modeled
   controlling for other subjective outcomes, we predict higher
   satisfaction for distance learners. This suggests that the best pathway
   to equalize outcomes across delivery modalities is to work hard to
   overcome the social presence gap experienced by students learning in a
   distance-hybrid environment.},

Abstract = {Discussion is a crucial component for learning in a college classroom.
   Increasingly, university and college faculty are using online learning
   management systems to facilitate and assess course discussions. Given
   this reality, are there ways to frame prompts to generate normatively
   better discussions, or discussions where students are better able to
   meet the course learning outcomes? To answer these questions, we utilize
   data from Introduction to American Government classes at two
   institutions with the students of three instructors who participated in
   online discussion boards on multiple substantive topics; for each topic,
   students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions.
   In each, we framed a related prompt in different ways to test how such
   prompts impact student success as measured by several learning outcomes
   informed by the American Association of Colleges \& Universities
   (AAC\&U). With our unique experimental design and novel data, we are
   able to test several hypotheses related to student engagement, the
   content of discussions, as well as the quality of students' work. In the
   end, our research has important normative implications for pedagogy as
   well as the cultivation of civility and political engagement inside and
   outside of the modern classroom environment.},

Abstract = {Are there any prima facie reasons that democracies might have for
   disenfranchising older citizens? This question reflects increasingly
   salient, but often incompletely theorized complaints that members of
   democratic publics advance about older citizens' electoral influence.
   Rather than rejecting these complaints out of hand, we explore whether,
   suitably reconstructed, they withstand democratic scrutiny. More
   specifically, we examine whether the account of political equality that
   seems to most fittingly capture the logic of these complaints - namely,
   equal opportunity of political influence over electoral outcomes - can
   justify disenfranchising older citizens. We conclude that equal
   opportunity of influence cannot ground a blanket disenfranchisement of
   older people and that, taken in conjunction with other general
   considerations that apply to all sound electoral policies, partial
   disenfranchisement proposals (i.e. proposals for reducing the electoral
   influence of older citizens via age-weighted voting) are both
   quasi-inapplicable and practically unrobust across a relevant range of
   political contexts.},

Abstract = {Linked fate, the concept introduced by Dawson almost three decades ago,
   reoriented the study of racism and political behavior in the United
   States. The scholarship traditionally had focused on the racial
   psychology of whites and how racism seeps into their political views and
   actions. Dawson proposed the Black utility heuristic theory and linked
   fate, its associated measure, to investigate the political behavior of
   Blacks, the minority group most harmed by racism. Since then, linked
   fate has become a ubiquitous variable of interest in research on
   minority group politics. Yet the research program around linked fate is
   due for some extension. Most studies gloss over the fact that the Black
   utility heuristic theory is historically and socially conditional. We
   call for bringing elite-level agency and group-level social practices
   back into the literature to clarify the macro- and meso-level conditions
   under which a group's racial status translates into linked fate at the
   individual level. Greater inquiry into these dynamics is not only
   warranted but also has broad implications for the research on racial and
   ethnic politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the ways in which the suspension of standing
   orders is being practised in the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives)
   of Malaysia during part of the 14th Parliament from 2018 to 2020, with
   regard to its ultimate goal in achieving legislative functions, rather
   than as a shortcut to advance legislative or other business. This paper
   examines the legitimacy of having specific provisions in the Standing
   Orders of the Dewan Rakyat that would allow a suspension of standing
   orders to be carried out. Comparable to practices in the Australian and
   the New Zealand House of Representatives, it is suggested that a clear
   procedure for the suspension of standing orders in the Dewan Rakyat
   needs to be devised as part of achieving the proper legislative function
   of Parliament.},

Abstract = {This article investigates two accounts of political propaganda in
   autocratic regimes. One argues that propaganda's content does not matter
   substantively and that propaganda is mostly a signal of the regime's
   overwhelming power over citizens. A second argues that propaganda is
   substantively meaningful: autocrats may communicate strategically either
   by attracting attention through highlighting the regime's strengths or
   by distracting attention away from the regime's malperformance. Using
   nearly 135,000 North Korean state-generated news articles between 1997
   and 2018 we show that North Korea systematically adjusted its
   communication strategies following the leadership transfer from Kim Jong
   Il to Kim Jong Un.},

Abstract = {This article explores the gender dimension of ideology and
   representation by analysing the political parties that ran in the 2019
   Polish parliamentary elections, using a novel analytical framework based
   on gender claims and gender-related policy pledges. This article
   demonstrates that a left and liberal ideology largely determines
   feminist and pro-LGBTQ+ promissory representation. However, the gender
   ideologies of right-wing political parties vary in their traditional
   types and can include a populist element. This article contributes to
   comparative gender and politics scholarship by examining gender
   ideologies in the Central and Eastern European context, where on the one
   hand, populism and anti-gender campaigns have taken hold, and, on the
   other, feminist and progressive movements have challenged traditionalism
   and illiberalism. This article also differentiates a scholarly meaning
   of gender ideology from its populist meaning.},

Abstract = {Extensive research on gender and politics indicates that women
   legislators are more likely to serve on committees and sponsor bills
   related to so-called ``women's issues.{''} However, it remains unclear
   whether this empirical regularity is driven by district preferences,
   differences in legislator backgrounds, or because gendered political
   processes shape and constrain the choices available to women once they
   are elected. We introduce expansive new data on over 25,000 US state
   legislators and an empirical strategy to causally isolate the different
   channels that might explain these gendered differences in legislator
   behavior. After accounting for district preferences with a
   difference-in-differences design and for candidate backgrounds via
   campaign fundraising data, we find that women are still more likely to
   serve on women's issues committees, although the gender gap in bill
   sponsorship decreases. These results shed new light on the mechanisms
   that lead men and women to focus on different policy areas as
   legislators.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a new application of the concept of the
   `crime-terror nexus' by highlighting the increased prevalence of
   criminal engagement in modern slavery and human trafficking (MS/HT) by
   contemporary terrorist groups. Using the Islamic State and Boko Haram as
   case studies, Luciano Pollichieni and Andrew Mumford explain how such
   organisations are involved in MS/HT, and explore the economic and
   operational advantages they generate from involvement in these illegal
   activities. The authors call for new research in this field and flag the
   growing links between terrorism and slavery for counterterrorist
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {This article examines the frames used by Pakistani news media while
   covering a political protest in 2019 on Twitter. The study deploys
   quantitative content analysis based on thematic framing, episodic
   framing, genre, types and subject matter of tweets. In recent years,
   there has been growing recognition of the use of Twitter in political
   and protest communication. Twitter is a platform with the potential to
   manage and coordinate protest activities and movements effectively. The
   current study is carried out to demonstrate the importance of one of the
   aspects of political protest communication. Tweets (N =498) posted
   between 20 October and 20 November 2019 by three mainstream Pakistani
   media organizations (Dawn, The News, Express Tribune) were collected and
   analysed. Results show that straight news was used more in episodic
   frames by the media organizations on Twitter. Results of the study add
   to the increasing body of studies showing that media outlets have also
   embraced modern media to use frames while covering political issues.},

Title = {The potentials of heresthetic and rhetoric in an open framing situation:
   theory and evidence from a survey experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To win a policy debate, political actors may apply two analytically
   distinct counterframing strategies, rhetoric and heresthetic. Rhetoric
   is when counterarguments are formulated in the original dimension of the
   debate, while heresthetic is using arguments in a different dimension
   compared to the original frame. Although both rhetoric and heresthetic
   are ubiquitous phenomena in the process of public opinion formation,
   there are no general rules to specify their efficacy. Drawing on a
   survey experiment carried out in Hungary in 2020 (N = 2000), this paper
   uncovers the factors determining the effect of the two strategies.
   Introducing a conceptual distinction between open and trade-off framing
   situations, the paper demonstrates that the structure of the situation
   matters. While heresthetic has a robust effect in trade-off framing
   situations, rhetoric may have a strong impact in open framing
   situations. Moreover, the effectiveness of counterframing depends on the
   party affiliation of respondents and the strength of their related
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {With the increase of data availability, knowledge about quantitative
   methods is more important than ever. Indeed, students need quantitative
   methods to understand quantitative academic research, to conduct this
   research themselves, and to increase their employability in the labor
   market. Yet, students often experience quantitative methods as difficult
   to learn and, in turn, instructors find the topic difficult to teach. To
   make both learning and teaching easier, this article provides seven
   concrete suggestions regarding the teaching of quantitative methods.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {370-390},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has exposed deep economic and social fissures across societies.
   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI+) people
   are but one community whose marginalization, through this exposure, has
   been exacerbated. Given a history of criminalization on the African
   continent, in particular, LGBTQI+ people have come into stark visibility
   as citizens and, increasingly significantly, asylum seekers and refugees
   while contending with their absence from any form of pandemic planning.
   In this paper, I suggest that not only are we seeing a rise, linked to
   COVID-19, in insecurity experienced by African-based LGBTQI+ people but
   that this will have long term effects, one of which will be increased
   migration. Drawing on reports and empirical studies tracking the impact
   of COVID-19 on LGBTQI+ people and research and theory from the fields of
   disaster studies and queer African studies, in this paper, I approach
   COVID-19 as a disaster event. Applying a queer lens to disaster, I argue
   that if we read the historical stigmatization and criminalization of
   these communities as having led to the emergence of a growing LGBTQI+
   refugee population, both on and off the African continent, then the
   outcome of a disaster that exacerbates preexisting vulnerabilities can
   only mean the inevitable swelling of this populations numbers. However,
   as states globally use COVID-19 to further secure borders, curtailing
   asylum and resettlement, it is increasingly likely that these refugees
   will remain on the African continent. If that is the case, it would seem
   that ongoing criminalization may no longer be feasible.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the socio-demographic attributes and political
   attitudes of protesters in Germany. In doing so, the paper studies
   participation at demonstrations, one of the key forms of non-electoral
   political participation in Germany and a central political arena in
   which to negotiate political and cultural conflicts. Methodologically,
   we draw on original data from nine protest surveys collected between
   2003 and 2020. The demonstrations under scrutiny address a wide variety
   of issues such as peace, climate change, global justice, immigration,
   international trade and social policy. Analysing protesters' profiles,
   we focus on differences both within and across demonstrations. We show
   that demonstrators' socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics
   diverge considerably across the surveyed demonstrations. In particular,
   we identify two clusters of demonstrations, differing most prominently
   regarding participants' political trust, satisfaction with democracy,
   and perceptions of self-efficacy - the `disenchanted critics' and the
   `confident critics'. Based on a regression analysis across all nine
   demonstrations, we further show that the distinction of these two
   demonstration clusters is not the result of the presence or absence of
   certain groups of demonstrators.},

Abstract = {This paper provides evidence about the relationship between economic
   structure and political violence in Latin American countries in the
   period 1990 - 2019. The empirical analysis suggests that manufacturing
   activities are negatively associated with the number of terroristic
   attacks. On the contrary it exists a positive relationship between
   mining activities and political violence. A further analysis suggests
   that the relative size of manufacturing with respect to mining sector is
   negatively associated to terroristic attacks occurrence. Such
   relationship becomes stronger when it is associated to high levels of
   trade openness.},

Abstract = {It is well documented that the strength of national attachment relates
   to attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity, and that the direction of
   the relationship varies across national contexts. Yet, little attention
   has been given to the fact that attachments may not be expressed solely
   at the national level. In federal and multinational states, individuals
   can express attachment to the country and to its territorial units. This
   study investigates the relationship between (national and provincial)
   attachments and attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity in the Canadian
   federation. Our findings indicate that stronger attachments to Canada
   lead to more positive attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity in all
   provinces. They also demonstrate that provincial attachments relate to
   attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity both in a minority nation
   provincial context (Quebec) and in other provinces (Alberta and
   Saskatchewan), but that the direction of this relationship can be of
   opposite direction than that for attachment to Canada.},

Abstract = {In the United States, environmental federalism largely relies on a
   system for policy implementation that allows the federal government to
   delegate primary program authority (or primacy) to state agencies.
   Although it is an ingrained feature of several major federal
   environmental policies, such as the Clean Water Act (CWA), there is
   little evidence to indicate what impact delegating authorities has on
   programs. In order to examine this, the authors use a synthetic control
   technique to determine how actual CWA program outcomes in five states
   compare to expected outcomes if EPA retained primary authority. Findings
   indicate that while there were no significant differences in Texas and
   Oklahoma, state primacy led to improved program outcomes in Florida, but
   worse outcomes in Maine and South Dakota. Conclusions suggest that
   primacy has asymmetrical impacts that largely depend on state
   implementation systems, which carries important implications for
   environmental federalism.},

Abstract = {During the last five years, Russian relations with the GCC have
   developed on a largely positive trajectory. Even Moscow's decision to
   leave the OPEC+ agreement and launch a price war with Saudi Arabia in
   March 2020 did not threaten the gains made by Russian diplomacy in the
   region. Following a cooling-off period in 2012-2014 caused by the
   negative reaction of the GCC States to the Russian support of the Assad
   regime in Syria, the overall rapprochement continued. When explaining
   the complex mixture of factors that are driving Moscow's dialogue with
   the GCC member states regardless of occasional political turbulence they
   usually refer to the growing intensity of Moscow's presence in the
   region, changing dynamics of the U.S. relations with Russia and the GCC,
   existing tensions between Middle Eastern countries as well as the
   transformation of GCC foreign policy vision. Yet, the economic factors
   usually remain underestimated. Consequently, this article will try to
   prove the importance of the economic factors for the current development
   of Russia's relations with the Gulf States. It will also assess the
   prospects for continued economic cooperation between GCC capitals and
   Moscow including an analysis of the ability of the sides to bring these
   relations to a new qualitative level.},

Abstract = {Negative partisanship is one of the most popular explanations for
   current levels of dysfunction in American politics. Yet, the term is
   used inconsistently in both academic research and the popular press. It
   is sometimes referred to as negative affect towards the out-party that
   is a more important predictor of political behavior than positive affect
   towards the in-party. It is also sometimes referred to as a negational
   identity, wherein identification with one party is founded upon not
   being identified with the other party. In this essay, I first review the
   two definitions of negative partisanship and their preponderance in the
   mass public. Counter some reports, disdain is not more prevalent than
   warmth. Next, I discuss new evidence which shows that partisan disdain
   and negational partisanship are mutually exclusive concepts. Finally, in
   a reanalysis of published work, I reexamine the evidence that
   purportedly shows that negative partisanship is a better explanation for
   political behavior than positive partisanship.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that education is relevant for both domestic and
   international reasons and without an incorporation of the international
   within the national it is not possible to understand education's changes
   and transformations in post-conflict and conflict-affected contexts. The
   paper aims to connect the local to the global by investigating their
   dynamic interaction through the peculiar lenses of international
   assistance to education reform in post-conflict Kosovo. It asks two
   questions: (1) how do global agendas of peace and security affect
   education reforms in conflict-affected contexts? and (2) how does
   education reform in conflict-affected contexts interacts with and is
   related to broader, international dynamics, processes, and actors? More
   specifically, the paper analyses the role of international actors in
   traditionally national sectors and the multi-layered, hybrid governance
   of education reform within a broader statebuilding, peacebuilding, and
   stabilization perspective. The analysis is divided into two empirical
   instances: (i) education for liberal multicultural peace (1999-2013) and
   (ii) education against violent extremism and radicalization (2014-2019).
   The paper sheds light on the globalization and securitization of
   education as well as the changing forms and practice of statehood and
   sovereignty in times of post-war-reconstruction and fragility. A
   threat-containment and security-based logic has dictated priorities and
   determined chokes in education reform and content.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the impact of political regimes on carbon emissions
   (CO2) from a historical perspective, covering the period of 1970-2015.
   Our sample consists of 153 countries that we follow for 20 years before
   the transition (1970-1990) and 26 years after it (1990-2015). During
   transition, post-Communist states experienced a decline in CO2, when
   controlling for economic variables. Transition had a positive impact on
   the environment only in cases when it was associated with
   democratization. When transition has led to consolidation of autocratic
   regimes, CO2 has increased.},

Abstract = {Politicization has different consequences for public administration and
   public services in different countries. This study seeks to identify the
   consequences of politicization in the Iranian public service. After
   reviewing the theoretical foundations of politicization, the authors
   reflect on different researchers' and political experts' views about the
   consequences of politicization. In the first phase of the study,
   qualitative data were gathered and categorized into structural,
   content-behavioral, and environmental dimensions, and Rouban's framework
   was used to organize themes. In the second phase, statistical analyses
   were performed to corroborate the results of the first phase. Results
   indicated that the consequences of two types of politicization were
   perceived to be negative ones, and there was one type of politicization
   in which the consequences were assumed to be more constructive than
   destructive. Implications and recommendations for future studies are
   advanced.},

Abstract = {Sociological theory posits that social change occurs first and foremost
   among young people, who set trends that may eventually carry over to
   older citizens. This study examined to what extent this proposition
   applies to electoral shifts by comparing parties' electoral gains among
   young (age 25) and older voters (age 24) in 21 Western established
   democracies between 1948 and 2019. An analysis of 219 national election
   surveys revealed that winning parties typically gained
   disproportionately among young voters. This youth bonus was even
   stronger for new parties, whose electoral breakthroughs were importantly
   facilitated by youths. Electoral shifts among young voters furthermore
   predicted similar changes among older citizens in the subsequent
   election. This indicates that young people are not only more sensitive
   to electoral trends, but that they can also set trends that eventually
   carry over to older citizens. Young voters should therefore be seen as
   important drivers of electoral volatility.},

Abstract = {Attitudinal differences between urban and rural voters in America have
   been in the spotlight in recent years and engaging rural populations
   politically has been growing in importance, particularly since the 2016
   presidential election. Meanwhile, social and geographic sorting is
   increasing the salience of a rural identity that drives distinct policy
   preferences. While recent research has examined how rural identities
   drive social and economic policy preferences, rural Americans are also
   particularly relevant to the fate of environmental policy. Farmers,
   ranchers, and forest landowners manage huge portions of American lands
   and watersheds and are important stakeholders in the implementation of
   environmental policies. Despite this, the environmental policy
   preferences of rural Americans have received little attention from the
   research community. This study fills a gap in the literature by
   investigating how collective identities among rural Americans drive
   environmental policy preferences. Through eight focus groups and
   thirty-five interviews with rural voters across America (total n=105),
   this study explores how four components of rural American identity-
   connection to nature, resentment/disenfranchisement, rootedness, and
   self-reliance-inform specific rural perspectives on environmental
   policy. The findings have implications for how to best design,
   communicate, and implement environmental policies in a way that can
   better engage rural Americans on this issue.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {75},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous research posits that constituents' evaluations of senators will
   vary over time depending on if a senator is up for re-election or not.
   In order to test the effect of the Senate electoral cycle on constituent
   opinion, we take advantage of the Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study's survey panel from 2010, 2012, and 2014. These data are
   particularly well suited for our study because they allow us to examine
   the same constituents' opinions of the same senators at various stages
   in the Senate electoral cycle. While our analysis finds some variation
   in constituent evaluations over time, many of these differences are
   either statistically insignificant or substantively negligible. On
   balance, we find much more consistency in constituent evaluations over
   time, but the relationship can be more nuanced and conditional on the
   level of electoral competition. Specifically, we find that competitive
   elections lead to an increased association between policy agreement and
   constituent evaluations.},

Abstract = {The Marriage Equality Act (2017) provides an example for Chancellor
   Angela Merkel's strategy of `leading from behind' in the form of evolved
   facilitation as she changed her stance from publicly resisting to
   enabling this policy. Merkel's objections against marriage equality were
   shared by large parts of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social
   Union (CDU/CSU): A draft version of the bill was postponed for two years
   in the justice committee due to internal conflicts in the CDU/CSU.
   Scholars argue that Merkel's shift from blocking to enabling the reform
   has been influenced by international as well as domestic developments.
   The focus of this paper is on a domestic factor that has been neglected
   so far, namely interactions between the far right and the conservative
   camp. Based on data from a case study on `anti-gender' mobilisations
   against marriage equality in Germany and their influence on the
   parliamentary process, this article analyses shifts in the conservative
   camp.},

Abstract = {Research on party competition and political representation relies on
   valid cross-national measures of party positions. This research note
   reports on the 1999-2019 Chapel Hill expert survey (CHES), which
   contains measures of national party positioning on European integration,
   ideology, and several European Union (EU) and non-EU policies for six
   waves of the survey, from 1999 to 2019. The trend file provides party
   position measures for all 28 EU countries and 1196 party-year
   observations. In this article, we analyze the evolving party positions
   on European integration from 1999 to 2019, with a particular focus on
   how EU positions are related to economic leftright and the
   Green/Alternative/Libertarian-Traditional/Authoritarian/Nationalist
   dimension (GAL-TAN). The dataset is publicly available on the CHES
   website.},

Abstract = {Immigration is one of those issues about which everyone has an opinion,
   but those opinions are rarely informed by facts. Rather, they are
   sustained by feelings of alienation, powerlessness and fear. That
   governments draft legislation based on these depictions is highly
   problematic. It demonstrates at best a capitulation of leadership and at
   worst an explicit acceptance of a racist right-wing populist agenda.
   When combined with systemic misogyny, a framework of oppression emerges
   that makes the lives of migrant and refugee women even more precarious
   than it is for men. These, like many other aspects of the `hostile
   environment', force people into destitution; they fear reprisals by the
   system if they speak out and in many cases feel ashamed. All this
   sounds, and is, rather bleak, but it is not the complete story. Despite
   the hostility-or because of it-there is a thriving grassroots community
   of solidarity that is organising resistance against misogyny and the
   hostile immigration policy. The way forward starts with the reframing of
   the `good/bad refugee/migrant' discourse from which a new narrative
   emerges: that of a fair immigration system based on principles of
   dignity, justice and welcome.},

Abstract = {How does an increased presence of immigrants in the workplace affect
   anti-immigration voting behavior? While cooperative interactions between
   natives and immigrants can reduce intergroup prejudice, immigrant
   coworkers might be regarded as a threat to native-born workers' labor
   market position. We combine detailed Swedish workplace data with
   precinct-level election outcomes for a large anti-immigration party (the
   Sweden Democrats) to study how the share of non-Europeans in the
   workplace affects opposition to immigration. We show that the share of
   non-Europeans in the workplace has a negative effect on support for the
   Sweden Democrats and that this effect is solely driven by same-skill
   contact in small workplaces. We interpret these results as supporting
   the so-called contact hypothesis: that increased interactions with
   minorities can reduce opposition to immigration among native-born
   voters, which, in turn, leads to lower support for anti-immigration
   parties.},

Abstract = {Why do parties change candidate lists between elections? Although
   candidate list volatility is an important indicator of the
   responsiveness of electoral representation, it has received little
   attention in research. We offer a critical case study of party list
   volatility in Finland, using a candidate-centred open-list proportional
   (PR) electoral system with ideal conditions for `ultra-strategic' party
   behaviour. Our explorative two-stage research design begins with party
   elite interviews, to extract factors that can affect list volatility,
   which in the following step are tested in a regression analysis of 564
   party lists in parliamentary elections 1983-2019. Our results show that
   list formation is a complex phenomenon, where demand and supply factors
   interact in a contingent fashion. Following trends of voter dealignment,
   personalization and `electoral-professionalization' of parties,
   volatility has increased over time. Electoral defeats and declining
   party membership increase volatility, but a member-driven mass-party
   heritage that limits party elites' strategic capacity has a stabilizing
   effect.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the completion of a government reintegration
   program in Colombia for former non-state armed actors, such as rebel
   forces and militias, in the post-conflict period. As the members of
   these groups lay down their arms and return to a peaceful existence, the
   effectiveness of their transition to `normal' lives can be critical in
   preventing the re-emergence of conflict and violence. Former combatants
   face numerous challenges and hardships such as criminal violence,
   political violence, economic hardship that, if not properly addressed,
   may increase the likelihood that some of them become involved in
   criminal work, political violence, or other activities that undermine
   peace. We develop a theory of the impact of violence and insecurity
   challenges facing former, non-state armed actors (henceforth, ANSAs). We
   suggest that the numerous challenges involved in leading a normal life
   under conditions of abnormal security will likely make successful
   completion of government reintegration programs more difficult for
   ANSAs. We also consider and account for the powerful effects of gender
   and family in the successful completion of a reintegration program. We
   test our theoretical model on the successful completion of a government
   reintegration program in Colombia, and test our hypotheses on a large
   database of ANSAs. We find support for our hypotheses, as well as social
   factors that greatly influenced the likelihood of successful completion
   of the Colombian government's reintegration program.},

Abstract = {The rapid escalation of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) elicited
   varying degrees of responses from governments. The escalation and
   community spread of the COVID-19 pandemic despite initial responses
   resulted in a lockdown strategy in some countries. Nigeria embraced a
   lockdown policy, albeit with some socioeconomic stimulus measures to
   cushion the resultant economic hardship. The inadequacy of the stimulus
   measures led to lockdown violations and human rights abuses. This study
   establishes the nexus between Nigeria's lockdown policy response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, human rights violations, and the role of Nigerian
   civil society in mainstreaming civil rights protection during this
   public health emergency.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1308-1324},

Abstract = {To be responsive, politicians have to rely on beliefs about public will.
   Previous research suggests that perceptions of public opinion are often
   distorted. However, it remains unclear (1) why reelection seeking
   officials misperceive public preferences and (2) how to mitigate these
   distorted beliefs. I argue that misperceptions result from unequal
   exposure to different subconstituencies and a tendency of legislators to
   project their own preferences on voters. I find support for these
   arguments in a six-wave panel of Swedish MPs combined with mass surveys.
   Elite beliefs disproportionately reflect the preferences of privileged
   voters and the personal positions of legislators. Additionally, an
   experiment with Swiss representatives leveraging real political events
   reveals how misperceptions can be reduced by encouraging a more balanced
   exposure to voters. The study concludes that economic and political
   inequalities are rooted in elite beliefs about the electorate and
   reveals ways to bolster the links between voters and their
   representatives.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to detect the reasons for party
   leaders' persistence or departure from the office, starting from the
   moment they are selected or re-selected. More specifically, we try to
   assess which (if any) characteristics of the leadership race (LR) called
   to appoint (or re-appoint) the party leader, in combination with other
   conditions, could favour leadership re-selection in office at the end of
   the term, rather than a more or less forced early departure. To this
   end, we have investigated all the LRs promoted by both bigger and
   smaller parties in four Western European countries over the last three
   decades. Bridging the literature on leadership selection and leadership
   survival, we built a theoretical framework that allowed us to turn to an
   original methodological approach in the field qualitative comparative
   analysis to unravel asymmetrical, equi-final, and conjunctural causation
   by looking at the combinations of conditions leading to the outcome,
   namely re-selection or departure from the office. Specifically, we
   identified five main conditions which are likely to affect the outcome,
   both alone and in combination with each other. whether there is an
   outgoing leader running for re-election (incumbency); a broad
   inclusiveness of the LR called to appoint the party leader; large
   victory (namely low competitiveness for contested LR or high approval
   rates for coronation of a single candidate); participation in government
   during the leadership tenure; and party electoral support (big'
   mainstream vs. `small' niche/challenger parties).},

Abstract = {The Co-operative Party, which represents the interests and ideas of the
   co-operative movement in British politics, has been the sister party of
   UK Labour since 1927. Largely ignored by scholarship, it has been on
   occasion the third-largest party grouping in the House of Commons and
   represents a social movement with formal members numbering in the
   millions. The unusual Labour/Co-operative relationship was tested during
   the New Labour period, with the Co-operative Party gradually
   establishing itself as a trusted sidekick and a source of policy ideas,
   despite some initial tensions. This article examines two historical
   instances where the party proved decisive in influencing public policy;
   the ``Thomas Bill{''} in 2001-2002, and the creation of Co-operative
   Schools during the 2007-2010 Brown premiership. In each case, the
   activities of Co-operative Party-linked `policy entrepreneurs' were key
   in the manufacture and exploitation of `windows of opportunity' for
   policy change. The paper makes two core conclusions, one empirical: that
   the Co-operative Party was able to influence New Labour's public policy
   direction in keeping with its founding objectives. The second is
   theoretical: that recent trends in Multiple Streams Analysis are
   reinforced, and that in smaller policy `subsystems', skilled policy
   entrepreneurs can play a greater role in the creation of windows of
   opportunity for policy change than the original theory implies.},

Abstract = {Rawls's contractualist approach to justice is well known for its
   adoption of ideal theory. This approach starts by setting out the
   political goal or ideal and leaves it to non-ideal or partial compliance
   theory to map out how to get there. However, Rawls's use of ideal theory
   has been criticized by Sen from the right and by Mouffe from the left.
   We critically address these concerns in the context of developing a
   Rawlsian approach to climate justice. While the importance of non-ideal
   theory for climate justice is increasingly being understood, its
   strategic and institutional importance for a Rawlsian approach needs
   further elaboration. We focus on the role of the Kantian conception of
   the reasonable and rational powers of persons in Rawls's work and show
   how this helps us to develop a partial compliance theory that focuses on
   the importance of institutions and strategic political action for
   achieving climate justice.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic brings back to the fore traditions of
   interconnected health governance in Africa, both at regional and
   inter-regional levels. Using the early pandemic responses of ECOWAS and
   the African Union as empirical case studies, we reconstruct (1) how
   already established regional actors in managing pandemics, such as the
   West African Health Organization (WAHO), are (2) now interacting with a
   newly established continental institution, the Africa Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), established in response to
   the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (2014-2016). This is bolstered by
   policy responses coordinated by the African Union Chairperson and (3)
   forms of inter-regional pandemic governance that are being developed
   between ECOWAS and the African Union. Against this backdrop, we briefly
   develop a more conceptual argument on the relevance and nature of
   inter-regional cooperation between the African Union and ECOWAS. First,
   when compared to other world regions, interlocking forms of regionalism
   have allowed many African governments to respond to Covid-19 early on.
   In view of poorly equipped national health systems, and an array of
   other demanding challenges, early responses have at least bought
   affected states time to prepare national health systems, start mutual
   learning and organize international assistance - despite all
   shortcomings that still exist. Second, regional crisis response has been
   an opportunity to (re)negotiate the division of labor between the
   African Union and ECOWAS, which has been already ongoing in the area of
   governance, peace and security.},

Abstract = {What makes violence political? Existing research argues that
   experiencing violence generates anger and grievances, which cause
   political mobilization, retribution, and spirals of escalating violence.
   I argue that the effect of violence on the political behavior of
   survivors is highly variable: situation-specific information shapes how
   survivors of violence experience anger, and whether they attribute blame
   to individual perpetrators or form more durable, expansive political
   grievances toward targets like police or prosecutors. I use qualitative
   and computational methods to analyze transcripts of original interviews
   with relatives of Black and Latinx homicide victims in Chicago, IL.
   Results show substantial diversity in emotional experience and blame
   attribution. I argue that this diversity is caused by variation in
   clarity about identity and motive of the perpetrator, and variation in
   perception of perpetrator responsibility. Having or lacking crucial
   information determines whether survivors become angry at perpetrators or
   form broader political grievances after traumatic experiences. Evidence
   from Chicago challenges the notion that violent trauma and anger have
   automatic or straightforward consequences for political behavior.},

Abstract = {This article shows that over the last three decades, competitive
   elections were associated with increased deforestation. Protection of
   forested areas provides long-term public goods, while their destruction
   provides short-term private goods for particular voters. Politicians
   facing a competitive election offer voters access to forested areas
   mainly for small-scale farming or commercial use of timber in exchange
   for electoral support. I test this theory of political deforestation
   using satellite generated global forest cover data and the results of
   over 1,000 national-level elections between 1982 and 2016. I find that
   countries that undergo a democratic transition lose an additional 0.8
   percentage points of their forest cover each year, that years with close
   elections have over 1 percentage point per year higher forest cover loss
   compared to nonelection years, and that as the margin of victory in an
   election decreases by 10 points, the amount of deforestation increases
   by 0.7 percentage points per year. These increases are on the order of
   5-10 times the average rate of forest loss globally. This suggests
   democratization is associated with underprovision of environmental
   public goods and contested elections are partially responsible for this
   underprovision.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Whilst maintaining its status as an economic engine in Europe, Germany
   has historically been a laggard in adopting gender equality measures.
   The European Gender Equality Index, however, now ranks Germany
   relatively high and shows substantial progress since 2005. While this
   has gone mostly unnoticed, Germany has passed far-reaching legislation
   in major policy fields relevant for gender equality. This expansive
   policy adoption occurred during the chancellorship of Angela Merkel, but
   we still know little about the actors and processes that explain it. The
   divergent perceptions of Germany in relation to gender invite deeper
   scholarly investigation. In general, we lack knowledge about how
   conservative women and their parties lead on gender policy. More
   specifically, we need to know more about how policy measures introduced
   by conservative governments affect gender norms and gender culture, and
   if they ultimately lead to effective implementation and greater
   equality. Investigating the effects of Merkel's tenure on gender
   equality, we assess policy output and outcomes with a focus on internal
   power dynamics in Germany, as well as international and EU-level
   pressures in the policy domains of political representation, LGBTI
   rights, migration, the labour market, and care.},

Abstract = {US states grant their local units different levels of autonomy in
   several dimensions including fiscal, functional, structural, and legal
   discretion. This study uses a comprehensive, multidimensional measure of
   autonomy to test its association with the fiscal behavior of over 19,000
   municipalities in the United States. Competing theoretical predictions
   range from significant increases in government size (Leviathan model),
   to no effect (median-voter model), and even smaller governments
   (institutional collective action model). Quantile regression analysis is
   implemented to test the association between autonomy and fiscal behavior
   for different city sizes. The empirical findings indicate that cities
   with more autonomy tend to spend less and have lower taxes and debt. The
   strength of this relationship, however, varies by city size.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is reason to believe that exposure to public broadcasting can
   positively affect voter turnout, but these effects are hard to
   empirically disaggregate. This paper examines the geographically
   delimited roll out of BBC radio in England, which coincided with
   successive off-cycle general elections in the 1920s. Combining spatially
   interpolated census data with constituency-level electoral returns, a
   matched difference-in-differences design finds that turnout increases
   with radio exposure. This finding is supported by qualitative
   examination of the roll out alongside a range of robustness checks. The
   study makes a contribution to the literature on media and voting
   behaviour, while enhancing our understanding of how the BBC shapes
   electoral behaviour in Britain.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role gender plays in the harassment, abuse and
   intimidation (HAI) of parliamentary candidates in the UK at election
   time. Using data from the Representative Audit of Britain surveys
   (2015-2019) this article takes an intersectional approach to investigate
   whether trends identified in 2017 suggesting that women candidates
   reported more incidences of HAI and were more likely to be concerned for
   their personal safety as a result than men, remain apparent in the
   subsequent election. Results suggest that HAI is getting worse for
   candidates in general, and the gender gap is widening. About three in
   every four women experienced some levels of fear while campaigning.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bounded solidarity has recently been criticized on the grounds that it
   valorizes homogeneity, arbitrarily prioritizes compatriots over
   outsiders, and is ultimately unnecessary to democracy. In response,
   defenders argue that solidarity is valuable because it supports the
   welfare state or a republican ideal of nondomination. This article
   argues that such defenses fail to demonstrate that bounded solidarity is
   not superfluous in the way that critics have claimed, leaving the ideal
   vulnerable to dismissal. Drawing on deliberative democratic theory, it
   shows that bounded solidarity among citizens is necessary in order to
   establish the epistemic preconditions of democratic self-determination.
   Understood in epistemic terms, bounded solidarity-a disposition among
   citizens to gather, and assign weight to, the perspectives of other
   citizens-deserves support because it is inextricable from the valuable
   goal of democratic self-rule.},

Abstract = {The Rohingya are one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.
   Military campaigns conducted by Myanmar against the Rohingya have led to
   numerous deaths, widespread cases of sexual violence, the destruction of
   hundreds of villages, and the deportation of more than 700,000 people to
   Bangladesh. These events have triggered proceedings at the International
   Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has arguably failed to address the
   religious dimensions of crimes and facts in some of its previous
   jurisprudence appropriately. The entanglement of law and religion at the
   ICC may lead to an impoverished ratio decidendi and disregard for the
   victims' claims. We hence argue that, by disentangling law and religion
   in the proceedings related to the Rohingya, the ICC may be able to
   enhance the consideration of both elements. This approach should result
   in (1) appropriate fact-finding related to the Rohingya's identity on
   ethnic and religious grounds as well as religious dimensions of mass
   atrocities; (2) attribution of criminal responsibility for serious
   violations of human rights, including rights related to the Rohingya's
   religious identity, which constitute international crimes; and (3)
   reparations for victims to redress harm inflicted on them.},

Abstract = {In the multi-nation society of China, disputes related to the beliefs
   and customs of indigenous communities in the process of the state's
   natural resources management have been increasing because of sports
   activities, tourism, extractive industries, hydropower and other
   infrastructure constructions. From a legal pluralism perspective, with a
   focus on the Tibetan mountain cult in the Kawagebo (Mt. Meili) mountain
   area, this research argues the existence of two types of governances
   based on different worldview, beliefs, normative frameworks and
   management practices: the community spiritual governance (CSG) and the
   state resources governance (SRG). By analysing the institutional
   constraints to, and the potentials of recognising the spiritual
   significance of, sacred mountains and rights of indigenous communities,
   this research justifies a pathway of turning SRG towards a `rights-based
   governance' for coordinating these conflicts.},

Abstract = {A wealth of research documents the rise of affective polarization, or
   the increasing disdain for the out-party in American politics. In this
   paper, we analyze ANES data from 1988 to 2016 to investigate the
   contribution of core value polarization to the phenomenon of out-party
   enmity. We find that greater differences in fundamental principles
   relate significantly to emotionally intense evaluations of the opposing
   party and its candidates, as well as the ideological out-group,
   independent of issue attitude extremity and the strength of one's
   partisan and ideological identities. Moreover, ANES panel data from 1992
   to 1996 reveal that past value extremity promotes future affective
   polarization. These results are important for our understanding of the
   nature and extent of value-based polarization in American politics.},

Title = {Pay to Play? How Reducing APSA Division Fees Increases Graduate Student
   Participation},
Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {645-650},

Abstract = {In 2017, the American Political Science Association (APSA) Committee on
   the Status of Graduate Students in the Profession launched an initiative
   to lower the cost of Division (i.e., organized section) membership for
   students to promote graduate students' professional development and to
   advance Division interests. This article assesses the effect of this
   intervention on Division membership. Using APSA membership data, we find
   that almost two thirds of Divisions that charged fees in 2017 reduced or
   eliminated student fees between 2017 and 2019, nearly halving the
   average student dues (i.e., from \$11.57 in 2017 to \$5.84 in 2019). As
   a result, average student membership increased by more than 300\% in
   Divisions that reduced fees (i.e., from 79.5 in 2017 to 248.7 in 2019),
   compared to a marginal 30\% increase in those that did not reduce fees.
   These outcomes of the initiative support additional efforts to reduce
   the costs of APSA participation for graduate students.},

Abstract = {Are individuals in violent contexts reluctant to tackle corruption for
   fear of future violence? Or does violence mobilize them to fight
   corruption? We investigate these questions looking at the effects of
   fear and violence stemming from the Mexican Drug War on attitudes toward
   corruption. We conducted two surveys before the 2012 Mexican
   presidential election. First, as part of a nationally representative
   survey, we find a positive correlation between fear of violence and
   willingness to accept corruption in exchange for lower levels of
   violence. To disentangle causal effects, we conducted a follow-up survey
   experiment in Greater Mexico City where we manipulated fear over the
   Drug War. We find that individuals within this context are not easily
   scared. Those who received a common fear-inducing manipulation do not
   report higher levels of fear and are less willing to tolerate
   corruption. Conversely, we find strong evidence that individuals who
   have been victims of crime are more likely to report both higher levels
   of fear and willingness to accept corruption if it lowers violence. Our
   findings suggest that voters are more strategic and resilient in the
   face of violence than many extant theories of political behavior
   suggest.},

Abstract = {Do policy makers in both parties represent the opinions of the richest
   Americans, ignoring those of median income? We find that the two
   political parties primarily represent different interest group sectors,
   rather than public economic classes. The Republican Party and business
   interests are aligned across all issue areas and are more often aligned
   with the opinions of the richest Americans (especially on economic
   policy). Democrats more often represent middle class opinions and are
   uniformly aligned with advocacy groups. Support from both parties is
   associated with policy adoption, but party influence cannot explain the
   association between affluent opinions and policy outcomes. Rather than
   an oligarchic political system, these patterns show competition among
   organized elites that still provides multiple potential paths for
   unequal public class influence.},

Abstract = {How responsive is the US' Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) to the labor
   dislocation that results from trade integration? Recent findings suggest
   that the world's most ambitious trade adjustment program barely responds
   to import shocks, and that the shortfall is made up by disability
   insurance and early retirement. This holds considerable implications:
   TAA offers a lens onto the central question of whether developed
   democracies can effectively redistribute the gains from international
   economic integration. We take a closer look at these results. Using
   petition-level data over a 20-year period, we find that TAA is between
   1.7 and 3.3 times more responsive than current estimates suggest. Yet
   the news is not all good. As we show, the responsiveness of TAA has
   decreased considerably since the 1990s, just as developed democracies
   started facing increasing pushback against liberalization. This
   shortfall, in turn, has political consequences: areas where TAA has been
   least responsive were also more likely to shift toward voting for Trump
   in the 2016 Presidential election. Our findings speak to the
   considerable challenge governments face in aiding workers ``left
   behind{''} by liberalization.},

Abstract = {Supporters of the Republican Party have become much more skeptical of
   the science of climate change since the 1990s. This article argues that
   out-group cues from Democratic elites caused a backlash that resulted in
   greater climate skepticism. The authors construct aggregate measures of
   climate skepticism from nearly 200 public opinion polls at the quarterly
   level from 2001 to 2014 and at the annual level from 1986 to 2014. They
   also build time-series measures of possible contributors to climate
   skepticism using an automated media content analysis. The analyses
   provide evidence that cues from party elites - especially from Democrats
   - are associated with aggregate dynamics in climate change skepticism,
   including among supporters of the Republican Party. The study also
   involves a party cue survey experiment administered to a sample of 3,000
   Americans through Amazon Mechanical Turk to provide more evidence of
   causality. Together, these results highlight the importance of out-group
   cue taking and suggest that climate change skepticism should be examined
   through the lens of elite-led opinion formation.},

Abstract = {Leaders in many African countries have attempted to subvert
   constitutional limits on the number of terms they can serve in office.
   By comparing attitudes among citizens who have experienced term limits
   challenges and those who have not (yet), we show that these attempts
   have driven a backlash: on average, citizens who experience a
   contravention attempt become significantly more likely to say they
   support term limits, especially if the challenge is successful and term
   limits are lifted. We argue that term limit challenges make salient the
   possibility of a ``president for life{''} and find that the backlash is
   greatest among those who are likely to be most alarmed by the prospect:
   those who oppose the current regime, those who are not thriving
   economically and those who most strongly support democracy over
   one-party rule.},

Title = {Issue ownership and salience shocks: The electoral impact of Australian
   bushfires},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As climate change increases the frequency of natural disasters,
   understanding how such disasters affect voting behavior has become
   crucial. While the literature has demonstrated that voters punish the
   party of the incumbent when they experience severe destruction, it
   remains unclear how other political parties are affected. In particular,
   we argue that voters shift their support to Green parties following
   natural disasters, given that these parties have ownership of
   environmental issues. We further argue that disasters decrease
   mainstream leftist parties' vote share because liberal-minded voters are
   more likely to be the ones switching to Green parties. Empirical tests
   on bushfires and voting in Australia provide some support for our
   predictions, as all the expected effects of fires on voting manifest in
   state-level tests but not constituency-level tests. This suggests that
   our theory may operate only at certain levels of governance, paving the
   way for future research into why this might be.},

Abstract = {Few issues are more salient for voters or more important in political
   decision making than economic conditions, and no American public
   official is more closely associated with the economy than the president.
   Existing scholarship disagrees, however, about how partisan loyalties
   affect economic evaluations. We study how partisan control of the
   presidency affects economic perceptions using eight waves of panel data
   collected around the 2016 presidential election from a national
   probability sample. We find that although individual-level perceptions
   are largely stable across time, the change in partisan control of the
   White House was associated with more positive evaluations among
   Republicans and more negative evaluations among Democrats. These effects
   are statistically significant yet substantively modest in magnitude. Our
   results indicate that partisanship is less strongly associated with
   economic assessments than some previous scholarship has claimed and
   suggest more sanguine conclusions about the prospects for presidential
   accountability even in a partisan era.},

Abstract = {How successful have countries in Asia been at vaccinating their
   populations against COVID-19? What explains the broadly similar pace of
   rollout across countries in the region despite diverse governance
   capacities, demographic compositions, resources and economies? This
   paper presents a comparative analysis of the planning and implementation
   of national vaccination drives against COVID-19 across 21 South and East
   Asian countries. We advance an analytical framework to understand the
   different challenges countries encounter and distinguish three key
   factors on both the national and international level-vaccine shortages,
   governance capacity for mass vaccination and vaccine hesitancy. We apply
   the analytical framework to national vaccination drives, offering a
   snapshot of countries' vaccination progress as of early 2021, and
   conclude with general trends for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the
   region.},

Abstract = {Most research has examined the influence of the Tea Party as a social
   movement or loose organization, but less is known about its influence
   within legislative party politics, especially at the state level. In
   this paper, we argue that in this context the Tea Party is primarily an
   intraparty faction that has caused significant divisions inside the
   Republican Party. Using an original dataset of legislators across 13
   states for the years 2010 to 2013, we examine legislator and
   district-level characteristics that predict state legislators'
   affiliation with the Tea Party. Our results reveal that in some respects
   legislators affiliated with the Tea Party are a far-right wing of the
   Republican Party. However, by other measures that capture
   anti-establishment political sentiment, Tea Party affiliated legislators
   comprise a factional group attempting to transform the Party in ways
   that go beyond ideology. These findings have important implications for
   the future prospects of the GOP.},

Abstract = {Our aim in this article is to show the stance on solidarity present in a
   hybrid regime. Taking Hungary as an example, we give individual-level
   explanations for attitudes towards solidarity and inclusion/exclusion in
   times when populist parties are in power. By creating typical solidarity
   groups, we explain who belongs to different solidarity clusters and why,
   what political orientations can be linked to solidarity groups and
   whether people's attitudes reflect the values/solidarity conceptions
   propagated by the Orban government. With this, we point to the social
   and political polarization of Hungarian society. We found that the
   appreciated, satisfied and politically trustful far-right exclusive
   groups - independent of their social status - make up not only the
   majority of society but also the crucial system-justifying basis of the
   Orban regime. However, in an ethnically rather homogeneous society
   foreigners could be seen as cultural and economic threats to the
   decisive majority, including a significant part of the inclusive groups.},

Abstract = {The world order is undergoing tumultuous changes amid the Sino-US trade
   war and a global pandemic. During these epochal times for political
   science, The American school of social sciences needs an intellectual
   revolution and a repositioning of the research agenda for political
   science. Comparative political studies must shift their focus from their
   traditional role of comparison of political institutions to that of
   state governance models, as the former can no longer advance new
   knowledge in political science while the latter represents a greater
   challenge for such studies. Likewise, studies of international relations
   in the traditional sense should take a step further and explore studies
   of world politics, i.e., studies of international relations and world
   order as shaped by institutional changes triggered by political trends
   within certain countries. The research approach of historical political
   science is indispensable, whether it is comparison of state governance
   models or of world politics.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new interpretation of Etienne de La Boetie's
   Discours de la servitude volontaire. Starting from the image of
   voluntary servitude as a collective enchantment that appears at the
   beginning of the treatise, the paper explores the transformation that
   the notion of enchanter undergoes in the early 16th century. The
   different contexts that this image allows us to identify, indicate that
   the Discours is inscribed, in an original way, in the long medical
   tradition on the power of enchantments. By recognising in the ``One{''}
   the qualities of the enchanter, La Boetie gives the enchantment a
   political value and identifies in the relationship enchanter/enchanted
   the key to an unprecedented pact of subordination. In this variation of
   scale, the enchantment as a political phenomenon occurs when the leader
   proves capable of performing credible prodigies. This reconstruction
   accords a central role to the figure of the thaumaturge leader, whose
   characteristics are defined by Machiavelli and Pomponazzi. In a reading
   history perspective, the article explores the relationship La Boetie
   establishes with Machiavelli and Pomponazzi. The article concludes with
   a comparison between the thaumaturgical paradigm and the charismatic
   paradigm, Marc Bloch and Max Weber.},

Abstract = {This article examines how recent world history is interpreted in
   Russia's latest state-approved textbooks, particularly what kind of
   ideological and civilizational leanings the interpretations reflect.
   Discourse analysis reveals that the textbooks broadly accept the
   superiority of the capitalist developmental model and liberal-democratic
   political system, all within a Western-centric, if not pro-Western,
   paradigm based on modernization theory; only in the context of recent
   geopolitical conflicts is the West portrayed in an adversarial light.
   These findings suggest that liberal and Western-centric thinking
   continues to influence sections of Russia's political and intellectual
   elites as well as the country's post-Soviet generation.},

Abstract = {Brexit has brought tensions in European and (especially) British
   politics. This article illustrates the rationale, scope and research
   questions of the special issue, which investigates the first Brexit
   effects in the five years following the 2016 referendum. Taking the
   distribution of political power as our primary focus and analysing
   mainly - though not exclusively - British politics, we trace the first
   developments in the three domains of politics, polity and policy since
   the UK's decision to leave the EU. In the politics domain, after the
   political uncertainties surrounding the referendum period, we detect a
   return to the power-hoarding dynamics typical of the Westminster model.
   However, the territorial and constitutional architectures of the British
   polity are under considerable strain, with Brexit strengthening the
   nationalistic movements in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the policy
   domain, despite strong common interests, Brexit has failed to produce
   cooperative EU-UK arrangements in finance and foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Research on differentiated integration (DI) has by and large ignored the
   views of political party actors on DI. Drawing on 35 semi-structured
   interviews with party actors from seven member states and situated
   across the political spectrum, we show them to regard DI as divisive and
   deeply political. We also identify two little explored dimensions
   affecting their views: namely the wealth of their member state (MS) and
   its prior experience of DI. Interviewees from richer MS generally favour
   DI more than those from poorer MS, and those from MS that have not
   experienced sovereignty or capacity DI welcome DI more than those from
   MS that have. While the former tend to see DI as allowing both opt outs
   for MS unwilling or unable to integrate further and enhanced cooperation
   for MS able and desirous of doing so, the latter fear their MS being
   excluded and relegated to a second-class status.},

Abstract = {How do rebels choose among available tactics during civil war? How do
   they substitute one tactic for another? Although previous studies
   address these questions, they narrowly focus on the presence or absence
   of substitution. Differentiating the varieties of substitution, however,
   is critical. How rebels respond to their tactical environment-including
   weather conditions-depends on the type of substitution. I formally
   derive three types of substitution and test them by exploiting
   weather-induced exogenous variation in rebels' tactical costs for ground
   and marine violent activities. The analysis of daily panel data in 31
   coastal conflict countries indicates that rebels substitute violent
   ground activities for maritime piracy but not vice versa. This asymmetry
   cannot be explained without differentiating substitution types.},

Abstract = {While political budgetary cycles in democracies have been rigorously
   studied for the past several decades, surprisingly little is known about
   electorally motivated policy manipulation in authoritarian regimes. This
   study analyzes how dictators strategically change the priorities of
   autocratic policies to cultivate electoral dominance even when election
   results are predetermined. I argue that dictators spend more money on
   redistributive policies in election periods. Using budgetary spending
   data from 63 autocratic countries between 1972 and 2015, this paper
   presents cross-national evidence of the existence of an electoral cycle
   in autocratic redistribution. Analyzing Afrobarometer survey data from
   18 African autocracies between 2008 and 2015, this study also finds that
   citizens' evaluations of redistributive policy fluctuate according to
   the electoral calendar. These findings contribute to the literature on
   authoritarian politics by exploring macro- and micro-level mechanisms
   through which authoritarian rulers improvise policy manipulation to
   cultivate electoral dominance.},

Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that extreme candidates perform worse, in part
   because their party's share of turnout declines. But does candidate
   ideology affect the decision of whether to abstain in a House race among
   voters who already turned out in the presidential election? I examine
   the relationship between candidates' ideology and voter abstention in
   the House contest, reporting two main results. First, fewer voters
   abstain in elections featuring more ideologically polarized House
   candidates. A consideration of party effects reveals more nuance,
   however: In most cases, roll-off is lower when extreme candidates run,
   but the effect of an extreme Republican is substantially larger than
   that of an extreme Democrat. Further analysis suggests that decreased
   roll-off is probably due to extreme candidates mobilizing out-partisans.
   My results suggest that allowing for the possibility of voter abstention
   is an important theoretical addition to understanding the behavioral
   effects of extremist candidates.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the ideological underpinnings of Steven Lubet's
   Interrogating Ethnography. I argue that Lubet's text draws from an
   ideological tradition best exemplified by An American Dilemma, Gunnar
   Myrdal's influential 1944 study of U.S. race relations. This tradition
   posits the notion of an enduring and egalitarian American Creed, which
   ensures that the United States' liberal-democratic institutions are
   fundamentally decent and fair in principle. I show how an
   unsubstantiated belief in the American Creed informs Lubet's claims
   about contemporary ethnographic research and, in doing so, limits the
   usefulness of his text. Ultimately, I conclude, Interrogating
   Ethnography epitomizes the ways in which troublesome ideological
   frameworks continue to shape debates about social science methodology.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Number = {3},
Pages = {1034-1047},

Abstract = {This paper offers a new reading of the political thought of the
   mid-Victorian jurist and intellectual James Fitzjames Stephen. Contrary
   to impressions of Stephen as a conservative or religious authoritarian,
   this article recognizes the liberal character of Stephen's thought, and
   it argues that investigating Stephen's liberalism holds lessons for us
   today about the structure of liberal theory. Stephen, the paper
   demonstrates, articulated robustly both technocratic and pluralistic
   visions of politics. Perhaps more stridently than any Victorian, he put
   forward an argument for the necessity and legitimacy of expert rule
   against claims for popular government. Yet he also insisted on the
   plurality of perspectives on public affairs and on the ineluctable
   conflict between them. Because both of these facets existed in his work,
   he fit within the liberal ranks, but he did not show how the two
   dimensions fit together. The tension that we discover from reading
   Stephen is, the article concludes, not peculiar to him, but a permanent
   feature of liberal theories, which always include both technocratic and
   pluralistic elements.},

Abstract = {When authoritarian incumbent presidents run in elections, they have
   significant incumbency advantage and almost always win. When incumbents
   comply with term limits or do not run for other reasons, they tend to
   designate successors in their stead. However, their chosen successors
   often lose. Do they lose because they cannot command the same electoral
   advantage in loyalty, resources and name recognition that incumbents
   can, or because succession and elections that follow occur in a more
   liberal environment? The identification of effects of presidential
   succession is challenging because individual decisions to leave office,
   or not, depend on existing power relations. Drawing from studies on
   authoritarian elections and democratization by elections, I propose an
   explanation why many incumbents are unable to transfer their incumbency
   advantage to handpicked successors. I rely on the battery of statistical
   tests including matching and instrumental variables to isolate the
   effects of succession on competitive authoritarian elections in
   1990-2016. Controlling for liberalization that may occur during
   succession, successors are still more likely to lose; however, running
   in a hegemonic party regime or having prior political experience and
   status may mitigate their electoral disadvantage. When successors lose,
   I find that the executive turnover that follows often leads to further
   liberalization.},

Title = {Stability through constraints: the impact of fiscal rules on autocratic
   survival},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {1564-1582},

Abstract = {A growing literature has investigated the role that formal and informal
   economic institutions play for autocratic survival. However, this
   literature has, so far, ignored a type of formal economic institution
   that has grown in importance among both democracies and non-democracies
   in recent decades, namely, national fiscal rules. In this article, we
   argue that fiscal rules can affect autocratic survival but that the
   effect is time-dependent. The introduction of a stricter fiscal rules
   framework causes short-term fiscal retrenchment and might increase the
   uncertainty among regime supporters about the provision of future
   patronage and spoils. However, stricter fiscal rules also improve
   long-term fiscal management and, thus, increase investor confidence and
   economic performance in the long run. Consequently, fiscal rules
   stabilize autocratic regimes in the long run but not in the short run.
   Fixed-effect estimations on a panel of autocracies from 1987 to 2016
   provide substantial evidence in favour of this argument.},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) economic governance is pivotal for gender
   equality in the EU, yet gender equality concerns have been sidelined in
   governance processes. This article analyzes the struggles involved in
   integrating a gender perspective into the EU's economic governance in
   the European Parliament (EP). It explores how the EP, often perceived as
   a champion of gender equality, constructs gender in relation to economic
   governance and how conflicts between the EP's political groups and
   committees influence the EP's ability to challenge gendered inequalities
   related to the governance regime. This article reveals that the EP's
   positions have been characterized by strategic silence about gender and
   understandings of gender equality as a productive factor that
   legitimized gendered policies. Party-political conflicts and compromises
   that have sidelined critical views, and a boundary between social and
   economic issues and actors, were key barriers for the integration of
   critical gender perspectives.},

Abstract = {Previous literature demonstrated that gender inequality is a major
   challenge for democratic consolidation. However, research that studies
   the effect of gender inequality on citizens' satisfaction with democracy
   is limited. This study contributes to this literature by exploring the
   relationship between citizens' perceptions of gender impartiality of
   public institutions and satisfaction with democracy in Turkey, where
   gender inequality is an acute problem. Analysis of a nationally
   representative survey showed that the perception of gender impartiality
   of public institutions is a major factor explaining citizens'
   satisfaction with democracy. Results also revealed that perceptions of
   gender impartiality of public institutions affect citizens' evaluations
   of the long-term performance of democracy. Another finding is that
   religiosity moderates the effect of perceptions of gender impartiality
   of public institutions on citizens' satisfaction with democracy. We
   conclude that gender inequality is not a peripheral issue to democratic
   consolidation in Turkey but a social problem that remains at the heart
   of it.},

   raise. Third, it develops an alternative approach, a republicanism of
   plural polities: Based on a relational and multi-dimensional
   understanding of citizenship, the paper questions the strong
   internationalist reliance on the citizenship-state-nexus and on
   statehood in general, but also takes issue with cosmopolitans' neglect
   of the boundedness of democratic self-determination. A republicanism of
   plural polities as a multi-perspectival approach to democratic
   institution-building in and beyond the state is open to constellations
   of plural polities of different forms and on different political levels
   while simultaneously recognising the particularity of each `free
   polity'. It thereby adds a new dimension to debates on the political
   forms legitimate institutions can assume under post-Westphalian
   conditions and opens avenues for research on inter-polity relations, on
   more complex constellations of self-rule and shared rule as well as of
   multilateral decision-making, on sovereignty and independence. The
   latter are exemplified by reference to the European context.},

Abstract = {Irregular migrants are strongly affected by the migration policies of
   the state in which they reside, while also being excluded from
   influencing such policies. Their practical access to political freedom
   remains limited, as most human rights instruments recognise the state
   parties' sovereign right to deport irregular migrants from their
   territory, and thereby from the jurisdiction which grants them human
   rights. Several legal scholars have previously considered the tension
   between universalism and particularism, and how it limits irregular
   migrants' access to human rights and public services. The aim of this
   article is to situate that conflict in the sphere of political rights by
   examining the protection of political activities. Using Bonnie Honig's
   concept of pluralistic antagonism, I will explain how the tension
   between universalism and particularism in human rights may affect this
   issue, and how it can prove useful for irregular migrants.},

Abstract = {Did the 2018-2019 Conte I Cabinet's approach to human rights also mirror
   a deeper change in the established national conception of the role the
   country should play in the international human rights regime? Applying
   Role Theory to the analysis of Italian decision makers' positions on the
   country's foreign policy vis-a-vis human rights norms and institutions
   during this period, the article reveals the existence of a phase of
   `role contestation' among Italian leaders. A new isolationist,
   uncooperative and delegitimising conception of both multilateralism and
   its human rights priorities clashed with a commitment to preserve the
   traditional conception of the country as a responsible multilateralist
   and principled actor, producing contradictory foreign policy behaviour
   and affecting the country's international reputation and credibility.},

Abstract = {Given the increasing prevalence of podcast listening, especially among
   young adults with college education, it is important to consider how
   student-produced podcasts can impact the student experience in the
   classroom, contribute to a more participatory course, and help achieve
   learning objectives. To engage these issues, this article reflects on
   the podcast assignment completed by five courses of students, three
   introductory American Politics classes and two Political Ideologies
   classes. This article seeks to examine how podcasts can work as a tool
   for students to research, analyze, synthesize, and present political
   information in a specific pedagogical and rhetorical setting; in the
   course of doing so, students become actively engaged with the audio
   public political sphere. I focus on assignment design, learning
   objectives, and my own pedagogical reflections in order to reach some
   tentative ideas about the pedagogical potential of podcasts in the
   political science classroom.},

Abstract = {Based on the provisions of criminal procedure theory and criminology,
   the problems of international legal assistance are revealed during the
   pre-trial investigation for crimes of corruption in the field of
   official and professional activities. Special attention is paid to
   identifying the details of evidential activities in criminal proceedings
   for offences related to the provision of public services during a
   special pre-trial investigation (in absentia). The methodological basis
   of the article is a set of general and special scientific methods of
   legal cognition. In particular, the concept of pm-trial special
   investigation is formulated, its functional purpose is defined,
   characteristics of the carrying out of separate investigative actions
   (search) during the special pre-trial investigation for corruption
   offences. Attention is paid to issues of international cooperation to
   identify and search for assets in these criminal proceedings. Other
   problems are revealed in the use of international legal assistance to
   obtain evidence during the investigation of these crimes. It is
   concluded that a problem that arises during international cooperation
   during the preliminary investigation is the uncertainty in international
   rules on the provision of mutual legal assistance.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Based on an original dataset of all articles on the Middle East in major
   political science journals during the past two decades, we assess trends
   in publishing on the region to explore whether it remains
   underrepresented in political science and how the field has evolved. We
   focus on the evolution of the total share of Middle East and North
   Africa (MENA)-focused articles, research topics, methods employed, and
   patterns of authorship by gender. The proportion of MENA-focused
   articles has increased, particularly after the 2011 Arab Spring
   uprisings, but remains strikingly low. With respect to topics and
   methods, research on the Middle East is increasingly integrated in
   mainstream political science, with articles addressing core disciplinary
   debates and relying increasingly more on statistical and experimental
   methods. Yet, these shifts may come at the expense of predominantly
   qualitative research, and primary topics may reflect the priorities of
   Western researchers while underplaying the major concerns of Middle
   Eastern publics.},

Abstract = {Even when women and people of color achieve positions of political
   power, institutional norms may combine with social constructions of
   difference to create a system in which power is distributed
   disproportionately. Such a pattern is evident in the US courts of
   appeals. Each case is resolved by a panel of three judges who also
   decide whether the opinion should be binding precedent (i.e., published)
   or not. I theorized that the variety of views and extended deliberation
   often attributed to diversity in a small-group environment depressed the
   rate of publication if judges were willing to compromise on the outcome
   but less willing to publish an opinion after such compromise. Using a
   massive original dataset of virtually all dispositive circuit opinions
   from 2002 to 2012, I found that homogeneous panels (98\% of which are
   composed of white men) shaped policy more frequently than diverse
   panels.},

Abstract = {A core insight of the literature on dispute settlement at the World
   Trade Organization (WTO) is that third party countries help enforce the
   organization's multilateral objectives, including the fundamental
   principle of nondiscrimination. Little is known, however, about when
   countries comply with WTO rulings and whether these bystander states
   play a role. We introduce new data on compliance, measured as whether
   losing countries make tangible domestic reforms to bring policy in line
   with WTO rulings. We show that compliance is significantly less likely
   in disputes with more third parties. Using a variety of estimation
   techniques, including controlling for nonrandom selection into legal
   rulings, we demonstrate a robust correlation between third party
   participation and noncompliance. Our findings highlight a risk of
   stringent enforcement and suggest that compliance problems threaten to
   undercut the operation of the multilateral trade regime.},

Abstract = {This study is part of the Disarmament, Demobilization, Reinsertion and
   Reintegration strategy, applied by countries transiting from civil wars
   to peace processes after arranging amnesties or negotiating agreements.
   A systematic review and meta-synthesis of 56 qualitative empirical
   studies, published in indexed journals, English and Spanish, was
   conducted. Its purpose was to analyze about scientific advances around
   the world on economic reintegration in relation to the identity of
   ex-combatants and veterans of civil wars between 1993-2018. The studies
   were selected through an sistematic procedure, an analysis of the
   epistemic and methodological components, a critical summary of findings,
   and a synthesis on the redefinition of reintegration as a
   multi-transformation process were carried out.. 73\% of the studies
   researched reintegration from the strategic, economic and political,
   while 20\% in the subjective and 7\% related it to identity.The studies
   analyzed had limited methodological development.},

Abstract = {In all areas of the legal world there are higher aspirations, which
   represent legal values to be protected, like the justice, the common
   good and legal security stand out. The present work was proposed to
   analyze if the Ecuadorian Legislator, in its process of construction and
   promulgation of the criminal law regulating against the unfair
   competition, incorporated these three values into it. Regrettably, the
   results show an apparent absence of the three legal values in criminal
   law, leaving legal operators at a disadvantage in view of the need to
   control this type of crime and society, awaiting compliance. Through an
   exercise of legal hermeneutics, the study starts from a real problem in
   the Ecuadorian legal system of the criminal law against of the unfair
   competition, which demands to be discussed in the search for the State
   to take the necessary measures to solve this problem.},

Abstract = {Qualitative scholars exhibit a wide range of views on and approaches to
   causality. While some approaches reject causality from the outset, a
   large strand of qualitative research in political science and
   international relations does, however, pursue causal explanation.
   Qualitative scholars nevertheless disagree about what causality means.
   Our paper reviews what causality means within different strands of
   qualitative research and how qualitative scholars engage in causal
   explanations. We focus particular attention on the fertile middle ground
   between qualitative research that seeks to mimic the statistical model
   and research that rejects causality entirely. In broad strokes, we
   understand views of causality as lying on a spectrum and partly
   overlapping. Along the spectrum, we identify three main clusters:
   `positivist leaning,' `postpositivist leaning,' and `Interpretivist
   leaning.' Within each cluster, we identify the main traits and provide
   illustrative examples. We find merit in each of these three clusters of
   approaches and in the ongoing dialogue among qualitative scholars of
   different orientations. Understanding similarities and differences in
   the way various scholars address causality might encourage some to take
   steps along the spectrum and expand their repertoires to embrace
   elements of other approaches. By making these distinctions more
   explicit, we hope to be able to enhance our understanding of different
   views of causality and the extent to which they overlap and provide the
   potential for collaboration.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to clarify the concept of democracy within Gianni
   Vattimo's nihilistic hermeneutics. The main objective is to establish
   the guidelines that give meaning to the author's rhetoric around public
   issues, which is linked to a conceptual framework known by
   historiography as the ``left Heideggerian{''} position. This
   Heideggerianism is intended to be left-wing as an anarchist or communist
   agenda against the institutions of liberal democracy as part of a
   pessimistic diagnosis of the hegemonic regime of the West, which it
   considers ``metaphysical{''} and ``lack of emergency{''}, that is,
   supposedly impervious to changes and social demands. The Turinese,
   however, pretends to be a supporter of democracy in a different sense,
   in the formula ``from dialogue to conflict{''}. In this context, we will
   try to show the effective use of ``democracy{''} as a political and
   social concept in the works of Vattimo, as well as to observe its
   possible inconsistencies and to find discursive consistency in them. To
   do this, it will be shown that the Turinese is within a pluralist
   version of democracy by means of a comparative analysis with the radical
   version of democracy offered by Chantall Mouffe in 2004. With this
   procedure, an attempt is made to give indications to reinterpret the
   left Heideggerian position as an alternative form of liberal political
   regime in the pluralist key or the hermeneutic radical democracy. As a
   balance, this proposal to incorporate nihilist rhetoric into a
   democratic theory would have the advantage of giving conceptual space to
   social conflicts as part of the dynamics of recognition of diversity
   within democracy, moving from a metaphysical and closed position to one
   open to listening to difference and social change.},

Abstract = {Peace education in school contexts involves improving student's skills
   to coexist peacefully and to arrive at the peaceful resolution of
   conflict with their peers. Many educational institutions from different
   contexts have started making efforts in this direction. Unfortunately,
   these experiences or their results are insufficiently documented. This
   paper attempts to offer a state-of-the-art analysis, identifying the
   main characteristics of a set of interventions that took place between
   2005 and 2021. These interventions draw on two themes: peaceful
   coexistence and conflict resolution. It was found that most programs
   include strategies such as: students training on competencies and
   skills, the implementation of mediation programs, social support and
   demands prioritization and classification. Based on the analysis of
   documented experiences we put forward some recommendations that may
   strengthen future interventions on Education for Peace.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to analyze the regulation of the legal
   profession and its global trends. There are many different types of
   regulators globally, and many different sources and methods of
   regulation. There is no simple approach to setting goals for regulating
   the legal profession in different legal systems. Although
   self-regulation of the legal profession is considered the basis for
   adhering to the standard of its independence, at the same time,
   academics recognize the existence of the theory of the management of the
   legal profession. To study these problems, the authors conducted a
   comparative study of the regulatory models of the legal profession in
   the world in terms of compliance with international standards of legal
   independence in different legal jurisdictions and made some suggestions
   to improve the legal regulation of the legal profession in Ukraine.
   Empirical sources for scientific research were international documents,
   court decisions, national legislation of Great Britain, Canada, the
   United States, Ireland, Scotland, Australia and others, and the work of
   scientists. The article uses general scientific methods - dialectic,
   analysis, synthesis, analogy, etc., and special methods, particularly
   legal, historical, and formal comparative law.},

Title = {Affective blocs: Understanding affective polarization in multiparty
   systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research has suggested that affective polarization (AP)-the extent to
   which partisans view each other as a disliked out-group-has increased,
   especially in two-party political systems such as in the US. The
   understanding of AP in multiparty systems remains limited. We study AP
   in Finland, characterized by a strong multiparty system and a low level
   of ideological polarization, between 2007 and 2019. We find that AP has
   increased, driven mainly by voters evaluating their least favorite party
   more negatively. We also propose an approach that goes beyond earlier
   literature, which has mostly used a single aggregate metric to measure
   AP. Using latent profile analysis, we find that voters are grouped into
   blocs that view some parties positively and others negatively. This
   suggests that the complex dynamics of AP in multiparty democracies
   involve relationships between not just individual parties but between
   what we call affective blocs that span across party lines.},

Abstract = {This study is concerned with the substantive representation of non-human
   species in parliamentary business. It applies Leston-Bandeira's
   legislative functions perspective (LFP) to a data set of 2500 public
   petitions on animal welfare, submitted over three terms of the UK
   parliament. The wider significance of this work lies in: (i) underlining
   the utility of the LFP to petitions analysis; (ii) showing that, while
   few directly secure policy change, e-petitions perform valuable
   legislative functions including campaigning, scrutiny and
   policy-influencing roles, foremost of which is linkage and fostering
   citizen engagement in parliamentary business. And (iii) Showing how,
   over the past decade, public petitions have significantly contributed to
   the increasing salience of animal welfare in UK politics.},

Abstract = {Emotional appeals are powerful motivators of political action. Yet the
   gender of a politician and the existing stereotypes held by audiences
   complicate the determination of which type of emotional appeal is best
   suited for different issue areas. In what ways do politicians' emotional
   appeals serve to mitigate or exacerbate the impact of gender stereotypes
   across different policy domains? This research examines when politicians
   pay penalties or gain rewards for their emotional expressions using a
   survey experiment on a diverse national sample. We find evidence that
   women politicians are on equal footing or stand to benefit when
   expressing masculine emotions while also having greater emotional
   freedom across policy domains. Men politicians, on the other hand, are
   significantly punished for not acting ``manly{''} enough in masculine
   policy domains. Nonetheless, these patterns become complicated by both
   situational context and partisan expectations. The results provide
   promise for the future prospects of women politicians while pointing to
   the continued relevance of gendered stereotypes about emotionality in
   today's political world.},

Abstract = {Oftentimes, democracy is not spread out evenly over the territory of a
   country. Instead, pockets of authoritarianism can persist within a
   democratic system. A growing body of literature questions how such
   subnational authoritarian enclaves can be democratized. Despite
   fascinating insights, all existing pathways rely on the actions of
   elites and are therefore top-down. This article seeks to kick-start the
   discussion on a bottom-up pathway to subnational democratization, by
   proposing the attrition mechanism. This mechanism consists of four parts
   and is the product of abductive inference through theory-building causal
   process tracing. The building blocks consist of subnational
   democratization literature, social movement theory, and original
   empirical data gathered during extensive field research. This case study
   focuses on the `Dynasty Slayer' in the province of Isabela, the
   Philippines, where civil society actors used the attrition mechanism to
   facilitate subnational democratization. This study implies that civil
   society actors in subnational authoritarian enclaves have agency.},

Abstract = {The role of technology is growing in intra-party democracy (IPD)
   processes. This article presents a proposal for analysing digital IPD,
   by applying empirical democratic theory dimensions. To test our
   methodology, we analyse two different types of parties, a new digital
   one, Pos, and a traditional one undergoing reform, the Labour Party. Our
   analysis shows, first, that the application of technology is not
   neutral, with a differential impact depending on the specific democratic
   dimension considered and, secondly, that-due to convergent
   developments-new and established parties are closer in their digital IPD
   than expected. These results point out the relevance, for the ongoing
   debate on the quality of IPD, of considering the impact of digital on
   different democratic dimensions and its evolution over time.},

Title = {Foreign Direct Investment Liberalization in Communist Regimes: A
   Theoretical Model Based on the Comparison Among China, Cuba, North

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {What are the driving factors for foreign direct investment
   liberalization in formerly communist countries? Previous research
   explains foreign direct investment liberalization as a function of the
   intensification of international commerce and democratization; however,
   the likes of China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam hardly fit into this
   narrative. The following contribution makes a theoretical argument about
   the causes of foreign direct investment liberalization in communist
   authoritarian regimes with highly centralized and closed economies. We
   argue that foreign direct investment liberalization is caused by
   external shocks materializing in policy adaptations. The degree of
   foreign direct investment liberalization depends on the balance of power
   between actors who favor liberalization and actors who stand to profit
   from rent-seeking economies. The relative power of both factions
   determines the magnitude and type of foreign direct investment
   liberalization. We test this theoretical argument using case studies,
   which include China and Vietnam as representatives of gradual
   transitions and Cuba and North Korea as representatives of traditional
   rent-seeking economies.},

Abstract = {Disproportionate rates of congressional representation based on gender
   and race are especially stark considering the symbolic and substantive
   meaning derived from descriptive representation (Mansbridge 1999). Using
   an original data set consisting of candidate demographics, district
   characteristics, and campaign finance reports, we analyze an
   understudied barrier to representation: unequal access to campaign
   receipts. We argue that it is the simultaneous gendering and
   racialization of the campaign finance system that produces gaps in
   campaign fundraising and representation (Crenshaw 1989). Our results
   underscore the limitations of unitary approaches which conclude that
   women no longer face a disadvantage in campaign fundraising. Unequal
   access to campaign receipts serve as a barrier to the descriptive
   representation of women of color. By analyzing the interaction of both
   race and gender on campaign receipt totals in U.S. House elections from
   2010 to 2018, we assert the path to representation is not equal for all.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses two crucial gaps in the scholarship on the design
   and execution Simulation-Based Education (SBE) - the importance of
   scaffolding in constructing successful simulations for entry-level
   students and the associated value of social media tools. We examine
   these issues within three successive iterations of a role-play
   simulation employed in an introductory undergraduate course. We employ a
   mixed-methods approach that draws on self-reported learning outcomes
   from a total sample of 291 students across three years. We argue that
   running a successful simulated activity hinges upon careful design and
   scaffolding, and that incorporating social media tools can help to make
   the learning experience more immersive and more accessible for students.},

Abstract = {This article offers a distinctive way of grounding the regulative duties
   held by social media companies (SMCs). One function of the democratic
   state is to provide what we term the right to democratic epistemic
   participation within the public sphere. But social media has transformed
   our public sphere, such that SMCs now facilitate citizens' right to
   democratic epistemic participation and do so on a scale that was
   previously impossible. We argue that this role of SMCs in expanding the
   scope of what counts as fair democratic epistemic participation, and in
   becoming the providers of access to the digital public sphere, brings
   with it duties of regulation.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Taiwan's National Epidemic Prevention Team, a
   collective synergy between government and society in fighting COVID-19.
   We draw on a model of collaborative governance to dissect the
   collaboration between National Epidemic Prevention Team members; that
   is, central government, local governments, private enterprises and
   citizens. We argue that the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome
   (SARS) outbreak, democratic deepening and continual diplomatic isolation
   despite the global health crisis contributed to Taiwan's National
   Epidemic Prevention Team capacity and cohesiveness. Our analysis
   contributes to the heated discourse on democratic resilience in these
   turbulent times, suggesting that outbreak control can succeed only if
   there is an integrated system of interdepartmental, central-local,
   intersectoral and citizen-state collaboration. Overall, this article
   shows how liberal democracies can control and counteract COVID-19
   without resorting to authoritarian methods of containment.},

Abstract = {Recent trends suggest that liberal democracy in Israel experiences
   tensions. Although such a crisis calls for the involvement of political
   scientists in this public debate, the bulk of political scientists has
   refrained from visible activity. The exception to this rule is the civic
   studies arena in which a small group of political scientists is deeply
   and visibly engaged. Civic education, which Israel integrates into the
   civic studies subject, is a central political socialization tool. As a
   deep controversy rages in Israel regarding the meaning of the
   ``democratic{''} and the ``Jewish{''} components of the state's
   identity, civic studies arouse strong emotions. This arena enables
   political scientists, who are divided into the liberal and the
   conservative camps, to remain out of the limelight of the general public
   debate about the illiberal turn, while at the same time engaging heavily
   in its shaping. The civic studies issue constitutes an example of how
   collective engagement of political scientists on specific policy issues,
   may constitute an opportunity for these scholars, their visibility and
   enhance to therefore, their social relevance. A qualitative analysis of
   the case study of civic studies in Israel demonstrates the various ways
   of involvement employed by political scientists in the illiberal turn
   debate.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {67},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {War is commonly conceived of as the result of a bargaining process
   between states. However, war also has redistributive consequences within
   a state: certain groups face disproportionate costs (e.g., likely
   conscripts), whereas other groups may accrue most of the benefits
   (military contractors, politicians, etc.). War should thus be viewed
   simultaneously as the result of a bargaining process between domestic
   groups. This article presents a two-level game in which the relative
   importance of domestic groups to a government can impact the likelihood
   of going to war, but only under certain conditions. In particular, a
   necessary condition for domestic distributive politics to matter for war
   onset is the existence of redistributive frictions between domestic
   parties. This allows the model to produce a new explanation for why war
   may occur despite the fact that it is Pareto inefficient: inability to
   costlessly redistribute value between war's beneficiaries and the
   beneficiaries of any peaceful bargain.},

Abstract = {Commemorating wars plays an important role in reinforcing a sense of
   national identity in many countries. Bellah's (1967) work on civil
   religion argues that such commemorations have a quasi-sacred character
   and can have cohesive-inclusive and coercive-exclusive effects. This
   article examines how references to the Australian New Zealand Army Corps
   (ANZAC) are incorporated into far-right messaging online where the Anzac
   legend is typically discussed with the purpose of conveying a nostalgic
   image of a narrowly defined, exclusionary national identity.
   Unconditional glorification of Anzac is used as a benchmark of
   acceptance, often linked to anti-Muslim messaging and sometimes embedded
   in a White supremacy agenda. The official Anzac commemorations remain
   mute to far-right attempts to use Anzac for their own political
   mobilisation.},

Abstract = {Though most scholars of race and politics agree that old-fashioned
   racism largely gave way to a new symbolic form of racism over the course
   of the last half century, there is still disagreement about how to best
   empirically capture this new form of racism. Racial resentment, perhaps
   the most popular operationalization of symbolic racism, has been
   criticized for its overlap with liberal-conservative ideology. Critics
   argue that racially prejudiced responses to the items that compose the
   racial resentment scale are observationally equivalent to the responses
   that conservatives would provide. In this manuscript, I examine the
   racial resentment scale for differential item functioning (DIF) by level
   of adherence to ideological principles using the 1992, 2004, and 2016
   American National Election Studies. I find that responses to some of the
   racial resentment items are, indeed, affected by ideology. However, the
   problem is largely confined to 2016 and more egregious with respect to
   ideological self-identifications than adherence to ideological
   principles. Moreover, even after correcting for DIF, the racial
   resentment scale serves as a strong predictor of attitudes about racial
   issues.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the socio-economic practices of trade unions,
   defined as the practices aimed to contribute to satisfying the human
   development needs of workers. The objective is to highlight and analyze
   how and to what extent the socio-economic practices of trade unions,
   considered as organizers of workers for themselves, have contributed to
   the working-class economy.
   In Argentina, the main socio-economic practices of trade unions are
   collective bargaining and social action, which have had different levels
   of complexity, scope and effects on workers' needs, depending on the
   dynamics of the power relations between labour and capital. Through the
   case study of the trade union Luz y Fuerza Capital Federal in two
   stages, one of expansion (1958-1975) and the other of crisis
   (1976-2002), this article makes theoretical-methodological
   contributions, which show the economic and political value of these
   practices for the workers' struggle and for the study of trade unions.},

Abstract = {The idea of development in Spanish cooperation towards Colombia has
   undergone great changes in the recent years. Thus, we ask ourselves the
   question of how has the notion of development been transformed in
   Spanish cooperation towards Colombia? Based on the documentary analysis
   of official and academic sources, we identify fundamental questions to
   be approached from a critical perspective in the conceptual changes
   associated with development in Spanish cooperation towards Colombia. As
   such, we find that the notion of development within Spain's cooperation
   towards Colombia has responded to changes in the international
   development agenda, that is, it began as an embryonic idea of fighting
   poverty, but has been experiencing changes associated with the
   particular Colombian contexts unlocking the security perspective from
   the agenda such as science, peace building and restoration of the social
   fabric.},

Abstract = {While recent scholarship has argued for the utility of W. E. B. Du
   Bois's thought for democratic theory, his career-long emphasis on the
   problem of social equality-and the solution of self-conscious
   manhood-has gone largely unnoticed. In this article, I argue that while
   Du Bois's emphasis on social equality powerfully situates racial
   oppression as a social and epistemic problem, his solution of
   self-conscious manhood paradoxically reproduces the very conditions of
   social inequality he seeks to combat. Open to people of all races,
   genders, and classes, the path of self-conscious manhood consists in
   radical truth-telling, a free anarchy of the spirit, a will to strive
   and act, and the purity of isolation. However, through a close reading
   of Du Bois's biographies, editorials, and fiction, I show that
   self-conscious manhood centers an exclusionary and atomized ethic of
   self-creation rather than producing a democratic political and social
   order.},

Abstract = {Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there has been increasing evidence
   suggesting that current gendered and racially biased structures put in
   place to deal with the crises lead women and BAME population to be
   disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Yet, there is less
   information on how different groups respond to the pandemic in terms of
   compliance with the measures implemented by the government, and the role
   that parenthood and employment play in explaining compliance for such
   groups. We take insights from the literature on policy preferences and
   compliance to argue that gender, ethnicity, parenthood and employment
   are associated with high levels of worry about the consequences of the
   pandemic, leading to variations in compliance with social distancing
   measures. We test our argument using data from an original nationally
   representative survey. Results indicate that women and BAME respondents
   present important challenges to manage anxiety, stress and worry but
   they manifest differently in their compliance with social distancing
   measures. We also find that parenthood and employment affect compliance
   but in an unexpected direction. Together, results indicate that
   compliance is not only a matter of individual choice but also a matter
   of structural and contextual factors.},

Abstract = {International organizations such as the WHO have worked to raise
   awareness of the massive infodemic that accompanied the COVID-19
   outbreak and made it hard for people to find trustworthy sources of
   information and reliable guidance for their decisions. Our contribution
   focuses on the Italian case, where the Communications Regulatory
   Authority (AGCOM) was able to act as first mover in its field so as to
   strategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of a
   pre-existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows
   that the activity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily
   limited to the implementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We
   discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for
   the fight against disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find
   that as a political actor in its own right, the Italian media regulator
   claimed control over sectoral expertise in order to shape the crucial
   first steps of the response to the infodemic.},

   virus, trust in government officials, and trust in scientists as
   reliable predictors of social distancing, yet the exact nature of the
   relations between these predictor variables remains unexplored.
   Examining these relations in a study involving 998 participants, we
   found that less trust in former President Trump's ability to guide the
   nation through the COVID-19 crisis and greater trust in scientists
   predicted greater COVID-19 knowledge. In turn, greater COVID-19
   knowledge predicted greater social-distancing behavior, and did so most
   strongly among those who reported (1) relatively low levels of trust in
   Trump and (2) relatively high levels of trust in scientists. These
   findings add a layer of complexity to our understanding of how knowledge
   about an issue and trust in authority figures shape behavior, suggesting
   that in addition to predicting the amount of knowledge people have on a
   certain issue, trust may play role in influencing the perceived validity
   of that knowledge as a basis for behavior. The implications of this work
   for campaigns aimed at increasing compliance with scientific guidelines
   are discussed.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that e-voting has no measurable effects on
   turnout. However, existing studies did (or could) not look at e-voting
   effects on the individual level. We innovate by analyzing whether and to
   what extent the availability of e-voting fosters turnout among specific
   groups of citizens, and how this influences the equality of
   participation. To that end, we estimate Bayesian multi-level models on a
   unique set of official data on citizens' participation covering 30
   ballots between 2008 and 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland, which has the most
   farreaching experience with e-voting worldwide. Despite the fact that
   e-voting was added to an easy-to-use form of postal voting, we find that
   offering e-voting has increased turnout among abstainers and occasional
   voters. By contrast, the effects of e-voting availability on the
   equality of participation are mixed with respect to the age cohorts and
   gender.},

Abstract = {Based on the German Longitudinal Election Study (2016), we explain
   citizens' support for measures to increase women's descriptive
   representation in parliament. Despite women's underrepresentation, we
   find little support for positive action measures, and in particular for
   legal gender quotas. Binary logit analyses show that support for the
   introduction of positive action measures is not affected by citizens'
   perceptions about the share of female members of parliament. However,
   experimental data reveal that receiving information about women's actual
   proportion in parliament has an impact on citizens' support for gender
   quotas, in particular among those who overestimate women's
   representation. Once they learn that the actual share is lower than they
   thought, they are more likely to support the introduction of quotas.
   This indicates that support for positive action measures can be changed
   through providing the correct information.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between Andrew Gamble's study of
   the Conservative nation and his more recent advocacy of a social
   democratic constitution. It argues that the former-the nature of the
   Conservative Party, mobilising support successfully-may serve to prevent
   the realisation of the latter, the Conservative view of the constitution
   prevailing over pressures for a new constitutional settlement for the
   United Kingdom. Whereas the analysis of the Conservative nation is
   grounded in, and can only be understood by reference to, an appreciation
   of political realities, the approach to constitutional change embraced
   by Gamble is largely apolitical, concerned primarily with ends to the
   neglect of means.},

Title = {Who supports metropolitan integration? Citizens' perceptions of
   city-regional governance in Western Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1081-1106},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {The appropriate scale of metropolitan governance has been the subject of
   long-running debates. These debates between institutional fragmentation
   and integration proponents have revolved around the efficiency and
   effectiveness of metropolitan governance structures. However, the
   democratic acceptability of such reforms - whether and which citizens
   support or oppose metropolitan integration - has been largely ignored.
   This article makes two contributions. First, it develops a
   socio-psychological explanation of citizens' support for metropolitan
   integration. Second, it uses unique survey data of 5000 respondents from
   eight West European metropolitan areas to demonstrate that group-based
   (local attachment and nationalist party support) and cognitive factors
   (exposure to metropolitan issues and heuristics) are linked to
   metropolitan integration support, while material interests are less
   relevant. These findings are in line with multilevel governance research
   more generally and suggest that citizens' multilevel governance
   perceptions exhibit similar patterns across territorial scales.

Abstract = {Legislative debates are a thriving field in comparative politics. They
   make representation work by offering legislators the opportunity to take
   the floor and represent their constituents. In this paper, we review the
   key theoretical concepts and empirical findings in a maturing field. We
   begin by addressing what legislative debates are and why we should study
   them to learn about inter- and intra-party politics. Next, we look at
   the contributions springing from Proksch and Slapin's ground-breaking
   model. In so doing, our review suggests that recent work extends the
   original model to include further dimensions of legislative debates.
   Third, we examine the role of legislative debates as mechanisms of
   representation, focusing on gender. Four, we examine the challenges of
   the comparative analysis of legislative debates. Finally, we map the
   road ahead by discussing four avenues of future research and some key
   questions that remain unanswered.},

Abstract = {This article explores the evolution of naturalization in Western Europe
   and the United States from the early modern period to the end of the
   nineteenth century. It discusses three phases: naturalization as an
   economic privilege in the early modern period; naturalization as a grant
   of political rights reserved for a minority of the population; and
   naturalization as access to membership to a community of equals. It
   argues that naturalization, while mainly relevant to individuals moving
   from one country to another, also involved aspects of multilateralism
   throughout: naturalized citizens possess a status negotiated by their
   original and new states of membership, but this status can also be of
   great relevance in interaction with third countries.},

Abstract = {Why is corruption so prevalent in the majority of developing Latin
   American countries? While there are several forces driving it, this
   article focuses on its links to natural-resource endowment. We present
   empirical evidence based on a panel dataset of 103 developing countries
   from 1996 to 2016, suggesting that there is an overall positive
   relationship between natural-resource abundance and corruption. What,
   then, explains the divergent performances of resource-rich developing
   economies in the region in terms of corruption? We argue that the
   workings of a social contract mechanism between the state and citizens
   mediate the resource-corruption relationship. This article identifies
   the ability of the state to tax the nonresource sector as a crucial
   component of such a mechanism, through which the unfavorable effects of
   natural-resource abundance on corruption can be alleviated to a certain
   extent. Finally, our country studies suggest that the direct components
   of non-resource tax revenues do more to condition the
   resource-corruption linkage than the indirect components.},

Abstract = {Defying a trend across the industrialized world, Sweden is one of the
   few countries to fundamentally restructure its public pension system.
   This reform has spurred interest in explaining how the Swedish political
   system accomplished a feat that has eluded so many other nations.
   Anderson claims it was largely due to politically powerful unions and
   industrial groups supporting government efforts, while Feltenius
   counters that Anderson underestimates the influence of smaller,
   issue-oriented pressure groups, the pensioners' organizations. The
   Anderson-Feltenius dispute reflects disagreement over Pierson's theory
   of welfare state development and retrenchment, as well as the
   persistence and influence of corporatism. We re-examine, in detail, the
   argument proffered by Feltenius and suggest, as a theoretical matter,
   both he and Pierson neglect the importance of informal rules in
   political decision making. We also present additional evidence, ignored
   by Feltenius, that unions-and by inference corporatism-remained
   influential during Sweden's reform. We thus argue Sweden's experience is
   unlikely to be valuable for noncorporatist countries.},

Abstract = {Coinciding with the reprint of El eclipse de la fraternidad, and as a
   tribute to the author, Antoni Domenech, this article offers a reflection
   on the notion of fraternity inherited from the emancipatory tradition.
   Specifically, the first section reveals the assumptions on which the
   ideal of fraternity is built, especially, the gender biases of the ideas
   of individual and in/dependence that lie underneath it. Confronted with
   the deficiencies of this conceptualization, a recovery and reformulation
   of such an ideal is proposed, one that may be capable of drawing
   attention to the care work and interdependencies inherent to social
   ties. The second section puts forward, in broad strokes, what public
   policies that promote an interdependent fraternity could be like.},

Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {In 1. I make explicit the understanding of philosophy, which allows me
   to address the question of realism from a philosophical perspective,
   while showing the limitations and strengths of this perspective. In 2. I
   deploy sense critique to defend the conception of the ``real{''} as
   ``knowable{''} (in the footsteps of Peirce) and thus to avoid the
   abstract identification of the real as ``independent of us{''} (as
   knowers, speakers, agents), recovered and radicalized by the continental
   Speculative Realism (SR). In 3. I briefly consider the proposals of the
   major representatives this scholarly strand (Brassier, Grant, Harman,
   Meillassoux), and highlight the deep internal divergences as well as the
   differences from New Materialism. In 4. I highlight the inadequacies of
   Cimatti's objections, published in this very journal, to SR and in
   particular to the Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), on which I also focus.
   In the central 5. I try to recover the initial determination of the
   ``real{''} as ``knowable{''} through a theoretical reconstruction in a
   pragmatic key of the 20th-century linguistic turn, which, on the one
   hand does not configure the plural and varied languages (language games,
   interweaving of words and interactions) as inevitable screens or cages
   for access to the world or impersonal self-referential systems (as
   Cimatti and also Croce, again in this very journal, suggest), to couch
   them rather as indispensable sites of discussion, correction and
   revision of meanings (along the dimensions of external and internal
   experience, as well as the functioning of interactions), and, on the
   other hand, give account of the rich plurality of types of signs and
   languages used. In the short 6. I warn against the idealizing risks of
   my own anti-stylization of human languages, yet to point out that the
   factual limits of communication become evident precisely because of an
   open and varied conception of the use of language, or rather of the many
   languages, which invites neither to their overcoming or to a
   hierarchical arrangement of them nor to the recourse to a universal
   ideal community of communication.},

Abstract = {With both leaders focused on integration (or re-integration) of their
   states with their respective regions, for South Africa and Russia, under
   the coinciding presidencies of Thabo Mbeki and Vladimir Putin (1999 to
   2008), distal ties would appear to have been a peripheral consideration,
   albeit one pursued with relative consistency. These years were
   un-ideological, having followed the collapse of the USSR but preceding
   the emergence of the intermittently ideological BRICS project. I use
   trade data from multiple sources to assess the two countries' economic
   relationship under these leaders. Upon noting the continued but slow
   growth in political interaction under the two leaders, the article
   documents the effects of political interaction on trade, which was
   encouraged by both leaders as they sought deeper south-south cooperation
   (SSC) and lessened dependency on the West (with which both countries
   were nevertheless growingly intertwined). Trade responded favourably on
   both sides after the 2006 mutual visits by the two presidents (as seen
   by 2007 trade volumes). Overall, under the Mbeki-Putin years, we observe
   Russian products forming a higher share of South African imports than
   the other way around, whilst growth in access to each other's markets
   saw mostly new access for South Africa (giving it a favourable surplus
   of over US\$25-million, which grew to over US\$2-billion under the Zuma
   years), thereby complicating our understanding of the relationship and
   the nature of the asymmetry which defines it.},

Abstract = {Due to the successful centralization efforts of the beginning of the
   2000s, Russian governors almost lost their domestic as well as
   international agency. However, there is still a considerable variation
   in their international activity levels that remains unexplained.
   Employing an original dataset on the international activity of Russian
   governors from 2005 to 2015, the article investigates what effect
   regional political regime, ethnicity and other factors have on the level
   of gubernatorial participation in paradiplomacy. The level of regional
   democracy, the absence of ties between governors and regional elites,
   and the ethnic distinctiveness of a region are all positively associated
   with the engagement in international activity. The article demonstrates
   that regional authorities turn to paradiplomacy when faced with
   pressures for resource attraction and ethnic identity construction, even
   under the conditions of a relatively centralized authoritarian state.},

Abstract = {For decades, the most used mainstream model for economic growth and
   development was that used and promoted by the global north. However,
   this model has not seen the same results in the developing global south
   as it has in the developed global north. BRICS emerged as an
   organisation that presented an alternative means to the global north's
   approach to economic growth and development. This article examines
   whether BRICS membership has fostered the economic growth and
   development of South Africa and Brazil. This article examines the five
   years before and after Brazil and South Africa joined BRICS. Key
   findings of the study are that economic growth and development gains
   have been minimal. The study concludes that Brazil and South Africa have
   achieved political gains from their BRICS membership, which is
   considered to offset the absence of tangible economic growth and
   development gains.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on the candidate selection processes of
   Podemos in Spain and the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S - Five Star Movement)
   in Italy, processes which are related to intra-party democracy. With a
   mixed-methods approach (including novel data from the expert survey
   PoPES, 31 semi-structured interviews with party representatives and
   militants, and analysis of party documents, statutes and leader
   speeches) and a comparative perspective, we explore candidate selection
   in the context of the broader organizational party structures over time.
   We find that: (1) Podemos functions like a typical centralized party,
   whereas M5S is a deviant case with strong and centralized control over
   party organization but decentralized mechanisms for candidate selection;
   (2) both these logics of centralization of power undermine the parties'
   democratic credentials but have different consequences in terms of
   cohesion (expulsions/departures in M5S and splintering in Podemos); and
   (3) in both cases, the parties' organizational culture and symbolic
   tools legitimate their top-down features.},

Abstract = {The President of the Republic of South Africa declared a national state
   of disaster, in terms of the Disaster Management Act 2002 (Act 57 of
   2002) on the 16th of March 2020, which empowers the executive to
   coordinate disaster management mechanism that focuses on preventing and
   reducing the outbreak of Covid-19 virus. In other words, the legislative
   and executive functions of the state have effectively been lapsed into
   one. This case study examines the consequences of this type of emergency
   regime on the behaviour of parliamentary opposition parties. Parliaments
   initiate, prepare and pass legislation, as well as exercise oversight
   and hold government to account. I look at the number of amendments, oral
   and written questions for a limited period of six months from the
   announcement of the national state of disaster, and compare with the
   same period the previous years, 2018, 2019, 2020, to determine if the
   changing nature of executive-legislative constitutional balance has
   influenced the behaviour of opposition parties in their strategies
   relating to policy-making and scrutiny.},

Abstract = {Finding a way to impress upon students how they directly connect to
   others around the world is a challenge. What they had for dinner, how
   they paid for their gasoline, and where they disposed of their Starbucks
   cup all provide fodder to help students see direct connections between
   their actions and the world around them. Consumption logs track
   decisions, responses, and activities, thus offering a pedagogical tool
   that raises awareness, provides information for comparison, and helps
   students connect abstract ideas with concrete, personal examples.
   Pairing these logs with any number of assignments, including journals,
   short responses, and critical thought papers, increases their potential
   for promoting student learning.},

Abstract = {The diversity of today's voters and political candidates demographic
   characteristics calls for the application of the homophily principle in
   understanding voters behavior. This paper evaluated the effect of
   ethnic, gender, religious and age homophily on status homophily, which
   is contextualized within the Ghanaian context. The findings established
   that amongst the factors affecting status homophily; ethnic homophily is
   the most influential factor, followed by gender homophily and age
   homophily, with religious homophily having the least effect. The
   findings established that voter preference for candidates during
   elections draws on ethnic lines and dissipate the established perception
   that religion is a major influential factor in voter preference for
   candidates. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of
   status homophily in political marketing research and practice and the
   opportunities for future research. It recommended that political
   marketers should develop and apply market orientation, marketing
   intelligence and demographic segmentation as well as develop positioning
   strategies using political brand personalities and brand ambassadors
   based on voters' demographic preferences for candidates.},

Abstract = {A growing literature has argued that electoral turnout decreases the
   more government policy constrained by economic and institutional
   factors. This paper investigates whether a certain type of policy
   constraint, fiscal rules, lowers turnout. Since fiscal rules set limits
   for government fiscal policy, they should lower the incentive for
   citizens to participate electorally. However, using parliamentary
   turnout data in a large panel of democratic countries, little robust
   evidence is found in favor of fiscal rules having a depressing effect on
   electoral turnout. Analysis of European individual-level data also
   suggests that national fiscal rules do not affect inequality in
   electoral turnout between income groups either.
   Difference-in-discontinuity evidence from Italian municipalities further
   suggests that the results are causally identified.},

Title = {Dealing with measurement error in list experiments: Choosing the right
   control list design},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {List experiments are widely used in the social sciences to elicit
   truthful responses to sensitive questions. Yet, the research design
   commonly suffers from the problem of measurement error in the form of
   non-strategic respondent error, where some inattentive participants
   might provide random responses. This type of error can result in
   severely biased estimates. A recently proposed solution is the use of a
   necessarily false placebo item to equalize the length of the treatment
   and control lists in order to alleviate concerns about respondent error.
   In this paper we show theoretically that placebo items do not in general
   eliminate bias caused by non-strategic respondent error. We introduce a
   new option, the mixed control list, and show how researchers can choose
   between different control list designs to minimize the problems caused
   by inattentive respondents. We provide researchers with practical
   guidance to think carefully about the bias that inattentive respondents
   might cause in a given application of the list experiment. We also
   report results from a large novel list experiment fielded to over 4900
   respondents, specifically designed to illustrate our theoretical
   argument and recommendations.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Using the tools provided by intellectual history, we analyze the ideas
   and doctrines contained in the political propaganda of the first
   generation of Fabian socialists (1880-1890) with the idea of exploring
   the extent to which the economic agreements discussed in its origins by
   this version of English socialism appears subordinated to a handful of
   moral purposes that we can trace in the intellectual environment of that
   period. Our conclusions suggest that Fabianism is neither a third way
   nor the result of a fortunate dialectical synthesis between liberalism
   and socialism, but a political culture of its own with the capacity of
   agency to update contemporary ideological debate.},

Abstract = {How can we equalize opportunities while respecting people's freedom?
   According to a view that I call libertarian resourcism, people's fair
   shares of resources should normally take the form of unconditional,
   individual cash endowments, thereby supporting the freedom to do
   whatever they might want to do. This view, of which Van Parijs'
   philosophy of `real freedom for all' is the clearest and most well-known
   example, has become a powerful weapon to criticize work conditionality
   as unfair and perfectionistic (or illiberal), and to motivate political
   struggles for the emancipation of the precariat. However, similar views
   are also expressed in many other justifications of basic income that
   stress the strategic importance of exit-based empowerment. This article
   argues that the reliance of these theories on concepts and assumptions
   of libertarianism makes them ill-equipped to justify core requirements
   of social empowerment, and to identify the forms of agency needed to
   sustainably advance the radical objectives they favour. The implication
   of this is not to reject the link between social justice and
   unconditional resource endowments but to dissociate the justification
   and design of such measures from libertarian ways of thinking.},

Abstract = {Following the proposal of the ``third constitutional way{''} deployed by
   Curd) Cobos, this article proposes a reading of the Chilean
   constitutional process in which the normative and descriptive dimensions
   of it appear conjugated. An old Aristotelian rationale allows us to
   observe the constituent processes, including the Chilean one, as
   unfinished expressions of a new order that is demanded and that its
   retrospective constitutional consecration should not ignore. Understood
   in this way, the Chilean constituent process generated as of October 18,
   offers risks but also immense opportunities in the face of the challenge
   of establishing a new radically democratic social order.},

Abstract = {Interactions between units in political systems often occur across
   multiple relational contexts. These relational systems feature
   interdependencies that result in inferential shortcomings and
   poorly-fitting models when ignored. General advancements in inferential
   network analysis have improved our ability to understand relational
   systems featuring interdependence, but developments specific to working
   with interdependence that cross relational contexts remain sparse. In
   this paper, I introduce a multilayer network approach to modeling
   systems comprising multiple relations using the exponential random graph
   model. In two substantive applications, the first a policy communication
   network and the second a global conflict network, I demonstrate that the
   multilayer approach affords inferential leverage and produces models
   that better fit observed data.},

Abstract = {This article examines MPs' constituency orientation in two of the most
   `extreme' cases of proportional representation, Israel and the
   Netherlands. Both countries are considered as limiting cases, providing
   evidence of the type of geographically based representation we are
   likely to see when there are no electoral institutions which encourage a
   geographical link between voters and representatives. While the
   literature predicts the geographical connection between voters and
   representatives in extreme proportional electoral systems to be minimal,
   this article finds this to hold true for the Netherlands but not for
   Israel. It then seeks to find factors explaining variation in MPs'
   constituency orientation in the absence of electoral incentives.},

Abstract = {How pervasive is partisan sorting and polarization over public policies
   in the American public? We examine whether the barriers of partisan
   sorting and polarization seen in national politics extend to important
   local policies that shape economic development. To describe the extent
   of partisan sorting and polarization over local development policies, we
   employ conjoint survey experiments in representative surveys of eight US
   metropolitan areas and a hierarchical modeling strategy for studying
   heterogeneity across respondents. We find that strong partisans are
   sorted by party in some of their policy opinions, but rarely polarized.
   The same voters who disagree about national issues have similar
   preferences about local development issues suggesting a greater scope
   for bipartisan problem solving at the local level.},

Abstract = {Since 1999, there is a Peruvian guerrilla that presents an autonomous
   and differential development: the Peruvian Communist Party, Valle del
   Alto Huallaga (PCPVAH). These remains of Sendero Luminoso have presented
   a new direction in the 21st century. The aim of this paper is defining
   the new direction of the PCP-VAH, located in Huallaga Valley, as an
   independent organization. Therefore, we will discuss essential aspects
   of the PCP-VAH, as its ideology, organization and strategy, in order to
   emphasise the changes appeared because of the weakening of the guerrilla
   and the new regionalisation context. Besides, the changes and the
   continuities with its predecessors: the Shinning Path and Red Path.},

Title = {Accessibility and generalizability: Are social media effects moderated
   by age or digital literacy?},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {An emerging empirical regularity suggests that older people use and
   respond to social media very differently than younger people. Older
   people are the fastest-growing population of Internet and social media
   users in the US, and this heterogeneity will soon become central to
   online politics. However, many important experiments in this field have
   been conducted on online samples that do not contain enough older people
   to be useful to generalize to the current population of Internet users;
   this issue is more pronounced for studies that are even a few years old.
   In this paper, we report the results of replicating two experiments
   involving social media (specifically, Facebook) conducted on one such
   sample lacking older users (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) using a source of
   online subjects which does contain sufficient variation in subject age.
   We add a standard battery of questions designed to explicitly measure
   digital literacy. We find evidence of significant treatment effect
   heterogeneity in subject age and digital literacy in the replication of
   one of the two experiments. This result is an example of limitations to
   generalizability of research conducted on samples where selection is
   related to treatment effect heterogeneity; specifically, this result
   indicates that Mechanical Turk should not be used to recruit subjects
   when researchers suspect treatment effect heterogeneity in age or
   digital literacy, as we argue should be the case for research on digital
   media effects.},

Abstract = {Policy responsiveness is considered an effective tool for representing
   the aggregated interests of an electoral district. This article asks the
   question whether or not legislators in a mixed-member electoral system
   act on the profile of the constituency in their parliamentary work and,
   if yes, whether the magnitude of their actions is dependent upon mandate
   type and electoral security. I answer these questions by using data on
   Hungarian Members of Parliament (MPs)' parliamentary questions, and the
   agricultural profile of the constituencies between 1998 and 2010. It is
   found that a larger share of the agricultural population correlates with
   a greater frequency of agriculture questions. Furthermore, as expected,
   single-member district MPs are more vigilant to the share of the
   agricultural population than list MPs. Interestingly, MPs remain
   indifferent to the fierceness of competition: they ask just as any many
   questions in the case of a safe seat as in the case of stiff
   competition.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {This article investigates the processes of politicization of the youth
   body, as well as the symbolizations and incidences of images in the
   field of cultural policies in Chile during a turbulent historical
   moment: 1968-1973 - moments before the Popular Unity and until the coup
   in Chile. This is a period in which both the cultural industry and the
   discussion in society itself incorporate topics and images into their
   respective agendas with a different representation of the youth body:
   their undressed body. In this way, during this period, youth nudity was
   positioned as a topic that broke into the cultural and media sphere -
   cinema, magazines and music: a sort of ``uncover{''} that did not manage
   to position itself but fleetingly. In the light of a genealogy of the
   youth, different pieces of the visual culture of the period were
   analyzed to understand its emergence, circulation and effects on
   society, and thus account for some strategies for making ideas and
   images of youth in Chile during this period of the 20th century.},

Title = {The history of Bolivian communism: the PCB: between internal

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The history of the 20th century is going to be incomplete without the
   history of international communism and its national manifestations. This
   text presents an outline of the history of the Communist Party of
   Bolivia, based on the documentation still unknown to the researchers,
   coming from the archives of the Soviet Communist Party, which allows to
   document and expose the analyzed events with greater foundation. This
   study chronologically covers the period of greatest communist presence
   in the national life of Bolivia, from its foundation to the debacle of
   the late 1980s, focusing on three dramatic crises of the PCB, always
   related to factors of internal action and international influences. ,
   from the division of the party with the departure of the pro-Chinese
   fraction in 1965, going through the major disruption of the organic life
   of the party related to the catastrophe of the Che Guevara guerrilla and
   ending with the catastrophic policy of party participation in the
   government of the Unidad Democratica y Popular, whose outcome was
   aggravated by the drastic changes in the international communist
   movement, initiated by the perestroika process in the USSR. In all these
   crises, the party was divided by the opposite currents, reformist and
   rupturist-revolutionary - both relied more on external, international
   factors and ideas than on internal politics and experience, always being
   the party aggrieved and unable to elaborate a line independent and
   creative for a national project that was ultimately the cause of the
   political collapse of the PCB},

Abstract = {Research has highlighted the role of the state in sustaining
   authoritarian regimes. But how does state capacity support autocrats
   during elections? The author argues that one specific aspect of state
   capacity - control over territory through the state apparatus - helps
   autocrats ensure large majority electoral victories. High-capacity
   rulers can rely on local agents and institutions to subtly manipulate
   elections, for instance by controlling the media or inhibiting the work
   of domestic election monitors throughout the territory while staying
   clear of costly manipulation such as election violence. In
   cross-national analyses of authoritarian multiparty elections from 1946
   to 2017, the study finds that state territorial control increases the
   likelihood of large victories. Furthermore, high levels of state control
   correlate with subtle strategies of manipulation, including media bias
   and restrictions on domestic monitors - strategies that are also
   positively associated with large victories. At the same time, state
   control is negatively associated with election violence.},

Abstract = {This article uses a survey carried out by the ESRC-funded Party Members
   Project in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 election to paint a
   portrait of Labour's post-Corbyn membership. They are overwhelmingly
   white, well-educated and largely middle class and middle-aged, with many
   of them living in southern England. They are also disproportionately
   likely to work, either currently or previously, in the public or
   charitable sector. They are left-wing but also very socially liberal,
   and they are very pro-European. This means they have a lot in common
   with Labour MPs but much less in common with many of the voters Labour
   desperately needs to win back. A significant number of members, perhaps
   especially those disinclined to regard antisemitism as a serious
   problem, could leave as a result of Corbyn being replaced (and possibly
   removed) by Starmer. Whether this will have much impact on Labour's
   electoral prospects is debateable.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {347-358},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We examine how people's emotional reactions to gun violence public
   service announcements (PSAs) influence information acquisition, policy
   preferences, and political engagement. Utilizing a non-student sample of
   more than 100 participants, we look people's emotional reactions (i.e.,
   anger, sadness, contempt, and fear) to two Sandy Hook Promise PSAs. We
   assess people's emotional reactions by relying on two complimentary
   measures: the traditional self-report measures as well as facial
   expression analysis. We demonstrate that when people are feeling sad
   after watching the Sandy Hook Promise PSAs, they are significantly more
   likely to retain information from a news article about school violence.
   Furthermore, feelings of contempt and fear lead people to seek out
   additional information about gun violence. In addition, we find when
   people feel anger, contempt, and fear after watching the PSAs, they
   change their views of gun policies. Finally, fear and contempt increase
   people's likelihood of becoming politically mobilized.},

Abstract = {Literature on Indian politics has largely under-examined the role of the
   family in shaping party politics with the exception of the studies on
   dynasticism. There is a paucity of research that looks at the complex
   ways in which intimate lives and party politics are intertwined. This
   article contributes to the existing feminist analyses of Indian party
   politics by conceptualizing politics and political labour in a way that
   does not exclude the role of the family. It presents the case study of a
   village in northern Kerala, which has been witnessing heightened
   political conflicts to show how personal experiences and family disputes
   get politicized. As domestic and political spheres bleed into each
   other, political parties become hugely dependent on feminine ideals and
   women's everyday labour, affects and sociality to survive electoral
   competitions. Yet, the patriarchal family and masculinized local party
   leadership use gender ideologies to celebrate hypermasculine political
   participation, undervalue women's labour and limit their political
   aspirations.},

Abstract = {In 2003, scholar Robyn Lim argued that the United States had tenaciously
   committed itself since the early twentieth century to maintaining a
   ``quadrilateral{''} balance of power in East Asia that included itself,
   China, Japan, and Russia. In the years since, however, the devastating
   material and psychological impacts of the Iraq War have combined with
   the neo-isolationist sentiments of President Donald Trump to call into
   question America's commitment to maintaining the East Asia
   quadrilateral. The arrangement has been put under further pressure by
   the inexorable and almost unbelievable rise of China to the status of
   economic superpower since the year 2000. Given these circumstances, it
   is imperative to consider what East Asia will look like if Washington
   chooses to retrench from the region in the coming decades.},
