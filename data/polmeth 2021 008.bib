Abstract = {Technocracy is a contested concept, but it is typically associated with
   the exercise of political power justified by claims to expertise, and is
   often contrasted with populist forms of politics. In Power Without
   Knowledge, Jeffrey Friedman reframes the concept of technocracy as a
   form of politics oriented to solving social and economic problems, and
   thereby extends it to cover not only epistemic elites but ordinary
   people. This move usefully challenges the simplistic framing of populism
   and technocracy as opposites, but at the expense of effacing other
   dimensions of democratic politics. Friedman also suggests that
   maximizing individuals' exit opportunities will allow them to take
   advantage of their relatively reliable personal knowledge. The
   architecture of ``exitocracy{''} would itself, however, be designed by
   experts who, as such, might be tempted to insulate the institutional
   architecture they design against democratic interference.},

Abstract = {Power is an important basic concept in Political Science and Economics.
   Applying an extended version of the uncertain dichotomous choice model
   proposed, the objective of this paper is to clarify the relationship
   between two different types of power a voter may have: skill-dependent
   (s-d) power and marginal contribution (mc). It is then shown that, under
   the optimal committee decision rule, inequality in skills may result in
   higher inequality of the two types of power and that the distribution of
   the second type of power (mc) can be even more unequal than the
   distribution of the first type of s-d power. Using simulations, and
   assuming evenly spread skills, this possibility is proved to be robust.
   The significance of the finding is due to the effect of power on reward,
   whether it is defined in terms of status or in terms of monetary
   payment.},

Abstract = {The recent military standoff between India and China in Ladakh had
   received tremendous public attention, both domestic and international.
   Mounting uncertainty, chaos, and looming instability marked the crisis
   for the fact that it shattered the prolonged stability along the Line of
   Actual Control (LAC). Particularly for India, it marked the heightening
   national security challenges from China. While the discussions that
   followed the crisis explored at length how the clash and the ensued
   crisis generated security threats, it seems to have inadequately
   captured the nuances of the insecurity generated. The article argues
   that the security concerns generated were not just physical but also
   `ontological'. The paper seeks to demonstrate how the Ladakh crisis
   engendered a sense of ontological insecurity for India.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {118-132},
Abstract = {In this article, we analyze to what extent cultural diversity brought
   about by immigrants affects economic activity of the Spanish provinces.
   To do that, we use panel data techniques that treat cultural diversity
   as an endogenous variable and account for spatial linkages. The dual
   nature of immigrants in Spain, that is, working and retired migration,
   is also considered in our regressions. The outcomes reveal that greater
   cultural diversity stimulates the economic activity of the Spanish
   provinces, these gains being reinforced in the case of labor-active
   migrant and for richer provinces. Our results are robust to diverse
   specifications, estimation methods, and samples.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to analyze the perspectives of
   Ukraine's foreign economic policy with respect to Latin America. An
   overview of the economic and political situation in Latin America is
   characterized by intensification of inflation in the region, reduction
   of exports and foreign investment, erosion of the level of business and
   consumer confidence. She used the following research methods: methods of
   analysis and synthesis, systematic approach, methods of induction and
   deduction, generalization, and systematization, economic, etc. Defined
   strategic orientations have been identified to improve foreign economic
   cooperation between Ukraine and Latin America to seek new foreign
   markets and increase foreign trade, such as: opening representative
   offices of Ukrainian companies in Latin America; active participation of
   Ukrainian companies in trade fair and exhibition events taking place in
   the countries of the region; establishment of bilateral industrial
   cooperation in the territory of MERCOSUR member countries. It concludes
   on the need to develop a long-term strategy to activate trade and
   economic cooperation between Ukraine and the countries of the Latin
   American region with the identification and justification of sectoral
   priorities.},

Title = {A Marxist Transhumanism?},
Journal = {NEW PROPOSALS-JOURNAL OF MARXISM AND INTERDISCIPLINARY INQUIRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-40},
Abstract = {Transhumanism is a philosophical, cultural and political revolutionary
   movement. It proposes a radical transformation of the human being and
   the society in which it develops. Transhumanism is revolutionary on a
   philosophical level because it collects ontological traditions of the
   past that posed this transformation, from British Marxist and
   non-Marxist left-wing thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries to Soviet
   and Russian cosmism. But going further back one can find
   prototranshumanist proposals from Christian theologians and
   Enlightenment philosophers. And it is revolutionary at a political level
   because it can be traced back to proto-transhumanist ideas in political
   revolutionaries of the past. The revolutionary doctrine par excellence
   of the 19th and 20th centuries is Marxism. Marxism also influenced
   certain transhumanists authors, although there are no transhumanist
   movements that claimed to be Marxist themselves, because none of them
   put into question capital as the basic social relation of capitalism. In
   the texts of Marx, Engels and Lenin there can be found
   proto-transhumanist ideas. Philosophical connections between Marxism and
   transhumanism are numerous. But beyond this, in this article we suggest
   that it is possible to develop a Marxist transhumanism movement that
   exceeds the actual individualistic and pro-capitalist prism on
   transhumanism. Also, we suggest transhumanism can serve to revitalize
   Marxist materialism in this 21st century and for the future. Marxist
   transhumanism would comply with the definition of communism of Marx and
   Engels, and it could even be said that Marxism is, essentially,
   transhumanist in its foundations, even when it defines posthumans as New
   Men, or Men Made In Property. And it could even be said that
   transhumanism is, in essence, Marxist. In this article, we present a
   historical cartography of inherent class relations in techno-scientific
   development and try to show the ideological impact that these relations
   made on transhumanists. We describe actual transhumanism as
   transcapitalism, and analyze its theoretical influences, proposing a
   theoretical itinerary for Marxist transhumanism, from Marx to more
   contemporary authors that would pave its political and philosophical
   roots. In addition, we define transcapitalism as BTA-Politics -
   biopolitics, thanatopolitics and anatomopolitics - in the sense of
   Michel Foucault. Finally, we propose that it is precisely the inherent
   contradictions of current Transcapitalism that set the paths for the
   construction of Marxist transhumanism.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the role of the equity factor in the consolidation
   of urban communities. The consolidation of the population is considered
   a way to achieve its stability. Social consolidation is discussed as an
   ambiguous concept that characterizes the process and outcome of an
   agreement between different communities on the basis of the unity of
   values and interests and the establishment of relations of mutual trust
   and solidarity, in order to achieve common goals. The results of the
   research have shown that justice is not only the dominant value of urban
   residents but becomes a factor that determines many daily practices of
   the population. As a conclusion it has empirically confirmed that, if
   there are significant discrepancies regarding the understanding of
   social justice by the inhabitants of the city and their lack of
   conviction in the practical implementation of this principle,
   consolidation remains only an illusory opportunity. Therefore, the
   consistent implementation of the principle of justice and the search for
   social consensus among various segments of the population are strategic
   priorities for the development of urban communities around the world.},

Abstract = {The realities of modern reality indicate that there are a significant
   number of unjustified attempts to resolve controversial issues based on
   the use of force. The article shows the evolutionary processes of the
   transition of insurgent-guerrilla movements to radical terrorist methods
   of struggle in the period of 1991-2001 and reveals the reasons for this
   process. The article analyzes the definition of ``international
   terrorism{''} in the modern sense, analyzes the characteristic features
   of international terrorism of the 1990s, the reasons for its spread, new
   forms of terrorist activity. The following methods were used in the
   study of the chosen topic: historical-genetic, comparative-historical;
   problem-chronological, the method of historical modeling. Authors
   conclude, there is no doubt that all the insurgent-guerilla movements,
   without exception, pursued their own goals. The most effective way to
   achieve them at the turn of the century turned out to be precisely
   terrorist attacks, which, with all the strength of state structures,
   were not possible to fend off. Thus, terrorism has become a strong
   weapon in the hands of weak players in the international arena.},

Abstract = {John Taylor was not only the main interpreter of the ideas of
   Jeffersonian democracy among nineteenth-century American political
   thinkers, but also a reference point for all the politicians of the
   Southern States who opposed the institutional theory of Alexander
   Hamilton and the Federalists. The true enemy of Republican values and
   principles was identified by Taylor and the Jeffersonians in the
   American judicial system and in the Supreme Court, which was led by John
   Marshall for thirty-five years. The theory of States' sovereignty, as
   drawn up by Taylor, affirmed the power of any State to declare null and
   void a Congressional law and to prohibit its application within the
   State's own territory.},

Abstract = {Hong Kong's non-white ethnic minorities - including its Filipino
   residents - are often described in media and policy discourses as a
   unified group. Speaking back to this misconception, in this article we
   describe the gendered experiences of two 23-year old Filipinas born and
   raised in Hong Kong through what Claudia Mitchell has described as girl
   method - research with girls for girls and about girls' concerns - in
   our case producing visual depictions of girlhood in cellphilms
   (cellphone + filmmaking + intention) and collaborative writing. We write
   together as coresearchers to extend participatoty approaches to research
   dissemination as we make sense of the changing political situation in
   Hong Kong in the years since our first collaboration in 2015. Through a
   polyvocal - many voices writing together - reflection on a cellphilm
   production project on identities and belonging four years later, we
   argue that Filipino identity in Hong Kong is complex and multifarious,
   and we aim to disseminate knowledge by and for Filipino Hong Kongers
   that speaks back to the erasure of their experiences within larger
   discourses about Filipinas, gender, and activism in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {The article considers the long-standing limits of the Economic and
   Monetary Union (EMU) through the lenses of Next Generation EU (NGEU)
   pandemic response evidencing how Covid-19 exacerbated EMU shortcomings
   are (not) overcome. We evaluate whether NGEU is only a palliative
   stop-gap fix to structural problems and how for Covid-19 to be
   considered as a breaking point for EU economic governance permanent
   ambitious (Treaty) reform is an essential and so far not uncontested
   step. A qualitative systematic review of weaknesses of EMU and proposed
   reforms informs a scoreboard evaluation of NGEU. Results confirm that
   while the symmetric crisis allowed suspending risk-sharing and
   solidarity vetoes, deep structural asymmetries and unfitness of
   (intergovernmental) decision-making cannot be addressed through NGEU
   temporary emergency mechanism. Hence Covid-19 so far cannot be narrated
   as sparking a revolutionary deviation from the architecture and guiding
   principle of the supranational fiscal framework. At the same time, the
   pandemic opened a (short-lived) window of opportunity for completing the
   EMU, requiring permanent structural institutional (Treaty) reform. A
   timely finding - grounded in copious extant literature on the EMU -
   highlighting the high stakes of the ongoing Conference of the future of
   Europe, whose success can only materialise through an ambitious
   (federal) agenda.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present paper is twofold. Firstly, we attempt to
   examine the existence of possible intercultural problems and conflicts
   in the Austrian-Slovak border region, and to subsequently propose
   feasible solutions. Secondly, the research is aimed at ongoing and
   planned projects of cross-border cooperation. The research is conducted
   predominantly by the method of key informant interview, which is, by
   definition, supposed to provide relevant data from people possessing
   knowledge concerning certain phenomena, or from influential people.
   Overall, five interviews with the mayors of the municipalities located
   in the border area were conducted. The research was supported by an
   extensive literature review of domestic as well as foreign sources and a
   critical discourse analysis. The interviews did not reveal existence of
   intercultural disputes, but they did prove the premise of the intention
   to intensify cross-border cooperation.},

Abstract = {Y The aim of the article was to conduct a comparative legal analysis of
   the features and problems of criminal prosecution of Ed legal entities
   for environmental crimes. The research objectives were fulfilled through
   modern methods of cognition. The leading Maria practical method was the
   method of observation. The study allowed to form a conceptual
   understanding of theoretical ideas about environmental crimes of legal
   entities in Ukraine. Currently,Reittaesv Ukraine is trying to focus in
   its legislative innovations on the implementation of lddeientu DrHumtoer
   progressive approaches to the introduction of a comprehensive
   institution loihiirom of criminal law measures regarding the liability
   of these entities. Relevant legal mechanisms and comments identified in
   the practice of the European Union and substantiated by scholars, can be
   implemented in the legislation of Ukraine. Amendments to the rules
   governing the procedure for effective prevention of environmental crimes
   by legal entities are proposed. It seems reasonable to introduce an
   active monitoring analysis of anthropogenic activities of companies, and
   the creation of special units to identify relevant violations. The
   mechanisms for implementing the set of preventive and monitoring
   measures outlined in the article, set the background for further
   scientific research.},

Title = {Is the (Mass) Party Really Over? The Case of the Dutch Forum for
   Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {286-295},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, the Netherlands has witnessed the rise of several
   influential populist radical right parties, including the Pim Fortuyn
   List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn), Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom (Partij voor
   de Vrijheid) and, more recently, the Forum for Democracy (Forum voor
   Democratie {[}FvD]). By analyzing the party's organizational structures,
   this article seeks to determine whether the FvD may be considered a new
   ``mass party{''} and to what extent ordinary members can exert influence
   over the party's internal procedures. The party's efforts to establish a
   large membership base suggest that the FvD set out to build a relatively
   complex mass organization. Through targeted advertising campaigns, the
   party made strategic use of social media platforms to rally support.
   Thus, while the means may have changed with the advent of the internet,
   the FvD invested in creating some organizational features that are
   commonly associated with the ``mass party{''} model. At the same time,
   however, the party did not really seek to foster a community of loyal
   partisan activists among its membership base but instead treated its
   members as donors. The party is clearly characterized by centralized
   leadership in the sense that the party's spearhead, Thierry Baudet,
   maintains full control over key decision-making areas such as
   ideological direction, campaigning, and internal procedures. At first
   sight, the party appears to have departed from Wilders's leader-centered
   party model. However, a closer look at the party apparatus demonstrates
   that the FvD is, in fact, very hierarchical, suggesting that the party's
   internal democracy is much weaker than the party's name might suggest.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary party group leaders (PPG leaders) are understudied but
   important actors in contemporary parliaments. This article examines the
   role orientations of PPG leaders in Belgium, using data from 66
   semi-structured elite interviews. Contradictory to theoretical views on
   frontbench roles as institutionally determined `position roles' and
   despite Belgian PPG leaders' comparatively limited intra-party
   authority, the findings indicate role variation on two dimensions,
   resulting in five distinct PPG leader role types. These are explained
   using multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis (mvQCA). We find
   that, while some roles are indeed heavily shaped by contextual factors
   such as parties' government status, size or electoral performance,
   others are more clearly driven by individual-level factors such as prior
   experience or progressive ambitions. As such, this article provides
   substantial insights into an underexposed aspect of legislative
   organisation, introduces QCA as a novel method to explain parliamentary
   roles and makes a theoretical case that also among frontbenchers
   preference-driven roles are possible.},

Abstract = {The article studies the theoretical and practical aspects of the
   development of Taiwan's residents' national identity. The analysis is
   based on the results of recent opinion polls which studied the trends in
   identity change of the Taiwanese people, their preferences and views on
   relations with mainland China. An attempt was made to establish a
   correlation between the changing identity, the wish of the majority of
   the population to maintain the status quo in relations with the PRC and
   the level of support of the political independence of Taiwan. The
   article shows that the share of those in Taiwan who identify as
   ``Taiwanese{''} has been increasing over the last decades. At the same
   time, the belief that Taiwan is an independent state has also been
   strengthening. The authors analyse the internal and external factors
   that influenced the dynamics of identity change and the attitudes
   towards the problems of the status of Taiwan on the island over the last
   two years.},

   Sentiment in Contemporary Democracies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {288-300},
Abstract = {According to much of the extant literature, feelings and beliefs among
   many citizens of being left behind and unheard by unresponsive political
   decisionmakers, who lack moral integrity represent the epicenter of
   recent protest and populist discontent in democratic society. Based on
   survey data for 20 contemporary democracies from two ISSP waves, we
   found that anti-establishment attitudes are not shared among the
   majority of respondents. Although there are differences between country
   contexts. Such sentiment is associated with macrostructural dynamics,
   since unfavorable attitudes toward politicians are more widespread among
   publics in countries which are exposed to higher levels of public
   corruption and witnessed increasing levels of income inequality.
   Besides, such sentiment is also restricted to particular social groups
   of society, because hostile feelings toward political decisionmakers are
   stronger among citizens in the lower ranks of society and among younger
   birth cohorts. Since the beginning of the century and throughout the
   Great Recession, unfavorable attitudes toward politicians have not
   increased among the public in advanced democracies. However, our
   analysis indicates that respondents with such attitudes have
   increasingly turned toward voting for anti-elite parties to raise their
   voice and now make use of online options to express their political
   views more frequently than in the past. Overall, the analysis
   contributes to recent research on populist and reactionist dynamics in
   contemporary democracies by addressing dynamics and structures of the
   feeling of being left behind by political decisionmakers and its
   implications for political (in)activity.},

Abstract = {In Czech foreign policy debates, the topic of human rights plays a
   central role. However, the issue of the connection between arms exports
   and human rights violations goes unmentioned. The Czech Republic can
   achieve much more in this area than heap criticism rightly deserved on
   Russia or China. Arms exports are a blind spot in the human rights
   debate. This undermines the credibility of those who declare they have
   made human rights a guiding principle of their political actions and
   hinders those who are seeking to provide a clear definition of the
   public's interest in export controls.},

Abstract = {Women and young constitute two underrepresented groups in most
   legislatures worldwide. The aim of this paper is to theorize and
   empirically analyze how the hitherto overlooked intersection between
   gender and young age condition legislators' opportunities to carry out
   their representative tasks on equal grounds. Using original survey data
   from the Swedish Parliament (response rate 82\%, n = 287) in combination
   with 40 in-depth interviews with young male and female MPs, we ask
   whether being young in parliament have different implications for men
   and women legislators. We find that young women experience higher
   demands and anxiety, and are more subject to negative treatment compared
   to other groups. Young men, on the other hand, stand out as the least
   exposed group. Together our results demonstrate that a young age
   reinforces negative gendered patterns for women in parliament, while age
   appears irrelevant or even, at times, a beneficial factor for young men.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether geographic representation affects local voting
   behavior in closed-list proportional representation (PR) systems, where
   conventional theoretical wisdom suggests a limited role of localism in
   voter preferences. Using detailed data on Norwegian parliamentary
   candidates' hometowns, we show that parties engage in geographic
   balancing when constructing candidate lists. However, because most
   districts contain more municipalities than seats, not all municipalities
   will ultimately see a local candidate elected. A regression
   discontinuity design applied to marginal candidates reveals that parties
   obtain higher within-district support in subsequent elections in
   incumbents' hometowns - novel evidence of ``friends-and-neighbors{''}
   voting in an otherwise party-centered environment. Exploring the
   mechanisms, we find that represented municipalities often continue to
   have locally-connected candidates in top positions, in contrast to
   municipalities with losing candidates, and are more frequently
   referenced in legislative speeches. There is no evidence that unequal
   representation creates inequalities in distributive policies.},

Abstract = {The past, present and likely future of ``pandemic perspectives{''} are
   here briefly examined: as embedded in the contemporary structure of
   speculative-based production, unsustainable path-dependent dynamics
   augur a difficult future of enhanced ecological ruptures under the
   current regime of accumulation. This has hastened pandemic moments, now
   including COVID-19 in 2020. Of particular note is the striking case of
   the wallowing US beset by multiple ``market failures{''} all along its
   medical supply chain and an absence of state capacity. Such historic
   conjunctures have tested the apparatuses of social reproduction: they
   can force profound restructuring, altering the path of accumulation
   along with the underlying societal order. This was the case in Western
   Europe as the ravages of the Black Death (1346-1353) contributed to the
   destabilization feudalism. However, in its wake, the ``second
   serfdom{''} flourished in Eastern Europe. Here we analyze, in three
   linked sections, some aspects of the political economy of infectious
   disease.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},

Pages = {109-130},
Abstract = {This article reviews longstanding debates about the relationship between
   power over and power to - often posed as the tension between domination
   and emancipation. It then turns to several frameworks which integrate
   these approaches to inform strategies for social action. In particular,
   it focuses on recent empirical studies which apply one such framework,
   the `powercube', to glean insights into how social actors navigate
   across multiple forms, spaces and levels of power. In so doing, we gain
   clues into how relatively powerless groups develop the capacities for
   agency and action which challenge domination and in turn give new
   possibilities for emancipation.},

Abstract = {This article tries to carry out a critical analysis of the Grand
   Strategy of both the United States and China in the face of the
   reorientation of the centre of the global political economy to East Asia
   and the geopolitical rise of China. From a historical and global
   perspective, both the theoretical positions underlying the Grand
   Strategy of both powers and the empirical dynamics of the global
   political economy capable of modifying the course of geostrategic
   planning are analysed. To do this, first of all, a critique of the
   theoretical foundations with which the theories of international
   relations try to understand hegemonic disputes is made. Second, it
   analyses how the theoretical-political spectrum of the US Grand Strategy
   intends to face the challenge of China's rise. Third, China's foreign
   policy strategy is analysed to prevent its rise from generating a
   reaction in the power in relative decline. Finally, the three most
   widespread precepts in the literature on the hegemonic dispute are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The article explores the effect of the covid-19 epidemic on politics in
   Iran. It asks how people's organisation and transformative experiences
   can counter forces and phenomena such as the current epidemic. The
   article reflects upon the extant and emergent potentialities of the
   current situation, imagining trajectories from the presence to the
   coming life in the post-epidemic future. The article is organised in the
   following sections: firstly, it provides an overview of the unfolding
   epidemic crisis in Iran to familiarise readers with the existing
   conditions and structures, including the effect of geopolitical
   constraints such as US-led sanctions and domestic models of crisis
   management. It then looks at how crises and health crises in particular
   destabilise the framework of interaction between power and people, and
   how this can be remodelled through the technologies of trust (such as
   vaccines and medical practice) that become essential to the continuation
   of political and social life. Within this frame, the article analyses
   how the epidemic produced and continues to shape forms of social
   organisation and cultural praxis, which originate from the mobilisation
   of solidarity and mutual help networks. These include an array of
   categories that have the potential to set the ground for a new sense of
   community amidst impeding crisis, counterpoising the high-tech,
   authoritarian vision of grand solutions to the crisis with a low-tech
   mobilisation and human-centred vision. Finally, the objective is to
   inquire into the potentialities of a politics of solidarity and hope and
   its counter-values of demoralisation, fear and desperation. This is what
   the article elaborates as the `pedagogy of the virus', a cognitive and
   practical journey resulting from the concurrence of crises in
   health/politics, whereby ordinary people learn to (re)enact organisation
   and community to change everyday life amidst societal and political
   disruption.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive protection of minors is one of the priority areas of
   criminal law policy. The pre-trial investigation, and their
   interrogation as its part, occupies a special place in the process of
   protection of minors and restoration of their violated rights. The
   interrogation of minors is a special procedure with clearly defined
   requirements. The aim of the study was to identify gaps in the
   regulation of interrogation of minors and suggest ways to address them.
   The methods used: system approach; descriptive statistics; comparison
   and juxtaposition; descriptive analysis; pragmatic approach;
   prognostication. The tactics of interrogation of a minor victim of a
   crime are legally defined in the national criminal procedural
   legislation of the vast majority of countries. The principles, rules,
   main measures, and purpose of interrogation of this category of victims
   in the pre-trial investigation are enshrined in the provisions of
   international regulations. These rules are based on the principle of
   child-friendly justice. But the practical conduct of the interrogation
   has several gaps, so it is necessary to clarify the rules of
   international and national regulations on certain provisions.},

Abstract = {UAVs have been used by non-state actors in the past decade. However, no
   known attack by right-wing extremists has been carried out using them.
   Havard Haugstvedt reviews recent developments in attacks - through
   online activity in open forums and by examining groups that have already
   used UAVs in their operations - by such actors, to explore the
   possibility of right-wing extremists adopting UAVs. The article argues
   that right-wing extremist groups lack a strong entity, such as a state,
   backing their development and operations. However, terrorist groups
   learn from one another, and as extreme right-wing ideologies have gained
   currency among some members of the military and law enforcement
   agencies, the capability to develop and use UAVs may be more possible
   than that which has been revealed thus far. Nonetheless, this article
   casts doubt on right-wing extremists' capability and desire to
   incorporate UAVs into a violent repertoire that has historically been
   composed of fists, fires and firearms.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the German colonization process on the border
   between Colombia and Panama for the period 1886-1941. Following the
   hermeneutical method, various printed and handwritten sources dating
   from that period produced by various Government ministries were
   interpreted: the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the Ministry of War, the
   Ministry of Government, the Ministry of Foreign Business, the Ministry
   of Industries, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of
   Finance. It was found that, for the study period, the Colombian State
   promoted German colonization, whic became a threat for the so-called
   colossus of the North, or the United States. The world economy fueled
   imperial rivalry and colonization on the border between Colombia and
   Panama.},

Abstract = {The literature on conflict interventions in Nigeria's Niger Delta region
   have shown profound interest in Government attempts to prevent ethnic
   fragmentations and the proliferation of armed militia groups.
   Legislative structures have often generated the multi-track approaches
   adopted by government to mitigate the conflicts. Though significant, the
   results of these efforts have remained unclear. The article explores the
   role of legislation in designing paths to peace in fragile, ethnically
   divided communities. Specifically, the article examines the Delta
   Development Administration Committee Law 2004. The legislative plan to
   promote the development administration law was to enable the executive,
   with participatory governance assistance, to implement key strategies
   for conflict transformation and peacebuilding. The article concludes
   that, contrary to the fears that the establishment of exclusive ethnic
   Community Development Committees (CDC) is a dreadful anachronism that
   will increase the dangers of ethnic exclusivity and offensive actions,
   the CDC will in fact generate conflict transformation and peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has reconfigured personal, organisational and
   political landscapes in quite radical ways. This paper reflects on the
   differentiated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it. We
   unpack some of the effects of the crisis on populations already subject
   to harassment, persecution and deprivation due to their marginal
   position in society or their resistance to state power. We illuminate
   how the current crisis is much more than a health crisis; the ways it
   exacerbates already existing deprivations; and how it might reveal
   hitherto unrecognised opportunities through which to make the world a
   more, rather than less, just and equitable place. Focus is on the way
   the crisis calls forth amplified forms of repression and consonantly
   amplified forms of vulnerability as well as reconfigured spaces for the
   operation of civil society organisations. We forward one key
   proposition, namely that while securitised responses to the crisis
   reveal an inherent conservatism, civil society responses reveal an
   agility and a capacity to innovate. While the inherent conservatism of
   securitised responses gives cause for serious concern, there is some
   hope to be found in the potential for innovation of civil society
   organisations. The revelation of humankind's shared vulnerability that
   is a feature of the crisis may serve as a springboard for the
   propagation of progressive change if we keep in mind the fundamentally
   human, and thus relational, nature of human rights and anti-torture

Abstract = {The European Parliament's House of European History in Brussels, which
   opened in 2017, is the first museum in Europe devoted to telling the
   history of modern Europe. Based on a close reading of its permanent
   exhibition, non-participant observation, document analysis and
   interviews, this article explores and interprets the museum's
   master-narrative about the First World War, the totalitarian regimes and
   the Second World War and post-war European integration. It demonstrates
   how and why the museum blames nationalism as the root cause of conflict
   and war in Europe. With its strong focus on the similarities between
   National Socialism and Stalinism as regimes of oppression, moreover, it
   tells a story of Europeans as victims of abstract oppressive regimes.
   Paradoxically, the House of European History in this way employs the
   narrative tools of nationalism for overcoming nationalism.},

Abstract = {While the growing body of research on non-violent political movements
   centres on the idea that choosing non-violence tends to produce more
   favourable outcomes for dissidents, the question of why some non-violent
   campaigns still fail has not been sufficiently empirically investigated.
   Building on the extant research on the effects of group dynamics and
   certain external actors, we examine the role of the natural resource
   wealth of target states on the outcomes of non-violent campaigns. We
   hypothesize that the probability that a non-violent movement will fail
   increases as the target state's natural resource wealth increases. This
   natural resource wealth could serve to neutralize the potential for
   support from both domestic and external actors, thereby increasing the
   risk of failure. The results of our statistical analyses support our
   hypothesis and suggest that non-violent campaigns are more likely to
   fail in states with higher natural resource wealth, particularly that
   which stems from oil.},

Abstract = {The aim of the investigation was to determine the most appropriate
   avenues for further implementation of the European concept of
   anti-corruption. To carry out this article, general and special research
   methods have been applied, such as systems analysis, dialectical, formal
   logical and structural functional methods, as well as a series of
   empirical methods. Statistical analysis has been used to demonstrate
   anti-corruption measures, undertaken in 2016 - 2020. The anti-corruption
   mechanism has been analyzed through the prism of combined institutional
   and instrumental systems, with the aim of preventing corruption. The
   priorities for transforming the anti-corruption mechanism have been
   defined as follows: (a) increased accountability for corruption
   offences; (b) introduction and appropriate application of corruption
   detection tools. It is concluded that the current trend demonstrates a
   decline in the implementation of anti-corruption preventive tools in
   Ukraine due to the following factors: change of the vector of public
   interest towards compliance with anti-Covid-19 measures, destabilization
   of authority and lack of collaboration between authorized subjects in
   solving corruption problems.},

Abstract = {The specific research on the issue ``other{''} is not intensive
   currently of the present time. Usually more attention pay to conception
   enemy. The aim of the study is to point out that ``other does not always
   mean hostile. At the same time, one must bear in mind that the line
   between hostility and tolerance is not really clear enough. The author's
   intention is to clarify and document concepts such as ``other{''}, ``the
   enemy{''}, ``identity{''}, ``we{''}, ``they{''}, ``minority{''} or
   ``majority{''}. ``Other is perhaps the most neutral term for describing
   something unacceptable, as I attempt to prove in the current study.
   Their analysis involves some degree of comparison and interpretation.
   The questions raised in the study are also a subject of research of
   political philosophy, among other disciplines. Without the description,
   explanation, interpretation of texts, i.e., processes that are
   indispensable for understanding and comprehension, one cannot arrive at
   a satisfactory outcome. I have attempted to offer a holistic view on the
   problem under discussion while providing the context, for such research
   is inseparable from man and his actions, as emphasised e.g. by Leo
   Strauss. Addressing this topic clearly demonstrates that conflict is
   part of any human action, including political activity.},

Title = {Territorial cohesion and democracy in the EU},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Inequality not only has an economic and social dimension, but also a
   territorial dimension with relevant political implications. The clear
   regional differences in economic development and employment and
   therefore in quality of life and opportunities in the European Union
   (EU) make the social situation increasingly unequal in territorial
   terms. There seems to be a growing consensus that large and dynamic
   urban areas are the future, while rural areas are perceived as having
   low potential. In many EU Member States, populism as a political force
   seems to grow in these so-called ``places that don't matter{''}, in
   numbers which may create systemic risks. The strengthening of the
   economic, social and territorial cohesion is one of the Union's main
   objectives. Already the Treaty of Rome (1957) established mechanisms to
   foster the economic and social cohesion, but it was not until the Treaty
   of Lisbon that a third dimension, the territorial cohesion, was
   introduced. Taking advantage of the tenth anniversary of the entry into
   force of the Lisbon Treaty, the aim of this text is to analyse the
   concept and instruments of EU's territorial cohesion policy in order to
   study the challenges of this policy.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses pushback operations in Greece as a generalized
   anti-immigration policy that involves practices constituting racist
   state crime. Beginning from a description of the illegal operations on
   the Greek/Turkish borders, this paper examines the constant denial
   tactics of the government and the response of national, regional and
   international organizations and institutions. It is shown that pushbacks
   have become a standardized frontline tool of border management. This
   phenomenon is approached from a criminological viewpoint in terms of
   racist state crime and as a racist biopolitical technology of power for
   the government of the migrant populations, and for the defence of
   society and national identity. Showing that pushbacks are a becoming a
   central border policy in Europe, the paper concludes with a discussion
   of the need for both legal and non-legal counter-strategies.},

Abstract = {After changes in Czechoslovak political regime in autumn 1989 it could
   be expected that the new foreign and security policy would reflect in
   the sphere of military diplomacy. In the Czech Republic, it has
   traditionally come under the competence of the Military Intelligence as
   a strategic intelligence agency. Its territorial configuration
   necessarily reflects the information interest of the intelligence agency
   in selected territories and in existing and predicted threats. The paper
   researches whether priorities in the territorial arrangement of Czech
   military diplomacy have been able to reflect the change in the security
   situation in the past thirty years. The research shows that no
   fundamental changes were actually made in 1992-2005 and even the Czech
   Republic's accession to the EU and NATO did not lead to immediate
   territorial transformation of Czech military diplomacy. The period from
   2005 until present is characterized by the fact that information
   interests are the decisive motive for changes in the territorial
   configuration of Czech military diplomatic offices.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {16-37},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in the so-called anti-gender
   campaigns across Europe and Latin America. The main aim of these
   campaigns is to oppose ``gender ideology{''}, or what is perceived as an
   unnatural subversion of traditional and acceptable gender norms, roles,
   and relations. The anti-gender campaigns were quickly deemed an
   international movement by scholars, specifically prevalent in Eastern
   and Central Europe. However, a lack of empirical case studies of the
   situation in each Eastern and Central European country and a tendency to
   overgeneralize make such claims debatable. This paper set out to answer
   the question of whether the anti-gender narratives had become salient in
   Lithuania-specifically, in the context of ratifying the Council of
   Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and
   domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention-based on a
   comprehensive analysis of the Lithuanian online news media articles on
   the topic. The paper argues that the signing of the Convention acted as
   a mobilizing force for the topic of gender ideology to enter the
   Lithuanian mainstream media. Although the subject matter seems to have
   gained public traction as evident through the organization of rallies
   against the Convention in Lithuania, the mainstream media has not played
   a significant role in escalating the anti-gender narratives.},

   holds, and the details of an act of embezzlement affect citizens'
   perceptions of corruption severity and willingness to punish. I find
   that the revenue source of stolen funds and the sector to which the
   funds had been allocated have the largest impact on perceived severity,
   followed by whether stolen funds are spent privately or recirculated
   through patronage or clientelism. The position the corrupt official
   holds has a smaller impact on severity, including whether the official
   was elected and whether he was a central or local official.},

Abstract = {Little attention has been paid to the analysis of individualism and
   libertarianism in student and feminist movements. This paper aims to
   highlight these subjects, by analysing differences and similarities
   between student protest and the women's liberation movement with respect
   to their attitude towards society. To do this, we will study Noi donne
   (a pivotal magazine for the traditional Italian feminist movement) and
   the neo-feminist movement's magazines Effe and Sottosopra, both of which
   were founded in 1973, but are characterised by a different ideological
   structure. This analysis reveals a shared vision of progress and how to
   achieve it: both movements assumed that progress could be achieved not
   by society and its oppressive structures, but by efforts made by
   individuals. Only if people learnt to free their true selves, overcoming
   prejudices and influences, could they liberate themselves from an
   oppressive and unfair society.},

Abstract = {While elite polarization in US politics has been well established, there
   has been substantial debate about whether US mass opinion has polarized
   in recent decades. Amnon Cavari and Guy Freedman suggest the apparent
   polarization of the US public may in part be an artifact of declining
   survey response rates. Cavari and Freedman argue that declining response
   rates may have led to only the most politicized-and therefore
   polarized-respondents being willing to give their opinions. We argue
   that, while the mechanism posited is plausible, other theoretical models
   of nonresponse predict no change in nonresponse bias or even declining
   nonresponse bias, depending on the cause of increased nonresponse. We
   show that the results of Cavari and Freedman's analysis are spuriously
   driven by each variable's correlation with time. After accounting for
   the time correlation, there is no evidence that nonresponse bias has
   inflated estimates of mass polarization.},

Title = {The Syrian conflict in Spanish press: An analysis of the securitization
   of war},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to provide a consistent knowledge
   base on the possible media securitization process of the Spanish press
   when reporting on the Syrian conflict. To this end, an automated
   analysis has been carried out, through the SVM supervised algorithm,
   with the aim of measuring the use of human drama and security frames
   during the period 2011-2020. The starting assumptions are that the
   Spanish press mostly uses the security frame when reporting on the
   Syrian conflict and that there are no significant differences in the use
   of frames between the different media. The results show that both
   hypotheses have been validated as all media use similar language with a
   broad predominance of security frame. Similarly, text mining suggests
   that the Spanish press has focused its attention on the international
   aspect of the conflict having difficulty identifying other internal
   actors. In short, the research aims to analyze globally the news
   concerning one of the most serious humanitarian crisis in the present
   millennium.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the determinants of both total migration and asylum
   migration to Germany. For the analysis, a comprehensive empirical model
   is set up that includes climate change, economic opportunities, such as
   per capita income differentials, links to Germany, home country
   characteristics (population growth, poverty, consumer confidence,
   unemployment), the political and institutional situation in the sending
   countries (measured by internal and external conflict, ethnic and
   religious tensions, government stability, law and order, military in
   politics), and a control for migration opportunities to alternative
   destinations. Panel data techniques (Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood)
   for the estimation of the parameters of interest are employed using a
   panel of 115 (134) origin countries for asylum migration (total
   migration) over the period of 1996-2017 or 2001-2017, depending on data
   availability. The analysis reveals that political, socioeconomic, and
   economic factors determine both total migration and asylum migration.
   Economic factors are also determinants of asylum applications, as asylum
   seekers most often come for several reasons. Poverty plays a distinct
   role in total migration and asylum migration. An alleviation of poverty
   in origin countries is associated with less overall migration to Germany
   but with more asylum migration. Increases in average temperature also
   impact asylum migration in the expected direction, thus, increasing
   forced migration. The most interesting findings are revealed when
   considering country groupings (main migration countries, major asylum
   countries, countries whose asylum applicants enjoy high, intermediate,
   or low recognition rates).},

Abstract = {Since the creation of Israel in 1948 its strategies of suppressing
   Palestinian resistance reveal a conscious scheme of slow elimination of
   the natives. What concerns us in this article is that, in light of all
   Israel's intentional violence, episodes of Palestinian non-violence do
   not capture and sustain the world's attention in the way that violent
   acts do. In order to fill this gap, and conceptually, we draw upon the
   rich works of Puar and de Sousa Santos, as well as others, to show how
   Gazans' heterogeneous ontologies and experiences with Israel's settler
   colonialism have, over the years, shaped a multiplicity of strategies
   for resistance. Empirically, we draw upon ethnographic observations and
   interviews conducted with Gazan Great March of Return (GRM) protesters
   to analyze their strategies of non-violence. We conclude that, in spite
   of the lack of sustained focus by academics and the media (in general)
   on the embedded resilience of Palestinians to Israel's settler colonial
   regime, and in spite of Israel's targeting of resistance itself,
   Palestinians' resolve remains as alive as ever in pursuit of their right
   to have rights. Our analysis in turn has implications for how the media
   and the academy interpolate and write about non-violence.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the studied problem is determined by the need to
   constantly improve the system of social protection of veterans in
   changing socio-cultural conditions to make it more consistent with the
   tasks and priorities of social and demographic policy and modern social
   threats and risks. The objective of the article is to study the Russian
   experience of social protection of war veterans and to develop practical
   recommendations for its improvement by updating the model of social
   protection of veterans to improve their social well-being and health.
   Research methods: systemic (integrative) method, assuming the need to
   analyze social, economic, legal, and other measures to support veterans
   and the elderly; expert survey; modelling. As a result of the study, the
   authors draw conclusions and offer recommendations on the improvement
   and implementation of the model of social protection of war veterans to
   improve their social well-being and health. The practical significance
   of the conducted study lies in the possibility of using the developed
   recommendations in the sphere of social policy and social work with
   veterans and the elderly, social gerontology, and practical activities
   of social protection institutions for senior citizens.},

Pages = {475-482},
Abstract = {The idea of including a right of secession in democratic constitutions
   has been discussed by different political and legal theorists; however,
   little has been said on the matter from the point of view of
   democratic-republican political philosophy. This article undertakes this
   effort by means of a normative analysis of Quebec's constitutional right
   of secession, as outlined in the Quebec Secession Reference. This
   analysis shows how the non-unilateral nature of this right minimises the
   risks for republican freedom (as non-domination) and inclusion in the
   Quebec secession conflict, while the fact that it is limited to a
   national constitutional framework dampens this achievement.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to assess development of entrepreneurship
   infrastructure of various countries according to opinions of experts
   from these countries. The elements were: knowledge and technology
   transfer infrastructure; commercial and professional infrastructure;
   production and information infrastructure; market infrastructure;
   institutions providing easy access to existing markets; social and
   cultural infrastructure. The research is based on methods of economic
   analysis, analogies, generalizations, classification, system and
   structural approaches. Information from the Global entrepreneurship
   monitoring project report for 54 countries was used as input data. The
   estimation of the distribution of indicator values on the effectiveness
   of the six main infrastructure elements of business development
   reflecting the opinions of experts from these countries with the use of
   mathematic models of normal distribution. During the study we determined
   the average indicator values characterizing experts `opinions on the
   effectiveness of each of the six key infrastructure elements of business
   development on a scale of ten; the intervals of their changes
   characteristic for the majority of countries were also considered. New
   knowledge about the effectiveness of infrastructure elements of business

Abstract = {Over the last ten years, scholars have rediscovered the relevance of
   council democracy and workers' councils for democratic thought. While
   these interventions are important, the literature lacks a coherent
   reconstruction of the development of council democracy in modern
   political thought. This article fills that lacuna by distinguishing
   between three conceptions of council democracy. One conception,
   advocated by Vladimir Lenin, interprets the councils as revolutionary
   organs able to destroy the old regime, but unable to govern afterwards.
   Another conception, favored by the interwar council communists, stresses
   the ability of workers' councils to democratize the workplace, providing
   the germs of economic democracy. The third, delivered by Cornelius
   Castoriadis and Hannah Arendt, emphasizes the radical democratic nature
   of workers' councils as an alternative to representative democracy. We
   argue that these three conceptions, notwithstanding their fundamental
   differences, share several core principles that can guide contemporary
   scholars to theorize the council as part of radical democratic
   repertoires. Moreover, we show the importance of these principles of
   council democracy for the constituent ambitions of contemporary
   movements like Occupy.},

Abstract = {This article presents a definitional structure for the notion of `proxy
   war' organised around three components: (1) a material-constitutive
   feature, (2) a processual feature and (3) a relational feature. First,
   the article evaluates the multiple usages of the term of `proxy war' in
   light of its contested character. Second, it proposes a way of making
   sense of the literature's conceptual turmoil by analysing the different
   attempts at defining the notion. To this end, it adds an important link
   to the methodology of concept analysis, namely the `semantic field',
   which it re-introduces as a heuristic to identify `military
   intervention' as a root concept for defining proxy wars. The article
   does so by identifying a type of semantic relationship between `proxy
   war' and `military intervention', namely sub-type inclusion.},

Abstract = {Contact tracing apps have thrived during the pandemic crisis. The need
   has led to unbalanced decisions that should be soon improved. In this
   paper, we shed light on the pros and cons of these apps, concretely the
   risks of apps like RadarCovid for data protection and privacy. We
   suggest lawmakers should settle a governance process of the
   infrastructure beneath the apps. Even though the medical interface
   should comply with data protection by design, the private platforms of
   Exposure Notification of Google and Apple (GAEN) do not provide
   equivalent safeguards. Moreover, the lack of efficiency of the apps,
   considering these risks, is relevant for the constitutional
   proportionality of the measure.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The well-being of Mexicans has gradually improved over the past five
   years, but inequalities remain high and many families remain in poverty,
   despite recent reform proposals around the Mexican welfare state. We
   analyze, based on three theoretical models, the tax public opinion of
   Mexicans to know the level of social legitimation of their tax system.
   Our analyses demonstrate a high resistance to their tax responsibilities
   and with regard to the public supply of public services,
   non-assimilation of tax rules and a tax deal that does not meet the
   expected characteristics play an important role.},

Abstract = {A state's coercive apparatus can be strong in some ways and weak in
   others. Using interview data from security personnel in China, this
   study expands current conceptualizations of authoritarian durability and
   coercive capacity to consider a wide range of security activities. While
   protest response in China is centrally controlled and strong, other
   types of crime control are decentralized and systematically inadequate
   in ways that compromise the state's coercive power and may ultimately
   feed back into protest. Considering security activities beyond protest
   control exposes cracks in China's authoritarian system of control-an
   area where it is typically perceived to thrive-and calls into question
   our understanding of regime resilience as well as our current approach
   to assessing the role coercive capacity plays in authoritarian
   resilience elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Tremendous efforts of legislators are directed towards the development
   of an ideal judicial system and procedure of administering justice.
   However, current trends of judiciary reformation are easier to
   comprehend and accept if we turn to the origins of legal protection of
   human rights which, undoubtedly, go back to the Roman law. Methodology:
   From this point we use comparing methods for analizing the legislative
   provisions; the structural method and historical method was used for the
   background of Legal procedure in roman law. Results and conclusions: In
   this article we will outline the main stages of formation of legal
   protection of human rights in Roman law and characterize types of these
   processes - namely legis actiones, formulary procedure and cognitio. By
   analyzing the original sources that have survived to our times, namely
   the Law of Twelve Tables, Gaius ` s Institutions and Justinian ` s
   Digestes, we will examine what peculiarities of consideration and
   resolution of cases each of these stages demonstrated; how the
   traditional views on the behavior of the parties and the court in the
   process were established; which main requirements were applied to
   justice in civil matters in Roman law. In the course of the work the
   following methods were used: essential, comparative, general historical.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify objectives and measures for
   expansion of the system of standards in Ukraine for the development of
   armaments and military equipment in the context of improving national
   defence capabilities. The following methods were used to achieve the aim
   set in the study: the method of direct observation, comparison,
   monitoring and analysis of the content of documents that provide
   standardisation of armaments and military equipment at the state and
   interstate levels. The key results of the study were: observation and
   comparison of the scope of regulations that ensure the standardisation
   of armaments and military equipment at the national level, as well as
   among NATO countries; comparison and distribution of powers of the
   competence of executive and supervisory bodies for the development and
   implementation of standards. Besides, the study provides a chart of the
   legal background for standardisation, and directly determines the
   sequential logical place of the stage of development of armaments and
   military equipment in the life cycle. Proposals are made at the end of
   the study on how to increase the effectiveness of legislative provision
   for the standardisation of armaments and military equipment.},

Abstract = {The Putin regime is expanding its power, suppressing opposition and
   society's autonomy. The situation is reminiscent of earlier eras. Andrei
   Sakharov and Alexei Naval'nyi, their reference to law, yesterday's
   Chronicle of Current Events, and today's social media with its
   documentary power are parallels. It seems that Russia's historical
   development is caught in a cycle. Society's considerable creativity and
   mobilizing power faces the leadership's equally remarkable destructive
   potential. Power triumphs at the expense of society.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that Marxism is inherently transhumanist because
   it entails a drive to de-reify nature, including the human being. I
   argue that the logic of Marxism also requires the temporal inversion of
   historical materialism, and its projection into the future. This is the
   transhumanism of Marxism. It is predominantly latent today. Marxists
   have largely been reluctant to conduct the temporal inversion of their
   historical materialist perspective, and in doing so have accepted an
   arbitrarily reified notion of the human. Transhumanists have not. I link
   Marxism and transhumanism through an ontological concept of suffering.
   Suffering encapsulates the materialist ontological relation between
   nature and the human. By tracing how suffering is articulated in both
   Marxism and transhumanism, I argue that we can get an idea of how to
   fully work out Marxism's temporal inversion and revive its latent
   transhumanism.},

Abstract = {Y The aim of this study is a comprehensive analysis of legal mechanisms
   to protect the rights of participants in contractual and non-contractual
   relations based on the experience of foreign countries, namely:
   Australia, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, Germany, Portugal, Turkey, France, and
   Switzerland. This research involved the following methods: sociological
   analysis, system-structural and comparative methods, logical-semantic
   and formal-logical methods, as well as the dialectical method. Our study
   resulted in identification of the main characteristics and features of
   legal mechanisms to protect the rights of participants in contractual
   and non-contractual relations of each of the studied countries. As a
   result, we drew conclusions about the need to update the regulatory
   framework of most of the said countries. The further use of mechanisms
   for legal protection of the rights of participants in contractual and
   non-contractual relations will help ensure their real and effective
   protection.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of diasporas is becoming an increasingly resonant topic
   in political sciences. With states becomig more porous transnationalism
   is said to influence domestic and foreign policy development of their
   respective ``motherlands{''}, also known as ``mother countries{''} or
   ``homelands{''}. The objective of this study is to characterize the role
   of the Armenian diaspora in the process of building Armenia as an
   independent state. The paper seeks to answer the question concerning the
   nature and the role of the Armenian diaspora in the formation of
   independent Armenia. The key argument this article wishes to make is
   that understanding of state building process of modern Armenia after
   gaining the indepedence needs to feature insights into both the armenian
   state and its sizeable and powerful diaspora. As such, the study sheds
   light on the relationship between the diaspora and the motherland within
   political, social and economic fields. The result is an innovated view
   of the issue of diasporas based on the prism of instrumentalization of
   the host countries. An alternative approach to examining the
   relationship between the diaspora and its motherlands is ethnographic
   research, based on primary data and the use of sociopsychological and
   constructivist literature, concerned with maintaining collective
   identity under the pressure of transnationalism. The potential
   application of the analysis of the relationship between the diaspora and
   the state as a composite system can be applied to the Jewish and Greek
   diasporas.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether (and how) parties adapt to party system
   saturation (PSS). A party system is oversaturated when a higher
   effective number of parties contests elections than predicted. Previous
   research has shown that parties are more likely to exit when party
   systems are oversaturated. This article examines whether parties will
   adapt by increasing the nicheness of their policy platform, by forming
   electoral alliances or by merging. Based on time-series analyses of 522
   parties contesting 357 elections in twenty-one established Western
   democracies between 1945 and 2011, the study finds that parties are more
   likely to enter - and less likely to leave - electoral alliances if PSS
   increases. Additionally, a small share of older parties will merge. The
   results highlight parties' limited capacity to adapt to their
   environments, which has important implications for the literature on
   party (system) change and models of electoral competition.},

Abstract = {The global use of crypto assets is a widespread practice in 2021 among
   people and companies that are interested in participating in new forms
   of business that could be very lucrative in the medium term, in addition
   to representing a new monetary conception of a digital nature that is
   not controlled by any central bank, nor issued by any state. The purpose
   of this short essay is to present volume 39, number 71 of Political
   Issues, by developing a set of reflections on the scope and meaning of
   cryptocurrencies in today's world. It is concluded that, the mere idea
   of minting a currency in digital format of the fictitious subject
   Satoshi Nakamoto creator of Bitcoins, is avant-garde for all people who
   want to carry out exchanges of values without any centralized mediation
   of private or public financial institutions, through an open access
   anomie network made up of free and equal subjects, that can death rate
   the monetary control of economies by governments, while creating
   alternatives for Fiat currencies. Among the negative aspects are the
   growing use of energetic electricity that cryptos require to be able to
   develop their operations.Y},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {421-442},
Abstract = {In recent years, the world has seen a rising backlash against
   globalization. This article reviews the nature, causes, and consequences
   of the globalization backlash. It shows that, contrary to a popular
   narrative, the backlash is not associated with a large swing in public
   opinion against globalization but is rather a result of its
   politicization. The increasing influence of globalization-skeptic actors
   has resulted in more protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist
   policies, some of which fundamentally threaten pillars of the
   contemporary international order. Both material and nonmaterial causes
   drive the globalization backlash, and these causes interact and mediate
   each other. The consequences are shaped by the responses of societal
   actors, national governments, and international policy makers. These
   responses can either yield to and reinforce the global backlash or push
   back against it. Understanding these dynamics will be an important task
   for future research.},

Abstract = {A famous proponent of solitude and self-reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson
   rejected the conformity of Jacksonian mobs and mass parties for solitary
   nature walks, and so has long been read as an antipolitical figure.
   Recent scholars have reinterpreted Emersonian self-reliance to include
   extralegal boycotts of slave-made goods and resistance to the Fugitive
   Slave Act. This essay takes these accounts a step further, arguing that
   Emerson saw that some forms of extralegal cooperative action were
   compatible with self-reliance. Specifically, self-reliance requires
   contemplating and then acting on personal moral rules. As Northern
   crowds rallied to rescue and harbor fugitive slaves, Emerson saw that
   joining an abolitionist crowd allowed unconventional debate and
   intellectual self-reliance and created a space to act on one's personal
   principles, encouraging active self-reliance. Union enlistment similarly
   let free Blacks and antislavery Northerners enact their principles and
   achieve a measure of self-reliance. Paradoxically, self-reliance can
   sometimes be achieved through common action.},

Abstract = {The interactions between culture, individual economic behavior, and the
   economic development of societies, and the processes of economic ideas
   spreading among countries, have long been neglected by mainstream
   economics. In recent years, such considerations have started to gain
   importance in the economics literature. This study will first address
   this emerging body of literature and its relation to the fundamental
   subject matter of economics: Why do some countries succeed in economic
   development while others fail? Second, it will review the works of
   Professor Ahmet Guner Sayar to understand how the above issues are
   reflected in the evolution of Ottoman-Turkish society. Examining some of
   the theses in Professor Sayar's works and their origins reveals the
   Ulgener-Sayar Approach to the study of Turkish economic and cultural
   history and its methodological foundations.},

Abstract = {This article scrutinizes relations between economic diplomacy and Free
   Trade Agreements (FTAs) by focusing on the Turkey-UK free trade
   agreements which came into force in 2021. Accordingly, the article first
   introduces the concept of economic diplomacy, an important issue as it
   has been shown that bilateral trade agreements, nowadays preferred by
   many countries, can be used as a tool of economic diplomacy. The article
   then discusses the history and development of free trade agreements
   signed by Turkey, including its long-running experience of economic
   integration with the European Union. Although Turkey began establishing
   free trade agreements in the 1990s, it has been concentrating on and
   accelerating its use since 2000. Based on economic and political reasons
   underlying the free economic agreements, the reasons why Turkey and the
   UK have reached such an agreement are summarized. Economic relations
   between the two countries are then analyzed and the details of the
   agreement are investigated in the context of the changes that it
   provides.},

Abstract = {The scientific article, based on the provisions of the theory of
   criminal procedure, criminology, psychology, reveals the problems of
   obtaining the testimony of a minor during the pre-trial investigation
   according to the laws of Ukraine. It is noted that the method of
   obtaining testimony should be based on the age and procedural status of
   the minor, which requires a special approach considering the vulnerable
   state, social immaturity, and the risk of violation of the rights and
   freedoms of such persons. The study used general scientific methods to
   determine certain legal categories that characterize the interrogation
   procedure of a minor, as well as special methods. The practice of
   introducing ``green rooms{''} in the field of criminal justice is
   recognized as promising, as the child's environment during relevant
   procedural actions is extremely important for establishing contact with
   the child. It is concluded that the lack of desirability of classifying
   a minor suspect as a subject for questioning in court during a pre-trial
   investigation is justified, as it would be contrary to the requirements
   of the law on the immediacy of the examination of evidence in court.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {228-239},
Abstract = {The Lega Nord (LN) has undergone a profound process of transformation
   since 2013, by replacing its historical regionalist populism with a new
   state-wide populist radical right outlook. However, very little is known
   about how such transformation impacted its organizational model,
   particularly the mass-party features that characterized it under its
   founding leader, Umberto Bossi. This article explores the organizational
   evolution of the party under Matteo Salvini by means of a qualitative
   in-depth analysis of 41 semi-structured interviews with representatives
   of the LN from four regions (Calabria, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and
   Veneto) and primary documents. It underlines that the LN was turned into
   a disempowered and politically inactive ``bad company,{''} charged with
   the task of paying the debts of the old party, while its structure,
   resources, and personnel were poured into a new state-wide organization
   called Lega per Salvini Premier (LSP). The LSP has not simply maintained
   the key features of the mass-party in the LN's historical strongholds,
   but also pioneered a modern form of this organizational model grounded
   on the continuous interaction between digital and physical activism,
   i.e., ``phygital activism,{''} which boosts the party's ability to reach
   out to the electorate by delivering the image that the League is
   constantly on the ground. The LSP has sought to export this modern
   interpretation of the mass-party in the South; however, in that area its
   organizational development remains at an embryonic stage, and the
   party's nationalization strategy has so far produced a
   ``quasi-colonial{''} structure dominated by, and dependent on, the
   Northern elite.},

Abstract = {The active learning literature has greatly expanded over the past few
   years. This article investigates the utility of employing concept map
   activities in a medium-sized class, and whether or not it improves
   students' learning and retention of material. We find that concept
   mapping activities significantly enhance students' mastery and
   recollection of class material. The size of the effect is considerably
   greater in our treatment group, relative to our control group. We
   discuss the advantages of this specific active learning technique, and
   offer suggestions for its incorporation into different institutional
   settings.},

Abstract = {Border politics are a salient component of high international politics.
   States are increasingly building infrastructure to `'secure'' their
   borders. We introduce the concept of border orientation to describe the
   extent to which the state is committed to the spatial display of
   capacities to control the terms of penetration of its national borders.
   Border orientation provides a lens through which to analyze resistance
   to globalization, growing populism, and the consequences of intensified
   border politics. We measure border orientation using novel, geospatial
   data on the built environment along the world's borders and theorize
   that real and perceived pressures of globalization have resulted in more
   controlling forms of border governance. Empirical evidence supports this
   claim: States build more along their borders when faced with economic,
   cultural, and security-based anxieties. Border orientation enhances the
   study of border politics, complementing the politics of territorial
   division with a richer politics of liminal securitization and its
   consequences.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades there have been periodic calls for improved
   teacher training and a growth in scholarship on teaching and learning.
   Yet, we know little about opportunities and participation in training
   programs. What kinds of training are political scientists collectively
   engaging in, especially for tenured and tenure track faculty? Are
   political science departments providing training programs for both
   faculty and graduate students? With the cooperation of the American
   Political Science Association, we included five questions about
   pedagogical training in a survey of Teaching and Learning Conference
   participants and in a survey of APSA members in 2018. We find that there
   is interest in different kinds of training experiences, but most of the
   training takes place outside the department. Within departments, there
   may be resource and culture-related obstacles to offerings and
   participation. Results indicate a need for more resources and
   career-related incentives in order to encourage participation in these
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {This essay outlines a set of mini-games designed to more effectively
   allow political science instructors, particularly in International
   Relations, teach basic principles and concepts associated with digital
   insecurity and cyber conflict. This topic, increasingly significant in
   IR syllabi in recent years, is in many cases considered with trepidation
   or uncertainty about the significance of different subjects within that
   might be covered. As a result, instructors often fall back on discussion
   of paradigm examples and fail to teach the underlying principles of
   function and logical design that give students insight into the security
   dynamics of the digital domain. Without such instruction, students in
   political science are less likely to act on interest in digital issues
   or science, technology and society topics more broadly. The games
   suggested herein are resources aimed at easing the challenge of
   providing such instruction and are accompanied by elaboration on student
   responses from three years of their use. These mini-games are extremely
   successful and, more importantly, simple and versatile enough that their
   incorporation in both introductory and intermediate IR syllabi is easy.},

Abstract = {A voluminous literature documents that citizens' perceptions of
   democracy are shaped by electoral victories and defeats, but what
   reasoning do citizens use to evaluate parties as winners or losers?
   Drawing on research on partisan-motivated reasoning, I propose an
   own-party bias in winner-loser evaluations according to which voters
   evaluate the electoral fate of their party more favourably than that of
   other parties. Data gathered in the aftermath of the Danish
   parliamentary election in 2015 support this expectation. Citizens are
   more inclined to interpret the election outcome as successful for their
   preferred party, regardless of the actual election result. This is more
   pronounced the stronger their partisan attachment and among the less
   politically knowledgeable, who also assign less importance to objective
   indicators of electoral success. The findings have implications for our
   understanding of electoral winners and losers and of how electoral
   results shape party support and polarization.},

Abstract = {Despite theoretical arguments suggesting the strong effects of
   presidential term limits and re-election on democracy, there is
   surprisingly little empirical evidence to evaluate them. We test both
   the effect on democracy of the existence of a consecutive re-election
   rule and of reforms introducing it for incumbent presidents. Using
   evidence from Latin American countries between 1945 and 2018, we test
   their relationship to both vertical and horizontal accountability. A
   synthetic control method is employed to account for the effect of
   term-limit reforms, and time-series cross-section models for modelling
   the association with the re-election rule. Both vertical and horizontal
   accountability as well as the quality of democracy are eroded by
   term-limit evasion reforms in most countries and strengthened in none
   between 1990 and 2018. Allowing presidents to run for re-election -
   relative to term-limited ones - is consistently associated with weak
   democratic outcomes.},

Abstract = {The United States' long-standing broad ``catch-all{''} political parties
   have historically combined voters from distinct regions of the country,
   each including both rural and urban dwellers. Since the late 1990s,
   however, rural Americans nationwide have increasingly supported the
   Republican Party, while urbanites have persisted in their allegiance to
   the Democratic Party. The growing rural-urban divide has become mapped
   onto American polarization in ways that are fostering tribalism. This
   place-based cleavage is now contributing to the transformation of the
   nation's politics and that of many states. It also threatens to have
   deleterious effects on democracy.},

Abstract = {In Brazil and Mexico, presidents failed to take swift, national action
   to stop the spread of COVID-19. Instead, the burden of imposing and
   enforcing public health measures has largely fallen to subnational
   leaders, resulting in varied approaches within each country and
   conflicting messaging from elites. We likewise see variation in
   compliance with social distancing across subnational units. To explain
   this variation, we contend that citizen responses are driven both by the
   comprehensiveness of state policies and whether they take cues from
   national or subnational elites. We hypothesize that support for national
   and subnational elites, and the nature of the state-level policy
   response, affect citizen compliance with public health guidelines. In
   both countries, we find that support for the governor has an interactive
   relationship with policy response. In Brazil, support for the president
   is associated with lower compliance. In Mexico, this effect is not
   present. We argue that these distinct relationships are due to the
   different cues emerging from each leader.},

Abstract = {Tocqueville has been portrayed as a ``strange liberal{''} for his
   singular defenses of individual liberty. This essay highlights an
   overlooked instance of Tocqueville's distinctiveness by analyzing his
   thoughts on suffrage, which placed him at odds with his French liberal
   contemporaries. It uncovers Tocqueville's attitude toward universal
   suffrage in America and his critiques of a capacitarian suffrage in
   France. I argue that Tocqueville articulated his hope not for a ``more
   democratic, but for a more moral{''} electoral law during most of the
   July Monarchy, aiming to transcend existing debates over the extent of
   the electorate or the capacite politique of the individual elector. By
   arguing for Tocqueville's singularity on the suffrage, this essay brings
   to light both his departures from the thought of the liberal
   Doctrinaires and his reflections on the particular character of
   democracy in France.},

Abstract = {The Complete Works of Tocqueville, inaugurated in 1952 with the
   publication of The Democracy in America by Editions Gallimard, reached
   its completion in June 2021 with the publication of volume XVII,
   Correspondence to Others, in three volumes. The article traces the
   history of the publication from its inception, outlines the editorial
   choices and historical contributions of the collection, and examines
   what the recently published volume teaches us about Tocqueville's
   personality, his political commitments, and his analyses of democracy
   and the Ancient Regime.},

   Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the initial months of
   COVID-19, with the aim of characterizing and comparing discursive
   strategies as well as exploring what factors explain the different
   approaches. Our conclusion is that the differences are due both as much
   to ideological factors as to contextual factors and the availability of

Abstract = {In May 2019, regional elections were held in Greece, simultaneously with
   municipal and European elections. The regional elections were placed
   right at the end of the national electoral cycle and national elections
   were planned to be held four months later. In general, the institutional
   and structural setting was favouring a nationalized, second-order
   character of the 2019 regional elections. Nevertheless, most of the
   patterns identified in the election outcomes point towards
   regionalization rather than nationalization. Hence, the 2019 regional
   elections in Greece were both regionalized and nationalized.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic crisis has confirmed neoliberal capitalism's
   inability to meet critical social needs. In the United Kingdom, mutual
   aid initiatives based on `solidarity not charity' blossomed in a context
   of state incompetence and private sector negligence - including Scrub
   Hub, a network of groups that autonomously produced personal protective
   equipment and provided it directly to health workers. Using a
   convergence of autonomist and anarchist perspectives, this article
   examines Scrub Hub as an example of emergent autonomous political
   economies and considers the challenges of resisting co-optation into
   volunteerist hierarchies and suppression by the neoliberal state.},

Title = {Free market capitalism and societal inequities: assessing the effects of
   economic freedom on income inequality and the equity of access to
   opportunity, 1990-2017},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 15},
Abstract = {Some blame free-market capitalism for increasing income inequality,
   arguing that richer classes could block access to others for maintaining
   their privileges. By manipulating the degree of political rights and
   resources available to others, the rich could reduce opportunities for
   others. Others argue that growth-promoting free markets raise all
   incomes, increasing aggregate welfare. We argue that governments more
   dependent on free markets are likely to focus on increasing access to
   human capital, thereby narrowing the gap between the rich and poor by
   increasing opportunities, even if income inequality rises with high
   growth. We assess the issue by examining the effects of an Index of
   Economic Freedom on income inequality measured by the standardized GINI
   and measures of the equity of access to quality schooling, health, and
   justice covering 128 developing countries during the 1990-2017 period.
   Our results show that, even if economic freedom is associated with
   higher income inequality, it also associates robustly with access to
   opportunity. Our results are robust to alternative models, sample size,
   and testing methods, including instrumental variables analyzes
   addressing potential endogeneity bias. Our results, taken together, do
   not suggest that growth-promoting economic freedoms hamper future
   progress by raising inequalities-on the contrary, economic freedoms
   promote equity of access to opportunities-findings inconsistent with the
   view that governments under free-market conditions are easily captured
   by the wealthy, who then block equitable access to public goods.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, society has witnessed the flourishing of
   artistic practices with socio-political aims, including street art.
   Street art created without permission has become one of the most
   persistent ways of protesting the usurpation of rights in the public
   space. However, current discussions about civil society and political
   participation tend to underestimate its political role.
   Street art has grown in popularity to a point where a legal form of the
   practice has also emerged. Using the Israeli street art scene as a case
   study, this article examines how street art has turned into an active
   intervention in public space and has transformed into a form of
   political participation that has the potential of reinforcing itself.
   The author contends that the inclusion of street art practices in the
   theoretical framework of civil society will enhance our understanding of
   contemporary political participation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we theorize the democratic aspect of democratic socialism
   through some of its recent, theoretical articulations and several of its
   historical, fugitive appearances. To illustrate a potential democratic
   turn, we highlight how these moments reflect a paradox of democratic
   spirit: the necessity of cultivating collective consciousness of popular
   power, while also acknowledging the limits of this power through a
   lingering attachment to the liberal democratic state as the means of
   achieving or supporting a democratic socialist vision. We call this
   democratic mirroring, which exceeds a concept of representation centered
   on the constitutional state. Although the state should be an important
   site of struggle, we maintain the spirit of democratic socialism is
   animated by quotidian struggles for a decent existence and those
   struggles must be mirrored in a way that supports the political
   education, political psychology, and the political self-respect of the
   ``demos{''} implied within democratic socialism.},

Abstract = {Is the public backlash against human rights rulings from European courts
   driven by substantive concerns over case outcomes, procedural concerns
   over sovereignty, or combinations thereof? We conducted preregistered
   survey experiments in Denmark, France, Poland, Spain, and the United
   Kingdom using three vignettes: a foreigner who faces extradition, a
   person fighting a fine for burning Qurans, and a home owner contesting
   eviction. Each vignette varies with respect to whether a European court
   disagrees with a national court (deference treatment) and whether an
   applicant wins a case (outcome treatment). We find little evidence that
   deference moves willingness to implement judgments or acceptance of
   court authority but ample evidence that case outcomes matter. Even
   nationalists and authoritarians are unmoved by European court decisions
   as long as they agree with the case outcome. These findings imply that
   nationalist opposition to European courts is more about content than the
   location of authority and that backlash to domestic and international
   courts may be driven by similar forces.},

Title = {Local level failure? Non-compliance of EU environmental policy within EU
   multi-level governance},

Abstract = {Non-compliance with EU environmental policy not only impedes
   Europeanization, but jeopardizes the protection of human health and the
   environment. However, research on failed policy implementation still
   applies traditional top-down or bottom-up approaches and disregards
   complex actor constellations and contextualization. The research in this
   paper applies a comprehensive multilevel governance (MLG) approach to
   overcome this gap and explain noncompliance with EU environmental
   policy. We conducted a qualitative analysis of non-compliance with the
   Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC) within an MLG context, based on a
   case study in Germany. Our findings revealed a dynamic interplay of
   local government's lack of action, an absence of serious support and
   pressure from superordinate levels, business actors exerting influence
   across all levels, and media reporting contributing to misinformation,
   all of which contribute to non-compliance. At the same time, there was a
   lack of awareness of the negative effects of air pollution and thus a
   lack of public pressure to act.},

Abstract = {Persistent divides among American voters regarding climate change,
   especially climate skepticism among conservatives, have long been
   explained with reference to ideology, vested interests, and trends of
   political polarization. More recently, an alternative set of
   explanations for the opinion gap between conservatives and liberals has
   been gaining traction, arguing that these divisions are generated by
   social identities and their effects on individual beliefs and attitudes.
   Here, we focus on global citizenship as a specific social identity.
   Seeking to connect ideology and social identity approaches, we study how
   the interaction between a person's ideological leanings and their social
   identity as a global citizen relates to beliefs and risk perceptions
   regarding climate change. Analyzing two kinds of survey data, we find
   that a global citizen identity moderates the relationship between a
   conservative ideology and a person's climate-related beliefs and risk
   perceptions, while it does not seem to have the same effect for liberal
   individuals. In other words, a global citizen identity is associated
   with a potential decrease in the ideological divide between
   conservatives and liberals regarding climate change. We explore the
   implications of these findings for climate change communication and
   policy and other issue areas.},

Abstract = {Do local elections under autocracy help the poor? We argue that local
   appointees in electoral authoritarian regimes have political incentives
   that undermine public service provision; regime leaders' preoccupation
   with national electoral control encourages them to overlook local
   governance problems if subnational officials can still deliver requisite
   votes in national elections. Using geographic and temporal variation
   across Russian cities (2002-12) in the elimination of mayoral elections,
   we investigate how mayoral appointments affect the maintenance of aging
   housing infrastructure. We find that, compared to elected mayors,
   appointed mayors allow more of their Soviet-era housing stock to become
   dilapidated and unsafe. Moreover, bad housing increases more in cities
   where appointees deliver high vote shares to the ruling party in
   national elections. Thus, while local elections under authoritarianism
   can improve local governance, the holding of semi-competitive national
   elections can actually undermine incentives for local appointees to
   provide public services.</p>},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of democracy
   in Nuevo Leon, using as a theoretical framework the concept of illiberal
   structures and practices at the subnational level. First, we describe
   the sociodemographic characteristics of Nuevo Leon. Next, we summarize
   the democratization process in the state. Third, we analyze the
   evolution of the electoral competition in the state-the law; election
   results for governors, Congress, and municipalities; and the role of
   justice in state elections. Fourth, the article considers whether some
   nonpolitical actors such as economic elites, organized crime, or
   gender-based violence influence the democratic process. The fuzzy
   borders between political and economic elites are the most relevant
   weakness of democratization in Nuevo Leon. The cooptation of the public
   decision-making process by the business elite may be an illiberal
   structure or practice in the state.},

Abstract = {It is widely agreed that service provision is the biggest challenge
   facing South African municipalities and particularly smaller
   municipalities. This paper analyses the South African municipal
   government with a focus on how it responds to the vision to build a
   capable state through developmental government - and the effects of
   political interference and corruption - to find ways to reduce the
   problem of service delivery. A qualitative approach was used, and data
   were collected from various jurisdictions through record review and
   telephone interviews to fill data knowledge gaps. Most municipalities
   have described clean water, work prospects and free basic services as
   the key service delivery obstacles that hinder the realisation of a
   developmentally competent local government in South Africa. The
   discussion finds that yet another problem is political interference in
   municipal administration. Although public engagement in civic affairs is
   a legal necessity, much remains to be done to bring about meaningful
   participation. Sanitation has always been a challenge for service
   delivery, particularly in rural communities, due primarily to a lack of
   infrastructure. Lastly, it was found that municipalities must do more to
   create human resources to provide services reflecting a developmentally
   competent South African local government.},

Abstract = {Research in psychology has established that people have visceral
   positive and negative reactions to all kinds of stimuli-so-called
   implicit attitudes. Implicit attitudes are empirically distinct from
   explicit attitudes, and they appear to have separate consequences for
   political behavior. However, little is known about whether they change
   in response to different factors than explicit attitudes. Identifying
   distinct antecedents for implicit and explicit attitudes would have
   far-reaching implications for the study of political persuasion. We
   hypothesized that implicit attitudes would change primarily in response
   to political advertisements' emotional valence, but this turned out to
   be wrong. In contrast, our next hypothesis that implicit (but not
   explicit) attitudes would improve in response to increased familiarity
   with an attitude object was supported across several tests. Aside from
   this finding, our studies illustrate how routine preregistration helps
   researchers convey what they learned from each test-including when
   predictions are not borne out.},

Abstract = {This paper studies, theoretically and experimentally, a model of
   electoral competition that allows for platforms where candidates may be
   ambiguous about which policy they will implement if elected. We argue
   that uncertainty about the policy preferences of the electorate,
   combined with perceived similarity of voters and candidates, can lead to
   the latter running on these ambiguous platforms. By appealing to voters
   from both ends of the spectrum, such platforms can ensure electoral
   success for noncentrist candidates in a sufficiently polarized society.
   Ambiguous platforms pose a threat to democratic representation because
   winning noncentrists always implement policies in favor of a minority
   and against the preferences of the majority. In our laboratory
   experiment, ambiguous platforms are chosen frequently by candidates and
   gain notable support from voters. Our main treatment variation provides
   causal evidence that ambiguous platforms are more popular among
   noncentrist voters if one of the candidates is a known centrist.},

Abstract = {Political theorists often turn to seventeenth-century England and the
   Levellers as sources of egalitarian insight. Yet by the time the
   Levellers were active, the claim that human beings were ``equal{''} by
   nature was commonplace. Why, in Leveller hands, did a long-standing
   piety consistent with social hierarchy became suddenly effectual?
   Inspired by Elizabeth Anderson, this article explores what equality-and
   the related concept of parity-meant for the Levellers, and what ``the
   point,{''} as they saw it, was. I argue that the Levellers' key
   achievement was subsuming a highly controversial premise of natural
   parity within the existing language of natural equality. This suggests
   that modern basic equality is the product of two, potentially
   contradictory, principles. This, in turn, has important normative, as
   well as historical and conceptual, implications for how theorists
   understand ``the point{''} of equality for egalitarian movements today.},

Abstract = {Collective memories of different events often interact. There are
   multiple possible modes of such interaction. This article explores the
   interrelation of two memories in the Russian memory landscape: memories
   of Stalin's repressions and the first post-Soviet decade, the 1990s. It
   shows that in museum exhibitions about the repressions, the 1990s are
   invoked in different modes. The interaction of the two memories has
   varying outcomes, including ``silencing{''} through cacophonous
   commemoration and a ``magnifying{''} effect of multidirectional
   memories. The article aims to open up the discussion of the complexity
   of the interrelation of the two memories.},

Abstract = {Social norms that legitimise men as political leaders, and undervalue
   women's leadership, are a tenacious barrier to women's representation
   globally. This article explores the circumstances under which women
   dynasty politicians, whose legacy connections have provided them with an
   initial pathway into politics, are able to disrupt these norms. We test
   a proposed typology of normative change - one that progresses from norm
   acceptance, to norm modification, then norm resistance - among women
   dynasty politicians in the Pacific Islands. We find that norms of
   masculinised political leadership are strong, and in many cases the
   election of wives, widows, daughters and other relatives of male
   political actors reinforces these norms through their positioning as
   `placeholders'. Yet some women dynasty politicians can, and do,
   challenge and extend social norms of leadership. This is especially the
   case when the `legacy advantage' is a springboard from which women
   demonstrate - and their publics accept - their own articulation of
   political leadership.},

Abstract = {Research on the welfare state has devoted considerable attention to
   social policy expansion. However, little is known about why governments
   expand social policies serving groups with limited power on issues with
   low visibility. I call these ``benevolent policies.{''} This class of
   social policies improves population well-being but produces minimal
   political gains for the governments enacting them. Why do governments
   expand benevolent policies if political incentives for reform are weak?
   I investigate this question by focusing on government responses to
   malnutrition. Drawing on nine months of fieldwork, including 71
   interviews, I argue that the origins of policy expansion can be found in
   the government bureaucracy. Bureaucrats with technical
   expertise-technocrats-can play a defining role, deploying international
   pressure to court executive support and orchestrate policy change. Their
   actions help explain the Indonesian government's unexpected expansion of
   nutrition policies, which serve low-income women and children and
   address micronutrient malnutrition.},

Abstract = {James Johnson argues that formal models are best conceived as fables
   which provide lessons about empirical phenomena and the ``standard
   rationale{''} of testing model predictions fails. Without justifying the
   ``standard rationale{''} as such, we argue that models produce
   scientific predictions. These predictions come at different levels or
   granularity of description and in different forms each bearing some
   degree of uncertainty, but still give conditions for the existence of
   political phenomena. Models and their predictions require projection
   onto the world, and that projection involves interpretation. Tests
   utilize inference to the best explanation, and it is the conceptual or
   theoretical aspect of models that make them explanatory. We discuss the
   extent to which our characterisation of models and their explanatory
   form versus that of Johnson constitutes a verbal or substantive dispute.},

Abstract = {This paper documents the deleterious effects of petroleum extractive
   activities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, with a special focus on
   HIV infection. It argues against the hegemonizing claims of the
   ``resource curse{''} thesis and deploys the framework of ``accumulation
   by dispossession{''} to explain the crisis of development associated
   with the country's petroleum economy. The paper couches the challenges
   of economic survival in the petroleum resource-rich region on a
   predatory alliance between the extractive transnational corporations
   (TNCs) and the domestic compradors. It highlights the implications of
   extractive activities in the region for HIV infection.},

Abstract = {Building on past research, we implement a hierarchical latent class
   model to analyze political participation from a comparative perspective.
   Our methodology allows simultaneously: (i) estimating citizens'
   propensity to engage in conventional and unconventional modes of
   participation; (ii) classifying individuals into underlying ``types{''}
   capturing within- and cross-country variations in participation; and
   (iii) assessing how this classification varies with micro- and
   macro-level factors. We apply our model to Latin American survey data.
   We show that our method outperforms alternative approaches used to study
   participation and derive typologies of political engagement.
   Substantively, we find that the distribution of participatory types is
   similar throughout the continent, and that it correlates strongly with
   respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and crime victimization.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether the sex of the selector matters for
   advancing women's inclusion in politics and how the political context
   shapes selectors' preferences and behaviour. It focuses on an
   under-researched area - the political appointments ministers make in
   their ministerial departments - and thus sheds light on the conditions
   under which women access appointed office. It analyses six governments
   in Spain between 1996 and 2018, using a mixed methods approach that
   includes statistical analyses of political appointments and interviews
   with former ministers. It finds that women ministers, as individuals,
   did not appoint more women than men ministers did at any time. However,
   women's presence is highly relevant. In more gender-balanced political
   contexts, men and women ministers appointed more women. Moreover, the
   context changed, in part because critical political actors pushed for
   it. This imbued a new political sphere, subcabinet-appointed offices,
   with representational significance.},

Abstract = {This letter explores language politics as it concerns gender, and
   investigates the adoption of amendments that introduce gender-neutral
   language to subnational constitutions via popular initiative. Embracing
   theories of female empowerment based on resource acquisition and
   shrinking gender differentials in economic resources, the authors argue
   that popular support for these initiatives will be higher in contexts
   where female and male incomes are closer to parity. The study tests this
   expectation using city-level historical administrative data in
   California on Proposition 11 in 1974 - the first American state to hold
   a popular vote on amending its constitution to include only
   gender-neutral language. It finds that greater parity in income between
   women and men is associated with greater voter support for the
   initiative. This result holds after controlling for conceivable
   confounders, fails to emerge when analyzing gender-irrelevant ballot
   measures, and replicates when analyzing similar measures held in three
   jurisdictions in other states.},

Abstract = {There are around 50 Swedish children interned in Syrian refugee camps
   due to their parents' affiliation with the Islamic State. Swedish
   authorities have a strict policy towards repatriating individuals who
   have joined the terrorist organisation. Therefore, these individuals,
   along with their young children, are left in these camps. This is
   noteworthy since the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) has
   been enshrined in Swedish law since 2020 with the purpose of
   strengthening children's rights. In this article, media narratives
   concerning these children and the process of repatriation are explored
   in relation to the CRC. The findings suggest that the media narrative
   contributes to the representation of a ``new kind of child{''} that is
   both in danger and dangerous, a narrative configuration that may affect
   the public's way of reacting to their situation.},

Abstract = {During the 2019 centennial celebration of women's suffrage in Germany,
   Chancellor Angela Merkel conceded that gender quotas are important and
   that the ultimate goal must be gender parity. Merkel's legacy in terms
   of advancing women within her own party, however, is mixed. Surrounding
   herself with a tight circle of women professionals and arguably
   modelling success for fellow women party members, she nonetheless
   remained noncommittal on parity. Her support for the `quorum', a 33 per
   cent inner-party `quota light' adopted in 1996, appeared muted and
   inconsequential. Throughout Merkel's chancellorship, the CDU failed to
   adhere to this quota in party offices and among parliamentarians.
   Analysing gender-disaggregated party and electoral data with insights
   gleaned from semi-structured interviews with party members, this article
   sheds light on CDU quota implementation challenges. We assess
   inner-party politics and policies within the context of the CDU's
   struggle to attract female voters, to respond to an increasingly
   progressive Women's Union, and to accommodate its Bavarian sister party,
   the CSU. We find that despite a reframing of its gender equality agenda
   and strong inner-party mobilisation, the CDU majority still resists
   quotas. The mismatch between party statutes and electoral system,
   moreover, obstructs quota implementation, making gender parity in the
   CDU an elusive goal.},

   selective for online social groups of different ideologies, namely
   rightists and leftists, what content generated by these groups is
   censored, and what censorship methods are employed on the two groups. To
   answer these underexplored questions, we observed censorship practices
   on Sina Weibo for a full month and collected and analyzed the censored
   social media posts of both rightists and leftists. Our analysis
   confirmed the existence of selective censorship on posts by the two

Abstract = {In the 21st century the European Union is adapting to the politicization
   of its gas trade with the Russian Federation with a hybrid model: a
   mixture of different measures. In order to prevent, or at least to
   mitigate, Russian use of gas trade in a realistic power politics, the EU
   is responding with measures which are digressing from the economic
   perspective, especially free-market one, and getting closer to the
   political perspective. Non-market responses have become unavoidable
   primarily due to bringing the political element into a foreign trade
   relationship. Based on the analysis of the EU's responses to the threat,
   which has originated from the Russian politicization of gas trade, it is
   possible to follow the incremental transformation of the EU
   liberal-economic identity into an increasingly geopolitical one in a
   world that is becoming increasingly realistic, both in the energy field
   and in international affairs in general. The European Union has included
   concepts of solidarity and sovereignty in its energy policy, yet
   according to the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and
   Security Policy, the EU has to ``learn to use the language of power
   again{''}.},

Abstract = {William Graham Sumner is popularly thought of as the Progressive Era's
   strongest champion of the unencumbered individual, following Richard
   Hofstadter's identification of Sumner as ``one of America's preeminent
   and influential social Darwinists.{''} Sumner scholars have increasingly
   pushed back against this characterization, pointing to the roles of
   cooperation and the ``law of sympathy{''} within Sumner's writings.
   However, the revision of Sumner has remained focused on the texts that
   Hofstadter identified as Sumner's ``political{''} writings. This article
   argues that such a focus would have confused Sumner, who saw the study
   of politics as intimately tied to the study of history. Reconstructing
   Sumner's political thought by contextualizing his ``political{''}
   writings in his understanding of historical development and his extended
   historical accounts, the article argues that Sumner understood civil
   liberty not as an abstract concept but as an empirical fact that emerged
   from the interplay of historical forces.},

   on their race, Indigenous background and age, alongside information on
   gender, occupation, prior electoral experience and electoral outcome. We
   outline the process for collecting and systematizing these data, which
   relied on genealogical methods and the principle of triangulation. The
   data can be used to track diversity among electoral candidates over time
   or merged with other sources to answer district-level questions about
   representational diversity, electoral dynamics, vote choice and
   political communications. The method could also be replicated and
   applied to other levels of government.},

Abstract = {The work offers an interpretive analysis and reception of Cicero's claim
   about the imperative supremacy of welfare and salvation of the people
   (salus populi suprema lex esto), made in the third book of Cicero's
   Laws. This statement is only a piece of the ``puzzle{''} of Cicero's
   reflections on government laws, largely focused on the reparation and
   survival of the Roman Republic, the historical context of which displays
   many adversities afflicting its integrity. First of all, it is necessary
   to offer an interpretive overview of Cicero's claim about the supremacy
   of welfare and salvation of the people and the Republic in the
   historical context of the Roman political and legal circumstances, in
   order to gain a complete insight into the reception of the claim,
   especially in legal doctrine and practice. The actuality of Cicero's
   claim in the form of constitutional provisions (Articles 16, 17 and 101
   of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia) on states of emergency
   and crisis has particular relevance against the backdrop of the COVID-19
   pandemic, but also for some new controversies, as demonstrated by the
   case study of recent decisions taken by the Constitutional Court of the
   Republic of Croatia.},

Abstract = {This article explores the strategic functions of independence
   referendums. These referendums are normally framed as popular decisions
   on statehood over a certain territory. However, I argue that the popular
   will does not always have the decisory function that plebiscitarian
   theories suggest. In fact, actual decision referendums are rare; often
   independence referendums are instead used strategically as a leverage
   and signalling tactic. The article is structured as follows. First, I
   propose two key criteria to classify independence referendums regarding
   actors and timing. Through the application of these criteria, I build a
   typology proposing four main uses of referendums: leverage, signalling,
   decision and ratification. Second, I focus on the specific case of
   leverage referendums. I argue that analyzing the outcomes of leverage
   referendums can provide some clues about why secessionists still call
   for these referendums even though they almost never result in
   internationally recognized statehood. Finally, I conclude by discussing
   the implications of my findings.},

Abstract = {Presidents' informal powers remain under-investigated especially in
   Western European democracies. This gap might hamper the full
   understanding of how presidents ultimately behave and act. The objective
   of this article is twofold. First, it aims at adopting a definition of
   presidents' informal powers by distinguishing them from formal ones and
   from informal institutions. Second, it distinguishes among different
   kind of informal powers by focusing on why presidents use them. To this
   end, a typology based on the following two criteria is proposed: (1) the
   existence of formal powers at disposal of the president in a specific
   sphere and (2) the evaluation of public support each individual
   president thinks to enjoy should they act or refrain. Four types of
   informal powers can be derived from these dimensions: substitutive
   informal powers, parallel informal powers, risk-taking informal powers
   and subverting informal powers.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon data from the China Labor Dynamics Survey, this study
   examines the mediating role of social exclusion between migrant status
   and subjective well-being. Our empirical findings suggest that not only
   current migrants are socially excluded in the cities of destination but
   also returned migrants are insufficiently reintegrated into their
   villages of origin. The experienced social exclusion, in particular, the
   lack of social support, the feeling of vulnerability, and the deficiency
   in the sense of community persistently undermines the subjective
   well-being of both current and returned migrants. Our findings shed new
   light on how migration decisions could affect people's perceptions of
   their lives and create inequality across social groups.},

Abstract = {Social media has become a common feature in American politics, with more
   frequent use among the masses and elites alike. With this increased
   salience, researchers have explored various aspects of social media use
   and its impact on political outcomes. While we know a great deal about
   elite adoption and use of social media platforms, we know comparatively
   less about why some of these social media messages `go viral,' while
   others receive little to no attention. Drawing on research from the
   political science literature on emotional appeals, as well as work in
   marketing and psychology, we argue that elite messages will spread when
   they contain strong emotional language. Using both human and automated
   coding of senators' tweets, we demonstrate that elite messages that are
   more negative and those that contain political attacks are more likely
   to spread on social media. Our findings suggest that politicians have an
   incentive to engage in more negativity online, which might further
   increase affective polarization in American politics.},

Abstract = {The EU's diffusion of its norms lie at the core of its neighbourhood
   policy. However, while scholars have uncovered selective patterns of EU
   norm adoption and application, still little is known about what shapes
   the resonance of EU norms in the partner countries. This question
   matters for the EU's proclaimed objective of transforming its
   neighbours, in a region fraught with a competition of soft influences
   between the EU and Russia. In order to cast light on local resonance of
   external norms, the article delves into identification processes within
   the partner countries in relation to the values promoted by the EU and
   Russia. Focusing on an idiographic case study, it examines how the EU's
   diffusion of anti-discrimination has hit home in Armenia, in a context
   marked by Russia's staunch defense of ``traditional values{''}. The
   research relies on semi-structured interviews and elites' discourses,
   which are analysed using frame analysis. It highlights a shift from
   discursive rejection of the EU's normative script to tentative
   discursive acceptance - at least at elite level - after the Velvet
   revolution. The article shows how the diffusion of external values feeds
   into domestic dynamics and illuminates the role of domestic elites in
   filtering external influences.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},

Abstract = {Presidents need to craft political support to push through policy
   changes. But even when new policies are socially desirable, they are not
   always politically feasible. This article shows that in resource-rich
   countries, presidents can use windfall revenues to obtain support for
   their policy agenda. Using Ecuador as a case study, I show that oil
   revenues and president-led policy changes have the same long-run trends
   (i.e. both variables are co-integrated); government expenditures link
   oil revenues and policy change in the short run; and more discretionary
   budget rules also increase president-led policy changes. In this
   country, presidents produced policy changes only when they benefited
   from high oil revenues. These findings contribute to the literature on
   policymaking in Latin America; they show that the fiscal context in
   which policymaking institutions operate shapes presidents' ability to
   produce policy changes and their long-run patterns. The results also
   present a framework to study policymaking in resource-rich countries.},

Abstract = {Do the processes states use to select judges for peak courts influence
   gender diversity? Scholars have debated whether concentrating
   appointment power in a single individual or diffusing appointment power
   across many individuals best promotes gender diversification. Others
   have claimed that the precise structure of the process matters less than
   fundamental changes in the process. We clarify these theoretical
   mechanisms, derive testable implications concerning the appointment of
   the first woman to a state's highest court, and then develop a
   matched-pair research design within a Rosenbaum permutation approach to
   observational studies. Using a global sample beginning in 1970, we find
   that constitutional change to the judicial selection process decreases
   the time until the appointment of the first woman justice. These results
   reflect claims that point to institutional disruptions as critical
   drivers of gender diversity on important political posts.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that emotions matter in politics, but we know less
   about when and why politicians use emotive rhetoric in the legislative
   arena. This article argues that emotive rhetoric is one of the tools
   politicians can use strategically to appeal to voters. Consequently, we
   expect that legislators are more likely to use emotive rhetoric in
   debates that have a large general audience. Our analysis covers two
   million parliamentary speeches held in the UK House of Commons and the
   Irish Parliament. We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive
   rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary
   with word-embedding techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary.
   We show that emotive rhetoric is more pronounced in high-profile
   legislative debates, such as Prime Minister's Questions. These findings
   contribute to the study of legislative speech and political
   representation by suggesting that emotive rhetoric is used by
   legislators to appeal directly to voters.},

   Political Success Despite Programmatic Failure of the Solar Energy

Abstract = {Although many scholars have studied policy success and failure, the
   relationship of these phenomena to the policy process-essential for an
   explanatory or anticipatory analysis-remains unclear. I address this gap
   by linking the policy success heuristic with the multiple streams
   framework (MSF) and developing hypotheses to explain outcomes. I apply
   this conceptualization to the case of the solar energy policy in
   Gujarat, India by combining a qualitative policy assessment with a
   process trace of policy making. The findings show that the conflicted
   process success and the programmatic failure resulted largely from a
   top-down push for a policy without a problem. This push, nevertheless,
   led to political success that was sustained by recoupling problems and
   politics through agenda denial, blame avoidance, and credit claiming. I
   conclude with implications for the research on policy evaluation, the
   MSF, and policy studies, as well as the governance of a sustainable
   energy transition.},

Abstract = {This commentary reflects on the potential of Madra's Late Neoclassical
   Economics for comprehending neoliberalism. Extending Madra's work, it
   presents an ideology critique of late neoclassical economics (LNE) as
   articulating a social fantasy of harmonious market order that enables
   neoliberal proponents to structure their reality against the Real of
   Capital. Madra's exposition of LNE's orientation around the theoretical
   problematic of neoclassical humanism enables consideration of
   neoliberalism as informed by an obsessional neurotic logic, whereby
   subjects postpone encountering the Real via repeated ideological
   modifications to preserve their fantasy against traumatic incursions.
   Exploring the conditions of possibility for functioning markets, LNE
   reinforces the fantasy of market order through theoretical innovations
   rationalizing increasingly intensive measures to realize it. Thus,
   symptoms bleeding through gaps between the Symbolic reality of
   neolibealism and the Real of Capital are disavowed as market and
   cognitive failures, foreclosing critical engagement with capitalist
   dynamics. This is illustrated through examining the new institutional
   economics of development as disavowing the violence of capitalism.},

Abstract = {Sufficientarian theories of distributive justice are often considered to
   be vulnerable to the `blindness to inequality and other values
   objection'. This objection targets their commitment to holding the moral
   irrelevance of requirements of justice above absolute thresholds of
   advantage, making them insufficiently sensitive to egalitarian moral
   concerns that do have relevance for justice. This paper explores how
   sufficientarians could reply to this objection. Particularly, I claim
   that, if we accept that the force of the aforementioned objection comes
   from relational, and not distributive, inequalities, different
   strategies are open for sufficientarians in order to be sensitive to
   these concerns. Drawing on recent literature about the relation between
   distributive and relational egalitarianism, and the possibility of
   reducing one to the other, strategies of `internalizing' and
   `externalizing' relational egalitarian concerns to a distributive
   sufficientarian framework are explored. In turn, I suggest that both
   strategies fail in their standard versions, but argue that a particular
   `hybrid view' about justice is an attractive candidate for the
   sufficientarian theorist.},

Abstract = {This note seeks to understand the extent of the disruptions to
   international relations caused by pandemics, focusing on one
   globally-endemic disease: malaria. We posit that longstanding diseases
   such as malaria have the potential to undermine the political ties of
   nation states, as well as the many benefits of these connections. Our
   argument is tested empirically using both directed-dyadic and monadic
   data, while incorporating methods that account for endogeneity and other
   relevant concerns. We find that the geographic malaria rates of a
   country not only serve to historically discourage foreign governments
   from establishing diplomatic outposts on a country's soil, but also lead
   to an aggregate decrease in the total diplomatic missions that a country
   receives. We then discuss the current implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a paradigm shift from the traditionally systematic,
   rigid structures of thesis writing courses to favor an inclusive, fluid,
   and flexible approach that both centers on student needs and meets the
   professional demands of future graduates. An intentional move to amend
   the thesis writing course would (1) create the conditions for students
   to have a greater stake in their own writing, (2) establish a sense of a
   cohort and scholarly community, and (3) integrate students into the
   professor's scholarly habits of writing. This comprehensive education
   approach is intended for application in upper-level undergraduate thesis
   courses. By increasing the student's share in the writing and research
   process as collaborators, instructors can model the behaviors of
   scholarship and intellectual community, position ourselves as mentors,
   and substantially increase our own academic productivity. To elaborate
   upon this approach, I reflect upon my experience as a preceptor in a
   Senior Seminar Bachelor's thesis course to provide a loose outline for
   fellow capstone thesis writing instructors.},

Abstract = {The transition away from the highly intolerant and persecutory regimes
   of late-medieval and early-modern Europe was facilitated by four
   important developments. First, Europeans learned that social order and
   cohesion are threatened less by diversity than by intolerance of it.
   Second, the traditionally paternalist vision of the state's role was
   called into question by a new valuation of the individual conscience and
   consequently of individual liberties. Third, the assumption that the
   meaning of symbols is objectively determined was replaced by the
   recognition that symbols are intersubjectively determined by convention.
   Fourth, Europeans began to distinguish two senses of publicity:
   visibility and representativeness. The tenuous hold of these four modern
   assumptions is illustrated by laws of laicite, which harken back to the
   medieval mindset on all four counts.},

Abstract = {Challenges to the Arctic region abound and intersect. Warming, ice and
   permafrost melting, and pollution jeopardize health and food security of
   Indigenous and other Northern communities. Problems related to natural
   resource extraction and shipping are developing. Because these issues
   cross sovereign boundaries, they must be addressed multilaterally. The
   Arctic Council is the principal forum in which Arctic states and
   Indigenous groups address shared concerns in the region. We
   co-administered a five-day program on science and diplomacy in the
   Arctic at Dartmouth College in June 2017 to educate postsecondary
   students on Arctic challenges and governance, foster skills and
   confidence related to leadership and diplomacy, and inspire civic action
   in Arctic and international affairs. The program consisted of lectures,
   discussions, a teamwork and collaboration exercise, a negotiation
   workshop, and a Model Arctic Council (MAC)-a simulation of delegates'
   work in the Arctic Council. We found that students had strongly positive
   perceptions of the curriculum and felt that they accrued Arctic-related
   awareness and skills, while developing enthusiasm for engaging in civic
   affairs. Students attributed the program's value to the use of multiple
   pedagogies, especially simulation, an interdisciplinary environment, and
   mentorship from and engagement with Arctic Council and other
   practitioners.},

Title = {The Use of Human Dignity in Legal Argumentation: An Analysis of the Case
   Law of the Supreme Courts of Finland},

Abstract = {The concept of human dignity is increasingly used in legal reasoning,
   albeit that we still lack a clear understanding of its function in that
   sphere. In European countries, its use is influenced by varying national
   and regional European applications in courts. This article conducts a
   theoretically oriented empirical analysis of the case law of the two
   supreme courts of Finland to canvass the use of human dignity in the
   argumentation of these courts. The analysis is based on 92 cases from
   the Supreme Administrative Court and 36 from the Supreme Court that
   refer to human dignity in the reasoning part of the judgement. Three
   different uses of human dignity in legal argumentation are recognised
   and defined: restrictive, enabling and compensatory. These uses are
   arguably also recognisable in other jurisdictions. However, the
   compensatory use of human dignity, in the context of tort law - in the
   form of damages for emotional suffering - in particular, appears not to
   have been extensively discussed before. The article argues that the
   different uses of human dignity in legal argumentation reflect many
   ideas traditionally connected with the concept. For example, the close
   connections between dignity and autonomy, and dignity and vulnerability,
   emerge from the case law.},

Abstract = {This essay elaborates a conception of sovereignty that highlights its
   revolutionary potential. Its argument addresses the nature of different
   movement strategies in the ongoing struggle for food sovereignty and how
   movements ought to confront the state while simultaneously using it to
   create a transformative, potentially anticapitalist form of governance.
   This claim is built from critiques of the state and sovereignty in
   studies of radical democracy. The essay then presents how Lenin connects
   sovereignty to proletarian governance. A revolutionary conception of
   sovereignty, developed by placing discussions of Lenin's work in
   dialogue with practices of food sovereignty, is found in collective
   political action that suspends state power and challenges private
   property to create alternative economic and noneconomic forms of
   organization. This dialectical rendering of sovereignty entails
   constructing a new order by simultaneously conflicting with and acting
   through the existing one.},

Abstract = {Since its inception, political science has been studying the
   institutions of government and the way in which power is produced and
   distributed in a society, and it does so in a comparative manner. This
   article aims to examine the not necessary but very influential link
   between political institutions and comparative analysis. Its
   consolidation resulted from the change that the irruption of the
   behaviorism and the theory of the rational election produced in the
   political science, laying down bases to renew the study of the political
   institutions and to privilege the comparative politics like
   methodological strategy. The article argues that the reconfiguration of
   the link between political institutions and comparative politics, from
   the last decades of the twentieth century, has established a kind of
   ``orthodox consensus{''} in political science that assumes a model of
   empirical hypothetical-deductive science and a methodological strategy
   comparative applied to this specific study object for the political
   explanation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether voters' experience of extreme weather events
   such as flooding increases voting in favor of climate protection
   measures. While the large majority of individuals do not hold consistent
   opinions on climate issues, we argue that the experience of natural
   disasters can prime voters on climate change and affect political
   behavior. Using micro-level geospatial data on natural disasters, we
   exploit referendum votes in Switzerland, which allows us to obtain a
   behavioral rather than attitudinal measure of support for policies
   tackling climate change. Our findings indicate a sizeable effect for
   pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood: vote-share supporting
   pro-climate policies can increase by 20 percent. Our findings contribute
   to the literature exploring the impact of local conditions on electoral
   behavior.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {What are Chinese public attitudes regarding nuclear weapons? Although
   scholars have studied Chinese elites' views on nuclear weapons,
   surprisingly little is known about the views of China's public. To
   understand Chinese public views on nuclear weapons, we conduct an online
   survey (N = 1066) of Chinese respondents. This is, to our knowledge, the
   first survey of Chinese public attitudes towards nuclear weapons. We
   find that although Chinese citizens view the possession of nuclear
   weapons as important for their country's security, they strongly oppose
   the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. We also provide
   respondents an opportunity to describe their views on nuclear weapons in
   their own words. Using computer-assisted text analysis, we assess
   patterns in these open-ended responses and compare across age groups. We
   find that younger respondents emphasize non-material factors such as
   having a greater voice internationally, whereas older respondents
   emphasize self-defense. Overall, this analysis sheds light on the public
   attitudes that may shape China's evolving approach to nuclear weapons.},

Abstract = {Three decades ago Huckfeldt and Sprague hypothesized that partisan
   context constrains information sharing between neighbors. We develop
   their theory to identify implications for campaign mobilization in
   homogeneous and mixed-partisan contexts. We argue that get-out-the-vote
   (GOTV) spillover effects should vary with the proportion of rival party
   supporters in a neighborhood. Using two samples of households that were
   either included or excluded prerandom assignment from a street-level
   GOTV experiment, we test this expectation of differential spillover
   effects. We estimate neighborhood party preferences using targeting data
   made available by the UK Labour Party. We find that spillover effects on
   party supporters are smaller in neighborhoods that include larger shares
   of rival party supporters. Rival partisans are mobilized in
   mixed-partisan neighborhoods where the probability of spillovers from
   mixed-partisan households is higher. This article extends Huckfeldt and
   Sprague's theory and demonstrates the importance of social dynamics for
   parties' campaign strategies.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {36},
Pages = {22-38},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The general meaning of ``proxy war{''} is the pursuit of one's interests
   exploiting other actors. Measures to this end can be implemented in two
   ways: through hard and soft power. As far as countering the activities
   of terrorist organizations is concerned, it can be seen that
   self-interest is placed above efforts against terrorism. The civil war
   in Syria and the activities of terrorist organizations have become
   grounds for greater involvement of global powers in the struggle for
   gaining influence in the country. This paper aims to show the actions of
   global and regional powers and other state actors taken in an attempt to
   assert power and influence under the guise of the fight against
   terrorism. The paper is divided into two parts: theoretical and
   practical. The theoretical part discusses aspects related to Josepha
   Nye's concept of ``smart power{''} and the notions of ``proxy war{''}
   and ``proxy activities{''}. The practical part discusses the activities
   of international actors pursuing their interests through official
   involvement in the fight against Daesh in the Syrian territory.},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This work aims to identify the most relevant approaches that the link
   between state bureaucracy and politics can take within the space opened
   by Weber's classic intervention. I seek to contribute to the
   construction of a cartography that locates the changing discursive
   hegemonies in the academic field. First, I analyze the Weberian
   formulation that alludes to a complementary tension between
   administrative cadre and political practice. Afterwards, I identify six
   distinct, but non-exhaustive, theoretical strategies or directions: one
   that conceives of bureaucracy as a space crossed by internal political
   tensions that condition its role in relation to politics; one that
   defines bureaucracy as a force that intervenes guided by its own
   interests; one which sees in technocracy a new politically dominant
   class or elite; one that maintains that politicians and bureaucrats are
   interdependent actors; and a perspective that delimits bureaucrats as
   strategic managers with political capabilities.},

Title = {Gender Politics and Legislative Networks in Taiwan: An Analysis of
   Women-Bill Co-Sponsorship and Bill Success},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},

Abstract = {This article examines how legislative networks can be utilised to
   further the interests of female voters. Specifically, I investigate how
   legislators' gender and partisanship within co-sponsorship networks are
   related to the successful passage of women bills. For this goal, the
   article focusses on Taiwan-where both women's descriptive and
   substantive representations have improved dramatically since
   democratisation and, at the same time, co-sponsoring bills have been a
   legislative process of the ongoing significance. The article utilises an
   original bill co-sponsorship dataset that consists of 232,734
   co-sponsors related to all bills submitted between 2005 and 2016. By
   comparing women and non-women bills, the article demonstrates that the
   legislative effectiveness on women bills varied by legislator's gender
   and affiliated party. That is, the proportion of male legislators in the
   co-sponsorship network did not effect on women bill success, while it
   turned out to be positively related to non-women bill success. Moreover,
   the proportion of right-leaning party legislators in the co-sponsorship
   network decreased the odds of women bill passage while increasing the
   chance of non-women bill ones. Despite the increasing participation of
   male legislators and right-leaning party legislators in co-sponsoring
   women's issues in Taiwan, the results demonstrate that their role was
   limited on the success of women bills.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the positions of various social
   groups, reflecting the controversial and contradictory aspects of the
   process of identity construction in post-Soviet Russia and the factor of
   memory politics. The article reveals the characteristics of the
   post-Soviet identity-building process and the related politics of memory
   under the century-end systemic transformation that has launched a new
   existential project in Russia. Collective identity is formed in a new
   social space: the global dichotomy of globalization and localization.
   Methodologically, it is a documentary research close to the analysis of
   discourse. The process of transition from the Soviet Union to
   post-Soviet space and the construction of the new state on the ruins of
   the socialist empire will keep the problems of a new identity and the
   politics of memory relevant soon. It is concluded that thirty years
   after the liquidation of the socialist project, the crisis of collective
   identity in Russia and the ``battle for history{''} and a new Russian
   national unity are not over. However, persistent social atomization and
   conflict-triggering narratives of various socio-cultural communities and
   ideological groups persist.},

Abstract = {Whether or not nationalism fuels terrorist violence by ethnic groups is
   an important yet underexplored research question. This study offers a
   theoretical argument, empirical analysis and a case study. When
   political leaders such as presidents and prime ministers use nationalism
   to shore up legitimacy, they threaten the existence of disfavored ethnic
   groups. In turn, those groups are more likely to respond with terrorist
   attacks. The author tests this argument using a sample of 766 ethnic
   groups across 163 countries from 1970 to 2009. The multilevel
   mixed-effects negative binomial regression results provide evidence that
   leader nationalism is a significant driver of ethnic terrorism. The
   detrimental effect of nationalism remains the same after using a
   generalized method of moments method to account for possible reverse
   causality. A case study of Sinhalese nationalist leaders versus Tamil
   Tigers also supports the nationalism and terrorism nexus.},

Abstract = {In light of increasing white supremacist violence in the United States,
   calls to identify such violence as terrorism have surged in public
   discourse. Federal and state agencies have taken up these demands and
   included white supremacy in counterterrorism and national security
   policy. While this classification appears to remove the racist double
   standard in applications of the terrorism label, it has come under
   criticism for obscuring the history and distinctly U.S. American roots
   of white supremacy, on the one hand, and expanding the harmful and
   typically racially coercive consequences of U.S. counterterrorism, on
   the other hand. There is, however, a robust yet neglected tradition in
   U.S. racial justice activism that uses the language of terrorism to make
   sense of white supremacy. By examining this tradition, this essay offers
   a more nuanced assessment of the dangers and possibilities of
   classifying white supremacy as terrorism. Specifically, I look at Ida B.
   Wells's analysis of lynching as racial terrorism to recover an
   alternative narrative of white supremacist terrorism. I argue that the
   understanding of white supremacy as terrorism in her writings not only
   exposes the partisan use of these terms and their complicity in
   constructing a narrowly circumscribed and biased public knowledge about
   racial domination, but also reveals some mistaken assumptions of the
   current debate. This essay thus sheds new light on a neglected discourse
   of white supremacist terrorism and makes it relevant for contemporary
   purposes.},

Abstract = {Politicians' individual traits can influence policy outcomes. A local
   mayor has authority over the budget process and can affect the municipal
   budget allocation. This study empirically examined whether the mayor's
   gender affected the gendered budget in Korean cities between 2016 and
   2020. Across various econometric designs, our results revealed little
   evidence that mayoral gender (women, in this case) affects the
   formulation and execution of the gendered budget. The results imply that
   the effects of female representation through a female leader are
   dependent on various socioeconomic contexts.},

Abstract = {Few studies have focused on the Canadian context to examine the
   political impacts of personality. Even though the Canadian Election
   Study (CES) has measured the Big Five personality traits since 2011,
   very few studies have taken advantage of this data to assess
   personality's political role among the Canadian electorate. Using CES
   data from the three latest elections (2011, 2015 and 2019), we first
   explore how reliable the measurement of personality is. Except for
   agreeableness in 2015, the correlations across the personality items are
   similar to what is typically found in the literature. We next examine
   how personality affects ideology and partisan identity in the Canadian
   context. We show that a two-dimensional measurement of ideology refines
   our understanding of the impacts of personality on ideology. The
   findings also suggest that personality plays an essential role in
   forming ideology in Canada but has a limited impact on partisanship.},

Abstract = {Divisions between Whites and Blacks have long influenced voting. Yet
   given America's growing Latino population, will Whites' attitudes toward
   Blacks continue to predict their voting behavior? Might anti-Latino
   prejudice join or supplant them? These questions took on newfound
   importance after the 2016 campaign, in which the Republican candidate's
   rhetoric targeted immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere. We examine the
   relationship between Whites' prejudices, immigration attitudes, and
   voting behavior using a population-based panel spanning 9 years. Donald
   Trump's candidacy activated anti-Black but not anti-Latino prejudice,
   while other GOP candidates had no such effect. This and other evidence
   suggests that Whites' prejudice against Blacks is potentially activated
   even when salient political rhetoric does not target them exclusively.
   These results shed light on the continued political impact of anti-Black
   prejudice while deepening our understanding of the mobilization of
   prejudice and the associated psychological mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Labour's election defeat in December 2019 provided the opportunity for a
   fundamental rethinking of economic and political strategy of a kind that
   failed to take place during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour
   Party. Deep tensions within the Corbyn movement and in the economic
   programme presented by Corbyn's Labour were managed successfully in
   2017, but exploded in 2019. Corbynism's populist communications
   strategies became dislocated from an increasingly state-centred and
   bureaucratically-focussed economic programme still heavily influenced by
   the thinking of the late 1970s and 1980s. Populist strategies in general
   suffer from a weak conception of hegemony, and the failure to create
   policy that could win hegemony for left politics was both an expression
   of Corbynism's weakness and a contributor to its defeat. Future economic
   programmes of the left will need to reclaim the radical, decentralising
   elements of Corbynism, seeking new agents for change at local and
   regional levels.},

Abstract = {Studies on renewable energy (RE) policies and policy making have
   generally focused on the Global North. This article homes in on how
   trust, an underexamined concept in the multi-level governance
   literature, affects RE trajectories in Malaysia and Indonesia. Through
   comparative analysis, we find that different levels of trust result in
   similar degrees of RE policy support, but dissimilar degrees of
   engagement between state and societal actors in RE policy making.
   Negative expectations of the social grievances engendered by RE
   transitions contribute to reluctant, though legitimized, pursuits of
   clean energy production and consumption. Meanwhile, trust in actors'
   nationalism-that is, in opposing a Global North environmental agenda and
   demonstrating constitutionally aligned resource management in Malaysia
   and Indonesia, respectively-facilitates more inclusive policy making.
   Due to greater nationalism, Indonesia's state-society engagement in RE
   governance is stronger and leads to a civil RE movement that outpaces
   Malaysia's overall.},

Abstract = {Partisan media bias has been difficult to operationalize, and it rarely
   has been analyzed cross-nationally. This study presents new measures of
   media bias and applies them to data covering 24 EU countries. To build
   the measures, we employ two benchmarks of political balance-objectivity
   and neutrality. We rely on cross-national content data on parties'
   visibility from 13'893 mentions in news stories, 530 expert evaluations
   on party favorability of media outlets, and survey data on media
   audiences' partisan preferences from 24'068 individuals. Scores are used
   to assess partisan media bias at country, outlet, and party levels.},

Abstract = {Brexit may have dominated the 2019 general election campaign, but it
   wasn't the only issue at stake. The political parties published
   wide-ranging manifestos, while their appeals also rested on established
   ideological reputations. This article analyses the content of the 2019
   manifestos and uses the latest Manifesto Project estimates to explore
   ideological movement in the British party system. It reports the
   changing policy emphases in Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat
   manifestos and the ideological positions of these and other political
   parties in 2019. It further presents new measures for parties' positions
   on the cosmopolitan-traditionalist dimension of party competition, an
   increasingly important divide in electoral politics. The article shows
   that the ideological gap between the Conservatives and Labour opened up
   further in 2019. It also shows how the parties' distinctive ideological
   profiles, as well as their positions on Brexit, gave voters a clearer
   choice than in recent elections.},

Abstract = {Trade and economic relations between Iran and France have improved more
   than political relations between the two countries since 1979. After the
   fluctuations of the 1980s, the French presence in the Iranian car
   industry as well as energy and oil sectors during the normalization of
   relations between the two countries in the 1990s made Tehran and Paris
   more interested in economic cooperation. However, this cooperation
   reflected sinusoidal movements in the 2000s and 2010s parallel with the
   ebbs and flows of international concern over Iran's nuclear program. In
   this article, we examine economic relations between France and Iran from
   the Iranian revolution in 1979 until the end of 2020 and identify the
   domestic, bilateral, and international ups and downs influencing these
   relations.},

Abstract = {Studies on cultural divisions in Western European politics typically
   combine two different value divides. The first divide is moral
   traditionalism versus progressiveness, which pits the religious and the
   secular against each other on matters of procreation, family and gender
   roles. The second one is authoritarianism versus libertarianism, which
   captures the opposition between the high- and low-educated about
   basically secular attitudes towards matters of immigration and law and
   order. Since the first divide is religiously inspired and the second one
   is basically secular, this article systematically distinguishes between
   them and studies whether secularization in Western Europe affects them
   differently. We perform multilevel regression analysis using European
   Values Study data (four waves, 1981-2008) for 17 Western European
   countries. Our findings show that the divide between the religious and
   the secular about moral issues declines with secularization, while the
   divide between the high- and low-educated about secular issues becomes
   wider.},

Abstract = {Does public participation in constitution-making processes enhance
   constitutional legitimacy? Using an original public opinion survey
   conducted in Tunisia shortly after the adoption of the 2014
   Constitution, this article examines whether public participation in
   constitution-making activities enhances perceived constitutional
   legitimacy. The results show that participants are more likely to
   support the constitution and its institutions than non-participants. We
   argue that participation increases constitutional literacy among the
   general public and this increased knowledge impacts the respondents'
   perception of the constitution. The empirical findings confirm normative
   assumptions of participatory model of the democratic theory and suggest
   that inclusive and participatory constitutional reform processes, in
   contrast to an elitist approach, are more likely to yield democratic
   constitutional outcomes which are supported by larger segments of the
   society.},

Abstract = {In this paper we leverage a sudden shift in refugee settlement policy to
   study the electoral consequences of refugee settlements. After the 2013
   Norwegian parliamentary election, the newly elected right-wing
   government made a concerted effort to spread newly arrived immigrants
   across the country, with the consequence that some municipalities with
   limited experience in settling refugees accepted to do so. We propose
   that such policy changes have political consequences, increasing the
   salience of immigration issues and shifting voters' preferences to the
   right. We further propose that successful refugee integration can move
   (parts of) the electorate to the left, with stronger political
   polarization as a possible effect of the policy change. Applying
   difference-in-differences techniques, we find no evidence of
   unidirectional shifts in voter sentiments, but support for the
   hypothesis of stronger political polarization.},

Abstract = {In 2016 Brazil's Senate ousted the popularly re-elected President Dilma
   Rousseff, who had been accused of budget mismanagement under the
   pretense that she committed an impeachable crime that justified the
   parliamentary coup. This paper investigates the hypothesis that her
   government was removed once it could no longer sustain a neoliberal
   pro-finance agenda, which depends on the state, and that the forces that
   seized power promised to restore and strengthen. Pro-finance policies
   had been established in the 1990s by the Cardoso government and were
   maintained by the Lula da Silva government. The latter, nevertheless,
   was able to raise wages, as did Rousseff, but more slowly. Her
   government also loosened some neoliberal policies, such as the so-called
   fiscal austerity. Rousseff's non-elected successor, Michel Temer, tried
   to limit budget spending by implementing a 20-year ceiling on the real
   growth of virtually all expenditures except public debt interest. He
   also began aggressive privatizations and, after curtailing labor
   protections, proposed a regressive social security reform to further cut
   state expenditures. Thus, the Temer government promoted dispossessing
   policies to redistribute economic surpluses-e.g., through future primary
   fiscal surpluses-and allow the expansion of capital accumulation. The
   latter is driven by the proletarianization that follows welfare
   cuts-i.e., cuts in the social wage-due to the budget cap and regressive
   social security and labor reforms that sought to increase the supply of
   cheaper labor-power. Capital could also expand because budgets can
   increase the commodification by private companies of hitherto
   state-provided pensions and healthcare.},

Abstract = {How young people become active citizens to sustain democracy is a
   crucial question for a modern democracy like Australia to pose in a
   context of youth political disillusionment with politics. The present
   research investigates this question in the context of young Australian
   adults' norms of citizenship and intended political participation. The
   results show that encouraging young people to engage in decision-making
   processes in school or the community may cultivate active democrats,
   while law-abidingness works as a moderator of other citizenship norms.
   It remains a major challenge for democracies to promote engaged
   citizenship norms, prepare young people to be interested in civic
   issues, and facilitate skills that make politically self-efficacious
   young citizens.},

Title = {The Welfare State Upholders: Protests Against Cuts in Sickness Benefits

Abstract = {The power resource approach (PRA) claims that the labour movement
   continues to be the most prominent defender of the welfare state. The
   new politics thesis (NPT), on the other hand, claims that the welfare
   state has created new interest groups in the form of welfare clients who
   have taken over as the most prominent welfare state upholders. In an
   attempt to empirically evaluate these claims, we present a study of the
   extent to which clients and the labour movement have been involved in
   protests against cutbacks in the Swedish sickness benefit from 2006 to
   2019. The article contributes to the welfare state literature by
   studying a most likely case for PRA-style interest group mobilization
   both in terms of country (Sweden) and policy area (sickness insurance).
   It also tests the claim from PRA scholars that client interests are
   uncommon in these contexts. Our results show that protest engagement
   among client groups is greater than the engagement among the labour
   movement when looking at protests directed specifically against cuts in
   the sickness benefit programme. However, when broader protests against
   cutbacks in several transfer programmes are taken into account, the
   number of protests initiated by clients and by the labour movement is
   comparable. Overall, our results suggest that both the PRA and the NPT
   are needed to explain current developments in social democratic welfare
   states like Sweden.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of pandemics on partisan perceptions of government
   competence? Taking the case of Covid-19 in the UK, we explore how
   voters' assessments of the government's handling of the economy and
   health were affected by four events: the first UK Covid-19 death; the
   national lockdown; Boris Johnson's hospitalisation; and Cummings'
   scandal. Using a large representative weekly survey in the last year
   totalling over around 30'000 respondents, our results show that Labour
   voters had the worst assessments of government handling. The first death
   deteriorated perceptions of government handling of health among both
   Labour and Conservative voters, while Boris Johnson's hospitalisation
   improved perceptions among most voters. Lockdown improved the perception
   of health handling but at the cost of more negative perceptions of its
   handling of the economy. The Cummings scandal had a negative effect on
   perceptions of government handling of economy but surprisingly improved
   perceptions of its handling of health.},

Abstract = {Water, a vital element in arid areas, has marked the relations between
   Chile and Bolivia. This article presents an analysis of the complex
   relations between the two countries, from the point of view of
   freshwater, throughout a qualitative methodology based on the review of
   multiples sources. With a geopolitical approach, three key moments are
   highlighted: the 1950 negotiation, the Lauca controversy and the
   discussion over the Silala River. This investigation aims to understand
   the relevance of water in bilateral relations, and how this element was
   vital in the diplomatic tensions of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Beijing's economic diplomacy has, since the dawn of the millennium,
   sought to reconfigure the world by championing a new economic order that
   is predicated on the principles of multipolarity and fairness. The last
   policy conference of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) shed some light
   into how these policy ideals are to be carried out by Beijing and how
   they will bear on her relationship with countries from the Global South.
   This paper considers the policy statements of the CCP during its 19th
   congress held in October 2017 as a sneak peek into the future of China's
   economic diplomacy and the implications for Africa's own economic future
   from the context of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
   (BRICS). It argues that China's role as the leader of the BRICS fulcrum
   reflects her goal to have a global influence that will see erstwhile
   economic backwaters such as Africa turning their focus away from the
   West to the East in search of sustainable solutions to their economic
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The investigations of Carl Schmitt yielded an influential but partial
   recovery of the term ``political theology.{''} In this article, I
   consider Schmitt's tendentious reduction of political theology to a
   justifying or legitimizing function. I then turn to Aquinas to
   demonstrate that Christian political theology also offers robust
   criticism of political life. After laying out three such standards for
   criticism, I account for why Christian political theology exhibits this
   deep ambivalence toward political life. The traditions of political
   theology, I argue, can be understood as attempts to harmonize polar
   tensions with those traditions. Whereas thinkers like Schmitt and
   Foucault emphasize one set of polarities against another, Aquinas
   effects a genuine synthesis. This synthesis should be the task of
   political theology. I close with notes toward the renewal of political
   theology.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about the
   capability of governments to develop policies addressing its effects.
   This article evaluates citizens' attitudes about their governments'
   early responses to the crisis in three post-Soviet countries (Estonia,
   Georgia, and Ukraine). We explore how the pandemic emerged, focusing on
   connections among state capacity, government policy interventions, and
   crisis mitigation. We also use data from the Perceptions and Attitudes
   on COVID-19 in Eurasia (PACE) survey to evaluate how individual-level
   attitudes and characteristics are associated with evaluations of
   government responsiveness. We find that trust in state institutions
   affects reported satisfaction with crisis responses.},

Abstract = {Constitutional pluralism (CP) and differentiated integration (DI) have
   been criticised as potentially legitimising democratic backsliding
   within the EU. Critics contend that effective measures require
   strengthening the legal authority of the Court of Justice of the
   European Union and the political authority of the European Commission.
   We dispute this criticism, which rests on a federal conception of the EU
   at odds with its confederal features. We argue that the value of
   democracy for the EU derives from pluralism between as well as within
   states, thereby justifying CP and DI. While both prove incompatible with
   democratic backsliding, they challenge the legitimacy of the strong
   assertions of federal authority some advocate to tackle it. Drawing on
   CP, we propose four criteria for EU action against backsliding regimes,
   and suggest processes and penalties that meet them. We liken the latter
   to `value' DI, whereby backsliding states can be excluded from EU
   funding and voting rights.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 public health pandemic has seen governments spend trillions
   of dollars to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus as well as to
   soften the economic blow from the shutting down of national economies.
   Subsequent budget shortfalls raise the question of how governments will
   pay for the direct and indirect costs associated with the COVID-19
   pandemic. In this article, we study the public's willingness to
   contribute through paying a new tax, with a focus on Canada. We find
   that both generalized social and political trust are associated with a
   greater willingness to support a COVID-related tax and that generalized
   social trust, in particular, attenuates the negative effect of an
   experimentally manipulated, specified level of tax burden on policy
   support. These findings entail important implications for the public
   opinion and tax policies literature, as well as for policy makers.},

Abstract = {Did the crisis period influence party issue salience on the two main
   dimensions of conflict - economic and cultural - in Europe? How did this
   happen in terms of potential differences between Southern European
   countries, the most exposed to economic depression and austerity, and
   the rest of Europe? And what can we learn about all this when we look at
   the parties themselves and consider party-level determinants of issue
   salience? In answering these questions, this study investigates
   continuity and change in party issue salience over time, comparing
   Southern Europe with the rest of Europe between 2000 and 2018. Using
   manifesto data, we test hypotheses on the relevance of the economic
   crisis for issue salience in party competition and the intermediary role
   of party characteristics in one of the most turbulent areas of recent
   times. We show that in Southern Europe, during the Great Recession, the
   socio-economic cleavage contained the ascendance of a socio-cultural
   dimension and that party-level characteristics are important in
   conditioning responses to the crisis in terms of issue salience. To
   pursue the argument, we combine insights from saliency theory and
   accounts of party strategic adaptation.},

Abstract = {This paper reconsiders the arguments of my book, The Longing for Total
   Revolution, in response to the thoughtful analyses collected in this
   symposium. It restates the book's main genealogical and critical
   arguments about the philosophical sources of uniquely modern forms of
   social discontent, while distinguishing those arguments from recent
   attempts to uncover the deeper, theological sources of discontent. It
   focuses, in particular, on the role played in modern social discontent
   by the group of thinkers I describe as the ``Kantian left{''}: a long
   line of social critics who sought to ``realize{''} Kant's understanding
   of human autonomy in society, thereby gaining what Marx called ``control
   and conscious mastery{''} over our social world, not just over our
   wills.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that the ``theological and social-psychological
   radicalisation model{''}, which has been primarily used in a Western
   context, has influenced the strategies used by the Kenyan government to
   explain and combat radicalisation and terrorism. The model predominantly
   focuses on religion and social networks as crucial to the radicalisation
   process. My research in Kenya demonstrates how the underlying principles
   of the model are used in a non-Western context. I claim that the Kenyan
   government is increasingly using the model to delegate surveillance,
   especially to the security sector but also to some civil society actors.
   As illustrated in my findings, Kenya has, through specific definitions,
   reports and statements, contributed to the institutionalisation of the
   term radicalisation and its link to Islam. My argument is substantiated
   by an analysis of official policy documents, official statements and
   interviews. Paradoxically, the hard approach taken by the security
   sector in Kenya towards the Muslim population seems to have further
   fuelled radicalisation in the country.},

Abstract = {This article gives an account of the correspondence between social class
   and the opinion regarding the different social and problematic demands
   posed as of the events of October 18, 2019, known mediately as the
   ``social outbreak{''} or the ``social crisis{''} of Chile. To achieve
   the above, a multiple correspondence analysis is carried out based on
   the collection of information from the National Socioeconomic
   Characterization Survey (CASEN) of 2017 and the results of the 2019
   Citizen Consultation of Chile conducted by the Chilean Association of
   Municipalities. The results show the conformation of three class
   positions based on the dimensions of the social class concept outlined
   by Erik Olin Wright that correspond to different opinions, which
   contradict in certain aspects the central hypothesis (correspondence
   between social class and positioning political-social, or ``class
   consciousness{''} hypothesis). Despite the above, it is possible to
   identify themes and concerns of each social class.},

Abstract = {Do female leaders amplify the voices of other women in politics? The
   author addresses this question by examining parliamentary debates in the
   UK House of Commons. In the context of a difference-in-differences
   design that exploits over-time variation in the gender of cabinet
   ministers, the article demonstrates that female ministers substantially
   increase the participation of other female MPs in relevant debates,
   compared to when the minister is male. It also uses a measure of debate
   influence, based on the degree to which words used by one legislator are
   adopted by other members, to show that female ministers also increase
   the influence of female backbenchers. To explore the mechanisms behind
   these results, the author introduces a new metric of ministerial
   responsiveness and shows that female ministers are significantly more
   responsive than their male counterparts to the speeches of female
   backbenchers.},

Abstract = {Can leveraging family history reduce xenophobia? Building on theories of
   group identity, we show that a family history of forced relocation
   leaves an imprint on future generations and can be activated to increase
   sympathy toward refugees. We provide evidence from Greece and Germany,
   two countries that vividly felt the European refugee crisis, and that
   witnessed large-scale forced displacement of their own populations
   during the twentieth century. Combining historical and survey data with
   an experimental manipulation, we show that mentioning the parallels
   between past and present differentially increases pledged monetary
   donations and attitudinal measures of sympathy for refugees among
   respondents with forcibly displaced ancestors. This differential effect
   is also present among respondents without a family history of forced
   migration who live in places with high historical concentration of
   refugees. Our findings highlight the role of identity and shared
   experience for reducing out-group discrimination.},

Abstract = {Analogies to the Peloponnesian War have been misapplied in studies of
   US-China relations, especially regarding the so-called ``Thucydides
   trap{''} of inevitable conflict between an established power and a
   rising power. This article addresses methodological problems with
   deriving policy lessons from political theory and ancient history. It
   then argues that Thucydides is more applicable to overcoming a pattern
   of leadership mistakes reminiscent of Athens' populist politics, erosion
   of international agreements and mismanagement of alliances. To meet the
   China challenge, the United States must renew its national strength with
   good governance, productive interdependence, and sustained investment in
   human capital.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between crises and democracy
   through a focus on the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. Its central
   argument is that to interpret the current pandemic purely in terms of
   its epidemiology and public health implications risks overlooking its
   potentially more significant socio-political consequences. This is
   because the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis have themselves
   become overlaid or layered-upon a pre-existing set of concerns regarding
   the performance, efficiency and capacity of democratic political
   structures. The aim of this article is to try and understand and warn
   against what might be termed a rather odd form of cross-contamination
   whereby the cynicism, negativity and frustration concerning politicians,
   political processes and political institutions that existed before the
   coronavirus outbreak is allowed to direct, define and automatically
   devalue how democratic structures are subsequently judged in terms of
   how they responded to the challenge. As such, this article focuses on
   the link between the Coronavirus crisis and the democratic crisis; or,
   more precisely, the risk that the Coronavirus crisis may mutate into and
   fuel a broader crisis of democracy.},

Abstract = {The present article seeks, through a critical look, inspired by the

   the production of space. For this reason, a historiographic analysis of
   the different periods of formation of informal settlements in the
   country and their link with the pattern of economic accumulation that
   prevails at that time is carried out.},

Abstract = {Research has underscored the agenda-setting and policy implementation
   advantages associated with the concentration of political and
   policy-making authority. But to what extent does this concentration of
   authority within health policy--making institutions determine the early
   timing and depth of non-communicable disease (NCD) policies? Are other
   factors within and outside of government more important? Comparing one
   Latin American country exhibiting a strong concentration of political
   and policy-making authority, Mexico, to one that does not, Brazil, we
   find that weaker, fragmented political and policy-making powers in
   Brazil expedited the creation and implementation of NCD programs. As
   seen in Brazil, our findings suggest that the factors that account for
   the earlier adoption of NCD policies and successful implementation are
   the early institutionalisation of societal interests and pressures
   within the bureaucracy, the ``bottom-up{''} diffusion of early policy
   ideas, and international policy recommendations. This institutional,
   participatory, and ideational approach may provide more important
   predictors for explaining variation in NCD policies.},

Abstract = {Over the past three decades, participatory methods of constitution
   making have gained increasing acceptance and are now an indispensable
   part of any constitution-making 568 process. Despite this, we know
   little about how much public participation actually affects the
   constitution. This article investigates the impact of participation in
   two groundbreaking cases: Brazil (1988) and South Africa (1996). This
   analysis demonstrates that public participation has relatively small
   effects on the text, but that it varies in systematic ways. The theory
   advanced here posits that party strength (especially in terms of
   discipline and programmatic commitments) is the key determinant of the
   effectiveness of public participation. Strong parties may be more
   effective in many ways, but they are less likely to act on input from
   the public in constitution-making processes.},

Abstract = {This work shows how the half a liter of milk campaign represented the
   collective desire for social equality, giving prominence to local
   communities and mothers to fight against infant mortality and build the
   new society. Based on ministerial files, speeches, films and political
   posters, it is argued that the half liter of milk was a means to
   establish the exercise of power by local communities and to define the
   importance of the mother in society based on her role as ``good
   mother{''}.},

Abstract = {Disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19 have proliferated,
   particularly on social media. The purpose of this paper is to show the
   rhizomic nature of COVID-19-related dis- and misinformation having
   aspect of conspiracy theories, which are used on social media platforms
   to counter the official narratives about the origins of the virus.
   Consisting of 40 news-style articles, the data was used to find out how
   a conspiracy theory about the virus being a possible man-made bioweapon
   was presented to the audience. The results indicate that the rhizomatic
   structure of COVID-19 conspiracy theories makes it possible to vary the
   narratives based on the platform where it is published and the target
   audience. Information spreads in unexpected ways, and it is difficult to
   control or predict the spread of extremist content. This makes it
   possible for different actors, governments, and organizations to use
   information for their own purposes as a weapon of information warfare.},

   highlighted the challenges of maintaining democratic accountability of
   government expenditure where public services are contracted out to
   private companies. Although not the only focus of policy debate,
   pressure is building from both parliamentarians and the Information
   Regulator to extend UK information laws to the rapidly expanding number
   of private companies holding major public sector contracts. However,
   there remains a lack of evidence as to the nature and extent of this
   accountability gap and the implications for legislative reform. This
   article presents findings on non-compliance from a comprehensive field
   experiment using Freedom of Information requests on the Private Finance
   Initiative model of outsourcing. We demonstrate the limits of Freedom of
   Information as a tool for accountability and argue both legislative and
   regulatory reform are needed to enable proper public scrutiny of
   outsourced public services.},

Abstract = {Politicians' work pressure is gaining more attention in parliamentary
   studies. To participate in the discussion about governing under
   pressure, this article offers an interdisciplinary approach to
   investigate how representatives navigate within a flexible, limitless
   work culture. This article presents a new inquiry to re-examine
   contemporary political agency by combining cultural studies theories
   with empirical insights in Nordic countries. By analysing 52
   semi-structured interviews with MPs in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, the
   study finds that politics attracts people who want to change the world,
   but these attributes may initiate a vicious cycle, taking the form of
   psychological strain.},

Abstract = {How much public and elite support is there for the use of a citizens'
   assembly - a random selection of citizens brought together to consider a
   policy issue - to tackle major, deadlock-inducing disagreements in
   deeply divided places with consociational political institutions? We
   focus on Northern Ireland and use evidence from a cross-sectional
   attitude survey, a survey-based experiment and elite interviews. We find
   that the general public support decision-making by a citizens' assembly,
   even when the decision reached is one they personally disagree with.
   However, support is lower among those with strong ideological views. We
   also find that elected politicians oppose delegating decision-making
   power to an `undemocratic' citizens' assembly, but are more supportive
   of recommendation-making power. These findings highlight the potential
   for post-conflict consociations to be amended, with the consent of the
   parties, to include citizens' assemblies that make recommendations but
   not binding policy.},

Abstract = {How do major national events influence attitudes toward non-nationals?
   Recent research suggests that national sports team wins help foster
   national pride, weaken ethnic attachments, and build trust among
   conational out-group members. This paper asks a related question: By
   heightening nationalism, do these victories also affect attitudes toward
   foreign out-groups, specifically refugees? We examine this question
   using the 2019 Africa Cup football match between Kenya and Tanzania,
   which Kenya narrowly won, coupled with an online survey experiment
   conducted with a panel of 2,647 respondents recruited through Facebook.
   We find that winning increases national pride and preferences for
   resource allocation toward conationals, but it also leads to negative
   views of refugees' contribution to the country's diversity. However, we
   present experimental evidence that reframing national sports victories
   as a product of cooperation among diverse players and highlighting
   shared superordinate identities can offset these views and help foster
   positive attitudes toward refugees.},

Abstract = {This paper advances a theoretical framework on the impact of time rules
   on the administrative coordination of policies that deal with long-term,
   transboundary challenges. Its empirical focus is on the fight against
   antimicrobial resistance-AMR. The paper's framework concerns how
   government agencies employ time rules in coordination so as to respond
   to this open-ended policy challenge. To illustrate the framework's
   usefulness to studies of coordination, the paper examines Sweden's
   intersectoral coordination on AMR. The case study draws on interviews
   and policy documents. Its findings give support to the paper's argument,
   namely that government agencies are more likely to coordinate
   voluntarily if they have discretion in setting and administering
   coordinative time rules.},

Abstract = {Long before Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion Theory, Thomas Hobbes's
   account of self-interest and risk assessment formed the basis of a
   powerful argument for the benefits of negative appeals. Dismissing the
   pursuit of highest and final goods as inherently incapable of yielding
   collective action, Hobbes proposed a method focusing instead on the
   highest evil, something that individuals with different goals could
   agree on as a barrier to their respective pursuits. In his own theory,
   that evil was violent death in the dystopian setting of his notorious
   state of nature. The staying power of Hobbes's memorable image itself
   validates Hobbes's rationale and offers important reminders regarding
   the limits of utopian appeals to collective action.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Governments are increasingly intrigued by the possibility of harnessing
   the private `social investment' market to finance the delivery of social
   services. One social investment initiative in particular - Social Impact
   Bonds (SIBs) - has spread extensively within the global North. This
   article investigates the transnational mobility of SIBs by exploring the
   adoption and implementation of SIBs in New Zealand. It considers SIBs as
   a case of `fast policy', a concept that describes both the increasing
   rapidity of policymaking and the proliferation of `best practice' policy
   models. Although the model was adopted relatively quickly in New
   Zealand, implementation spanned a number of years following various
   complications and setbacks, echoing experiences in other places. This
   article seeks to extend conceptions of policy mobility and fast policy
   by arguing for both fast and slow temporalities of policy movement,
   contending that while adoption of mobile policies tends to be rapid,
   implementation can follow a much more gradual pace as they mediate, and
   are mediated by, local political, institutional and ideological factors.},

Abstract = {In The Law of Peoples (1999), John Rawls invented a fictional Muslim
   state that he called Kazanistan. The genealogy of Kazanistan I offer
   here is the first examination of Islam in Rawls's papers. It contributes
   to a critical body of work about the Muslim Question and how
   Euro-American thinkers construct Islam. In recent years, theorists have
   turned to Rawls's papers. The archival turn, however, has neglected the
   last phase of Rawls's career and his book-length attempt at thinking
   internationally. I address this oversight and critically examine Rawls
   on Islam and global politics. I historicize Rawls's turn to Islam,
   Kazanistan's late introduction, and its transformations across drafts.
   By examining ``the Kazanistan papers,{''} I highlight the dissonance
   between Rawls's philosophical discourse on Islam and the contemporaneous
   geopolitics recorded in his archives. This disjuncture, I suggest, is
   characteristic of the logics of liberal deflection from empire and
   liberal ``inflection{''} into the Muslim Question.},

Abstract = {Shrinking audiences and political coverage cutbacks threaten newspapers'
   ability to inform the public about politics. Despite substantial
   theorizing and widespread concern, it remains unclear how much the
   public can learn from these struggling news sources. I link measures of
   the newspaper-produced information environment with large-scale surveys
   that capture the public's awareness of their member of Congress. This
   shows the contemporary effects of newspapers on representative-specific
   awareness are one-half to one-third estimates from earlier eras. Despite
   this decline newspapers remain an important contributor to political
   awareness in a changing media landscape, even for those with limited
   political interest. These results establish broader scope conditions
   under which the public can learn from the media environment.},

Abstract = {Minority groups striving for integration may support representation in
   state institutions as well as recognition measures not as ends in
   themselves but only insofar as they believe that these reforms can
   advance their full integration into mainstream society. We illustrate
   this argument by focusing on perceptions about police reforms among
   Israeli Jews of Ethiopian descent, a racial minority. Drawing on data
   from public opinion surveys, focus groups, and interviews with community
   activists, our analysis indicates that Ethiopian Israelis support
   recruitment of co-ethnic officers (representation) and cultural
   sensitivity training of police officers (recognition) because they
   believe it could change police's attitudes and behaviors. However, they
   are also conscious of the downsides of these reforms as they might
   perpetuate their stigmatization as a distinct group that requires
   special accommodation. This paper suggests that successful integration
   strategies need to take into account how minority groups view their
   status within the state's citizenship regime.},

Abstract = {This paper provides theoretical justification and empirical evidence
   linking the mode of privatization of state assets in banks and
   industries to the quality of institutions of legal and financial
   governance that underpin financial development. The evidence from
   twenty-five states of Eastern Europe suggests that allowing foreigners
   to assume the role of strategic investors in banks and industries via
   direct sale methods of divestiture of state assets contributes to legal
   and institutional development, particularly a stronger and more
   impartial legal system, better quality of bureaucratic governance, and
   stronger legal protection of creditors, while insider privatization
   schemes, such as voucher privatization or management-employee buyouts,
   do not fulfill the same role. The empirical results are robust to
   instrumental variable analysis and to the inclusion of numerous economic
   and political controls for alternative explanations.},

Abstract = {Studies on authoritarian values, which have mostly focused on
   authoritarian regimes and on democracies with spells of
   authoritarianism, suggest trust in public institutions. However, limited
   empirical evidence has been carried out in the Philippines where cycles
   of regime change and authoritarian leadership have characterized its
   post-authoritarian landscape. Examining multiple public opinion data
   from the Asian Barometer Survey, this study found that regardless of the
   political leadership across different regimes, Filipino citizens
   expressed attitudinal dispositions, i.e. conforming, anti-political
   pluralism, and support for strong leaders, that constitute authoritarian
   political values. But instead of a destabilizing effect, estimates from
   ordinary least squares indicate that Filipino citizens' authoritarian
   tendencies enhance institutional trust-seen as an indicator of support
   for the political system. The findings of this study empirically
   challenge the view of democratization in the Philippines by
   foregrounding its `populist-authoritarian' dimension. In addition, they
   provide evidence of a growing scholarship in comparative political
   studies that claims that courting confidence for political institutions
   and regime support does not necessitate a `liberal-democratic' model.},

Abstract = {We discuss the background and context of the research that went into
   Jack Walker's 1991 book, Mobilizing Interest Groups in America. Jack was
   uniquely situated to devise this research project, but it was also his
   reaction to dominant political theories of the time. The 1960s posed a
   puzzle: Groups that had previously been silent were getting mobilized.
   And yet the most powerful theoretical perspectives either said this was
   impossible, or that it was unwelcome. Jack thought otherwise. We discuss
   the reception of the book in the field, its impact on later scholars,
   and we speculate on what the profession lost when Jack was killed
   prematurely, before his book was completed, in a automobile accident.},

Abstract = {Contrasting elements of China's ``urban sickness{''} are empty new
   apartment complexes abutting dilapidated but overcrowded structures.
   While scholarship has explored these issues separately, we show their
   common presence even in the least likely of cities. Why are ghost cities
   and slums simultaneously on the rise in China? Analysis of eight of
   China's ``ghostliest{''} cities and in-depth case studies demonstrate
   how the pursuit of quantified targets generates these particular urban
   distortions. We argue that their joint rise exposes weaknesses of the
   regime's heretofore successful political economy model, which we
   summarize as the center's intentionally ``limited vision{''} into local
   governance.},

Abstract = {The desire to be more responsive to the demands of citizens complicates
   the relationship between Secretary of State and Permanent Secretary and
   has an impact on policy delivery capacity. This article considers four
   separate contributions to effective policy delivery in a context of
   increasing and increasingly variegated demands: those provided by the
   Secretary of State, Permanent Secretary, special political adviser
   (SpAd) and chair of the departmental board. Drawing on insights garnered
   through a series of interviews with key policy actors, we draw attention
   to the SpAd bridging function between Secretary of State and Permanent
   Secretary, which eases the tension between ministerial urgency for
   outcomes versus the officials' realistic appraisal of `smoothing out'
   the challenges to policy delivery. The departmental board's stewardship
   of policy delivery, meanwhile, is minimal due to the lack of
   chairmanship by the Secretary of State, requiring professional chairs to
   be appointed to this role.},

Abstract = {All four UK and devolved governments performed a `U-turn' on their
   COVID-19 school exams replacement policies. After cancelling exams, they
   sought teacher estimates on their grades, but supported an algorithm to
   standardise the results. When the results produced a public outcry over
   unfair consequences, they initially defended their decision but reverted
   quickly to teacher assessment. We explain these developments by
   comparing two `windows of opportunity' overseen by four separate
   governments, in which the definition of the problem, feasibility of each
   solution, and motive of policymakers to select one over the other
   lurched dramatically within a week of the exams results. These
   experiences highlight the confluence of events and choices and the
   timing and order of choice. A policy solution that had been rejected
   during the first window, and would have been criticised heavily if
   chosen first, became a lifeline during the second. As such, while it is
   important to understand why the standardisation process went so wrong,
   we focus on why the policymaking process went so wrong.},

Abstract = {It remains contested whether Chinese public consultation practices can
   be called local deliberative democracy or a sort of consultative
   authoritarianism. Yet, these different evaluations lack an appreciation
   of regional variations as well as underlying drivers. This study fills
   this gap by developing a political economy approach and constructing
   panel data of 36 Chinese cities over 12 years. Our study reveals that
   the functional purpose of appeasing social conflicts serves a key
   underlying incentive that drives China's deliberative turn, yet heavier
   dependence on foreign investment in a local economy hinders public
   consultation. Content analysis of 3082 public hearing documents further
   shows that adoption of public hearings varies by regions with
   economically and politically advantaged municipalities being more likely
   to adopt consultative institutions for transparency. This study brings
   together the scholarship of contentious politics and deliberative
   politics while offering a nuanced understanding of regional differences
   of public consultation.},

Abstract = {As the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along
   urban-rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities
   that are tied to one's community-type. As community-type becomes an
   important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one's community
   in-group, or denigration of one's community out-group. We explore the
   extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other
   factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the
   ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world.
   Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and
   rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type
   social identity that is independent of other factors which are
   correlated with the urban-rural divide. We use two different experiments
   to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are
   distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government
   resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job
   applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than
   other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type
   identities are important in politics.},

Abstract = {National identity claims have taken a growing importance in the French
   political landscape these last decades. While representations of French
   national identity have long been scrutinised from an elite perspective,
   much less is known about ``What is it to be French?{''} from a citizen's
   perspective. This article aims at filling this gap. Using the European
   Values Study data, from 1981 to 2018, it first offers a general measure
   of change in French people national claims during that period. Building
   on a classification, it then proposes to disentangle five different
   types of French nationalism. Finally, the article tests the explanatory
   power of these types of nationalism on support for attitudes and a few
   policy preferences which involve representations of the in-group and the
   out-group such as immigration and solidarity policies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the varying development of private household debt
   across European countries, using a mixed methods design. Quantitative
   analysis demonstrates that trade deficits, public debt and unemployment
   spending influence the volume of private debt. While this suggests a
   high problem load for Italian households, a comparative case study on
   Germany and Italy reveals that more German than Italian households end
   up in critical debt. This is explained by the two countries' different
   cultures of lending. Italian households borrow more heavily from family
   and friends than German ones. Moreover, the competitive dynamic of the
   German growth model creates incentives for low-income groups to borrow;
   to the extent this dynamic affects both countries, this translates into
   demand for more risky loans in Germany and economic pressure on families
   in Italy, ultimately limiting the compatibility of the different lending
   regimes.},

   elections despite voters' support for action on global warming
   declining. Meguid ({[}2008]. Party Competition Bbetween Unequals:
   Strategies and Electoral Fortunes in Western Europe. New York: Cambridge
   University Press) proposed that mainstream parties must decide whether
   to dismiss, accommodate, or oppose a new issue and niche party,
   predicting the impacts using the theory of `issues-based voting'. We use
   a time series of voting intention to test this theory. Mainstream party
   strategies had the predicted effects on the Greens vote. In the presence
   of a competitive niche party, mainstream parties' strategies may respond
   to the dynamics of competition, beyond the traditionally considered
   institutional and economic forces.},

Abstract = {Interrogating the limits of post-foundational accounts of political
   economy, this response to Taavi Sundell, proposes three conceptual
   shifts. First, I argue that the distinction between politics and
   economics polices a border that absolves economic questions of their
   implication in policing appropriation and political order. Second, I
   think political economy in terms of proprietary order. The notion of
   proprietary order situates reproduction in relation to regimes of
   property, material inequality and propriety: the securing of `proper'
   objects and subjects through technologies of inequality. Here I
   reconceptualize first the politics of equivalence, and second logics of
   `propertization'. I argue that post-foundationalist theorists tend to
   focus on equivalential logics in relation to populism and hegemony.
   However, they forget logics of debt and financial equivalence and thus
   cannot adequately conceptualize hegemony. Second, I rethink property as
   a technology that polices ways of being, seeing and doing. I
   characterise property as a contingent form of political articulation
   that nonetheless has sedimentary effects that haunt any present. I
   situate property in relation to the sedimented colonial legacies that
   haunt it legal forms today. How, I ask, do different proprietary and
   equivalential orders police equality and limit democracy?},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-342},

Abstract = {While previous literature has offered two broad categories of
   explanation for individual trade preferences: economic self-interest and
   non-economic factors, we contend that during times of intensified elite
   discourse on trade, individuals may follow elite opinions to form their
   opinions on trade. Utilizing data from the 2016 American National
   Election Survey, we examine the effect of Trump's protectionist views
   and rhetoric on public trade opinion. We argue that there was a ``Trump
   effect{''} on trade attitudes among the mass public in 2016 and this
   effect went beyond the party line, meaning that Trump supporters,
   regardless of their partisanship, were more likely to be influenced by
   his protectionist views and to adopt anti-free trade positions.
   Moreover, we suggest a conditional effect of political knowledge on the
   ``Trump effect{''} of trade opinion. Our empirical tests offer strong
   support for both hypotheses, suggesting a significant ``Trump effect{''}
   on public trade opinion in 2016.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the flow of demographic trends and the evolution of
   political forces in Northern Ireland has long had a predominantly binary
   focus. The many studies of the fall and rise of nationalism, and of the
   rise and fall of unionism, are based on a sometimes explicit but more
   often unspoken narrative of competition between two communities. This
   article considers an issue in relation to which a much smaller
   literature has appeared: the steady growth of an apparent middle ground.
   This is made up in part of those who were born outside Northern Ireland.
   But it also includes people who have exited from affiliation to the two
   dominant communities defined by religious background, or perhaps never
   belonged to either; of those who do not see themselves unambiguously as
   British or as Irish, but rather report a dual or alternative identity;
   and of those who identify with neither the unionist nor the nationalist
   community. Using census and survey data, the article tracks the
   evolution of this expanding section of the population, and assesses its
   implications for political choice and for the future constitutional path
   of Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Having experienced a late institutionalisation as an academic discipline
   in the 1990s, during this century the political science community in
   Spain has struggled to converge with other fully established
   counterparts in Western Europe. In this article, we analyse and evaluate
   how successful these efforts have been concerning internationalisation.
   The article sheds light on the factors that explain this development.
   Using data from PhD dissertations defended since 1990 and articles
   published on SSCI journals since 1985, we demonstrate that the
   institutional reforms affecting higher education in Spain during the
   early 2000s, and the austerity measures introduced in the first part of
   the 2010s to address the economic crisis, together with the evolution of
   the particular ecology of the discipline, introduced greater competition
   into the Spanish political science academic market. This, in turn,
   triggered internationalisation of political scientists in Spain,
   particularly among the younger cohorts.},

Abstract = {This article responds to Cowan et alts critique of our article `Losing
   sight of women's rights: the unregulated introduction of gender
   self-identification as a case study of policy capture in Scotland',
   published by Scottish Affairs 28(3) in August 2019. Cowan et al. make a
   series of strong criticisms, including of our accuracy, diligence and
   adherence to scholarly norms. We reject these as unreasonable. In our
   view, they misunderstand and misrepresent the fundamental purpose of our
   article, fail to engage with our core thesis of policy capture, and
   implausibly seek to place our view of the law beyond academic
   respectability. Their own strongly-asserted view of the law appears at
   least open to question. We argue that the problem is not with our
   scholarship falling below any normal acceptable standard, but rather
   that Cowan et al. appear to be uncomfortable with others holding and
   expressing any different view to theirs on this topic. They have
   therefore reached too quickly for assertions of incompetence or worse.
   We discuss the climate in which our original article was produced and in
   which we are now defending it. Describing our own experiences as well of
   those of other academics, we question how the scholarship needed to help
   shape policy and law in this area can take place under such conditions.},

Abstract = {Recognizing democratic backsliding and increasing support for
   authoritarianism, research on public preferences for democracy and its
   authoritarian alternatives has gained traction. Moving beyond the extant
   focus on economic determinants, our analysis examines the effect of
   national identity, demonstrating that it is a double-edged sword for
   regime preferences. Using recent European Values Survey data on 24
   European countries from 2017 to 2018, we show that civic national
   identity is associated with a higher support for democracy and lower
   support for authoritarian regimes, whereas the reverse holds for ethnic
   identities. Further, economic hardship moderates these relationships: it
   strengthens both the negative effect of ethnic national identities and,
   to some extent, the positive effect of civic national identities on
   democracy support vis-a-vis authoritarian alternatives. This has
   important implications for the survival of democracy in times of crises
   and the study of a cultural backlash, since social identity matters
   substantively for individuals' responses to economic hardship.},

   democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The study of party coalitions largely focuses on national elections in
   western democracies. How are coalitions formed in political systems in
   which competition occurs on a clientelistic rather than programmatic
   foundation? To examine coalition formation outside the context of
   western party systems, we study pre-electoral coalitions formed in
   subnational executive government elections in Indonesia. Using a unique
   dataset of 5048 such coalitions in combination with fieldwork conducted
   in several provinces, we analyze coalition patterns. In contrast to
   conventional ideological and office-seeking explanations we find that,
   at least until recently, in forming coalitions parties regularly
   prioritized immediate pay-offs from candidates - which mostly come in
   the form of cash payments - over longer-term office and patronage
   benefits. Attributing this finding to the limited influence that parties
   exert over politicians once they are elected in regional Indonesia, we
   highlight the interaction between coalition formation and the incentives
   that politicians have once in office.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Research on public perceptions of voter fraud often relies on items that
   gauge the frequency of noncitizen voting, double voting, and posing as
   someone else. Few studies explore the underlying sentiments that
   structure the concept of voter fraud and its meaning to people. Further,
   no study has examined whether these dominant survey items fully capture
   the ways in which people understand and articulate their views about
   voter fraud. We use original surveys with open-ended questions to
   explore public perceptions of voter fraud. With a combination of
   in-depth content analysis and text analysis, we find that individuals
   think of voter fraud as consisting of a wide array of actions being
   undertaken by a diverse set of actors. We also find substantial
   differences in the ways that Democrats and Republicans think about this
   issue. Our study provides important contributions to a growing
   literature on election administration and public opinion toward voter
   fraud.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How do citizens of democratic polities translate their policy
   preferences into voting choices? Proximity and directional theories of
   issue voting offer different answers to this question that have strong
   implications for parties' strategies. Controlled scenarios in imaginary
   two-candidate contests have gained popularity as a method to estimate
   proportions of proximity and directional voters in the population.
   However, this method is not always applicable in comparative research
   where scholars often have to study multiparty elections with
   observational data. In the present paper, I demonstrate how relative
   prevalence of different issue voting rules can be estimated using finite
   mixture modeling. Using both a paradigmatic and a recent case, I
   demonstrate that the mixture model predicts observed voting choices
   better than the alternatives. I also show how finite mixture modeling
   can be used to study individual-level characteristics of proximity and
   directional voters using education as an example.},

Abstract = {The conversation with Dr Nyla Ali Khan focuses on the issue of Kashmir
   that has remained the most contested subject since the independence of
   India and Pakistan. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has a history that is
   unique owing to its socio-political conditions, demography and
   geography. It perhaps needs a very critical intervention by historians,
   litterateurs and politicians. The conversation emphasizes Dr Khan's
   views on Kashmir, Kashmiri, and Kashmiriyat, and the current
   socio-political situation of the region along with its history has been
   dismantled by the politics, militancy, and militaries of both the
   Nation-states of India and Pakistan.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of states have adopted laws that require voters to
   show photo identification to vote. We show that the differential effect
   of the laws on turnout among those who lack ID persists even after the
   laws are repealed. We leverage administrative data from North Carolina
   and a photo ID law in effect for a primary, but not the subsequent
   general, election. Using exact matching and a difference-in-differences
   design, we show that for the 3 percent of voters who lack ID in North
   Carolina, the ID law caused a 0.7 percentage point turnout decrease in
   the 2016 primary election relative to those with ID. After the law was
   suspended, this effect persisted: those without ID were 2.6 percentage
   points less likely to turnout in the 2016 general election and 1.7
   percentage points less likely to turnout in the 2018 general.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {203-220},

Abstract = {This paper responds to critics of Reinhold Niebuhr by exploring two
   themes important for locating his views on cruelty's emergence in modern
   society. The first relates to his basic insight into the relationship
   between individual morality and group loyalty and solidarity. Niebuhr
   provides a sophisticated argument for such group dynamics in his work,
   issued in Moral Man, Immoral Society, as well as his essays on race.
   These also form the basis for his second thematic argument regarding
   cruelty, the role of `righteousness' as it relates to security and
   insecurity. Niebuhr's views on race, I argue, need to be considered more
   broadly as an example of his views on groups, power, and cruelty. The
   paper concludes with some modest proposals for thinking about combatting
   cruelty via Niebuhr's counsel.},

Abstract = {We theorize and measure a situational self-censorship that varies across
   spatial-temporal political contexts. Schelling's insight that
   distinctive times and places function as focal points has generated a
   literature explaining how activists coordinate for protest in
   authoritarian states. Our population of interest is not activists but
   ordinary citizens, who, we assume, are risk-averse and prefer to avoid
   trouble. Focal points rally activists for political expression. By
   contrast, we theorize, ordinary citizens exercise greater than usual
   political self-censorship at focal points, to avoid punishment as
   troublemakers. We test our theory by leveraging geotagged smartphone
   posts of Beijing netizens on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, to
   estimate precisely if, when, where, and how citizens engage in political
   talk. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that compares
   smartphone political talk at and away from focal places before and after
   focal times. We find netizens self-censor political talk significantly
   more at potentially troublesome spatial-temporal focal points.},

   The Foundations of Affective Polarization in the Swedish Multiparty
   System},

Abstract = {Currently, very little is known about the individual level foundations
   of affective polarization outside the US context. This paper addresses
   this research gap by exploring the predictors of affective polarization
   in Sweden, using nationally representative survey data. From 2010 till
   the 2018 elections, the Swedish multiparty system was divided into two
   affectively converged mainstream party blocs that were moderately
   polarized between each other, and an asymmetrically polarized populist
   right party that invoked significantly more hostility from the
   supporters of mainstream parties than vice versa. To unpack the
   foundations of affective polarization in such a tripolar configuration,
   we employ a methodological approach that distinguishes not just between
   in- and outparties but also in- and out-blocs, and separates different
   conflict dimensions. We find that: (1) voters with stronger partisan
   identities and more extreme political attitudes exhibit higher levels of
   affective polarization. The latter, however, is a better predictor of
   direct dislike towards political opponents; (2) the effects of political
   attitudes correspond to the tripolar nature of the party system: while
   affective polarization between the centre-right and -left blocs is
   mostly driven by socioeconomic positions, the hostility towards Sweden
   Democrats links predominantly to cultural issues, most notably
   immigration; (3) institutional trust has a two-edged relationship with
   affective polarization: populist right voters that trust the country's
   central institutions more, are less polarized towards mainstream blocs,
   whereas among centre-right voters, higher trust associates with stronger
   animosity towards Sweden Democrats. We believe that these findings could
   have broad implications for affective polarization research in
   multiparty systems.},

Abstract = {The Salafi Mosque in Birmingham, England, is a hub of European
   salafiyya. It is the center of a vibrant network of online and print
   publications, and hundreds of Muslims attend its prayers. Based on a
   field study at the mosque that included a written survey with a sample
   of male attendees and twenty-three interviews with attendees and local
   leaders, the article challenges the common perception of salafiyya as an
   approach that inherently involves provocative and costly personal
   choices and demonstrates the nuanced and ambivalent aspects of its
   radicalism. It suggests that affiliation with the Salafi Mosque allows a
   sense of moral superiority while requiring little intellectual effort
   and few social and financial commitments and that the mosque provides
   space for the articulation of strong anti-liberal views while avoiding
   the perils of political activism that directly challenges the mainstream
   of society. The article also shows how several of the qualities that
   make the mosque appealing to some Muslims result in its marginalization.},

Abstract = {Terrorism is a controversial term, not only in politics but also in
   political science. The reason for this controversy seems to be that
   labeling political violence as terrorism is connected with a value
   judgment: Terrorism is considered illegitimate violence, as opposed to
   resistance, which is also illegal but understood to be legitimate at the
   same time. The common academic definitions of terrorism try to avoid
   such valuation and define terrorism as a tactic and thus as a means to
   an end, but the analysis or selection of the empirical phenomena is
   necessarily preceded by a valuation. In contrast, this article develops
   a conception of terrorism that systematically includes the goals and
   thus the question of legitimation of political violence. The proposed
   conceptualization takes as a starting point the self-concept of the
   actors of political violence, who necessarily regard the violence they
   perpetrate as legitimate and thus as resistance, and measures the
   justification of this self-ascription by the classic justification of
   violent resistance. On this basis, this article develops a multilevel
   standard for distinguishing legitimate and illegitimate political
   violence, abstracting from the moral convictions of the actors.},

Abstract = {Learning in extremist settings is often treated as operational, with
   little regard to how aspiring participants in extremist settings engage
   with complex and abstract ideological material. This paper examines
   learning in the context of the amorphous network of digital channels
   that compose the extreme-right online milieu. Through an in-depth
   qualitative analysis, we explore how well the prevailing model of
   extremist ideological learning (in `communities of practice') accounts
   for the behaviour of aspiring participants of Fascist Forge, a
   now-defunct extreme-right web forum. The findings suggest that some of
   the social aspects of communities of practice have been replicated in
   the online setting of Fascist Forge. However, for a combination of
   technical and ideological reasons, the more directed and nurturing
   aspects of learning have not. Several issues are raised about the role
   of ideological learning in online communities, notably the open
   accessibility of extremist material, the lack of ideological control
   leading to potential mutation and innovation by self-learners, and the
   role of digital learning in the preparation, shaping and recruitment of
   individuals for real world organising and activism.},

Abstract = {In the 1990s, many left-wing parties abandoned their traditional
   economic policies and adopted more pro-market economic stances. Central
   and Eastern Europe offers a useful context to explore the impact of
   these policies on the electoral fortunes of the left-wing parties that
   adopted them. Although rewarded at first with electoral victories, the
   adaptation of pro-market positions had a less straightforward impact on
   the left-wing parties' electoral fortunes in the long run. CHES data on
   party positions and ESS survey data on party support show that
   pro-market left parties obtain reduced support; this effect is
   particularly pronounced among the economically vulnerable occupational
   groups. In countries with more pro-market left parties, these groups
   have a higher propensity to vote for right-wing parties. These findings
   highlight important parallels between the dynamics of Western and
   Central and Eastern European party systems.},

Abstract = {The issue of sovereignty has never been resolved in Scotland. The 1998
   Scotland Act, creating the Scottish Parliament affirmed that the
   Westminster Parliament is sovereign, but this is disputed. In practice,
   the issue was left largely in abeyance as sovereignty was seen as an
   outdated concept. The Scottish independence referendum of 2014 and the
   UK Brexit referendum of 2016 both brought back the question of
   sovereignty in stark terms. Analysis of data from the British Election
   Study of 2019 with regard to (a) the right of Scottish
   self-determination, and (b) the right of a UK-wide majority to take
   Scotland out of the EU, allows us to identify `sovereigntists' and
   `unionists'. Sovereigntists, on both dimensions, now constitute a
   majority. A smaller group of unionists reject both positions. There
   remains a group of `semi-sovereigntists' who accept Scottish
   self-determination, but also that the UK as a whole should decide on
   Brexit. Controlling for the social and political factors, Scots are
   increasingly polarised around issues of sovereignty, which have become
   central to contemporary Scottish politics.},

Abstract = {This article studies the ideological roots of the particular form of
   party democracy that was established in Germany and Italy after 1945.
   Given the deeply rooted tradition of anti-party politics and the
   previous failure to construct stable party democracies, it is remarkable
   that political parties evolved into the central actors of post-1945
   democratic regimes in Germany and Italy. This article investigates how
   postwar reforms in this regard build on ideological assumptions put
   forward in the Interwar era. It centres on two thinkers who not only
   epitomized the historical continuity before and after the War, but also
   made a major impact on the reform of political institutions after 1945.
   Costantino Mortati and Gerhard Leibholz not only inspired political
   reformers with their writings, but also fostered party-state democracy
   during their tenures as constitutional court judges. As such, their
   views on political parties are of crucial importance in understanding
   why the postwar regimes took the shape of a `party-state democracy'.},

Abstract = {Power, culture or role, preceded by adjectives such as civilian, tamed,
   reflexive, hegemonic, commercial realpolitik or shaping, are commonly
   used to portray German foreign and security policy. When scholars and
   pundits aggregate explanatory factors on the national level, even in
   democracies, they assume that a significant degree of agreement exists
   among domestic actors at any point in time. Assuming that actors within
   national conceptual boundaries share similar values and preferences can
   create a blind spot for important subnational variation. To capture
   political cleavages and ultimately provide a picture of when to expect
   policy change and in what form, this paper asks: what is the role of
   parties and party leadership in formulating German foreign and security
   policy? I argue that we need to look at political parties' sub-national
   and intersubjective constructions of purpose to understand the
   variegated expressions of what could and should be the `national' norm
   at any point in time (and what is contested). Ultimately, this helps
   explaining how stable so-called national preferences are.},

Abstract = {The public goods theory of alliances exerts substantial influence on
   scholarship and policy, especially through its claim that small alliance
   participants free-ride on larger partners. Prior statistical tests of
   free-riding suffer from model specification and generalizability
   problems, however, so there is little reliable and general evidence
   about this prediction. In this study, I address those limitations with a
   new test of the free-riding hypothesis. Using data on 204 alliances from
   1919 to 2007, I examine how often states with a small share of total GDP
   in an alliance decrease military spending while states with a large
   share of allied GDP increase military spending. I find little evidence
   to support this expression of the free-riding hypothesis. This implies
   that free-riding based on economic weight is unusual in alliance
   politics, which may be due to limits on alliance security as a public
   good or bargaining between alliance members.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to the people of
   sinking island states. When their territories inevitably disappear,
   what, if anything, do the world's remaining territorial states owe them?
   According to a prominent `nationalist' approach to territorial rights -
   which distributes such rights according to the patterns of attachment
   resulting from people's incorporation of particular territories into
   their ways of life - the islanders are merely entitled to immigrate, not
   to reestablish territorial sovereignty. Even GHG-emitting collectives
   have no reparative duty to cede territory, as the costs of upsetting
   their territorial attachments are unreasonable to impose, even on
   wrongdoers. As long as they allow climate refugees to immigrate,
   receiving countries have done their duty, or so the nationalist argues.
   In this article, I demonstrate that the nationalist's alleged
   distributive equilibrium is unstable. When the islanders lay claim to
   new territory, responsible collectives have a duty to modify their way
   of life - gradually downsizing their territorial attachments - such that
   the islanders, in time, may receive a new suitable territory.
   Importantly, by deriving this duty from the nationalist's own moral
   commitments, I discard the traditional assumption that nationalist
   premises imply a restrictive view on what we owe climate refugees.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {386-398},
Abstract = {Recent research on territorial preferences focuses on explaining who
   supports or opposes independence. However, this research overlooks the
   relevance of an ``intermediate{''} category of citizens who may oppose
   the territorial status quo of a sub-state territory but not support
   independence. We use evidence from the critical case of Catalonia to
   illustrate the relevance of individuals with such preferences for
   policies and outcomes highly relevant to secessionist conflicts. We
   present four sets of findings using two-wave panel data from December
   2017 (just prior to the December regional elections when Catalan
   independence was the most salient and contentious issue) and September
   2018. First, we find that a sizable plurality within Catalonia supports
   greater autonomy short of independence; conventional sociodemographic
   variables explaining support for independence do not strongly account
   for this preference. Second, such pro-autonomy individuals have
   considerably more intermediate attitudes regarding the key ``on the
   ground{''} actions that the Spanish and Catalan governments pursued
   during the crucial independence drive in 2017. They were more opposed
   than pro-independence individuals to the unilateral independence
   efforts, and more opposed than pro-status quo individuals to the Spanish
   government's actions to counter these efforts. Third, they expressed
   emotions around the secessionist conflict similar to pro-status quo
   individuals. Finally, using an embedded survey experiment, we find that
   pro-autonomy individuals are more trusting of both the central and
   regional governments regarding their abiding by an agreement to resolve
   the conflict, and are less easily ``polarized{''} through priming.
   Overall, these findings indicate the importance of further analyzing
   individuals with intermediate territorial views in secessionist
   conflicts.},

Abstract = {We argue that hostile sexism and racial resentment play an important and
   somewhat underappreciated role in American elections through their
   influence on voter turnout and engagement with political campaigns. The
   effects of these attitudes are not straightforward but depend on
   partisanship. We evaluate whether high levels of racial resentment and
   hostile sexism cross-pressure Democratic partisans, resulting in lower
   levels of political participation. We further consider whether high
   levels of racial resentment and hostile sexism bolster participation
   among Republicans. We find evidence of these divergent effects on the

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-73},
Abstract = {Recently, a new government of Ontario decided to replace the province's
   health care system with a different approach to the management of health
   services. The major portion of the change meant that several regional
   health agencies would be combined into a single health authority. The
   decision mirrored one that had been made ten years earlier in Alberta,
   which allows for an opportunity to assess the decision of Ontario. This
   paper compares the performance of the single authority in Alberta and
   the regional authorities in Ontario for the past ten years. A superior
   performance by Alberta would suggest that the single authority is
   preferable to the regional arrangement and that Ontario had made a sound
   decision. A contrary result would give reason for believing differently.
   The comparison indicates that the Ontario government might have been too
   hasty in opting for a single health authority.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the functioning of digital public diplomacy in
   Mexico and Chile. The methodology used was qualitative and comparative.
   The two countries have a presence in cyberspace, both in web pages and
   social media. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very active on
   social media, while the Chilean Foreign Ministry developed a presence in
   cyberspace later, but progressively it is positioning itself with an
   agenda that emphasizes its major foreign policy issues. Interaction is
   the aspect that has less development in both cases.},

Title = {A Reassessment of the Turkish Party System},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-289},
Abstract = {Modern political institutions have a long history in Turkey but because
   of limited competition until 1945 and military interventions in 1960,
   1971, 1980, and 1997, the party system has not developed consistently.
   Moreover, the electoral system, particularly the 10\% electoral
   threshold applied after 1980, directly affected the Turkish party
   system. Having been interrupted by non-democratic forces and attempted
   to be formed via political engineering, the development of Turkish
   political parties and party systems has not been linear. In recent
   years, there has been an increasing amount of literature on the Turkish
   party system. However, since most studies were based on inadequate
   empirical data and limited to the 1990s and the 2000s, they have
   generally focused on the predominant party system and failed to
   critically review discussions on party systems. This paper analyzes
   Turkish party systems from 1950 to the present using the quantitative
   method. Adopting the criteria of the number of relevant parties and
   their relative strengths, this study applies different indicators such
   as the effective number of parties and fragmentation. This paper argues
   that Turkey has experienced four main different forms of party systems
   since 1950: a two-party system (1950-1960 and 2002), a two and a half
   party system (1960-1980), a moderate multiparty system with a balance
   among parties (1991-1999), and a moderate multiparty system with one
   dominant party (1983-1987, and 2007-2018).},

Abstract = {The promotion of Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development is one of
   the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda, and considered a key means of
   implementation. The 2030 Agenda, while noble and necessary to put
   humanity on a sustainable path, has vastly exacerbated the complexity
   and ambiguity of development policymaking. This article challenges two
   assumptions that are common in both policy discussions and associated
   scholarly debates: First, the technocratic belief that policy coherence
   is an authentically attainable objective; and second, whether efforts to
   improve the coherence within and across policies make achieving the
   Sustainable Development Goals more likely. We unpack the conventional
   `win-win' understanding of the policy coherence concept to illustrate
   that fundamentally incompatible political interests continue to shape
   global development, and that these cannot be managed away. We argue that
   heuristic, problem-driven frameworks are needed to promote coherence in
   settings where these fundamental inconsistencies are likely to persist.
   Instead of mapping synergies ex-ante, future research and policy debates
   should focus on navigating political trade-offs and hierarchies while
   confronting the longer-term goal conflicts that reproduce unsustainable
   policy choices.},

Abstract = {China's trade relations with the rest of the world, affected by the

   are the central aspects of this work. In it, we propose to review
   China's economic ties with the three North American countries. The
   analysis will be carried out keeping the historical perspective,
   analyzing chronologically and reasonably first the immediate antecedents
   and then those that occur before the threat of the spread of the lethal
   virus. It highlights how the economic ties of the Asian giant's
   relationship with this region have been upset, integrated into an
   integration mechanism that succeeded NAFTA in a context of uncertainty.
   It is reviewed case by case and in a comprehensive way, how, in the face
   of this global health threat, the links between the power of the eastern
   Pacific and the western bloc of said ocean behave.},

   continued domestic hostility before it can be said to be a lasting
   realignment. A great deal with depend less on the Social Democratic
   Party that is largely responsible for bringing it about with the support
   of German Greens, and more on the willingness of the Christian
   Democratic Union, their Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union
   and the German voting public to adopt a more interventionist fiscal
   policy as well, generating shared commitments to economic policy at home
   and in Europe. That has not happened yet.},

Abstract = {The article presents an outline of the biography and the main phases of
   the scientific, political and teaching activities of Charles E. Merriam
   (1874-1953), setting the stage for the publication of the Russian
   translation of his work The Present State of the Study of Politics
   (1921). The author examines Merriam's contribution to the development of
   Political Science in the United States, primarily his New Science of
   Politics program, aimed at achieving a new quality of political research
   and teaching discipline, which should not be confined to the narrow
   framework of purely theoretical reflection. According to Merriam, only
   the update of methodological tools (in particular, widely borrowing
   methods from natural sciences, especially biology), productive
   interaction with other branches of knowledge and a general reorientation
   to systematic expert support of public administration can ensure the
   transformation of Political Science into a truly scientific discipline.
   The article analyzes the role of Merriam in the formation of the Chicago
   School of Political Studies, his participation in providing expertise to
   the public administration, including F.D.Roosevelt's New Deal. The
   article demonstrates that, being a product of its time, the canonical
   text of Merriam has not lost its relevance today, stimulating a new
   understanding of the criteria for the scientific nature of political
   knowledge and touching on a number of issues that are still acute for
   modern political scientists.},

Abstract = {The state of emergency at COVID-19 tests the capabilities of the world's
   governments, in contexts of increasing political conflict, where social
   needs and aspirations for justice and equity grow exponentially, all
   which impact on the structuring of a post-coronavirus order with
   uncertain characteristics. In this sense, through a documentary
   methodology and the analysis of official government management data, the
   objective of the article is to describe the meaning of transparency and
   governance policies implemented within the framework of the health
   crisis of the pandemic of the new coronavirus, from the perspective of
   the open government with special emphasis on the cases of Chile and
   Colombia. The main findings of the research emphasize that open data
   policy is a necessary condition for qualitatively increasing the levels
   of governance and transparency of public management in crisis
   management, all of which makes it possible to conclude that the open
   government model makes public information available to the citizen that
   positions him as a watchdog for government activities but, at the same
   time, the data, being timely and comprehensive, promote the creation of
   initiatives for collective benefit.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of fiscal reform efforts in Middle East oil
   producers, this article proposes a general framework for understanding
   how citizens relate to welfare benefits in the rentier state and then
   tests some observable implications using original survey data from the
   quintessential rentier state of Qatar. Using two novel choice
   experiments, we ask Qataris to choose between competing forms of
   economic subsidies and state spending, producing a clear and reliable
   ordering of welfare priorities. Expectations derived from the
   experiments about the individual-level determinants of rentier reform
   preferences are then tested using data from a follow-up survey. Findings
   demonstrate the importance of non-excludable public goods, rather than
   private patronage, for upholding the rentier bargain.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the issues of restrictions on the
   freedom of information that has arisen under the impact of the novel
   coronavirus outbreak. Another goal of the paper is identifying ways to
   protect such rights or to indicate which amendments to the law might be
   of use. The research methodology is based on general and special
   scientific methods, in particular: analytical, comparative-legal,
   systemic, and structural. The structure of the work includes: the review
   of international and Ukrainian legislation related to the freedom of
   information; the possibilities of its restriction; possible ways to
   enabling safe and secure management of the freedom of information during
   the coronacrisis. An analysis of international experience was carried
   out, as well as aspects of the protection of civil liberties such as
   freedom of speech, the right of peaceful assembly, etc. Several
   problematic issues were identified. Although, the general results of the
   study can be interpreted as alarming trends in the field of human rights
   and civil liberties. Particularly, it is multiple violations of the
   freedom of information all around the world under quarantine
   restrictions.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the concept of supreme power,
   which, according to the author, is undeservedly neglected by the modern
   Political Science. Despite the high importance of this concept, its
   definition is lacking in dictionaries, as well as most textbooks and
   reviews.
   Legal Science and State Studies have known this concept at least since
   the 16th century. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the works
   of such scientists as Boris Chicherin, Alexander Alekseev, Nikolay
   Korkunov, Georg Jellinek, Lev Tikhomirov, Petr Kazansky the academic
   consensus was formed that supreme power can be defined as legally
   unlimited, complete and unconditional power in the state. At the
   beginning of the 21st century, the interest in this category has
   revived, which resulted, in particular, in the previous concepts
   becoming relevant again.
   After having critically analyzed the existing ideas of the Russian
   researchers on this topic, the author comes to the conclusion that
   elaboration of the relevant theory of the supreme power that lives up to
   the modern level of knowledge, requires interdisciplinary approach and
   combined effort from lawyers, political scientists, historians, and
   sociologists. Having convincingly demonstrated that today this task is
   still far from being complete, he focuses on a number of key problems
   for the development of such a theory and outlines possible directions
   for finding their solution. According to his conclusion, the category
   ``supreme power{''} has a significant heuristic potential, and its
   ``return{''} to political, as well as constitutional and legal, science
   would enrich their methodological tools. In particular, its application
   to the analysis of political systems makes it possible to discern behind
   the facade of the constitutional separation of powers not only who
   governs (i.e., exercises this or that authority granted by the
   constitution), but also who rules i.e., has the right to make final
   decisions on key issues of political life.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a rise in prominence - at both national and
   European levels - of anti-gender movements and parties. While actors
   using this rhetoric can be found across most EU member states,
   anti-gender rhetoric represents government policy in a few East-Central
   European countries, bringing these objections to the European level. In
   this article, we analyse and interpret this ECE-led state opposition to
   `gender' by examining the diversification of the meaning of this term at
   EU level, including a shift from a structural to an individualist one,
   which we argue lends empirical credibility to the anti-gender rhetoric
   of right-wing populist parties. Based on interviews with EU stakeholders
   in the European Commission, European Parliament and EU-level civil
   society, as well as on the analysis of European Commission documents and
   Council Conclusions, we track the use of the term `gender' and the
   definition which has been attached to it. We conclude that these changes
   result at least in part from feminist taboos and neoliberal tendencies
   within feminist theory arriving to the EU polity. We believe that the
   shifts around the concept of gender on the progressive side shed light
   on the popularity of the anti-gender discourse and of the right-wing
   itself.},

Abstract = {Home services - in which working-class women make up the majority of the
   workforce - arrived on the European agenda in the 1990s. Since then, the
   attention of European institutions has focused on two main issues:
   labour market participation and workers' and human rights. What has been
   the role of workers' and employers' representatives in the emergence and
   shaping at European level of this new area of focus? This article shows
   that national and European business/employers' federations cooperated
   with the European Commission to frame home service work as a means of
   increasing employment rates but that alternative policy frames for
   home-based services also appeared. The activities of the International
   Labour Organisation (ILO) contributed to bringing frames that had
   developed in parallel to converge at European level.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is dedicated to modern challenges related to
   the implementation of legal guarantees within tax legal relationships.
   Legal guarantees within tax legal relations are the embodiment of the
   constitutional and legal guarantees of human and civil rights and, at
   the same time, act as an integrated intersectoral tool, covering both
   the administrative, financial and tax spheres respectively. The
   methodological basis of the article consisted of a set of general and
   special methods of scientific knowledge that, when applied, provide the
   opportunity to achieve the stated objective and ensure the scientific
   reliability and validity of the theoretical conclusions obtained. It is
   concluded that, to implement the potential to ensure taxpayers' choice
   of alternative methods of taxation, it is necessary to create conditions
   for commercial entities to perform the appropriate calculations and make
   the appropriate decisions. Entrepreneurs should receive government help
   in this through various electronic services.},

Abstract = {Subnational analyses of political preferences are substantively relevant
   and offer advantages for causal inference. Yet, our knowledge on
   regional political preferences across Europe is limited, not least
   because there is a lack of adequate data. The rich Eurobarometer (EB)
   data is a promising source for European-wide regional information. Yet,
   it is only representative for the national level. This paper compares
   state-of-the-art methods for estimating regional preferences from
   nationally representative EB data, validating predictions with
   regionally representative surveys. Our analysis highlights a number of
   challenges for estimating regional preferences across Europe, such as
   data availability, variable selection, and over-fitting. We find that
   predictions are best using a Bayesian additive regression tree with
   synthetic post-stratification.},

Title = {The POS and the peace process in Colombia: the case of the Revolutionary
   Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army in its process of party
   adaptation},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the process of the party adaptation of the
   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army, FARC-EP, based
   on Sidney Tarrow's conception of the political opportunity structure
   -POS-. It aims to answer the question of what were the different factors
   of the POS present in the Colombian political and social context and how
   did they influence the FARC-EP to abandon arms and join the Colombian
   political system as a new political party with a presence in democratic
   institutions, leaving arms behind and exchanging them for words.
   Methodologically, a documentary analysis is carried out from the
   theoretical perspective of the concept of Tarrow's political opportunity
   structure, collecting the main influencing factors in the concept of the
   EOP. It concludes that the FARC-EP knew how to take advantage of the
   different opportunities open in the EOP through increased pressure on
   different sectors to achieve the desired changes and thus culminate in
   the approval of the Havana Peace Agreements and their adaptation to a
   political party.

Volume = {122},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The paper develops the Habermasian thesis of ``mutual conditioning{''}
   between law and democracy, in a unity of understanding and action,
   aiming to contribute to its elucidation. From the Kantian theory of law,
   Habermas combines individual autonomy with public autonomy and
   elaborates a communicational version in which the modern political
   community, constituted by all social actors, perceives itself as a
   mutual intersubjectivity of positions in order to affirm, to make
   individual freedom grow and develop. Communicative action guarantees
   that plurals combine ``anonymously{''} so as not to harm the individual
   or individual freedom, recognizing, however, the tension existing in
   this communicative action, since the public space accessible to all must
   autonomously enable everyone to express their opinions. Habermas
   acknowledges the impossibility of perfect ``consensus{''} in a society
   built on the full autonomy of the co-societarians, which keeps
   communicational action permanently active. The legitimacy of ``law and
   democracy{''} is formed in the public space with the equal participation
   of all social actors in order to `signify' a legitimate legality. In
   effect, communicational action provides a democracy free from all forms
   of instrumentalization that will take the place once occupied by
   contractualism.},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {There is an increasing body of research analyzing the consequences of
   populism on democracy. So far, however, not enough attention has been
   devoted to the relationship between populists in power and public
   support for the political system. The present study is a contribution to
   bridging current research on these topics. It argues that populist
   presidents enhance regime legitimacy, but only among those citizens who
   voted for the winning candidate in the last presidential elections.
   Based on data from 18 Latin American countries, the analysis reveals
   that populist presidents increase the winner-loser gap in citizen's
   system support, trust in institutions, external efficacy, and
   satisfaction with democracy. These findings provide evidence that
   winners might support a regime where democracy is at risk or is already
   backsliding.},

   have often imposed blockades and embargoes on other states. More
   recently, sanctions have been used to limit trade in goods and services

   sanctions have become an important tool for states and international
   organizations. But they also raise numerous problems for the
   international legal order in the globalized world. The legal regulation
   of sanction regimes is only getting started.},

   Governance Perspective},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {428-438},
Abstract = {With the growing populations and range of large wild mammals in Europe,
   wildlife governance has grown in importance and provoked social
   conflicts, pressuring policy-makers to provide adequate policy
   responses. Some countries chose decentralised approaches, while others
   retain traditional top-down mechanisms. However, evolutionary mechanisms
   behind those changes and their impact on steering have attracted
   relatively little attention. We investigated the evolution of the
   governance of three wildlife species (European bison, moose, and wolf)
   in Poland (1945-2020) to map their existing paths and explore external
   and internal factors influencing steering patterns. The results suggest
   that despite the persistent dominance of state-centred governance and
   top-down hierarchical instruments characteristic for a post-socialist
   country, steering involved intense and often informal communication with
   influential actors. A growing diversity of actors and discourses in
   wildlife governance increased the state's steering options and improved
   conservation outcomes. Concurrently, the government's steering shifted
   from concrete policy results to managing tensions and interests within
   the field. These transformations helped to retain the effectiveness of
   steering in the changing context, while retaining state-dominated
   governance.},

Abstract = {Through a documentary methodology the article is devoted to the study of
   special confiscation as a measure of criminal law, which was introduced
   in Ukrainian legislation on the path of transformation and reform in the
   institution of confiscation of property. The study found that the
   emergence of a special forfeiture was mainly dictated by Ukraine's
   choice of European integration and the need to fulfil its obligations to
   bring domestic criminal law into line with European standards and
   international legal practice in the fight against crime. The article
   discusses the provisions of criminal law on the regulation of special
   confiscation as another measure of criminal law and considers the main
   problematic aspects of this institution in the doctrine of Ukrainian
   criminal law. The correlation between general confiscation and special
   confiscation was revealed in the article. It was concluded that these
   two types of seizures are different in a legal nature. The confiscation
   of property is a type of additional punishment and, the special
   confiscation of property is an independent type of other measures of the
   nature of criminal law.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that a Marxist transhumanism is politically and
   ethically incoherent. While it is true that transhumanists and Marxists
   believe that human beings are self-determining, self-transforming,
   transhumanists are committed to transcending the material conditions of
   organic life. Their ultimate aim is to encourage the emergence of an
   artificial superintelligence whose self-creative capacities are not
   limited by the needs of organic life forms. Socialism, by contrast, is a
   political and ethical movement committed to ending the suffering caused
   by capitalism, by changing social institutions and the values according
   to which resources are distributed and utilized. The success of the
   transhumanist project would render all social and political theories and
   institutions obsolete. The socialist use of technology would expand
   human life-capacities while preserving the ties of mutual need that link
   us together and make human life meaningful and worthwhile.},

Abstract = {In the context of economies referred to as diverse or different,
   Alternative Economic Practices (AEP) are actions that, alternative to
   capitalism in varying degrees, aim to fulfil people's basic needs. The
   Great Recession of 2008 gives a new incentive to their theoretical and
   empirical analysis as a result of the new meaning given to alternative
   economic and political spaces, particularly in an area hit hard by the
   crisis - Southern Europe. This paper examines an aspect hardly
   represented in academic literature: the profile of the social basis of
   alternative economic practices and its operational significance.
   By means of the frameworks provided by institutional economic geography
   and contributions made by the theory on urban social movements as well
   as social mobilisation, it explores the characteristics of the social
   basis of Spanish AEP using that which prior studies highlighted from the
   profile of the participants in Greek practices as a point of comparison
   and reference. We suggest that the contextual conditions determine the
   attributes of the key actors and the strategies to challenge the
   existing social institutions and structures and mobilise the social
   forces to support collective projects that contradict the dominant
   relations. The result is that of nominally identical AEP, belonging to a
   common alternative repertoire yet composed of social bases with clearly
   distinct profiles. This means that both are built upon different values,
   discourses, motivations and identities, leading to their varied
   geographical significance and potential to transform.},

Abstract = {This article studies the participation of young people in the Border
   Integration and Development Committee (CIDF), a novel space in the
   Chilean-Peruvian bilateral relationship. Youth are studied as emerging
   actors in inter-regional (para)diplomatic activity between Arica and
   Tacna. My objective is to ethnographically interpret their participation
   in the bilateral forums known as the Binational Youth Council of Tacna
   Arica. The trajectories of these actors are retrieved and analyzed, as
   is their process of convergence with other more institutionalized actors
   in bilateral venues. The results characterize youth through the dynamics
   of otherness amongst a plurality of actors. This analyzes showcases
   youths as emerging, though usually invisible players in traditional
   international relations debates.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to establish the incidence of disaster
   risk management on the environmental awareness of students of the police
   training center for officers - Peru. The approach was quantitative,
   substantive, and non-experimental, transactional design. For this study,
   the population had 1309 students from the police training center. The
   sample consisted of 186 students drawn through an intentional
   non-probability sampling. The technique used was the survey and the
   instruments were questionnaires, with a dichotomous and Likert scale, it
   was validated through expert judgment and its reliability determined by
   Kuder Richardson - 20 and Cronbach's Alpha and in terms of inferential
   statistics it was used, ordinal logistic regression. It was concluded
   that disaster risk management significantly affects the environmental
   awareness of students from the police training center for officers of
   Peru, 2020. Since the likelihood ratio is significant (p<0.05);
   adjusting well to the data (Deviation with p<0.05); and it explains
   53.4\% of the dependent variable environmental awareness. Likewise,
   there is a significant incidence of the disaster risk management
   variable in the dimensions of the dependent variable; cognitive,
   affective, active, and conative. In the dimensions, the significance
   value was less than p<0.05.},

Abstract = {Fiscal policy surveillance, including the possibility to impose
   financial sanctions, has been an important feature of Economic and
   Monetary Union since its inception. With the reform of fiscal rules in
   the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt crisis, coercive
   provisions have been made stricter and the Commission has formally
   gained power vis-a-vis the Council. Nevertheless, sanctions under the
   Stability and Growth Pact for budgetary non-compliance have so far not
   been imposed. This article asks why the Commission has until now
   refrained from proposing such sanctions. Using minimalist
   process-tracing methods, three post-crisis cases in which the imposition
   of fines was possible, are analysed. Applying an adaptation of normative
   institutionalism, it is argued that the mechanism entitled
   ``normative-strategic minimum enforcement{''} provides an explanation of
   why no sanctions are imposed in the cases studied: Given that the
   Commission does not perceive punitive action as appropriate, it
   strategically refrains from applying the enforcement provisions to their
   full extent.},

Title = {CONCEPTUALIZING THE COMMON EUROPEAN HOME: A FRENCH VISION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-24},
Abstract = {The ``Common European Home{''} (maison commune europeenne) is a
   political project and civil society strategy which prioritises the
   cultural similarities of the peoples of Europe in relation to
   integration amongst nation-states. The purpose of this study is to trace
   the specifics regarding the conceptualization of this principle in its
   form of political mythology (political metaphor) as fed by media and
   artistic discourses. The study conducts an innovative analysis of the
   political metaphor ``European Home{''} based on material by the famous
   French writer Michel Houellebecq. The deconstruction of Houellebecq's
   metaphor helps to trace the transgression of the political myth of the
   ``European Home{''} as 1) ``Greater Europe from Gibraltar to the
   Urals{''} and 2) ``a union identical to the EU{''}. The image created by
   Houellebecq himself reflects new perspectives on ``new values{''} as
   based on Europeans' experiences thereof, identifying the problem of
   rejecting the ``new{''} (pan-European) identity and refusing to reduce
   culture to its political facades. The close relationship between the
   artistic optics of Houellebecq's novels and the techniques of modern
   imagology is revealed; the deep significance of literary images in the
   creation of the image of the country regarding its political
   consciousness is explained and traced. The results of the study provide
   a new perspective on the discussions that are underway in France in
   connection with the ``political dimension{''} of Houellebecq's work, and
   also clarify the importance of literature as an empirical and
   theoretical source of political theory.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the opposition of neurosciences of moral
   judgement to moral philosophy, shedding light on the political meaning
   of the thesis according to which a science of morality is possible, or
   already real, and would demonstrate that rights' recognition equates to
   a cognitive error. It furthermore presents some theoretical
   contributions offered by Kant's moral doctrine - on condition that one
   avoids providing an unfounded and caricatural account in order to make
   it the paradigm of armchair philosophy - about the role of intuition and
   reasoning in formulating moral judgements and of mental experiments on
   moral dilemmas.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research, we present here in a summarized form, is
   none other than to verify what consequences the COVID-19 and forced
   confinement is having on family cohesion. Our observation units are
   young students at public universities from Madrid as they are UCM, UAM
   and URJC. These students live with some of their relatives. The survey
   was launched while the first COVID-Confinement took place (March and
   April 2020). We have chosen the online survey as a technique for
   collecting data, taking into account the difficulties of the moment. In
   the end, 305 university students took part in our study. The results are
   contradictory and ambivalent: one half of the respondents stated that no
   changes had taken place, and the other half was divided between those
   who spoke of positive changes and those who spoke of negative changes.
   We can talk about four different groups or categories of people:
   intense, strengthened, unchanged and conflictive relationships. We
   conclude the study by stressing the need to carry out qualitative
   studies in the future in order to deepen and qualify the results
   achieved in the present research, as well as to carry out longitudinal
   studies, in order to take into account whether the changes produced by
   the COVID-19 on family cohesion are interpretable as temporary or
   permanent.},

   as a Workplace},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {20-35},
Abstract = {Gendered entitlement underpins the bullying, harassment and assault
   which flourishes in places like the Australian Parliament, where power
   is concentrated in the hands of male politicians. This article
   identifies necessary steps to undercut it. Mitigation measures should
   include a robust complaints process independent of, and external to,
   Parliament; demonstrable and transparent consequences for offenders; and
   the use of regular, anonymous, publicly available surveys of MPs,
   political staffers and ancillary staff to track incidents relative to
   actual complaints, so the system can be adjusted to maximise
   effectiveness. These measures are necessary but not sufficient, given
   parliamentary offenders' amplified sense of entitlement that underpins
   the problem's resistance to change. Active measures must be taken to
   induce real diversity throughout the parliamentary ecosystem, beyond the
   current `50/50 gender equity focus', to disrupt current patterns of
   entitlement based on gender, race and class that make parliaments as
   workplaces less safe. Parallels with society as a whole need to be
   drawn, and comparable initiatives and approaches deployed community-wide
   to address the same pervasive problems.},

Title = {Legal Aspects of Dividend Payment in a Limited Liability Company},
Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {70},
Pages = {119-138},
Abstract = {The objective of the study was to identify forms, main objectives and
   regulatory measures that can improve the development of the legal
   regulation of dividend payments in a limited liability company. The
   study involved three methods: direct observation, comparison, and
   analysis of the content of documents that provide legal regulation of
   dividend payments at the state and interstate levels. Eight important
   factors influencing dividend policy are presented. The success of
   business activity depends directly on the regularity of profits and the
   amount of capital of the company, while it is inversely dependent on the
   regularity and size of dividends. It is concluded that the type and form
   of dividend policy is partly governed by the rule of law and partly
   determined by non-legal business factors. An optimal dividend policy
   means that there must be an appropriate balance between the payment of
   current dividends and the future growth of the company's profits. In
   this case, the procedure established by law and the sequence of shares
   preceding the payment of dividends indicates the partial entrepreneurial
   freedom of the participants in this case.},

Title = {China's Party Diplomacy in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {07},
Number = {04},
Pages = {451-465},
Abstract = {Of the many ways of interaction between states, party diplomacy plays a
   unique role in shaping international relations. The Communist Party of
   China (CPC) has been distinctively characterized by its international
   background since the day of its founding and has always taken a strong
   initiative toward internationalization in the process of ensuing growth
   and rise. Its passion for external exchanges and communication has
   become an outward expression of its inbuilt international nature. The
   CPC shares a long history of interaction with its counterparts in
   Southeast Asia, which can be roughly divided into four stages: the
   hostile stage, the probing stage, the breakthrough stage, and the stage
   of deepening coordination. It fully shows the dynamics underlying
   inter-party relations and the clues for evolution in the regional
   landscape. A careful investigation into this history reveals that
   China's party diplomacy in the region is marked by the diverse format of
   exchanges, the adoption of inclusiveness, the constructiveness of
   cooperation agenda, and the progressiveness of outcomes. Looking into
   the future, China's party diplomacy in the region is ushering in new
   opportunities. Party-to-party interaction is becoming more desirable for
   both China and Southeast Asian countries. The agenda has been expanded
   to cover a broader scope and the interacting process between the two
   sides is now smoother than ever. Nonetheless, challenges still abound.
   China's party diplomatic efforts are susceptible to the volatility of
   domestic politics in Southeast Asian countries as well as emerging
   hotspot issues. The agenda and participants of party-to-party
   interaction often change fast. Consensus reached through party diplomacy
   is often hard to translate into actions. To achieve success in party
   diplomacy, parties involved should aim for policy goals that are common
   and universal, engage with each other as equals, collaborate to make
   forward-looking plans and catalyze constructive actions, thus laying a
   solid foundation of enduring peace and prosperity for the region and the
   world.},

Title = {Emerging digital citizenship regimes: Pandemic, algorithmic, liquid,
   metropolitan, and stateless citizenships},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {160-188},
Abstract = {This article develops a conceptual taxonomy of five emerging digital
   citizenship regimes: (i) the globalised and generalisable regime called
   pandemic citizenship that clarifies how post-COVID -19 datafication
   processes have amplified the emergence of four intertwined, non-mutually
   exclusive, and non-generalisable new techno-politicalised and
   city-regionalised digital citizenship regimes in certain European
   nation-states' urban areas; (ii) algorithmic citizenship, which is
   driven by blockchain and has allowed the implementation of an
   e-Residency programme in Tallinn; (iii) liquid citizenship, driven by
   dataism - the deterministic ideology of Big Data - and contested through
   claims for digital rights in Barcelona and Amsterdam; (iv) metropolitan
   citizenship, as revindicated in reaction to Brexit and reshuffled
   through data co-operatives in Cardiff; and (v) stateless citizenship,
   driven by devolution and reinvigorated through data sovereignty in
   Barcelona, Glasgow, and Bilbao. This article challenges the existing
   interpretation of how these emerging digital citizenship regimes
   together are ubiquitously rescaling the associated spaces/practices of
   European nation-states.},

Abstract = {Many argue that critical thinking is a democratic necessity, a valuable
   career readiness skill, and a key learning outcome of political science
   education. Research suggests that critical thinking training is most
   effective when students are explicitly taught critical thinking skills
   and develop valuation of and self-efficacy in utilizing these skills.
   This paper reports on a case study of explicit critical thinking skills
   awareness and practice training in a second-year political science
   class. Pre- and post-test analyses found statistically significant
   increases in students' self-rated valuation of critical thinking and
   self-efficacy. The instructor felt that the explicit linking of the
   class course material to the critical thinking sessions promoted quality
   class discussions of the core course material.},

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {1-20},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand how electoral rules affect
   citizens' satisfaction with democracy. The focus is on the extent to
   which this effect is mediated by the constituency orientation of
   legislators and the proportionality of election results. The analysis
   combines data from the European Social Survey and the Comparative
   Candidates Survey and covers 24 elections from 14 European countries.
   The multilevel SEM suggests two results. On the one hand, what majority
   and some mixed-member electoral systems gain through increasing
   constituency orientation, they lose to disproportional election results.
   On the other hand, open and flexible lists perform better in increasing
   satisfaction than closed ballots. Importantly, the analysis reveals a
   winner-loser gap in how constituency representation and proportionality
   affect democratic satisfaction. Both are more important for the losers
   of the elections when they evaluate democratic performance.},

Abstract = {Why do dictators purge specific elites but not others? And why do
   dictators purge these elites in certain ways? Examining these related
   questions helps us understand not only how dictators retain sufficient
   competence in their regimes to alleviate popular and foreign threats,
   but also how dictators nullify elite threats. Dictators are more likely
   to purge first-generation elites, who are more powerful because they can
   negotiate their role from a position of strength and possess valuable
   vertical and horizontal linkages with other elites. Further, dictators
   tend to imprison purged first-generation elites - rather than execute,
   exile or simply remove them - to avoid retaliation from other elites or
   the purged elite continuing to sow discord. We find empirical support
   for our predictions from novel data on autocratic elites in 16 regimes
   from 1922 to 2020.},

Abstract = {Many social movements face fierce resistance in the form of a
   countermovement. Therefore, when deciding to become politically active,
   a movement supporter has to consider both her own movement's activity
   and that of the opponent. This paper studies the decision of a movement
   supporter to attend a protest when faced with a counterprotest. We
   implement two field experiments among supporters of a right- and
   left-leaning movement ahead of two protest-counterprotest interactions
   in Germany. Supporters were exposed to low or high official estimates
   about their own and the opposing group's turnout. We find that the size
   of the opposing group has no effect on supporters' protest intentions.
   However, as the own protest gets larger, supporters of the right-leaning
   movement become less while supporters of the left-leaning movement
   become more willing to protest. We argue that the difference is best
   explained by stronger social motives on the political left.},

Abstract = {In this research note, we examine how Hong Kong voters respond to police
   violence in the recent social movement. We use causal forests, a machine
   learning algorithm, to estimate the impact of tear gas usage specific to
   each constituency. Based on the 2019 District Council Election outcome,
   we find that there is heterogeneity in the effect of state coercion on
   the vote share of pro-democracy candidates, depending on many
   socioeconomic characteristics of the constituency. The results imply
   that economic concerns still matter in the struggle to obtain democracy:
   citizens who sense economic insecurity in social unrest show less
   disapproval of state violence.},

Abstract = {At issue in the SNC-Lavalin scandal was a new tool of corporate criminal
   law: remediation agreements. Introduced in 2018, remediation agreements
   allow corporate diversion and create an alternative to the prosecution
   of corporations suspected of criminal wrongdoing. This article examines
   why the federal government adopted and chose this particular new tool.
   Drawing on a wide-ranging documentary record, I argue that this reform
   was the product of transnational lawmaking and the ongoing influence of
   Canada's international commitments to prohibit and punish foreign
   bribery. The article shows how international criticism of Canada's
   lacklustre anti-foreign bribery enforcement record catalyzed
   cross-national policy diffusion and learning from other states. This led
   Canada to adopt corporate diversion, which promised greater enforcement,
   and also led Canada to adopt a form of the practice with legislative and
   judicial limits that narrowed the chances of any company-including
   SNC-Lavalin-of obtaining a remediation agreement.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately
   affected poor communities. However, relatively little is known about how
   this differential impact affected support for, and compliance with,
   COVID-19 lockdown policies. This article examines the relationship
   between socioeconomic inequalities and public opinion towards COVID-19
   containment measures in Peru. Despite the strict quarantine measures
   adopted by the government of Peru, the country struggled to contain the
   spread of the disease. We designed and implemented a nationally
   representative survey in Peru and found that economically vulnerable
   sectors are more likely to oppose the quarantine and are more likely to
   defy the stay-at-home recommendations to leave home and go to work. Our
   contribution highlights that poor citizens' housing and economic
   conditions can explain why the poor are more likely to react negatively
   to COVID-19 lockdown policies.},

Abstract = {How do governments address complex, cross-sectoral problems, like the
   COVID-19 pandemic? Why were some Latin American countries more
   successful at containing the pandemic's most devastating health
   outcomes? We argue that national governments that were more
   collaborative in their response to COVID-19 were more successful in
   reducing death rates. Our original dataset offers a novel attempt to
   operationalise collaborative governance (CG). We undertake simple
   statistical tests to measure the relationship between CG and
   COVID-19-related mortality rates in Latin America. We then choose three
   case studies to assess whether collaboration was meaningful in practice.
   Initial evidence suggests governments that pursued CG were more
   effective at containing mortality rates early on in the pandemic. The
   collaboration helped to foster cooperation over resources; buy time to
   prepare for a potential case surge; and produce a unified message
   regarding what citizens should do to prevent viral spread.},

Month = {DEC-APR},
Abstract = {Starting from some key concepts in Mark Fisher's work, the article
   develops its analysis throughout three steps. First, it focuses on
   social media and several figures that have been conceptualized to
   explain distinct discursive positions within the uses of social media.
   Second, the article locate several debates turned into ``cultural
   wars{''} within the last few years. These considerations lead into the
   last plane of analysis, which consists of a mapping of the ideological
   present, focused in three main ideological currents: liberal centrism,
   postfascist right, and the reactionary left. The article concludes by
   presenting some questions deemed crucial to confront those three
   ideological currents.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {455-469},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why do politicians who have short tenure expectations have incentives to
   invest in long-term infrastructure projects? This mismatch between
   politicians' short tenures and the long-term needed for infrastructure
   projects to come to fruition is generally expected to result in
   underinvestment in critical infrastructure. However, recent data show
   that China makes massive investments in large-scale, long-term
   transportation projects. By proposing a political exchange model, we
   demonstrate a fundamental synergy between the incentives of short-term
   mayors and of provincial leaders that is realized as a result of subway
   projects. With both a difference-in-differences design and a fuzzy
   regression discontinuity design, we show that subway projects
   significantly increase the promotion chances of city mayors. Additional
   tests also confirm the mechanism of our theory. Mayors who obtain subway
   projects deliver economic benefits to provincial leaders. The provincial
   politicians' prospects of promotion are significantly improved thanks to
   these economic returns.},

Abstract = {More and more Western European radical right-wing populist parties
   participate in the governments of their respective countries. At least
   some of these parties moderate-that is, become less radical-once they
   join the government; others, however, do not. Although the literature
   has addressed such moderation, the conditions that lead to it have not
   been analyzed comprehensively. In this paper, we use a fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA, N = 14) to determine what
   conditions are consistently associated with moderation across cases. We
   find that the degree of governmental responsibility a party takes over
   is as important as its internal dynamic. In a ruling coalition,
   compromises must be found, which can create high internal tensions
   within the radical right-wing populist party. Joining government can
   thus have its price: a crisis of party identity and a strong compulsion
   to moderate.},

Abstract = {Despite its conceptual and empirical ambiguities, the Left-Right
   distinction of political preferences is a widely used tool in academic
   debates on voting and party behaviour, coalition formation and political
   culture. In a novel contribution to scholarship on the social
   construction of ideological identities, we investigate the
   context-dependent nature of the association between different
   conceptualizations of economic well-being and political orientations
   along a Left-Right scale. Our theoretical framework distinguishes
   economic well-being into a materialist and (p)ost-materialist dimension,
   and derives its hypotheses from Social Modernization Theory. Using
   multivariate analyses with original survey data from 3,449 undergraduate
   students in Bolivia, Brazil, Italy, Kenya, Sweden, Switzerland and the
   UK, our results show clear patterns and large effect sizes in the
   association between respondents' macro-economic context and their
   micro-level ideological orientations. In non-high-income countries,
   respondents' Left-Right self-placements correlate with a materialist
   conceptualization of economic well-being, which centres on assessments
   of their family's real-life economic status. In high-income countries,
   by contrast, respondents' Left-Right self-placements are associated with
   a post-materialist conceptualization of economic well-being that is
   based on normative judgements about inequality aversion.},

Abstract = {Outgroup hostility and racialized language were the most important
   predictors of support for Trump in the 2016 election season. Some
   scholarship argues that outgroup hostility outweighs the importance of
   white ingroup attitudes. Using a mix-methods content analysis of Trump's
   campaign speeches, this paper agrees that outgroup hostility was the
   primary rhetorical device used by Trump in his speeches in both the
   primary and general elections. This work goes further and examines how
   Trump's rhetoric framed and constructed the ingroup using outgroup
   rhetoric to connect the two. We argue that immigration and refugees,
   specifically, were used by Trump as part of the identity story he told
   about the ingroup and what it means to be an ingroup member. Our
   contribution rests on the correlation between hostile outgroup
   rhetoric-especially towards immigrants and refugees-to the framing and
   defining of the ingroup (through first-person plural pronouns). Further,
   we connect this rhetorical device to questions about what is at stake
   for the ingroup (i.e., power). We highlight a rhetorical mechanism that
   helps explain how hostile outgroup rhetoric is linked to ingroup
   framing, a contribution that adds to the literature on this topic.},

Abstract = {Racial triangulation theory brilliantly conjoins, at once, two different
   types of racialized hierarchies, thereby allowing more than the metrics
   of standard anti-African American racism ({''}the color line{''}) to be
   theorized. This is one of the hallmarks of the pathbreaking model. At
   the same time, this essay chronicles how racial triangulation falls prey
   to the common social science tendency of US centrism, nation-state
   singularity, and catch-all models, omitting the influence of
   (neo)imperialism, (neo/post)colonialism, neoliberalism, and other
   foundational projects of global and American racism. For instance, U.S.
   empire - i.e., militarist, capitalist, cultural dominance - means that
   most Asian ethnic groups experienced racial injustice and a version of
   racial triangulation in their sending countries before migration; in
   turn, the pre-migrant context profoundly shapes how the US
   racializes/positions these groups (often vis-a-vis one another) and how
   the margins respond. In addition, racial triangulation privileges
   eastern-descent ethnics, overlooks anti-South Asian American racism in
   the post-1980s and post-911 era, underappreciates Asian/Asian American
   resistance, and neglects to theorize those positioned at the
   intersection of ``inferior{''} and ``foreigner{''} (of which former
   President Barack Obama is emblematic). In spite of the (constructive)
   criticism, in this era of Covid-19 racism, the Atlanta Massacre,
   widespread state murder of Black Americans, anti-Latinx/-Mexican
   nativist racism, and Muslim Bans, we need to expand racial triangulation
   theory, not dismiss it.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do means-tested programs increase beneficiaries'
   political participation? Recent scholarship has begun to shed light on
   this question through a series of causal studies of Medicaid expansion.
   This article builds on those analyses by exploring an additional case,
   the US expansion of Old-Age Assistance (OAA) programs between 1932 and
   1940. It provides new evidence that means-tested programs can mobilize
   their beneficiaries and also sheds light on how these effects emerge.
   Exploiting state-by-state variation in expansion, I find that increases
   in OAA generosity increased turnout in elderly counties but increases in
   the OAA coverage rate did not. These findings show that resource effects
   are crucial to generating positive feedback and can do so even in the
   case of a highly stigmatizing, means-tested program. I further find that
   by mobilizing elderly Republican recipients, OAA cost FDR votes in
   Republican-leaning counties, suggesting that even positive participatory
   effects may undermine social programs' entrenchment.</p>},

Abstract = {In this paper I unpack a realistic conception of politics by tightly
   defining its constitutive features: conflict and order. A conflict
   emerges when an actor is disposed to impose his/her views against the
   resistance of others. Conflicts are more problematic than moralists
   realize because they emerge unilaterally, are potentially violent,
   impermeable to content-based reason, and unavoidable. Order is then
   defined as an institutional framework that provides binding collective
   decisions. Order is deemed necessary because individuals need to
   cooperate to survive, but groups cannot spontaneously secure collective
   decisions and are prone to conflicts. Particularly, the fact that
   potentially violent conflicts emerge unilaterally means that order
   requires coercion. I conclude that mischaracterizing conflict and order
   leads to undesirable normative principles, and that this criticism can
   be leveraged not only against Rawlsian liberals who moralize conflicts
   away, but also against some agonists who underestimate the need for
   order and some communitarians who underplay both circumstances.},

Abstract = {Earlier research refers to populist parties as being advocates of a
   greater use of referendum. Yet, there has been no large-scale systematic
   test of this claim. This article addresses this gap in the literature
   and tests the relationship between populism and greater use for
   referendums in party manifestos. It analyzes 824 manifestos of 187
   populist and non-populist parties in 27 Member States of the European
   Union between 1994 and 2018. We test if populist parties are virtually
   all in favor of a greater use of referendums and whether they would talk
   about referendums much more than non-populist parties.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, empirical scholars have asserted that
   citizenship may include memberships in political communities other than
   the nation-state. This paper is based on fieldwork (2015-2017) on the
   rights of Internally Displaced Persons in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo. It provides an empirically grounded analysis of the multiple
   political communities in which forced migrants take part and how
   membership in these communities helps them to claim fundamental rights,
   which the state is unable to provide. We outline various
   pre-displacement and post-displacement memberships, and show that they
   have different participation requirements, leading to varying levels of
   integration of people who are displaced from their communities of
   origin. The paper provides a methodological contribution to critical
   approaches to studying citizenship and informal political communities.
   It also contributes to well-informed policy-making in the humanitarian
   aid context of Eastern Congo.},

Abstract = {Electoral coalitions between ideologically incompatible parties - among
   other unconventional electoral strategies - may seem to threaten
   effective representation, signaling a breakdown of programmatic
   politics. However, this perspective overlooks parties' and voters'
   dynamic considerations. We propose and estimate a model of dynamic
   electoral competition in which a short-term ideology compromise, via an
   electoral coalition, offers opposition parties (and voters) the
   opportunity to remove an entrenched incumbent party from office, thus
   leveling the playing field in the future. This tradeoff provides a
   previously unrecognized rationale for coalition formation in elections.
   We take our model to data from Mexican municipal elections between 1995
   and 2016 and show that coalitions between parties on opposite ends of
   the ideology spectrum have served as an instrument of democratic
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {This article presents a memorable method to introduce new students to
   the concept of political needs. Using an adaptation of Abraham Maslow's
   ``Hierarchy of Needs{''} to one of ``Hierarchy of Political Needs{''}
   the instructor presents how needs for ``physiological survival,{''}
   safety, belonging, ``recognition,{''} and ``democratic participation{''}
   have shaped political motivations as well as state and partisan
   responses. The article discusses Maslow's original arguments and the
   criticisms that have been leveled against them. It also shows how the
   original hierarchy has been adapted by scholars since the 1950s. It then
   demonstrates how a theoretical framework on political needs can be
   created and shows how the concerns about the Maslow Hierarchy can be
   used to trigger student discussion. The article finally presents how the
   concepts are presented through lectures, self-reflection activities, and
   discussion.},

Abstract = {Misinformation makes democratic governance harder, especially in
   developing countries. Despite its real-world import, little is known
   about how to combat misinformation outside of the United States,
   particularly in places with low education, accelerating Internet access,
   and encrypted information sharing. This study uses a field experiment in
   India to test the efficacy of a pedagogical intervention on respondents'
   ability to identify misinformation during the 2019 elections (N =
   1,224). Treated respondents received hour-long in-person media literacy
   training in which enumerators discussed inoculation strategies,
   corrections, and the importance of verifying misinformation, all in a
   coherent learning module. Receiving this hour-long media literacy
   intervention did not significantly increase respondents' ability to
   identify misinformation on average. However, treated respondents who
   support the ruling party became significantly less able to identify
   pro-attitudinal stories. These findings point to the resilience of
   misinformation in India and the presence of motivated reasoning in a
   traditionally nonideological party system.},

Abstract = {Renewed interest in legislative `power over the purse' has seen a
   growing demand in modern democracies for parliaments to strengthen their
   authority over national budgets. However, weaknesses in legislative and
   institutional reforms intended to bring about more assertive parliaments
   with powers to amend budgets raise issues on how parliament's role in
   influencing the budget differs from what formally conferred powers
   anticipate. Specifically, to what extent can formal parliamentary
   institutions be expected to advance the aspiration of greater
   legislative influence on the budget? This article critically considers
   the institutional arrangements of the South African parliament that
   inhibit effective execution of its role in budget decision-making. In
   particular, it explores three determinants: extent of formal powers,
   institutional capacity, and incentives facing individual MPs.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the temporary (2015) and permanent (2018)
   expositions of Moscow's GULAG History Museum (GHM), and the documents
   surrounding its creation. The analysis demonstrates two key findings.
   First, focusing on the Gulag and omitting post-Gulag Soviet repression,
   the GHM ultimately works to historicize the former. Second, while
   prominently ending the permanent exposition with Stalin's death, the GHM
   nevertheless downplays his role in the repression. The Gulag becomes a
   thing of the past, something to acknowledge--and leave behind. Stalin,
   however, is extracted from that past: he remains in the present, as part
   of the official ``Great Patriotic War{''} memory.},

Abstract = {Which is better for electoral accountability: a fragmented opposition
   that gives plenty of alternatives or an opposition with fewer stronger
   parties? While oppositions play a key role in democracies, the effect of
   opposition fragmentation on accountability remains unclear. On the one
   hand, fragmentation may enhance accountability by providing voters with
   ideologically close alternatives. On the other hand, increased
   fragmentation could make coordination over strong viable alternatives
   more difficult. In this study, I present an original survey experiment
   designed to test whether fragmentation of the opposition enhances
   accountability. Moreover, to assess the specific conditions under which
   fragmentation may enhance accountability, I distinguish between
   ideologues and pragmatic voters, and differentiate between ideological
   and valence issues. Results show that opposition fragmentation enhances
   accountability, particularly for ideologues. Lastly, I present a direct
   test of the mechanisms that demonstrates that fragmentation improves
   accountability because marginal gains in ideological proximity outweigh
   losses in viability.},

Abstract = {Climate change is an overwhelming issue today, but sociology has yet to
   fully engage with its hermeneutical and political aspects. The article
   tackles this limitation and thus the lexicon of climate change,
   proposing an integrated framework that brings its principal concepts and
   notions together. In particular, it singles out hazard, risk and threat,
   vulnerability and resilience, adaptation, mitigation and precaution,
   Anthropocene and Capitalocene, nature and society. Although some authors
   have stressed the political aspects underlying these concepts and
   notions, and the IPCC itself has incipiently recognised this issue, the
   parameters of the debate remain conspicuously narrow. The article
   therefore proposes to engage it in direct and strong political terms,
   countering the partly successful operation of depoliticisation that such
   concepts and notions undergo. While the article concentrates on
   discursive aspects, it eventually points to the role of agents and power
   within the UN system concerning the articulation of this lexicon.},

Abstract = {Can direct democracy overcome the ``problem of intensity,{''} treating
   everyone equally and yet allowing an intense minority to prevail if, but
   only if, the majority's preferences are weak? Storable votes and
   quadratic voting propose possible solutions. We test their performance
   in two samples of California residents, using data on four initiatives
   prepared for the 2016 California ballot. To estimate the probable
   effects of the two systems, we bootstrap the original samples and
   generate two sets of 10,000 multielection simulations. Both systems
   induce minority victories in 30\%-35\% of the samples and yet result in
   higher expected welfare relative to majority voting, appropriating
   between one-third and two-thirds of the remaining surplus.},

Abstract = {This article explores the interplay between regional identity and
   economic development in Wallonia. Relying on a critical reading of
   economic policy texts and political discourse relating to both the
   domestic and foreign policy spheres, the study examines the manner in
   which Walloon political actors discursively construct the relation
   between economic development and regional identity. The findings point
   to a perceived mutually reinforcing role between economic development
   and identity, offering a more nuanced approach to current studies
   exploring this relationship. Facilitated by the analytical division
   between domestic and foreign policy spheres, the study also highlights
   an important link between two facets of `regional identity': the
   regional consciousness of inhabitants and the image of the region
   itself.},

Abstract = {Enns and Koch question the validity of the Berry, Ringquist, Fording,
   and Hanson measure of state policy mood and defend the validity of the
   Enns and Koch measure on two grounds. First, they claim policy mood has
   become more conservative in the South over time; we present empirical
   evidence to the contrary: policy mood became more liberal in the South
   between 1980 and 2010. Second, Enns and Koch argue that an indicator's
   lack of face validity in cross-sectional comparisons is irrelevant when
   judging the measure's suitability in the most common form of pooled
   cross-sectional time-series analysis. We show their argument is
   logically flawed, except under highly improbable circumstances. We also
   demonstrate, by replicating several published studies, that statistical
   results about the effect of state policy mood can vary dramatically
   depending on which of the two mood measures is used, making clear that a
   researcher's measurement choice can be highly consequential.},

Abstract = {There has been frequent reference to the concept of an emancipatory
   peace in the critical academic literature on peace and conflict studies
   in IR, much of it rather naive. It has developed an ecosystem of its own
   within debates on peace without drawing on wider disciplinary debates.
   Terms such as `emancipation' and its relative, `social justice' are
   widely used in critical theoretical literature and were common parlance
   in previous ideological eras. It was clear what such terms meant in the
   context of feudalism, slavery, imperialism, discrimination, a class
   system, nuclear weapons and racism over the previous two centuries. Now
   it is less clear in the context of changing peace praxis.},

Abstract = {This paper looks to the historical imbrication of racial and caste
   supremacy with citizenship, drawing attention to the inherent
   coloniality of citizenship in post-imperial Canada and India. We examine
   the transition from explicit to insidious, unofficial forms of
   institutionalized racial/caste supremacy. Explicit forms of supremacy
   have established and normalized forms of hierarchy that ascribe tiers of
   citizenship, even after legal guarantees of supremacy have been removed.
   We seek to examine the coloniality of modern citizenship to (a) better
   historicize the ongoing colonial violence of citizenship within
   post-imperial places and (b) penetrate the shield of fragility to help
   citizens come to terms with their unearned privileges.},

Abstract = {States negotiate over the specific terms of multilateral treaties
   because those terms determine states' willingness to ratify the treaty.
   In some cases, a state might decline to ratify a treaty it otherwise
   supports because specific terms are too far from those it prefers.
   States and inter-governmental organizations negotiating treaties would
   like to uncover the minimal terms needed to secure the ratification of
   key states, but under what circumstances will those states candidly
   reveal those terms? Using a spatial representation of the issues in a
   treaty negotiation, we use mechanism design to determine what
   information states will reveal in a treaty negotiation. We find that
   states are willing to reveal how they would like tradeoffs between
   different issues to be resolved but not the minimal terms they require
   for ratification. Further, negotiations cannot always separate types
   that need concessions to ratify from other types that would like
   concessions but would ratify the treaty even if they do not receive
   them. These findings provide insight into how treaty negotiations can
   succeed or fail, and they lay the theoretical groundwork for a new line
   of empirical research on how multilateral treaties are negotiated.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 and the corresponding economic lockdown and income loss for
   large segments of population was something unexpected for all European
   countries, and their welfare systems were not prepared to protect their
   citizens from such threats. Social resilience is becoming used in
   disaster risk analysis, and preferred to that of vulnerability, to refer
   the ability of the social entities to respond to such challenges,
   enabling them to cope and adjust to adverse events. It has been more
   recently used in the context of the European Union (EU) about COVID-19,
   regarding the creation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility, intended
   to mitigate the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
   The global nature of this pandemic makes possible and relevant a deeper
   understanding of social resilience at different levels of analysis:
   international, national, local and individual/household levels. This
   article aims to contribute to this by proposing a set of indicators of
   social resilience in face of COVID-19, supported in a theoretical
   framework developed herein, and comparing the performance of a selection
   of EU countries with distinct welfare system configurations, with
   different roles played by the government, the market, the social
   organizations and the families. Using comparable statistical data at
   macro level and data concerning the responses of government to the
   economic and social effects of the pandemic, we produce a synthetic
   index of social resilience, combining resilience on coping and
   resilience on adapting. We relate the differences found in coping and
   adapting with the welfare system configurations of these countries.},

Abstract = {This paper provided a new framework i.e., fifth-generation literature on
   suicide bombings. The latter have always been a central debate/value in
   warfare; however, they have taken a centre stage in asymmetric warfare.
   The lethality and commitment to the cause makes a suicide attacker a
   real danger. The Iraqi episode of Al-Qaeda used suicide bombings as a
   military operation, and it transferred the expertise to Taliban to fight
   against the US-led Allied Forces in Afghanistan. From there the same
   tactics proliferated to Pakistani Taliban who used it as a military
   operation against the security and civil establishments of Islamabad.
   Apart from the Pashtunwali Code and the strict adherence to the Deobandi
   School of thought, the Pashtuns of Afghanistan and Pakistan readily
   accepted to recruit and train suicide attackers and employed suicide
   bombings as a military operation. This analytical and explanatory study
   generally banked on secondary data, normally gathered from the academic
   sources; however, primary data was also used, and an interview of an
   anonymous security official was conducted as well. This paper is a
   concentrated effort to probe and investigate the advent of suicide
   bombings in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to examine that how and why the
   Pashtuns used it as a military operation to achieve their desired
   objectives. The article found that the selection and indoctrination of a
   suicide bomber involves almost eight stages.},

Abstract = {I argue here that the term ``populism{''} captures too much, including
   movements that are enthralled by a fantasied ideal as well as genuine
   movements for plural and popular sovereignty. The term is too often used
   to deride all popular movements, but this is to the detriment of
   genuinely political and democratic movements for democratic sovereignty.
   I distinguish popular movements that are genuinely political and
   generative from those that are regressive and anti-political. The
   latter, I argue using psychoanalytic theory, are melancholically
   clinging to a lost Thing, while democratic popular movements are open to
   creating new societies. To explore these differences I draw on Lacan and
   Klein whose theories point to the need for creatively working to create
   new collective identities rather than melancholically clinging to old
   ones.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {867-877},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Publication bias is pervasive in social and behavioral sciences because
   journals and scholars tend to reward and be rewarded for statistically
   significant findings. However, the determinants of the severity of
   publication bias are less well understood. We argue that publication
   bias depends on whether an independent variable is a key variable or
   statistical control in traditional regression modeling. The bias should
   be severe only for the key variable that relates to a central question
   and hypothesis in a study. We offer an empirical strategy to detect the
   conditional nature of publication bias. As an illustration, we perform a
   meta-regression of 229 model estimates from 36 articles in the
   democracy-foreign direct investment literature. We find that publication
   bias is most severe when democracy is a key variable, but appears weak

Abstract = {Social scientists are facing a crisis of confidence in quantitative
   results. Multiverse analysis provides concerned scholars a tool for
   verifying the robustness of findings. This article introduces political
   scientists to multiverse analysis through an application. It identifies
   how differing approaches to data processing led to divergent conclusions
   about the representation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Americans
   in Congress in a 2015 Journal of Politics article. The analysis casts
   doubt on the original conclusion that the size of the LGB population in
   a district is significantly associated with the bill sponsorship
   activity of its representative. More broadly, it demonstrates how
   researchers can keep a running tally of data-processing decisions and
   parsimoniously present the consequences of those decisions for the
   findings. Multiverse analysis can help scholars publish replicable
   results in original work as well as replicate and extend previously
   published work.},

Title = {Residential Constraints and the Political Geography of the Populist
   Radical Right: Evidence from France},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {842-859},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What explains variation in populist radical right (PRR) support within
   Western democracies? Specifically, why is contemporary PRR support often
   and increasingly stronger in areas seemingly detached from the effects
   of globalization, transnationalism, or immigration, the key issues these
   parties emphasize? This study articulates a theory of residential
   constraints to deepen understanding of these spatial patterns. I
   hypothesize that when citizens are residentially constrained-that is,
   when their means of reacting to local conditions and ``voting with their
   feet{''} are limited-they are more likely to support PRR parties. To
   test this claim, I use a multimethod research design and exploit both
   quantitative and qualitative evidence from France, an important case of
   long-standing and geographically divided PRR support. I demonstrate that
   the PRR performs well in areas where locals' access to services and
   opportunities is compromised and where opportunities and incentives to
   relocate are blocked by residential constraints. Residential constraints
   thus generate a set of relative economic grievances and render them
   highly salient in localities that may otherwise appear unaffected by
   more objective hardships and structural decay.},

Abstract = {Can referendums help increase perceived legitimacy among citizens with
   populist attitudes? Indeed, public opinion surveys show that populist
   citizens are especially in favour of referendums. However, we do not
   know whether this support reflects a principled desire for different
   decision-making procedures or an instrumental one (that is, because they
   expect referendums to yield favourable outcomes). We study this question
   on a real-life case: the Dutch 2018 referendum on the Intelligence and
   Security Services Act 2017. Using high-quality survey data from both
   before and after the referendum, we find that, counter to conventional
   wisdom and our hypotheses, populists' support for referendums is less
   driven by instrumental motives compared to that of non-populists, and
   that populists are more likely than non-populists to accept the outcome
   of a referendum, even when this outcome is unfavourable.},

Abstract = {In this article I interpret John Rawls's concept of the original
   position as a spiritual exercise. In addition to the standard
   interpretation of the original position as an expository device to
   select principles of justice for the fundamental institutions of
   society, I argue that Rawls also envisages it as a ``spiritual
   exercise{''}: a voluntary personal practice intended to bring about a
   transformation of the self. To make this argument, I draw on the work of
   Pierre Hadot, a philosopher and classicist, who introduced the idea of
   spiritual exercises as central to ancient and modern conceptions of
   philosophy. By reading Rawls alongside Hadot, this article portrays
   Rawls as a thinker deeply concerned with the question of how subjects
   can lead more just and fulfilling lives. It also proposes that the
   original position as a spiritual exercise can help defend liberalism as
   a social and political doctrine.},

Title = {Understanding the influence of vested interests on politics of
   anti-corruption in Indonesia},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-273},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {The aim of conceptual article is to consider the available literature
   regarding associations between the role of vested interests and its
   impacts on anti-corruption measures in Indonesia. Research focusing on
   vested interests as a side-effect of political-economic reforms in the
   Indonesian context is limited, although there are extensive studies
   regarding the impact of neo-liberal reforms consisted of
   democratization, market liberalization and institutional reforms on the
   effectiveness of anti-corruption approaches in developing countries.
   Indonesia is one of the developing countries applying neo-liberal
   reforms expected to curb corruption more effectively. Because vested
   interests are very persistent and likely to be more influential to the
   anti-graft approaches during the transitional periods in Indonesia,
   there is a need to understand the ways in which the vested interests
   work. The key outcome of this article is to highlight the need to better
   understand how the persistent corrupt forces have created an
   unpredictable and uncertain future of Indonesia's anti-graft agenda.
   Recommendations for future research regarding associations between the
   role of vested interests and effective or ineffectiveness of
   anti-corruption machines are provided to stimulate more empirical
   attention to this area to support Indonesia to create more transparent
   and accountable politico-business environment.},

Abstract = {Though it may sound awkward to ask whether the political sovereign is
   happy or unhappy, the question is relevant to political theory,
   especially within a political theological perspective. Because man was
   created in the image of God, human happiness needs to be a reflection of
   divine beatitude, and as divine sovereignty is, at least analogically,
   related to political sovereignty, the conceptual coherence is secured.
   The main argument is, however, that the analogy does not hold. I shall
   show how St Thomas Aquinas's short treatment of God's beatitude may
   mislead us about power, fame, riches, and dignity being essential to
   happiness, based on an analysis of Franz Kafka's major novel, The
   Castle, and a few other writings by him. I shall argue that our
   tradition of political thinking and behavior remains ambivalent on this
   issue. The political sovereign is born out of our unhappy condition, yet
   its power, fame, riches, and glory suggests to us that it has
   appropriated our happiness. But for this very reason it cannot be happy,
   and it therefore suggests a false analogy between the divine and the
   political sovereign. It is fundamentally at variance with our happiness,
   which incites us to abandon, reject, and eventually, kill it.},

Abstract = {Providing corrective information can reduce factual misperceptions among
   the public but it tends to have little effect on people's underlying
   attitudes. Our study examines how the impact of misinformation
   corrections is moderated by media choice. In our experiment,
   participants are asked to read a news article published by Fox News or
   MSNBC, each highlighting the positive economic impact of legal
   immigration in the United States. While the news content is held
   constant, our treatment manipulates whether participants are allowed to
   freely choose a media outlet or are randomly assigned. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of people's ability to choose: While factual
   misperceptions are easily corrected regardless of how people gained
   access to information, subsequent opinion change is conditional on
   people's prior willingness to seek out alternative sources. As such,
   encouraging people to broaden their media diet may be more effective to
   combat misinformation than disseminating fact-checks alone.},

Abstract = {Communal conflicts present a severe threat to human security, resulting
   in the death of thousands of people every year. The communal conflict in
   Dagbon in the Northern Region of Ghana, for instance, led to the murder
   of the King of Dagbon and 40 other people. This conflict has attracted
   debates which are centred around attempts to explain its onset. But the
   understanding of this phenomenon is still incomplete. In particular,
   there is inadequate detailed information about what actually started the
   conflict. This article aims to fill this knowledge gap by engaging the
   greed-grievance theories to comprehensively understand the conflict's
   onset. This article contributes to the theoretical understanding of
   communal conflicts, which is of both scholarly and policy importance.
   Navigating insights from theoretical literature and content analysis of
   secondary data, it finds that perceived injustice and land wealth were
   the motivating factors in the onset of the conflict in Dagbon in 2002.},

Abstract = {The delegation of violence in civil war is often perceived as a
   weakening of the central state to the benefit of uncontrollable
   non-state actors. We use the case of Afghanistan to show the limits of
   this argument. More specifically, we look at how the Karzai
   administration dealt with the challenge of increasing military personnel
   without losing control over them. We argue that the presence of
   international troops critically affected policy. We also argue that,
   contrary to common interpretations, the choices that were made reflect a
   re-appropriation of the state formation process by Afghan political
   elites, rather than a weakening of the central state.},

Abstract = {Women remain underrepresented in electoral politics compared to their
   share of the population. Using an original dataset spanning 1975-2019,
   we examine whether the presence of women in prominent political office
   leads to an increase in the number of women serving in state
   legislatures. We define prominence in two ways: the total number of
   women elected to statewide office and the length of a state's history of
   electing women. We find that the prominence effect diverges by party.
   The election of prominent Democratic women leads to an increase in the
   proportion of Democratic women state legislators, while the election of
   Republican women leads to a decrease in the proportion of Republican
   women state legislators. Rather than serving as role models for women of
   both parties to enter the political pipeline, electing more women to
   prominent office is contributing to a greater representational gap
   between the parties in state legislatures.},

Abstract = {This article returns to the post-Civil War period to reconstruct
   Congressman Thaddeus Stevens's political thought. Stevens argued that
   incorporating former slaves into republican society required a federal
   policy of land confiscation and redistribution in the South. According
   to the Republican congressman, taking land from the planter class, not
   just granting land to freed slaves, was a necessary component of any
   plan intended to break the slave power and inaugurate an interracial
   republic. My recovery of Stevens's defense of land confiscation offers
   us critical purchase on contemporary demands for slave reparations. I
   compare the tenets of contemporary reparations discourse and Stevens's
   efforts to form a true republic. Recovering Stevens's bid orients us
   toward the potential uses and dangers of resurrecting a politics of
   Reconstruction premised on the active taking of material power from
   those who disproportionately wield it.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1940s, the Swiss philosopher Denis de Rougemont actively
   engaged in pro-European movements, taking part in all the most important
   cultural events supporting the European integration process. From 1950
   to 1985 he conducted the Centre europeen de la Culture in Geneva and
   dedicated most of his writings to the cultural roots of Europe and the
   ethics of federalism, resulting in a philosophical and political path
   that is increasingly critical of the methods and outcomes of European
   integration. In contrast with the economic and functionalist method, he
   imagined a federal and meta-national union as the only political way to
   translate, defend and enhance European culture.},

Abstract = {After decades of consistent refusal to curb international tax evasion,
   the US Biden administration has recently proposed an international
   scheme for taxing the world's largest transnational companies. This
   article seeks to better understand why it is so difficult to develop an
   international scheme controlling tax evasion by examining the role
   played by neoliberal governmentalities and their link to sovereign
   power. It is argued that neoliberal governmentalities have been crucial
   in propagating a design of sovereign power that is conducive to tax
   competition and, ultimately, to tax evasion. Yet, these divergences also
   seem to provide a space for reforming current taxation regimes.},

Abstract = {Does the passage of anticorruption reforms affect the types of people
   that want to serve in government? This article evaluates the effects of
   a common tool to fight corruption-financial disclosures-using data on
   25,642 elections in Putin-era Russia. I argue that financial disclosures
   function like a personal audit, generating information for journalists
   and prosecutors to investigate illicit gains earned inside and outside
   of government. Exploiting staggered elections, I find that requiring
   financial disclosures leads to roughly 25\% fewer incumbents seeking
   reelection and 10\% fewer candidates with suspicious financial
   histories. Greater media freedom and law enforcement capacity further
   increase the risk of corruption and tax evasion being uncovered,
   resulting in even fewer candidacies from those criminally exposed.
   Increasing transparency changes the incentives for serving in elected
   office, even in settings where other political motives may be at play.},

Abstract = {Voting is the foundational act of democracy. While thousands of studies
   have treated voting as a dependent variable, comparatively little
   research has studied voting as an independent variable. Here we flip the
   causal arrow and explore the effect of exogenous voting shocks on
   citizens' broader attitudes and behaviors. To do so, we first use two
   waves from a uniquely large survey of young people in the United States,
   pairing this with a regression discontinuity design. We augment these
   results with a new meta-analysis of all causally-identified studies
   exploring whether voting is transformative. We find that-despite voting
   at much higher rates-individuals induced to vote, regardless of the mode
   used to mobilize, are (precisely) no different from all-else-equal
   individuals that are not. Our results illuminate the (non)consequences
   of a vitally important-and widely studied-political behavior and speak
   to the broader importance of voting as an object of study.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, regionalist forces have been testing the limits of
   the EU multi-level system by making concrete bids to `Independence in
   Europe'. This article investigates the reaction of the EU institutions
   in the cases of Scotland and Catalonia. The analysis, based on archive
   research and elite interviews, points to a certain ambiguity in the
   behaviour of EU institutions, whereby a claimed neutrality is
   contradicted by declarations that clearly help the defence of
   member-states' territorial integrity. This strategy is applied by all EU
   political institutions - intergovernmental and supranational alike - and
   to both analysed cases, independently of whether the independence
   process is considered legal (Scotland) or illegal (Catalonia). The
   implementation of this strategy is strengthened by party connections
   between member-states' PMs and presidents of EU institutions.},

Abstract = {There has been a proliferation of research with human participants in
   violent contexts over the past ten years. Adhering to commonly held
   ethical principles such as beneficence, justice, and respect for persons
   is particularly important and challenging in research on violence. This
   letter argues that practices around research ethics in violent contexts
   should be reported more transparently in research outputs, and should be
   seen as a subset of research methods. We offer practical suggestions and
   empirical evidence from both within and outside of political science
   around risk assessments, mitigating the risk of distress and negative
   psychological outcomes, informed consent, and monitoring the incidence
   of potential harms. An analysis of published research on violence
   involving human participants from 2008 to 2019 shows that only a small
   proportion of current publications include any mention of these
   important dimensions of research ethics.},

Title = {War, democratization, and generational cohort effects on participation
   in Japan},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Studies show that both democratization and war mobilization boost levels
   of participation enduringly among members of the generational cohort
   that come of age around the time. But little is known about the relative
   effects of war mobilization and democratization on long-term
   participation rates among impressionable generations that experience
   both. We address this question by examining generational cohort effects
   by gender, drawing on newly available data on the case of Japan.
   Age-period-cohort analyses of the Survey on Japanese Value Orientations
   (1973-2013) show that the increase in lifelong participation rates of
   the ``war generation{''} over prewar generations was much greater for
   men than for women, thus suggesting that the high rates of participation
   among members of this cohort are driven more by mobilization than by
   democratization. This finding yields significant implications for the
   analysis of democratic consolidation in different parts of the world.},

Abstract = {Regional governments, particularly those representing distinct
   communities, are typically thought to pursue power of self-rule, or the
   ability to self-govern within their own regional jurisdiction. In
   contrast, limited attention has been paid to the importance of granting
   substantial influence via shared rule, or the ability to co-exercise
   authority over the state as a whole. Yet, central governments who fail
   to provide some form of guarantee regarding the authority to self-rule
   may face ongoing challenges to their legitimacy, authority, and ability
   to govern. As a result, granting shared control over modifications to
   their legal status may help to pacify demands from restive regions and
   those geographically separated from the state's centre. Analyzing the
   relationship between self- and shared rule across regional governments
   in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, I examine how the horizontal
   dimension of multi-level governance can serve as an accommodation
   strategy by central governments.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the viability of Mexican
   federalism from a plurinational and pluricultural perspective. It is
   based on the thesis that federalism is appropriate in plurinational
   countries, while in pluricultural countries it can be dealt with through
   other types of political-constitutional structures. It is argued that
   since Mexico is not a plurinational country, federalism is not an
   appropriate option to resolve the problems of distribution of
   competences.},

Abstract = {Existing theories of democratic reversals emphasize that elites mount
   actions like coups when democracy is particularly threatening to their
   interests. However, existing theory has been largely silent on the role
   of elite social networks, which interact with economic incentives and
   may facilitate antidemocratic collective action. We develop a model
   where coups generate rents for elites and show that the effort an elite
   puts into a coup is increasing in their network centrality. We
   empirically explore the model using an original dataset of Haitian elite
   networks that we linked to firm-level data. We show that central
   families were more likely to be accused of participating in the 1991
   coup against the democratic Aristide government. We then find that the
   retail prices of staple goods that are imported by such elites
   differentially increase during subsequent periods of nondemocracy. Our
   results suggest that elite social structure is an important factor in
   democratic reversals.},

Abstract = {Many appellate courts and regulatory commissions simultaneously produce
   case dispositions and rules rationalizing the dispositions. We explore
   the properties of the American practice for doing this. We show that the
   median judge is pivotal over case dispositions, although she and others
   may not vote sincerely. Strategic dispositional voting is more likely
   when the case location is extreme, resulting in majority coalitions that
   give the appearance of less polarization on the court than is the case.
   The equilibrium policy created in the majority opinion generically does
   not coincide with the ideal policy of the median judge in either the
   dispositional majority or the bench as a whole. Rather, opinions
   approach a weighted center of the dispositional majority but often
   reflect the preferences of the opinion author. We discuss some empirical
   implications of the American practice for jointly producing case
   dispositions and rules.},

Abstract = {In 2014, New Zealand enacted the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and
   Other Matters) Amendment Act in response to ongoing labour abuses on
   board South Korean vessels in New Zealand's foreign charter vessel
   sector. Importantly, the legislation expresses the universality of the
   International Labour Organization's Decent Work Agenda: all member
   countries must pursue policies based on the strategic objectives of
   equality, dignity, safe working conditions and that workers are
   protected from exploitation. The Act was in response to the
   identification of widespread labour abuses in this sector. In June 2011,
   the extent of the abuses came to light when 32 Indonesian crewmen of the
   Oyang 75 walked off their vessel. In this paper, we explore how a range
   of stakeholders worked organically to bring about change. We do this
   qualitatively by combining semi-structured interview (with over 160
   Indonesian migrant crewmen between 2011 and 2017), observation and
   document analysis. We analyse our data through the lens of participatory
   action research which provides a framework to document the processes of
   who was involved, the cycles of change, what was achieved in each cycle,
   and importantly the platform for change. Specifically, we look at how
   stakeholders - the crew themselves, their advocates, academics,
   non-governmental organisations, journalists, activists, among others -
   all played a part in achieving legislated protections.},

Abstract = {The US naval services are facing a strategic imperative. The US Navy is
   no longer the most numerous in the world, nor does it hold the
   technological edge in all maritime domains; yet, measured by individual
   warship capability, it remains supreme. Nevertheless, that metric may be
   less important in the face of adversary numeric superiority and the
   presence of disruptive, merging technologies. As we see a resurgence of
   great power competition and new technologies that can be employed to
   gain advantage across the spectrum of conflict, James Wirtz, Jeffrey
   Kline, Phillip Pournelle and Mie Augier argue that the US naval services
   need to capture opportunities to employ disruptive technologies and to
   think through how to adapt to the changing security environment.},

Abstract = {The literature on the nationalization of party systems has found that
   decentralization of authority leads to increasing territorial
   heterogeneity of voting behaviour. In this article, we intend to further
   extant knowledge on this topic by exploring whether different levels of
   government imply distinct representations of party competition at the
   citizens' level. We do so by analysing Twitter data collected during the
   2015 regional elections in five Italian regions (Liguria, Veneto,
   Tuscany, Campania and Apulia) to estimate national and regional party
   configurations by means of multi-dimensional scaling. Analyses show that
   national party competition is generally perceived in the same way across
   regions, but representations of regional political spaces tend to stand
   out from it and also to differ from each other. These results suggest
   that, in line with the process of political decentralization of
   authority, voters perceive party competition in different ways according
   to the level of territorial governance at stake.},

Abstract = {This article explores utopian dimensions and reality problems in the
   intellectual production of leading Anglophone public intellectuals and
   policymaking institutions of Western capitalism. We argue that from the
   close of the 1990s, but especially in the wake of the Great Financial
   Crisis of 2007-2009, elite discourse has splintered into three core
   strands or moments: first, a post-hegemonic, punitive neoliberalism of
   austerity, which retreats from leadership and seeks to preserve extant
   power relations; second, a pragmatic neo-Keynesian turn, which
   frequently combines the language of enterprise and competition with
   advocacy of selective political and economic re-regulation towards a
   more socially justified capitalism; and third, the advance of a
   `liberalism of fear', which evokes a number of threatening dystopian
   figures in populism, protectionism, the 1930s, extremism and
   totalitarianism. This splintering effect, we argue, is one of the key
   features of today's wider ideological-utopian constellation, entwined
   with the growth of the new far right and with radicalization on the
   left. Drawing on a Gramscian analysis of crisis, we argue that the
   ideological incoherence of the dominant intellectual elite, and the
   denuded utopian dimensions of their discourse, are both symptomatic and
   productive of the present organic crisis of Western capitalism and its
   attendant crisis of intellectual and moral leadership.},

   Republican-controlled states. Scholars have referred to this situation
   as ``fractious federalism,{''} with Republican state policymakers toeing
   the national party line in refusing to cooperate with a major policy
   initiative. In some cases, however, diverse advocacy coalitions have
   overcome fractious federalism to pass expansion legislation in deeply
   Republican states. More recently, such coalitions have resorted to
   ballot initiative campaigns as another means of overcoming such
   polarization, and won impressive victories in a series of `bleep
   red{''}states. Drawing on forty-four interviews with people involved in
   expansion advocacy in eleven states, I report important insights on the
   formation and activities of these coalitions in both the legislative and
   ballot initiative eras of Medicaid expansion politics.},

Abstract = {In this introductory article for the 2020-2021 Annual Review of American
   Federalism, we review notable developments in U.S. politics and policy
   during the last year, with an emphasis on their intersections with and
   consequences for federalism. We focus in particular on the 2020
   elections and the COVID pandemic, along with policy developments in the
   areas of criminal justice and police reform, health care, environment,
   immigration, and equality and religious liberty. The events of the past
   year, especially those related to the pandemic and the fallout of the
   presidential election, led to a resurgence of public interest in
   federalism and a focus on the importance of government decision-making
   of state and local governments. Events during the last year have not
   only reinforced partisan polarization but have also deepened the
   existing divide of Americans along partisan lines and perhaps in new
   ways. Partisan differences have increasingly become cultural
   differences, so that political and policy differences have saturated
   American culture in notable ways.},

Abstract = {How do foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows affect democratic
   survival? No study has examined how FDI influences the likelihood of
   democratic survival, although many studies have studied the effect of
   regime type on FDI inflows. The previous finding that FDI contributes to
   authoritarian survival and decreases prospects for democratization does
   not answer this question since determinants of democratic transitions
   are clearly distinct from those of democratic survival. I argue that FDI
   in non-primary sectors is more likely than FDI in primary sectors to
   contribute to democratic survival since non-primary FDI is likely to
   produce growth-enhancing effects through upstream and downstream
   linkages in the host economy and facilitate the diffusion of democratic
   ideas and norms originating from the West. To overcome the problem of
   the sectoral FDI data's poor coverage, I exploit an exogenous variation
   in FDI inflows by utilizing a country's geographical distance from
   developed economies. Using a sample of democracies from 1970 to 2010, I
   find that inward FDI, instrumented by market proximity to developed
   economies, is associated with an increased likelihood of democratic
   survival. The analysis of primary and non-primary FDI also provides
   supporting evidence.},

Abstract = {The literature on delegated rebellion has treated principals (external
   states) and their agents (rebel groups) as the main factors in the
   inception of rebellion. Intriguingly, no attention has been paid to
   subnational elites as a separate, third actor. This article takes a
   novel perspective on delegated rebellion by ascribing agency to
   subnational elites. It introduces the theoretical concept of strategic
   entrapment, which shows that even subnational elites unwilling to follow
   the path of rebel violence may be trapped between the incipient rebel
   groups and a principal. As a result, subnational elites are sidelined
   and replaced by the principal's rebel proxies.},

Abstract = {How well are voters represented and what explains how well voters are
   represented? Answering these questions requires unpacking the mechanisms
   by which voters choose elected officials and elected officials implement
   policies. Though spatial theories of voting and legislative bargaining
   provide a broad framework for understanding these mechanisms, testing
   these theories involves a measurement problem where multiple political
   actors and outcomes must be located. We develop a technique for
   estimating policy outcomes, status quo locations, the ideology of elite
   political actors, and the ideology of voters, on a common scale. Using
   our new estimates, we demonstrate a similar level of incongruence for
   tax policies and spending policies. The incongruence arises for
   different reasons however-tax policies are over-responsive to the
   position of the median voter. Contrarily, spending policies are
   under-responsive and barely correlated with the position of the median
   voter. In examining the underlying mechanisms for policy change, we find
   that while the positions of elected officials over-respond to the median
   voter, the changing composition of state government has little immediate
   impact on policy. Instead, policy outcomes respond to long-term trends
   in the composition of government.},

Abstract = {This article aims to re-evaluate Margaret Thatcher's concept of
   citizenship and analyse its evolution during her government (1979-1990).
   It argues that her ideas concerning individuals and their relationship
   with the state and civil society were a crucial element of her belief
   system since at least the 1970s. Despite their importance, however, most
   analyses of Thatcherism have relegated these ideas to a marginal place.
   A rigorous analysis of speeches, interviews, memoirs and documents shows
   that Thatcher had reconceptualized the idea of citizenship long before
   her home secretary Douglas Hurd attempted to rationalize and re-package
   her ideas for public consumption. However, by the end of the 1980s, when
   moderate Conservatives such as Hurd turned their attention to this
   question, it was widely perceived that the Conservative Party required a
   more humane and coherent concept of citizenship. The article concludes
   that Thatcher's ideas about the relationship between individuals, the
   state and community had a lasting influence on the Conservative and New
   Labour parties' concept of citizenship.},

   Evidence on `Votes-at-16' in Scotland from Qualitative Work with Young

Abstract = {Within the UK, Scotland offers a unique case study of `Votes-at-16' in
   practice. Research provided evidence on the immediate effects of voting
   age reform on young people's engagement with politics, but little is
   known about how young people experienced being allowed to vote from the
   age of 16 years. This article analyses qualitative evidence about young
   people's experiences with the right to vote at 16 since the voting age
   reform in Scotland. Drawing on data from interviews with young people,
   we find that `Votes-at-16' brought about a mix of experiences. In
   combination with the experience of the 2014 Scottish independence
   referendum it marked a uniquely mobilising life event that boosted
   confidence in youth voice and led to a perceived increase in political
   efficacy. It also raised frustrations with young people, however, about
   their lack of voting rights in other elections and about a perceived gap
   between expectations and reality regarding the role of schools. By
   examining young people's experiences with `Votes-at-16' in Scotland,
   this article contributes to debates about the implications of voting age
   reform in the Scotland and beyond.},

Abstract = {Democracy assistance, including the promotion of electoral security, is
   often a central component of contemporary peacekeeping operations.
   Preventing violence during post-conflict elections is critical for the
   war-to-democracy transition. Yet little is known about the role of
   peacekeepers in this effort. To fill this gap, this study provides the
   first comprehensive sub-national study of peacekeeping effectiveness in
   reducing the risk of electoral violence. It combines geo-referenced data
   on peacekeeping deployment across all multidimensional peacekeeping
   missions in Africa over the past two decades with fine-grained data on
   electoral violence. The analysis finds a negative association between
   peacekeeping presence and the risk of electoral violence. The
   relationship is of a similar magnitude in the pre- and post-election
   periods. However, the association is more strongly negative for violence
   perpetrated by non-state actors compared to violence perpetrated by
   government-affiliated actors. Analyses using two-way fixed-effects
   models and matching mitigate potential selection biases.},

Abstract = {Does the party of government influence the amount and type of inward

   Moreover no existing study, for any level of government or any
   jurisdiction, uses methods that allow for causal inference. We apply
   regression discontinuity methods to a set of narrow margin US
   gubernatorial elections. Over the course of a 4-year term the election
   of a Republican governor causes a 17\% boost in the growth of
   manufacturing-oriented FDI stock, compared to a Democrat. However, the
   same approach provides no evidence that partisanship matters for the
   overall level of FDI.},

Abstract = {It is difficult to measure public views on trade-offs between spending
   priorities because public understanding of existing government spending
   is limited and the budgetary problem is complicated. We present a new
   measurement strategy using a continuous treatment, multivariate choice
   experiment. The experiment proposes deficit-neutral bundles of changes
   in spending and taxation, allowing us to investigate attitudes toward
   modifications to the existing budget. We then use a structural choice
   model to estimate public preferences over spending categories and the
   taxation level, on average and as a function of respondent attributes.
   In our application, we find that the UK public favors paying more in tax
   to finance large spending increases across major budget categories, that
   spending preferences are multidimensional, and that younger people
   prefer lower levels of taxation and spending than older people.},

Title = {The Closed Door: A Democratic Problem in the Post-Political Careers of
   Cabinet Ministers},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-24},

Abstract = {At the end of their political career, some politicians pass through `a
   revolving door', while others face `a closed door', in the sense that
   they have difficulty finding a job after their incumbency. Based on
   in-depth interviews with 15 Danish ex-ministers, this study shows how a
   minister's specialized skills, knowledge and networks related to the
   decision-making processes of government are considered by the ministers
   themselves to be important contextual factors that can lead to a
   revolving-door scenario for an ex-minister. Conversely, political
   profiling and a negative celebrity effect are key mechanisms that are
   considered to lead to a closed-door career outcome for ex-ministers.
   This closed door career outcome may discourage people from seeking a
   political career in the first place, and it may result in politicians
   continuing in politics after having lost the motivation that originally
   inspired their political career. Thus, the closed door phenomenon
   constitutes a potential democratic problem, knowledge of which is
   therefore an important addition to our knowledge on the democratic
   problems linked to the exit side of political careers.},

Abstract = {Is foreign aid an effective instrument of soft power? Does it generate
   affinity for donor countries and the values they espouse? This article
   answers these questions in the context of Chinese aid to Africa and the
   competing aid regime of the United States. The study combines data on
   thirty-eight African countries from Afrobarometer, AidData, and the Aid
   Information Management Systems of African finance and planning
   ministries. The authors use spatial difference-in-differences to isolate
   the causal effects of Chinese and US aid. The study finds that Chinese
   aid to Africa does not increase (and may in fact reduce) beneficiaries'
   support for China. By contrast, US aid appears to increase support for
   the United States and to strengthen recipients' commitment to liberal
   democratic values, such as the belief in the importance of elections.
   Chinese aid does not appear to weaken this commitment, and may
   strengthen it. The study also finds that Chinese aid increases support
   for the UK, France and other former colonial powers. These findings
   advance our understanding of the conditions under which competing aid
   regimes generate soft power and facilitate the transmission of political
   principles and ideals.},

Abstract = {This interview with the former editor of Rethinking Marxism discusses
   David F. Ruccio's long-running, highly successful, and humbly titled
   blog, Occasional Links \& Commentary on Economics, Culture and Society.
   With thousands of posts and well over a million views, the blog has
   become a one-person digital magazine of impressively wide reach and
   sweeping scope. In the conversation, David F. Ruccio reflects on his
   motivations for initiating and continuing the blog since its move to
   WordPress in 2009; the role of social media in popularizing Marxian
   analyses; the (dis)similarities of blogging versus teaching; and many
   other topics with his trademark erudition and frankness.},

Abstract = {This article is intended to critically analyse the `public morals'
   jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee (HRC). Under the
   International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, `protection of
   public morals' can be invoked as a legitimate aim to limit various
   rights, such as the right to freedom of religion and freedom of
   expression. In this regard, the HRC has held that `public morals' must
   be derived from many different traditions, and that limitation of rights
   based on public morals must be understood in light of the principles of
   universality of human rights and non-discrimination. However, this
   research has found that the HRC's jurisprudence on public morals
   contains two main problems. First, it remains unclear when a moral
   standard can be considered as deriving from `many different traditions'.
   Second, the HRC's interpretation is also not supported by the
   application of the general rule of interpretation.},

Abstract = {The article is about the role of fossil fuels in Russian foreign policy
   and about the geo-economic strategies which the Kremlin applies toward
   China and Central Asia. We argue that Russia uses a geoeconomic realist
   approach and a neo-mercantilist strategy toward China. Our second
   argument is that the desire for diversification and direct trade brings
   them closer to each other, but conflicting interests in Central Asia
   also divide them. The combination of these centrifugal and centripetal
   forces results in a balance in Russo-Chinese relations and characterises
   their new partnership. Finally, Central Asian fossil fuel exporting
   countries are also interested in trade diversification to remain
   independent from Moscow and Beijing. We argue that the Kremlin can use
   some aspects of a neoimperialist strategy toward Central Asia, but new
   pipelines toward China decrease the overpowering Russian influence in
   the region. Research covers the 2000-2020 period and statistical data
   references acquired from primary sources are used for the research.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the main contributions of the OAS Mission to Support
   the Peace Process in Colombia (MAPP-OAS) to transitional justice in
   Colombia, as a result of the actions by this international organization
   in support for the justice and peace process between 2005 and 2016. A
   qualitative research methodology was used, including the use of
   methodological tools such as: interviews and documentary analysis. Among
   the main findings, it was found that MAPP-OAS actions in support for the
   justice and peace process in Colombia contributed to: a) the
   strengthening of the justice and peace legal system, b) the
   strengthening of state institutions responsible for the process and c)
   the strengthening of justice and peace trials. This research offers
   interesting insights into the contributions of a regional organization
   (such as the OAS) in the implementation of transitional justice
   processes, while providing a starting point for the analysis of
   transitional justice in Colombia, in the context of the implementation
   of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.},

Abstract = {The article highlights the results of a study of the situation with
   official investigations into criminal offenses related to the enforced
   disappearance of persons in the context of armed aggression in eastern
   and southern Ukraine. The example of individual criminal proceedings
   presents some systemic problems that arise during the investigation of
   the facts of disappearance and suggests possible ways to solve them.
   There are several ``blocks{''} of problems that lie in the field of
   criminal law, criminology, and criminal procedure. The points of view of
   scientists and practitioners on this problem are highlighted. It is
   concluded that Ukraine, in today's conditions, needs to take measures
   aimed at improving the legal mechanisms of observance and protection of
   the right of persons staying in its territory to freedom from enforced
   disappearance, as well as intensifying law enforcement agencies to
   prompt, complete and impartial investigation of such facts, their proper
   qualification, search for victims, identification of those responsible
   for their disappearance, ensuring that victims receive timely and
   adequate compensation. The methodological basis for writing the article
   was a dialectical-materialist method, as well as the set of general
   scientific and special methods and techniques of scientific knowledge.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to form a systematic approach to understanding
   and resolving a set of tasks of police activities that guarantee the
   rights and freedoms of citizens in modern society. It was concluded that
   the most typical negligence in this area includes violations of the
   rights and freedoms of citizens such as the installation of
   administrative actions against them without any sign of the crime,
   incorrect characterization of administrative infractions, the violation
   of the procedural order of administrative detention, cases of
   unjustified detention without preparation of reports, as well as
   exceeding the legal deadlines for administrative detention. Particular
   attention was paid to the set of means of appeal in proceedings
   concerning administrative offences, which may be referred to as the
   institution of the protection of citizens' rights and freedoms. Common
   European approaches to the legal regulation of policing and the
   influence of European Union law and decisions of the European Court of
   Human Rights on the guarantee of human rights and freedoms in policing
   were analyzed.},

Abstract = {Throughout the history of humanity, there have been many conflicts in
   different geographical areas that have led to the outbreak of wars and
   various violent confrontations that have caused negative consequences at
   a social, political, economic and humanitarian level in the different
   places where they are produced. In this way, due to the extensive
   knowledge that is presented to us about the conflict and its
   consequences on the population, favoring the development of a culture of
   peace and the promotion of techniques for the peaceful resolution of
   conflicts and international security is part of the essence of the
   international system. The international community and international
   organizations are not alien to the conflicts that are currently
   developing in the world, therefore, we must bet on cooperation,
   communication and shared effort between all regional, national and
   international actors in the face of to promote understanding and
   dialogue between all the actors involved in a dispute. In this research,
   through the development of a descriptive - analytical methodology, it
   will be shown what are the foundations of the culture of peace, what
   consequences the culture of peace has for the resolution of
   international conflicts and what are the mechanisms of action of the
   different techniques for the peaceful resolution of conflicts such as
   negotiation, mediation, arbitration and diplomacy to enhance
   international security and the development of a culture of peace at the
   planetary level. Finally, the importance of conflict prevention will be
   detailed as a tool of enormous utility for their management,
   transformation or resolution, and it will be explained that education
   for peace acts as an agent be able of promoting social change through
   active peaceful construction.},

Abstract = {Centripetal approaches to democracy in divided societies seek to promote
   inter-ethnic accommodation and moderation by making politicians
   dependent on the electoral support of groups other than their own base.
   Such cross-ethnic voting stands in contrast to situations where
   politicians need only the support of their own co-ethnics to win
   elections. This distinction can be used to evaluate the utility of
   centripetal electoral systems in promoting voting across ethnic divides.
   To do so, this article begins by considering some critiques of
   centripetalism, showing that cross-ethnic voting is more common in both
   institutional design and actual practice than some critics believe. It
   then moves on to examine cases of cross-ethnic voting via ethnically
   designated party lists, cross-regional party formation rules, at-large
   communal or sectoral seat reservations, and uni-directional
   vote-pooling, using these cases to construct an index of strong,
   moderate and weak centripetal electoral systems.},

   control of constitutionality is assessed in order to stop applying
   unconstitutional laws, in concrete case, when exercising their
   constitutional powers, under the terms of Summary Precedent n degrees
   347 of the Supreme Court. The analysis takes place on the arguments
   invoked by the Supreme Court in the judgment that gave rise to the
   mentioned summary precedent and in several others related to the theme,
   based on the principle of juridicity. In the first stage of the
   investigation, the inductive method and documentary research are
   adopted. The final phase of the investigation consists of a qualitative
   analysis of the arguments made by the Supreme Court, using the deductive
   method. The research findings allow us to affirm that, from the
   perspective of the principle of juridicity, there are no arguments that
   justify the overcoming of Summary Precedent n degrees 347.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on the film ``In a Better World{''} (Hoevnen.
   Susanne Bier, 2011), in line with previous works in which film analysis
   has allowed us to delve into pedagogical issues. From this perspective,
   we have approached the analysis of the film following culture of peace
   and Lacanian psychoanalysis. The purpose is thinking about father-child
   relationships and the processes of male subjectivation, in order to
   reflect on pedagogical relationships. After the theoretical framework,
   we briefly present the film and then offer an analysis of it in two
   acts: forgiveness and choice. The conclusion points out that thinking
   about the intergenerational relationships involves reconsidering
   pedagogical relationship, placing the figure of the teacher as the heir
   to the paternal function and getting out of the model of
   heteropatriarchal masculinity},

Abstract = {We investigate how the outbreak of epidemics can affect host
   governments' targeting of refugees and violation of their physical
   integrity rights. We argue that governments target repression against
   refugees for two reasons. First, refugees are easily scapegoated for the
   arrival of epidemics at a time when governments are looking to shift the
   blame for their own poor performance. Second, crises provide
   circumstances for governments to engage in opportunistic repression to
   further their goal of coercing existing refugees to depart and deterring
   new refugees from arriving. Drawing upon a global dataset of countries
   for the years 1996 to 2015, we demonstrate that epidemic outbreaks do
   indeed increase the likelihood and scale of government repression
   targeting refugee populations. These effects are especially pronounced
   in countries with higher proportions of refugees hosted and in less
   democratic countries. Identification of this potential for government
   repression of refugees during epidemics is important in light of the
   grave scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest the
   international community should be vigilant for signs of governments'
   mistreatment of vulnerable refugee populations to shift focus away from
   their own poor handling of crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
   and opportunistically advance their goal of reducing the numbers of
   refugees hosted locally.},

Abstract = {Combining individual-level with event-level data across 25 European
   countries and three sets of European Election Studies, this study
   examines the effect of conflict between parties in coalition government
   on electoral accountability and responsibility attribution. We find that
   conflict increases punishment for poor economic performance precisely
   because it helps clarify to voters parties' actions and responsibilities
   while in office. The results indicate that under conditions of conflict,
   the punishment is equal for all coalition partners when they share
   responsibility for poor economic performance. When there is no conflict
   within a government, the effect of poor economic evaluations on vote
   choice is rather low, with slightly more punishment targeted to the
   prime minister's party. These findings have important implications for

Abstract = {The number of countries that have adopted policies allowing emigrants to
   participate in home country elections from abroad has increased greatly
   in the last few decades. The enfranchisement of non-resident citizens in
   home country elections is, nevertheless, somewhat controversial because
   it gives political influence to individuals who are unlikely to be
   affected by the outcome of an election. Despite an active debate on
   external voting rights among political theorists, little is known what
   the citizens themselves think of this practice. To examine how both
   non-resident and resident citizens perceive external voting rights, we
   use two surveys of Finnish citizens from 2019. The first survey was
   directed to Finnish citizens living abroad (n = 1,949), and the second
   was conducted using an online panel consisting of Finnish citizens
   living in Finland (n = 994). Both surveys included items with normative
   questions about external voting rights, which allows us to compare what
   resident and non-resident citizens think of the enfranchisement of
   external citizens. Our findings suggest that resident citizens view
   external voting rights more negatively than non-resident citizens. The
   factors associated with these attitudes are also quite different for the
   two examined populations. For resident citizens more education and
   ideological self-placement to the left is associated with more positive
   views of external voting rights, while experience of having voted from
   abroad and dissatisfaction with democracy in the host country is
   associated with more positive views among non-resident citizens.},

Title = {Are Political Attacks a Laughing Matter? Three Experiments on Political
   Humor and the Effectiveness of Negative Campaigning},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {3},
Pages = {720-737},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the effectiveness of negative campaigning offers mixed
   results. Negative messages can sometimes work to depress candidate
   evaluations, but they can also backfire against the attacker. In this
   article, we examine how humor can help mitigate the unintended effects
   of negative campaigning using data from three experimental studies in
   the United States and the Netherlands. Our results show that (1)
   political attacks combined with ``other-deprecatory humor{''} (i.e.,
   jokes against the opponents) are less likely to backfire against the
   attacker and can even increase positive evaluations of this
   latter-especially when the attack is perceived as amusing. At the same
   time and contrary to what we expected, (2) humor does not blunt the
   attack: humorous attacks are not less effective against the target than
   serious attacks. All in all, these results suggest that humor can be a
   good strategy for political attacks: jokes reduce harmful backlash
   effects against the attacker, and humoros attacks remain just as
   effective as humorless ones. When in doubt, be funny. All data and
   materials are openly available for replication.},

Abstract = {In recent years, wildfires have ravaged the landscape in many Western
   American states, especially California. But will these horrific wildfire
   experiences increase public support for wildfire adaptation measures? We
   conducted an individual-level survey in California in 2019. Combining
   survey data with geocoded information about a respondent's proximity to
   wildfire events and exposure to wildfire smoke, we assess whether
   respondents' experiences increased support for several wildfire
   adaptation policies. We also control for party affiliation. We find that
   Californians generally oppose restrictive resilience policies and view
   the decision to take adaptive steps as a matter of personal choice.
   Republicans are generally more opposed than Democrats to spending public
   funds to incentivize resilience measures, but proximity to wildfires
   lessens their opposition to using public funds to encourage homeowners
   to upgrade their properties for increased protection from wildfires and
   encourage relocation to safer places. Although exposure to wildfire
   smoke is extensive and harmful to health, we found that its main impact
   on policy preferences was statistically insignificant.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research has documented the development of pervasive
   anti-Muslim sentiment among White Americans. We build on this research
   to demonstrate that anti-Muslim attitudes and negative stereotypes of
   Muslim people have become an enduring and consistent component of White
   Americans' presidential vote choice beyond any one specific candidate or
   election. We argue that the racialization of Muslim Americas has
   increased their salience and significance in both the minds of White
   Americans and in national political discourse, making attitudes toward
   Muslims a consistent predictor of Whites' presidential candidate
   evaluations in every election since at least 2004. We support this
   account with empirical evidence from the 2004-2020 American National
   Election Studies, using measures of group affect and negative
   stereotypes of Muslim people.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {25-46},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {According to the material-heuristics hypothesis, people's socioeconomic
   position affects their perceptions about the socioeconomic environment,
   including how society distributes opportunities and rewards and to what
   extent people are responsible for their own economic situation. These
   perceptions, in turn, affect attitudes toward wealth redistribution. In
   contrast to the material-heuristics hypothesis are the more familiar
   material self-interest hypothesis, which relates redistributive
   attitudes to one's personal interest in gaining or losing from
   redistribution; and the self-serving reasoning hypothesis, according to
   which perceptions of how society distributes opportunities and rewards
   are a consequence rather than a cause of attitudes toward
   redistribution, which are, in turn, driven by material self-interest.
   All three hypotheses connect socioeconomic position and attitudes toward
   redistribution, but only the material-heuristics and the self-serving
   reasoning arguments account for why perceptions of the causes of wealth
   and poverty vary across economic groups and why this variation matters
   for attitudes toward redistribution. Ignoring the role of such
   perceptions can lead to the simplistic attribution of attitudes toward
   redistribution to personal self-interest.},

Abstract = {The Brexit process has shattered the foundations of British politics,
   with prime ministerial resignations, government defeats, continuous
   rebellions and floor-crossings. These phenomena seem at odds with the
   usual decisiveness of Westminster systems. However, the aforementioned
   departures from the British tradition could be interpreted as compatible
   with the typical distance of any empirical reality from theoretical
   models, as exceptions to the rule due to the specificity of the European
   issue, or as the surfacing of some deeper social, economic and cultural
   tensions. Data alone are insufficient to confirm any of the alternative
   interpretations, although they seem to confirm the existence of
   long-term dynamics rather than some short-term exceptionalism. Within
   this scenario, the article suggests that a series of institutional
   innovations introduced since the late 1990s have facilitated the
   political consolidation of those tensions, contributed to the partisan
   dealignment, and made room for a potential departure from a Westminster
   model of democracy.},

Abstract = {Radical right parties have gained access to government across Europe,
   yet scholarly work on how they shape welfare states remains scarce.
   Therefore, this article examines how radical right parties affect family
   benefits. Combining pro-natalist views with a commitment to traditional
   gender roles, these parties seek to support family incomes without
   altering the traditional intra-family division of labour. Radical right
   governance should therefore correlate positively with spending on family
   allowances, but negatively with childcare expenditures. However,
   generous family allowances may become less attractive and childcare
   spending more attractive to the radical right as immigrant populations
   increase. An analysis of 26 European countries between 1980 and 2015
   shows a negative, yet noisy, effect of the radical right on childcare
   expenditures. By contrast, effects on family allowances are negligible.
   Further analysis also uncovers that radical right governance is
   associated with larger gaps between spending on family allowances and
   spending on childcare. Supplemental data for this article can be

Abstract = {Scholarship on media storms has yet to systematically assess their
   impacts on public opinion. This article aims to fill this gap by using
   survey data to analyze the evolution of public opinion with respect to
   the so-called ``refugee crisis,{''} a media storm that occurred during
   the 2015 Canadian federal campaign. The evidence shows that the storm
   influenced citizen attitudes in regard to key frames of the issue and
   that the effect persisted until the end of the campaign. They also
   demonstrate how the most prominent frame became a determinant of voting
   intention, and ultimately, vote choice. Overall, these findings suggest
   that citizens are receptive to media storms and therefore offer a
   concrete example of how media market logic can have a preponderant
   influence in the public sphere.},

Abstract = {War comes with terrible costs both in terms of money and lives. Do
   voters punish incumbents for these costs? Much of the existing
   literature on the effects of war deaths on public opinion toward
   incumbents and their war efforts suggests that the answer is yes. We
   test this proposition on data from a non-US case: Canada's war in
   Afghanistan. We estimate models of the effect of local war deaths on
   incumbent support using individual-level panel data from the 2006, 2008
   and 2011 Canadian Election Studies and aggregate district-level data
   from the 2008 and 2011 general elections. In none of our models do we
   find support for the conclusion that war deaths decrease support for
   candidates of the governing party. Instead, we find evidence at both the
   individual and district levels that support for Conservative party
   candidates is higher in districts that experienced war deaths.},

Abstract = {Focus group research is a useful methodology within and beyond the field
   of political science, as a source of core or supplementary data. The
   focus group literature is rich and full of guidance, but advice on using
   digital tools in certain stages of focus group research is relatively
   scarce. Aiming to fill those gaps, this article draws on experience with
   two projects in order to outline how researchers can harness
   technologies for focus group recruitment and data analysis. While
   traditional recruitment and data analysis techniques are useful, we
   identify advantages of technology-assisted approaches, particularly for
   focus group research with marginalized communities. Geared to both new
   and existing focus group users, the article identifies fruitful ways to
   harness a wider range of technologies for conducting focus group
   research while maintaining consistency with established principles and
   practices.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have increasingly begun to study how citizen
   characteristics shape whether-and how-they interact with the police.
   Less is known about how officer characteristics shape these
   interactions. In this article, we examine how one officer
   characteristic-officer sex-shapes the nature of police-initiated contact
   with citizens. Drawing on literature from multiple fields, we develop
   and test a set of competing expectations. Using over four million
   traffic stops made by the Florida State Highway Patrol and Charlotte
   (North Carolina) Police Department, we find that female officers are
   less likely to search drivers than men on the force. Despite these lower
   search rates, when female officers do conduct a search, they are more
   likely to find contraband and they confiscate the same net amount of
   contraband as male officers. These results indicate that female officers
   are able to minimize the number of negative interactions with citizens
   without losses in effectiveness.},

Title = {Creating critical citizens? Anti-austerity protests and public opinion},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Following the Great Recession, many countries witnessed large protests
   against the austerity policies their governments implemented. What was
   their effect on public opinion? I argue that these protests can make
   citizens more critical of elite performance, but not more disaffected or
   undemocratic. Anti-austerity protests voice civil society actors instead
   of elites in the public debate, making that debate more relatable. Such
   increased relatability can make individuals more comfortable expressing
   their own dissatisfaction, and it can make them perceive that their
   voice is more valued. Taking advantage of a demonstration happening
   during the fieldwork of the fifth wave of the European Social Survey in
   Portugal, I find exposure to the protest decreased satisfaction and
   trust in elites. I find no evidence that the protest made individuals
   more disaffected from politics or more undemocratic. Supporting the
   argument regarding the mechanism, the protest increased the number of
   claims by civil society actors reported in the press and its effect was
   stronger for individuals worse represented by institutionalized elites.
   These findings highlight the democratic importance of unconventional
   forms of participation, and deepen our understanding of their interplay
   with conventional politics.},

Abstract = {We examine how presidential management styles shape personnel on the
   National Security Council (NSC). We analyze presidential directives from
   Presidents Carter to Obama to categorize administrations as either
   ``Hands-Off{''} or ``Hands-On{''} managers of the NSC. Using Office of
   Personnel Management records, we construct a panel of all NSC employees.
   We find evidence of Hands-Off presidents favoring administrative staffs
   with higher levels of graduate education. Also, across the period
   considered, there has been a decline in previous government service for
   those working on the NSC. Finally, we find no evidence management style
   helps explain the exit decisions of NSC staffers.},

Abstract = {The crisis unleashed by COVID-19 has profoundly impacted the world of
   work, with many workers losing their jobs or with insufficient safety
   measures in place for those still in work. Migrant workers are among the
   precarious workforce that is employed in particularly affected sectors
   where they have been subjected to labour rights' violations for a long
   time. The pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated the exploitation
   of migrant workers in particular, as evident from the widespread
   occurrence of the non- or underpayment of wages for work that has been
   carried out. Despite the efforts made in recent years at the global
   level to arrive at a common framework to regulate international labour
   migration in accordance with international human and labour rights'
   standards, little progress has been achieved on the issue of wage theft.
   This article analyses the reasons why the institutional architecture in
   place is ineffective to tackle the settlement of outstanding wage
   claims. We use the concept of access to justice as a starting point and
   steer our examination towards global advocacy as epitomised by a
   concerted campaign by an alliance between civil society organisations
   (CSOs) and global union confederations, which calls for the
   implementation of a justice mechanism for repatriated migrant workers.
   Our analysis is specifically centred on low-wage migrants on temporary,
   employer-tied contracts as illustrated by the South Asia-Middle
   East/Gulf migration corridor.},

Abstract = {How do mass publics react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT+) advocacy efforts in socially conservative societies? We consider
   how the first-ever LGBT+ Pride in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina
   influences ordinary citizens' attitudes and behavior regarding LGBT+
   support. Using nationwide and local panel surveys, we find that support
   for LGBT+ activism increased locally after the Pride but did not diffuse
   nationwide, signaling how proximity mechanisms reinforce Pride effects.
   In survey experiments, we show that subjects are responsive to both
   mobilization and counter-mobilization appeals by local activists. We
   also find evidence from a behavioral experiment that the Pride had a
   positive effect on shifting the allocation of financial resources toward
   local pro-LGBT+ activists and away from opposition groups. Finally,
   in-depth interviews with local LGBT+ activists underscore the challenges
   facing LGBT+ activism in socially conservative societies but also point
   to the substantial possibilities of collective action on behalf of
   minorities at risk.},

Abstract = {Democratic backsliding in Central and Eastern European countries is on
   the rise. Independent judiciaries, other institutions of liberal
   democracy, as well as civil liberties and media freedom are being
   undermined, coupled with the human rights and dignity of certain groups
   being curtailed or even violated. In these difficult political and legal
   circumstances, non-state actors, such as interest groups, face many
   challenges. The goal of this research is to explore how interest groups
   in Poland perceive their position, what tactics they use in order to
   influence public policies and decision-makers, and whether they search
   for networking strategies in order to strengthen their position
   vis-a-vis the government. By placing our research in the Polish context,
   we fill the gap in the current literature on the situation of interest
   groups that face democratic backsliding. We base our analyses on new
   survey data collected from Polish interest groups in 2017-2018,
   conducted within the Comparative Interest Group Survey.},

Title = {Electoral impacts of a failed uprising: Evidence from Hong Kong's
   Umbrella Movement},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Do anti-regime protests in electoral autocracies benefit the opposition
   by shifting the political preference of the bystanders? We seek an
   answer to this question by examining the electoral impact of Hong Kong's
   Umbrella Movement. Analyzing the election outcomes at the
   polling-station level shortly after the movement, we find that protest
   exposure, as measured by spatial proximity to protest sites, is
   positively correlated with the decline of electoral support for the
   opposition. Individual level surveys indicate that the adverse
   influences of protest exposure manifest themselves in elevating
   by-standing citizens' sense of economic insecurity, even though the
   movement causes no persistent income loss, while enhancing political
   efficacy.},

Abstract = {Ever since the negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement
   (NAFTA), noncentral governments in the US have been clamouring for a
   bigger say in US trade policy making. Yet, constitutional and practical
   constraints remain for states to represent their trade policy interests.
   To investigate these constraints and how states try to overcome them,
   this contribution considers the case of the negotiations for the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and
   the US. I analyze how states formulated and represented their interests
   on the TTIP. While overall state interest representation on the TTIP was
   low, I find various avenues in which states mobilized, mostly in a
   coordinated setting including the federal government and mostly driven
   by progressive-leaning state legislators with a background in
   international trade. The analysis of state interest representation on
   the TTIP adds to the literature on noncentral actors in international
   trade policy making.},

Abstract = {What happens to the anti-establishment sentiments of pro-incumbent
   voters for a populist force that is in government and thus controls the
   political system? This article examines this question utilizing the case
   of Turkey, a country in which a populist force has been in power for
   more than a decade. By analyzing populist attitudes among a nationally
   representative sample, we demonstrate that while the voters of the
   incumbent populist party (AKP) are less likely, compared to everyone
   else, to hold populist sentiments, the same voters are also
   substantially more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that center on
   malign foreign powers. This finding is relevant beyond Turkey, because
   it demonstrates that populist forces might be able to maintain popular
   support and thus stay in power for a long stretch of time by employing
   government propaganda to fuel an antagonism against conspiratorial
   foreign and global forces.},

Abstract = {This study analyses how information provided by different types of
   interest groups influences the ability of members of parliament (MPs) to
   accurately perceive the preferences of those citizens who voted them
   into office. To study how information provision by interest groups
   affects MPs' perceptions, we combine unique data from a citizen survey
   and face-to-face meetings with 151 federal MPs in Switzerland, thus
   enabling a comparison of actual voter preferences with MPs' estimations
   of these preferences. Ties to citizen groups, as self-reported by MPs in
   our survey, relate to more accurate perceptions by MPs, even when
   controlling for MPs' partisan affiliation. Ties to business groups, as
   declared in the official registry, relate to less accurate perceptions.
   These findings suggest that interest groups can both tighten and weaken
   MPs' link to their party voters, which might have repercussions on
   substantive representation and democratic accountability.},

Title = {Fragmented foes: Affective polarization in the multiparty context of the
   Netherlands},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Affective polarization, or antipathy between the supporters of opposing
   political camps, is documented to be on the rise in the United States
   and elsewhere. At the same time, there are limits to our understanding
   of this phenomenon in multiparty contexts. How do citizens draw the line
   between `ingroups' and `outgroups' in fragmented contexts with multiple
   parties? Answering this question has been hampered by a relative lack of
   data on citizens' views towards compatriots with opposing political
   views outside the US. This study is based on original data collection,
   measuring citizens' evaluations of various political and non-political
   outgroups among a population-representative sample of 1071 Dutch
   citizens. These data allow to study the extent and configuration of
   affective polarization in the highly fragmented context of the
   Netherlands. The analysis shows that respondents do distinguish between
   parties and partisans. They report more dislike towards political
   outgroups than towards almost all non-political outgroups. Rather than
   disliking all out-partisans equally, evaluations grow gradually colder
   as ideological distance towards a group increases. Affective
   polarization is especially strong between those who disagree on cultural
   issues, and between those who support and oppose the populist radical
   right. The article discusses how these findings enhance our
   understanding of affective polarization in multiparty systems.},

Abstract = {The world's most intractable conflicts, with nonstate armed groups
   (NSAGs) as key actors, have emerged in Africa. The UN seeks to deal with
   such threats through the increasing use of sanctions. NSAGs often resist
   sanctions demands, protracting conflicts. What is the role of leadership
   in the outcome? The sanctions literature has given scant attention to
   how predominant leaders determine whether NSAGs yield to sanctions. The
   nexus between leadership and sanctions effectiveness deserves attention
   given the threat NSAGs pose to international security and the need for
   more effective sanctions in Africa. The Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
   in Sierra Leone, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
   (UNITA) in Angola, and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Uganda are
   employed to address the subject.},

Abstract = {The growth of populist radical right parties at the expense of
   Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI) has recently reconfigured the right in
   Italy. Changes in power relations created for the Lega (League),
   Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy, FdI) and FI, different competitive
   pressures, resulting in distinctive - and often conflicting - responses
   to the pandemic. Based on the analysis of these parties' Twitter
   accounts and on survey data, this article examines how right-wing actors
   positioned themselves vis a vis the government, and each other,
   throughout 2020. Eventually, the League became the government's most
   vocal critic, forcing FdI to follow suit; meanwhile, FI reinvented
   itself as a moderate, pro-EU party. Despite these changes, our analysis
   also stresses continuity, insofar as the alliance continued to craft its
   message around taxation, the EU, immigration and law/order, as it had
   done in the past. It also continued to enjoy electoral support similar
   to that of recent decades.},

   Stackelberg (who played a crucial part in the development of economic
   science in Spain) with national socialism, whose party he had joined in
   1931. The original sources employed -most of which, including his
   denazificaction file, have remained unpublished to this day- show that
   from 1936 onwards von Stackelberg progressively and outrightly distanced
   imself from the Hitler regime and the National Socialist Party. At the
   time of his arrival in Spain, von Stackelberg was actively collaborated
   in the resistance against Hitler, being also closely involved with those
   who planed and executed the attack against the Fuhrer on the 20th of
   July of 1944 in the plot known as ``Operation Valkyrie{''}.},

Abstract = {We study the properties of the group-based model of voting in elections
   with more than two alternatives. In that model, voters coordinate at the
   group level rather than making decisions at the individual level. We
   characterize the set of (pure strategy) equilibria under two of the most
   widely used electoral rules around the world: plurality and majority
   runoff. There is a unique equilibrium for a broad range of parameter
   values. We identify the features of an election that lead to different
   types of voting behavior: either sincere voting or coordination behind a
   limited number of candidates. Our model thus clearly predicts when
   Duverger's law will fail. Comparing plurality and majority runoff, we
   find that incentives to vote sincerely are stronger under the latter, in
   line with empirical evidence. A distinguishing feature of the
   group-based voting model is that, even in large elections, cardinal
   utilities shape voting behavior.},

Abstract = {The Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) is a highly contested doctrine when
   authorized or not. Yet, the need to safeguard civilian populations from
   mass atrocity remains urgent with Cote d'Ivoire's post-election violence
   being instructive. Numerous studies have interrogated the nature of the
   conflict and subsequent interventions in Cote d'Ivoire, yet only a few
   seem to focus on the intervention process, outcome and implications for
   future application of the RtoP. This highlights need for deeper
   interrogation of the issues emerging from United Nations Security
   Council's execution of Resolution 1975 in Cote d'Ivoire and the wider
   implications for the doctrine. While the Ivorian crisis meets the just
   cause criteria for RtoP authorizing, its execution in the Cote d'Ivoire
   exposed some challenges for the emerging doctrine. Challenges
   encompassing conceptual ambiguity, institutional issues and operational
   lapses leading to mass violation of rights of the civilian population by
   intervention forces, and the delegitimizing question of regime change.
   Future application of the RtoP must be context-specific accounting for
   the peculiarities of the environment where it is authorized; ensure
   effective monitoring and evaluation of the process and the actors
   involved; review of the thresholds for armed interventions; must engage
   local populations in the peace process and; must be backed by political
   will of both international and regional actors},

Abstract = {The salience of judicial institutions in democratic and nondemocratic
   countries has increased, making it important to have women on these
   powerful and visible decision-making bodies. Yet, women have only
   recently gained entrance to peak judicial bodies including
   constitutional and supreme courts. The appointment of the first woman to
   a high court is a historic landmark, breaking traditional ideas of who
   can and should be on the court. Using a global, longitudinal data set we
   show that certain explanatory factors matter differently in wealthy,
   stable democracies and in developing countries. The method of selecting
   high court justices exerts influence in wealthy, stable democracies but
   not newer ones. Further, our findings suggest that in both sets of
   countries, appointments to high courts are not made in a domestic vacuum
   and are influenced by international norms of having women participate in
   governing institutions.},

Abstract = {Violence and intimidation against politicians is gaining attention in
   research on obstacles to political gender equality, but we still do not
   know whether women experience more violence as politicians than men.
   This article provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of
   physical and psychological gender-based violence against officeholders
   across the political hierarchy. Based on three waves of survey data on
   8,000 local-level politicians in Sweden, I find that the most pronounced
   gender gap in violence exists among politicians high in the political
   hierarchy. Female mayors experience far more violence than any other
   politician. Further, there are indications that women receive a higher
   penalty than men for media visibility and for supporting minorities.
   This suggests that perpetrators of political violence are biased toward
   targeting women, particularly more powerful and visible women. The
   findings have important implications for understanding the personal
   price paid for holding positions of political power and how it differs
   by gender.},

Abstract = {Tolerance underlies many contemporary controversies, yet theorists and
   political scientists study it in strikingly different ways. This article
   bridges the gap by using recent developments in political theory to
   enrich empirical research and extend the study of tolerance to contexts
   beyond liberal democracies, such as authoritarian regimes. Our
   recommendations challenge dominant liberal-democratic frameworks by
   emphasizing variation across the (1) objects of tolerance; (2) possible
   responses to difference; and (3) sources of tolerance. We then
   illustrate the promise of our recommendations with three theoretically
   informed experiments inspired by historical debates about religious
   conversion. Our results suggest a marked `convert effect' across not
   only contemporary religious but also secular political divides, with the
   same difference in terms of content viewed as less tolerable when
   resulting from conversion than when given or ascribed. The research
   demonstrates the benefits of greater dialogue across political theory
   and political science, while shedding light on a central question of
   tolerance today.},

Abstract = {While there is widespread agreement in the ministerial promotion and
   resignation literature that experience matters, experience has typically
   been defined as the length of time a legislator has worked in politics
   or served in a legislature. This approach fails to account for the
   different kinds of experience legislators accumulate as they progress
   through their political careers prior to appointment to cabinet. We
   demonstrate how researchers can use sequence and cluster analysis to
   obtain a more complete understanding of ministerial appointment. We
   identify four data-driven archetypes of political careers in Canada for
   the period 1968-2015. We find that MPs with diverse political careers
   are more likely to be appointed to cabinet, while MPs with opposition
   experience are more successful than MPs with government experience. We
   also find that parliamentary secretary is not necessarily a stepping
   stone to a full cabinet position, calling into question traditional
   conceptions of parliamentary politics as a `ladder'.},

   `interpretation above the contradictions of the bourgeois autocracy
   operating in brazil after the military dictatorship, which he defined as
   a ``dissimulated dictatorship{''}, and about revolutionary potential of
   the workers' movement. In our evaluation, fernandes did not properly
   consider the capacity of the bourgeois autocracy to co-opt with the main

   movement that gave bourgeois domination a social and political stability

Abstract = {Between 1933 and 1934, the South American Bureau (BSA) of the Communist
   International (CI) published Informaciones. The hypothesis of this
   article is that, assuming extreme internationalism and adhering his
   analysis to the resolutions of the 12th Plenary of the Executive
   Committee of the CI, the BSA adopted a policy aimed at promoting a
   bourgeois-democratic and anti-imperialist revolution. Thus, the study of
   Informaciones allows an in-depth investigation of the Comintern's
   project for South American communism during the final phase of the Third
   Period.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a productive methodological debate about how
   political scientists ``do history.{''} However, on one important point,
   the discussion has been surprisingly thin. This concerns the problem of
   reading history backward rather than forward. To understand this
   problem, we need to embed it in broader methodological discussions of
   how the selection of evidence is shaped (and potentially biased) by all
   sorts of prior assumptions going into the evidence-collection process.
   Thus, reading history backward makes scholars refrain from posing
   certain questions, become blind to certain descriptive developments and
   explanatory factors, and fail to enlist certain historical data. This
   article pulls together the fragmentary insights about this problem and
   devises an alternative, prospective approach centered on an open reading
   of the work of historians. Although this is a ``low-tech{''} issue, it
   is one that has huge ramifications for the way we do historical analysis
   as political scientists.},

Abstract = {Research on political representation has shown that corruption is not
   gender-neutral: it benefits the recruitment of men to political office
   more than it does women. Yet, it is unclear if all men or a specific
   type of men, elderly men, benefits the most from corrupt networks in
   terms of political presence. The `old boys' network thesis' would single
   out older men as the most likely beneficiaries of the homosocial capital
   gained through informal ties in corrupt settings. In this article, we
   test this thesis based on a dataset comprising 98 national parliaments.
   Through bivariate and multivariate analyses, we find that corruption
   tends to benefit the presence of men regardless of their age. We further
   conjecture that the inclusion of young male patrons into nepotistic and
   clientelistic networks could further explain why these networks of
   `gendered' corruption have been so sticky over time.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, the neoliberal worldview has become reflected
   increasingly in the policy ideas and institutional innovations advanced
   by both major parties in the United States. This is most obvious in the
   realm of economic and social policy, but especially evident at the
   subnational level, particularly in the city. I argue that neoliberalism,
   as an ideology, a set of policy prescriptions, and institutional
   designs, is conceptually distinct from liberalism, especially in its
   ``New Deal{''} form, social democracy, and from conservatism. Moreover,
   it is having a developmental effect-neoliberal ideas and institutions
   have proved durable. This article argues that an urban lens most
   strikingly reveals the presence of a neoliberal political order that has
   also made its mark on national political institutions, particularly in
   the American political economy.},

Abstract = {Challenging the popular perception that Confucianism provides mostly a
   moral defense of political hierarchy, this article demonstrates that
   Confucianism is more than compatible with democracy and fundamentally
   contradicts political hierarchy, be it autocracy or meritocracy. Drawing
   on Zhu Xi (1130-1200 CE), the spokesperson for the state orthodoxy in
   late imperial China and one of the towering figures in the Confucian
   tradition, I argue that to realize the Confucian self-cultivation
   program for all requires popular participation in politics beyond
   casting ballots. My argument builds on Zhu Xi's moral egalitarianism
   that all human beings can pursue sagehood by self-cultivation and should
   be given the equal opportunity to do so. Since Zhu Xi's self-cultivation
   program requires acquiring and perfecting political knowledge in
   political practice, to realize his moral egalitarianism requires
   political equality for all. As such, my participatory theory of
   Confucian democracy exhorts all people to engage in self-governance and
   daily administration of the state more proactively. Thus, it enriches
   the prevalent liberal theory of Confucian democracy that focuses on
   political representation but not on popular participation in politics.},

Abstract = {The context of European parties has been through a process of
   significant transformation in recent years, with the fall of traditional
   mainstream parties and the rise of challenger parties. Despite their
   significant differences, mainly at the ideological level, we argue that
   challenger parties share some common characteristics when they first
   enter parliament. Namely, we expect them to employ a similar strategy as
   regards their relationship with the other party actors and to attempt to
   send the same message to their electorate: that they represent the
   alternative to existing parties, be it in government or in opposition,
   and will behave accordingly in parliament. We test our expectations by
   analysing and comparing the cooperation attitudes of challenger parties
   vis-a-vis the other opposition parties, using legislative co-sponsorship
   during their first term in parliament as an indicator and Social Network
   Analysis as a method.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the policy implications of national and
   regional climate change denial in Russia. While in general Russia has
   lagged behind in its climate mitigation policy, its key fossil-fuel
   regions are actively responding to external initiatives and pressures.
   As the country generally lacks substantial climate policy initiatives,
   the focus of this study is on the symbolic policy reactions
   operationalized as the media coverage of climate change at the national
   and regional levels in Russia during 2017-2018. Following the
   theoretical perspective of disproportionate policy response, the
   analysis elaborates on one of the suggested causes of policy over and
   underreactions, namely, the level of public demand for policy action.
   The findings indicate potential for disproportionate policy response
   research to conceive of public demand in broader terms, distinguishing
   between local, national and international domains.},

Abstract = {Presidential crises come in multiple forms. The September 11, 2001
   terrorist attacks on New York and Washington DC exemplify a type of
   crisis marked by a combination of four qualities: (1) a sudden event
   that is (2) unanticipated and (3) requires (4) an urgent response by the
   president. This article offers an account of the day's unfolding events
   as White House and other officials experienced them. It does so in the
   words of participants, most of them drawn from lengthy and
   recently-released interviews conducted by the University of Virginia's
   Miller Center as part of its George W. Bush Oral History. Like all
   historical methods, oral history is imperfect. Among its advantages,
   however, is that it supplements documentary White House records that
   have become steadily less revealing. The article concludes with a brief
   discussion of certain post-9/11 measures designed to enhance security,
   some of which have been effective but none of which forestalled the
   January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol.},

Abstract = {The striving for self-worth is recognized as a driving force in
   international relations; but if self-worth is understood as a function
   of status in a power hierarchy, this striving often is a source of
   anxiety and conflict over status. The quasi-international relations
   within the early modern German Empire have prompted seventeenth-century
   natural law theorists such as Samuel Pufendorf and Gottfried Wilhelm
   Leibniz to reflect about this problem. In his De statu imperii Germanici
   (1667), Pufendorf regards the power differences and dependencies between
   the Reichsstande to be an expression of the deficits of constitutional
   structure of the Empire-a structure that, in his view, causes internal
   division because it leads to distorted practices of esteem between the
   estates. Against Pufendorf, Leibniz argues De jure suprematus ac
   legationis (1671) that political actors such as the German princes who
   are not Electors could fulfill functions under the law of nations such
   as forming confederations and peace keeping. Incoherently, however,
   Leibniz excludes less powerful estates such as the Imperial cities and
   the Hanseatic cities from the ensuing duties of esteem. This
   shortcoming, in turn, is arguably remedied in Pufendorf's later
   considerations concerning duties of esteem in diplomatic relations.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that rising housing prices increase voter
   approval of incumbent governments because such a rise increases personal
   wealth, which leads to greater voter satisfaction. This effect is
   strongest under right-wing governments because those who benefit from
   rising prices-homeowners-are more likely to be right-leaning.
   Non-homeowners, who are more likely to vote for left-leaning parties,
   will view rising housing prices as a disadvantage and therefore feel the
   government does not serve them well, which will mitigate the advantage
   to left-wing governments. We find support for our arguments using both
   macro-level data (housing prices and government approval ratings in 16
   industrialized countries between 1960 and 2017) and micro-level data
   (housing prices and individuals' vote choices in the United Kingdom
   using the British Household Panel Survey). The findings imply that
   housing booms benefit incumbent governments generally and right-wing
   ones in particular.},

Abstract = {Intra-party democracy calls for party elites being responsive towards
   party activists. Yet, empirically, we know relatively little about how
   responsive parties are towards their rank and file and the factors
   influencing these processes. This article investigates drivers of party
   responsiveness towards activists, using a novel data source. Following a
   case study approach, the article analyses how motions submitted at 41
   post-war party congresses of the Austrian Social Democratic Party were
   treated by party elites (n = 3249). Results indicate that elite
   responsiveness is a means to appease activists when the party
   underperforms in party competition. Elites vary responsiveness across
   intra-party groups. They are more ready to accept the demands of those
   groups that are affected most by the party's failure to deliver. Party
   elites are also more responsive towards electorally successful subunits.},

Abstract = {Wilderness defines Americans, but the concept itself lacks definition,
   prompting premature laments of its demise and cavalier advocacy for its
   reformulation. I argue in this article that, in focusing more on what it
   does than on what it is, there is an underlying cohesiveness to the
   wilderness concept-that its important permutations consistently support
   and enhance the liberal tradition, especially that part of the tradition
   that celebrates the wide distribution of human reason. Wilderness and
   liberalism are perceived as symbiotic, I argue, and it is this
   relationship that endears wilderness to the American psyche. John
   Winthrop, Jonathan Edwards, and John Muir, as well as the postmodernists
   who dismiss him, all share an appreciation of wilderness that appeals to
   their liberal inclinations. So, while the backpacking motif evolves,
   John Locke remains a constant companion. And it is only at their peril
   that scholars ignore his presence.},

Abstract = {Since 2017, four provincial legislatures have introduced bills invoking
   the controversial notwithstanding clause. We present an original dataset
   of news articles from 10 different outlets that discussed the clause
   while these bills were being debated in Saskatchewan and Ontario.
   Empirically, although the clause is typically portrayed accurately, we
   find over one-fifth of articles about the clause did not indicate that
   it must be included in legislation. Normatively, the clause was twice as
   likely to be portrayed negatively as it was positively, and the type of
   portrayal was strongly associated with the ideological orientation of
   the news outlet. The rate of negative portrayals was similar across the
   two provinces, which suggests that attitudes toward the clause may
   endure beyond the policy issue itself or the level of media visibility.},

Title = {Distorting the News? The Mechanisms of Partisan Media Bias and Its
   Effects on News Production},

Abstract = {Integrating scholarship from several fields of study, this paper
   proposes a new model for understanding how partisan bias operates and
   how to measure its effects. We chart the factors that influence partisan
   bias over news production within news organizations that are
   simultaneously constrained and conditioned by factors of market
   competition, context considerations and journalistic norms. We argue
   that partisan media bias of a news-story is expressed in the manner that
   different news outlets cover the same political story within the same
   timeframe relative to one another. We find that description bias is a
   key parameter that is intertwined with selection bias mechanisms that
   highlight and downplay news items according to their content. We
   illustrate how partisan media coverage occurs in the context of a major
   political protest in Israel. We employ a dataset consisting of 1556 news
   products from all major newspapers. We find that partisan bias finds its
   strongest expression in the types of news products that the news outlets
   emphasize on their front-page and in the sizing of articles. These
   mechanisms of partisan bias can be generalized in the study of partisan
   bias in other types of news outlets.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the ongoing blockade of
   Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, which, for almost five months, was under
   the guise of an ecological protest. It examines the role of volunteer
   organizations linked to the Azerbaijani government in coordinating the
   volunteer protestors blocking the Lachin Corridor, as well as the
   demographic makeup of these volunteers, the majority of whom are
   students from Azerbaijan's public universities. The article delves into
   the origins and objectives of these organizations, as well as the
   benefits that Azerbaijani youth gain by joining them. The article also
   touches on the organizations' next goal, which is to utilize the same
   student volunteers to influence media coverage of the ``West Azerbaijan
   community,{''} an initiative introduced by the Azerbaijani government to
   justify its territorial claims on sovereign Armenian territory. The
   study contributes to the understanding of the political and social
   dynamics of the so-called ecological protest in Azerbaijan and its
   potential consequences for the broader conflict in the region.},

Abstract = {Using survey data collected from residents of counties along the South
   Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States, we use innovative
   compositional data analysis techniques to examine individuals'
   assignment of responsibility for hurricane preparedness across federal,
   state, and local officials as well as among household residents and
   their community. We find that the public assigns limited responsibility
   for hurricane preparedness to governments. Rather, respondents,
   especially conservatives and those with low trust in government, view
   individuals themselves as responsible for preparedness. Our results
   emphasize the role of ideology and the individualistic culture of
   American politics. These results also have implications for scholars who
   study individual attribution responsibility in multi-level systems and
   who may assume that individuals will assign responsibility to one of the
   various levels of government; however, focusing on disaster preparation
   in particular, our study shows that a significant number of individuals
   may not assign responsibility to government at any level.},

Abstract = {The exercise of power has radically changed in the modern era and is
   creating new challenges for democracy and democratic policy-making.
   Michel Foucault has introduced a whole new vocabulary to the
   understanding of governance which is critical to conceptualizing both
   the changing nature of power and its implications for democracy.
   Foucault articulates three fundamental ways in which the state has
   sought to maintain control of, act upon and maximize its capabilities
   through those under its charge: sovereign, discipline and security
   power. While the history of sovereign power has been well established
   and a plethora of literature has emerged articulating the various
   disciplinary mechanisms which have evolved over the recent past, the
   field of security power has been relatively understudied and is fruitful
   ground for exploration. This article seeks to explore the concept of
   security power as articulated by Foucault in his work Security,
   Territory, Population and articulate two major failures endemic to the
   operation of security power where theory fails practice. This work not
   only highlights the evolving nature of power but also the fundamental
   threat that security power poses for democratic policy-making and
   principles of governance.},

Title = {The radical realist critique of rawls: a reconstruction and response},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-205},

Abstract = {Despite the rapidly growing literature on realism, there's little
   discussion of the ideology critique of John Rawls offered by one of its
   leading lights, Raymond Geuss. There is little understanding of what
   (most of) this critique consists in and few discussions of how Rawls'
   approach to political theorising may be defended against it. To remedy
   this situation, this article reconstructs the realist ideology critique
   of Rawls advanced by Raymond Geuss, which has three prongs: (1) Rawls'
   political theory offers insufficient tools to uncover and address
   distortions of our political values, beliefs, and intuitions; (2) it
   unacceptably reinforces these distortions by unduly legitimating them;
   and (3) it diverts attention from important features of real politics.
   With this done, I finish by considering how Rawlsians can respond,
   chiefly by employing a wide reflective equilibrium that includes
   different forms of genealogy and ideology critique.},

Abstract = {Does the internet facilitate selective exposure to politically congenial
   content? To answer this question, I introduce and validate large-N
   behavioral data on Americans' online media consumption in both 2015 and
   2016. I then construct a simple measure of media diet slant and use
   machine classification to identify individual articles related to news
   about politics. I find that most people across the political spectrum
   have relatively moderate media diets, about a quarter of which consist
   of mainstream news websites and portals. Quantifying the similarity of
   Democrats' and Republicans' media diets, I find nearly 65\% overlap in
   the two groups' distributions in 2015 and roughly 50\% in 2016. An
   exception to this picture is a small group of partisans who drive a
   disproportionate amount of traffic to ideologically slanted websites. If
   online ``echo chambers{''} exist, they are a reality for relatively few
   people who may nonetheless exert disproportionate influence and
   visibility.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why Ukraine maintained a competitive
   electoral regime despite the dominance of authoritarian diaspora in the
   decades after the country became independent in 1991. The
   anti-democratic effect of the diaspora was significantly mitigated by
   the fact that it was not organized into a political party and split by
   longstanding regional divisions. Because of their disorganization and
   dispersion across the political spectrum, old Soviet elites possessed
   limited capacity to consolidate power. The result was ``pluralism by
   default{''} in which democratic politics emerged out of authoritarian
   weakness. At the same time, variation in the (dis)organization of
   different authoritarian diaspora networks partially explains divergent
   levels of political competition between different Ukrainian governments
   in the 1990s and early 2000s.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Representative democracy presents politicians with an information
   problem: How to find out what voters want? While party elites used to
   rely on their membership or mass surveys, social media enables them to
   learn about voters' issue priorities in real time and adapt their
   campaign messages accordingly. Yet, we know next to nothing about how
   campaigns make use of these new possibilities. To narrow this gap, we
   use a unique data set covering every Facebook post by party leaders and
   party organizations in the run-up to the 2017 Austrian parliamentary
   election. We test the hypothesis that party actors are more likely to
   double down on issues that have previously generated higher levels of
   user engagement. We also theorize that responsiveness is conditional on
   major/minor party status and pre-campaign issue salience. The analysis
   shows that parties' issue strategies respond to user engagement,
   especially major parties on low-salience issues. This represents some of
   the first empirical evidence on how social media can enhance parties'
   issue responsiveness.},

Title = {Beyond the dominant party system: the transformation of party politics

Abstract = {For almost a century, unionists won a majority of seats in every
   election to Northern Ireland's regional parliament or assembly. That
   unbroken run came to an end in March 2017 when unionists became a
   minority in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time. Much
   scholarly analysis of this new dispensation characterises it as part of
   a long-term shift away from the binary politics of ethnonational
   division and majoritarianism as support grows for parties aligned with
   neither unionism nor nationalism. This paper offers an alternative
   analysis that emphasises the persistent importance of constitutionally
   related majorities. It argues that the emergence in 2017 of a
   non-unionist majority in the Assembly removed the last vestiges of a
   dominant party system that had endured in one form or another since the
   establishment of Northern Ireland. It marks the birth of a new party
   system, bringing about a much more fundamental shift in the dynamics of
   political competition than is generally understood. Rather than moving
   the politics of Northern Ireland beyond constitutional questions, it
   brings those questions to the forefront, with profound implications for
   the long-term relationship between Northern Ireland on one hand and the
   Republic of Ireland and Great Britain on the other.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to survey the literature dealing with the
   relationship between defense expenditures and external debt. Especially,
   nowadays, amid the international financial crisis and the global
   security challenges, understanding the relationship between external
   debt and defense spending is prominent in designing the debt management
   policy in conjunction with defense policy. The empirical investigation
   has produced mixed results, which can be attributed to differences in
   data sets or time periods, variable selection, econometric methodologies
   used etc. However, most of the studies confirm the presence of a
   long-run relationship among military spending and external debt and
   consider military spending as a significant contributing factor to the
   stock of external debt.},

Abstract = {European politics is increasingly being contested along two dimensions:
   the economic left-right dimension and a relatively new dimension focused
   on European integration and immigration. We test this framework at the
   party and individual-levels in the European Union. First, we use the
   Chapel Hill Expert Survey to demonstrate that there is no simple
   relationship between these dimensions at the party level in many
   European Union countries, and in fact the two dimensions are
   increasingly orthogonal. We then use the 2019 European Elections Study
   to show that the transnational-nationalist dimension significantly
   improves vote choice models relative to models that ignore this
   dimension. Even more striking, the transnational-nationalist dimension
   is not just significant, but actually improves vote choice models as
   much or more than the economic left-right dimension.},

Abstract = {This article explores the ethos of London through a mixture of public
   history and personal memoir. London has long been dominated by a broadly
   humanist culture, with a blend of wit, tolerance, and affection, found
   in writers from Chaucer to Dickens and on to William Morris. In
   addition, of course, London is a site of enormous political and
   financial power; an imperial capital that ruled over territories across
   the globe. The centers of power - the City and West End - are surrounded
   by a series of urban villages where a lively humanism is found in street
   markets, banter, and pubs. This balance is, however, not always
   harmonious. On the contrary, the humanism constantly unsettles the
   power, erupting in everyday hooliganism and mass riots, and the colonial
   provinces regularly unsettle the imperial center through terrorism and
   political protests. I conclude by suggesting that this interplay of
   power and humanism might be both a perennial feature of the human comedy
   and a cultural achievement.},

Abstract = {Holding the government accountable is a crucial function of elections.
   The extent to which voters can actually do so depends on the political
   system. One element that may influence the likelihood that voters hold
   the government accountable is the difference between wholesale and
   partial alternation. Prominent political scientists like Mair, Bergman
   and Strom and Pellegata and Quaranta propose that in countries with
   wholesale alternation voters are better able to hold governments
   accountable because in essence voters have the choice to keep their
   current government or `throw the rascals out'. However, this
   relationship has not been tested. We examine the relationship between
   partial and wholesale alternation and retrospective voting in a large-N
   cross-country study. We show that the association between government
   satisfaction and vote choice is stronger in countries with wholesale
   alternation than in systems with partial alternation.},

Abstract = {Existing work on propaganda finds that its extremeness and effectiveness
   vary in sometimes puzzling ways in response to major environmental
   factors such as repression, diversion, and crisis. Formal models of
   propaganda generally examine these factors in isolation, rendering a
   comprehensive understanding difficult; moreover, they often impose
   rationality assumptions at odds with experimental findings. I propose a
   behavioral game-theoretic model of propaganda in which, consistent with
   psychology research, citizens are cognitively constrained and their
   skepticism toward propaganda is endogenous. These cognitive constraints
   generate a trade-off for the propagandist between motivating extreme
   action through extreme statements and triggering citizen skepticism. I
   then incorporate repression, diversion, and crisis into the model. I
   synthesize, and explain, empirical findings on the relationships between
   these factors by showing how each affects both the citizen's level of
   skepticism and the propagandist's calculus.},

Abstract = {Emergency rule provides opportunities for aspiring autocrats to subvert
   democratic institutions while still following constitutional rules.
   There has been a steady rise in the use of emergency rule for this
   purpose in recent years, leading many scholars to speak of
   ``permanent{''} emergency rule. Existing explanations of permanent
   emergency rule focus on national-level factors, completely neglecting
   the role of local political dynamics. Our goal is to trace how
   overlooked local conditions enable the permanency of emergency rule. We
   do so by looking at one particular autocratizing emergency decree in one
   province in Eastern Turkey that became permanent during its recent state
   of emergency: the removal of local elected Kurdish mayors and their
   replacement with state-appointed trustees. We draw on in-depth
   interviews, reviews of three local newspapers, and a review of
   parliamentary records and political statements, to argue that three
   local conditions were necessary for this process. First, this was not a
   new policy for this region, which had long been treated as exceptional;
   secondly, there were high levels of local polarization and zero-sum
   politics around the ethno-political divide; and thirdly, local politics
   was highly clientelistic. These reinforcing factors created weak
   municipal government and enabled its eclipse by an autocratizing centre.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of cultural identity on electoral and
   policy outcomes when voters are ``behavioral.{''} Building on the
   evidence that voters assess political or economic events through the
   lens of their partisan identifications, we analyze an election between
   two office-motivated candidates in which voters over-reward or
   under-punish the candidate that shares their cultural identity. Focusing
   on issues with cultural as well as distributional implications for
   voters such as immigration and the cultural divide based on nativism as
   the source of identity politics, we find that the candidates'
   equilibrium policies are always preferred by the electorally dominant
   cultural group to the policy that would be optimal if policies only had
   distributional consequences. We also show that candidates do not
   necessarily target their own cultural bases in equilibrium. Furthermore,
   stronger identity politics increases policy polarization. Our findings
   contribute to the debates on the decoupling of voting behavior from
   economic interests, and the rise of immigration, trade protectionism, or
   engagement with global governing institutions as electoral issues that
   can shift historical voting patterns.},

Title = {Instant Credibility: The Conditional Role of Professional Background in

Abstract = {For legislators without legislative experience, credibility can be vital
   to achieving legislative success, and expertise from one's professional
   background is a highly plausible source of such credibility. For
   example, when legislating in policy areas directly related to one's
   previous occupation, a legislator's colleagues may perceive policy
   instruments as more informed by expertise rather than ideological
   preferences. In this paper, I focus on several questions related to the
   linkage between professional background and legislative success, and
   specifically, the ability to guide authored bills through the
   legislative process. First, does a match between a legislator's
   professional background and the topic of legislation make that
   legislation more likely to advance in the legislative process? Second,
   if so, does the importance of professional background dissipate as
   length of legislative service increases? Third, does the relevance of
   professional background systematically differ across types of
   legislators and legislatures? I find strong evidence that having a
   relevant professional background does lead to legislative success for
   new members, but that this pattern persists later in the legislative
   career too. Moreover, I find that these patterns are especially strong
   for minority party legislators and in legislatures with higher levels of
   membership turnover.},

Abstract = {Suicide terrorism is one of the deadliest terrorist strategies adopted
   by various terrorist groups around the world, but the 9/11 terrorist
   attacks have made suicide terrorism a popular attack strategy among
   terrorist organizations at the global level. However, there is scarce
   research on the effect of the 9/11 attacks on suicide terrorism. Using
   data obtained from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) between 1981 and
   2018, this research examines the effect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on
   suicide terrorism and different types of terrorist organizations that
   commit suicide terrorism before and after 9/11 and the changes in the
   trends in the outcomes. The results of negative binomial regression
   tests comparing pre-9/11 and post-9/11 and monthly interrupted time
   series analyses showed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks had significant
   impacts on the above-mentioned outcomes. The results suggested that the
   9/11 attacks have played a critical role in inspiring and encouraging
   terrorist organizations - religious-based ones in particular - to adopt
   suicide terrorism as an attack strategy.},

Abstract = {The 2018 House of Representatives elections were a historic victory for
   the Democratic Party. As has been the case in past ``wave{''} elections,
   however, this victory has posed the risk of factionalism within the
   party. In this paper we draw upon data on primary competition and
   independent spending to assess claims that Democratic primaries showed
   signs of emerging factional conflict within the party, and we compare
   Democratic primary competition to competition that emerged within the
   Republican Party during the early 2010s. We show that, despite arguments
   from progressive activists about reshaping the party, there was
   relatively little money spent in 2018 for primary challengers or for
   other primary candidates who ran against the party establishment. Most
   consequentially, the money that was spent came from groups with narrow
   issue concerns or with concerns about descriptive representation, not
   from insurgent ideological groups. Democrats, then, might develop a
   ``primary problem{''} that resembles the one faced by Republicans in
   prior election cycles, but there is little evidence that the 2018
   primaries were the beginning of such a development.},

Title = {The Personal is Political: Reconsidering the Impact of Scandals on
   Congressional Incumbents},
Journal = {CONGRESS \& THE PRESIDENCY-A JOURNAL OF CAPITAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {While a number of studies reveal that incumbent members of the House of
   Representatives are adversely affected by scandal, rarely do these
   studies analyze a scandal's impact both on election outcomes and the
   decision to run for reelection. Studies of retirements in particular,
   moreover, rarely analyze separately the effects of private (i.e., sex
   and other moral scandals) and public (i.e., corruption and procedural)
   scandals or consider media coverage of the scandal. This research
   proposes that members of Congress involved in private and public
   scandals will be more likely to retire and win a smaller percentage of
   the vote than members not involved in a scandal, that private scandals
   will be more impactful than public scandals, and that the higher level
   of media coverage further harms an incumbent's congressional career.
   Also explored is whether the consequences of sex and other scandals were
   greater for accused members in the 115(th) Congress than in past
   Congresses because of heighted awareness and attention to sexual assault
   in the workplace since the 2016 presidential election and subsequent
   \#MeToo campaign. From data collected over 10 Congresses
   (106(th)-115(th) Congresses) and elections (2000 through 2018), the
   results show that incumbents who are involved in a sex scandal or other
   private scandal are substantially more likely to retire than members not
   involved in a scandal but that public scandals do not matter. In
   addition, both sex scandals and corruption scandals reduce the
   incumbent's vote share in the general election but that sex scandals
   matter slightly more. Higher media coverage affects both the decision to
   retire and the share of the vote. There is no evidence of a more
   pronounced direct effect of sex scandals on retirement decisions in the
   115th Congress and scandals more generally on the share of the vote in
   the 2018 elections.},

Abstract = {This text identifies a clear albeit moderate transition away from
   neoliberalism by the government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. This
   transition is conceptualized as post-neoliberal as opposed to
   anti-neoliberal. The notion of ``post-neoliberalism{''} here captures:
   a) the strategic adoption of elements of neoliberal discourse and
   policy-making to, paradoxically, curve the effects of neoliberalism
   itself; and b) the practical negotiation of an anti-neoliberal agenda
   generated in the context of social movement dynamics, confronted, once
   in government, with the realities of a country that has been transformed
   by the neoliberal period in irreversible ways -at least in the immediate
   and short term.},

   male anthologies not only at that time, but also in later centuries.
   However, not everything was positive, since talented poets whose
   lifestyle did not math the style that their founders wanted to impose at
   the Arcadia were left out of the institution. At least Cristina Dudley
   and Teresa Zani, among others, saw their poetic work recognized in

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {70-81},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the gender aspect of pension reform in the
   Russian Federation. The unfairness of men's later retirement compared to
   women is reinforced by the significantly lower average life expectancy
   of Russian men compared to women. At the same time, in recent decades,
   world experience has shown a tendency to equalize the retirement age for
   men and women. In Russia, the legislator did not even take into account
   the sharply negative public opinion on the issue of raising the
   retirement age, the low average life expectancy in Russia compared to
   developed countries, according to the experience of which in 2018 the
   decision was made to gradually increase the age to 65 for men and 60 for
   women for retirement. The author provides statistics on the average life
   expectancy in Russia, including men in various regions of the Russian
   Federation, examines the history of the problem, provides world practice
   in the issue of pension reform in recent decades, and analyzes the legal
   positions of the constitutional Court of the Russian Federation on the
   possible violation of gender equality when men retire 5 years later than
   women and international law.},

Abstract = {The realistic orientation of the military doctrine of the Ecuadorian
   Armed Forces has remained unchanged over time despite a dynamic scenario
   of threats to the State. The objective of the article is to determine
   the historical origin of the realistic roots in the doctrine of the
   Armed Forces and their link to the resistance to new roles demanded by
   the State and society in present days, which leads to rigidity in the
   military structure against threats such as drug trafficking and
   organized crime. The methodology applied is a case study, throughout a
   historical analysis within the classical realism approach of the
   International Relations theories. The study concludes that the realism
   perpetuated in the military doctrine of the Armed Forces might obey to a
   wrong construction of the threat to face. This triggers internal
   resistance to the change of role that the State demands from the
   military institution at present, in the face of diffuse and
   unconventional threats.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to study the international experience of
   involving citizens in the prevention and fight against crime. The
   research methodology includes the following legal, general, and special
   methods: logical method, hermeneutic method, monographic method,
   comparative legal method, sociological methods, abstract-logical method.
   The views of Ukrainian and foreign academics on the problem of involving
   citizens in cooperation with the police to prevent and combat crime are
   examined. It analyses the experience of individual countries around the
   world on the peculiarities of involving citizens in crime prevention. It
   examinesin detail the practice of cooperation of citizens with the
   police of countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Germany,
   and a few others. To achieve this objective, the relevant government and
   regional programmes of these states were studied and the necessary data
   analyzed. It is concluded that they haveidentified circumstances that
   prevent the participation of the population in cooperation with the
   police in Ukraine. As a result, they suggest appropriate ways to solve
   these problems.},

Abstract = {To legitimize its actions and to control the population, the Romanian
   Communist Party (PCR) worked constantly to impose its vision, with the
   propaganda apparatus acting intensely during both the period of Gheorghe
   Gheorghiu-Dej, as well as during the reign of his successor, Nicolae
   Ceausescu. From its establishment in 1956, the Romanian National
   Television (TVR) had been one of the instruments through which the voice
   of the communist authorities had been heard, both literally and
   figuratively. In this study I investigate the evolution of TVR as a
   propaganda tool of the communist regime during the 1970s, with a focus
   on the evolution of the propaganda programmes and on the main
   requirements of the Party. For this purpose, I used sources from the
   Romanian National Archives and the Archives of the Romanian Broadcasting
   Society, and I analysed the measures that PCR took in relation to TVR so
   that the latter meets the ideological expectations of the communist
   regime.},

Abstract = {The study of policy feedback on public attitudes and policy preferences
   has become a growing area of research in recent years. Scholars in the
   tradition of Pierson usually argue that positive, self-reinforcing
   feedback effects dominate (that is, attitudes are commensurate with
   existing institutions), whereas the public thermostat model developed by
   Wlezien and Soroka expects negative, self-undermining feedback. Moving
   beyond the blunt distinction between positive and negative feedback,
   this article develops and proposes a more fine-grained typology of
   feedback effects that distinguishes between accelerating,
   self-reinforcing and self-undermining, specific and general, as well as
   long- and short-term dynamic feedback. The authors apply this typology
   in an analysis of public opinion on government spending in different
   areas of the welfare state for twenty-one OECD countries, employing a
   pseudo-panel approach. The empirical analysis confirms the usefulness of
   this typology since it shows that different types of feedback effects
   can be observed empirically.},

Title = {Governing Precarious Immigrant Workers in Rural Localities: Emerging
   Local Migration Regimes in Portugal},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {185-195},
Abstract = {Over the last decades, the globalization of the food and agriculture
   sector has fueled international labor migration to rural areas in
   Southern Europe. Portugal is no exception to this trend, as the
   intensification of foreign investment in agriculture combined with a
   declining and ageing workforce created a demand for flexible immigrant
   labor. The Eastern European and Asian immigrant workers who answered the
   industry's call were confronted with poor working conditions and
   lack-ing access to public services. In this article, we zoom in on the
   governance challenge that the presence of precarious immigrant workers
   (PIWs) poses to rural municipalities in the south of Portugal. The
   burgeoning literature on local inte-gration policies mainly focuses on
   how cities deal with the challenge posed by international labor
   migration. This article draws on a detailed case study of the
   municipality of Odemira to argue that more attention needs to be paid to
   emerging local migration regimes in non-urban localities. By adopting a
   regime-theoretical approach, we study how power relations between the
   local government, civil society, and the private sector play out around
   the question of immigrant reception. Our study suggests that immigration
   policies in rural localities are increasingly being developed through
   cooperation and coproduction between public and private actors. First,
   we demonstrate how the presence of PIWs is perceived as a policy
   ``problem{''} by each actor. Second, we outline how a governing
   coalition formed around the shared concern to improve arrival
   infrastructures, stimulate integration, mediate socio-cultural impact,
   and accommodate business interests. We con-clude by critically
   questioning the impact that emerging local migration regimes have on the
   rights and social position of PIWs in rural contexts.},

Abstract = {While it is true that there are economic limits that allow the

   that every constitutional state of law has established a vital minimum
   as obligatory, that is, minimum fundamental rights that the State is
   obliged to grant to your citizen This is the case since our legal system
   expresses the recognition of principles of justice of the highest moral
   importance, that is, Human Rights, which has prima facie priority over
   any other objective social or collective right, since in a liberal
   society and democratic, the latter have only instrumental and not final
   value ( Judicial Weekly of the Federation, 2017). That is why the study
   of public policies in the field of Fundamental Rights is proposed, which
   goes beyond solving a problem to materialize subjective rights through
   objective instruments.},

Title = {``The French Minister of Budget raises more ideas than taxes.{''} Two
   literary prizes for economic books under the ``high patronage{''} of the
   French Ministry for the Economy and Finance},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Since the 2000s, The French Ministry of Budget has been committed to a
   policy of economics education, bringing together public, private, and
   nonprofit organizations. An example of where the effects of this policy
   can be seen is in ``the high patronage of the Ministry for the Economy
   and Finance{''} granted to two litterary prizes in the field of
   economics: the Prix du livre d'economie - run by the nonprofit
   organization Lire la societe, which has close ties to the political and
   administrative elite and the economic press - and the Prix Turgot for
   the best book on financial economics - awarded by a think tank with
   strong links to financial elites. By examining their institutional
   environment (partner companies and public institutions), and the
   prosopography of their actors (organizers, judges, and winners), this
   study questions a particular form of relationship between temporal power
   and spiritual power over the economy. We show that the two prizes seek
   to capture and control resources that the judges and organizers lack:
   titles of intellectual and scientific legitimacy, academic positions and
   expertise, and media notoriety. If this differential shows the
   heteronomy of the work of consecration, entrusted to agents and
   institutions lacking legitimacy in the production of economic knowledge,
   our investigation shows that the function of consecration is coupled
   with a latent function of socialization between economic, intellectual,
   and media elites, and with an ideological function of promoting economic
   liberalism that benefits from the ``high patronage{''} of the Ministry
   of Budget.},

   addresses the difficult question of what is human nature, or the nature
   of being human. And, whether this `nature' is purely a phenotypic
   quality shared with all biological life, and as such open to biological
   modification and transformation? Or does human nature constitute a quite
   different and unique set of attributes? What Marx identified as `species
   being,' characterised by a very different understanding of
   transformation, that of productive activity or praxis.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {760-773},
Abstract = {Over the last ten years, the masses have taken to the streets in many
   countries of the Middle East and North Africa, determining a rapid
   dislocation of the mechanisms that order societies and creating the
   potential conditions for deep transformations. Despite this, the results
   have been modest. Dealing with political revolutionary movements that
   have failed to ignite social revolutions, scholars have questioned
   whether these events can be regarded as revolutions and which
   theoretical instruments are the most appropriate to explore a changing
   region. This article discusses these issues. It does so in two ways.
   Firstly, the article criticises the most common understandings of
   revolution and proposes a different interpretation of the phenomenon.
   This is based on a three-step strategy, which moves beyond an
   evolutionist interpretation of history, takes into account different
   dimensions of revolutions, and distinguishes different types of
   revolution. Secondly, to study revolutions properly, the article
   proposes to combine insights from both structuralist approaches and
   microfoundational studies. This allows to develop a moving picture of
   the revolutionary situation that does not overlook class and
   institutional aspects. Scholars can do this by scaling down the level of
   analysis from the outcome that revolution produces to the mechanism that
   puts it in motion.},

Abstract = {Our work is an attempt to elucidate the role of truth and how it is
   considered in the foundations of nonviolence expressed by Lev
   Nikolaevich Tolstoy and Mohandas K. Gandhi.
   Once the difference between relative truth and ontological truth has
   been proposed and analyzed, this review reflects on some daily
   manifestations which could express this ontological truth. Accepting
   that we are dealing with an ineffable and elusive concept, we reflect on
   whether its daily expression can be found -as we propose- in the
   virtuous practice of love, justice or humility, among other values.
   In the first part we will compilate the reflections bequeathed by these
   two mentors of nonviolence; in the second part we will offer some keys
   to interpret those expressions of this ontological truth. These keys
   will be matched with the ideas spreaded by the authors themselves, and
   will be offered as the ethical values that may be cultivated by the
   nonviolence thinking.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses presence of populistic rhetoric in the behaviour of
   two Slovak prime ministers who have been responsible for managing the
   COVID-19 pandemic. It is based on Brubaker's (2017) work on populism and
   tries to identify his six elements within the area studied. The main
   argument is that even though these two actors have different political
   backgrounds and experience, both use a populist repertoire in their
   communication and actions and having to deal with a crisis such as
   COVID-19 pandemic is not the reason to not use it. It is important to
   analyse societal structures as the COVID-19 pandemic not only put lives
   at risk, but also economic and social rights and the security of the
   state.},

   Brexit},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-89},
Abstract = {To what extent has Brexit affected Norwegians' perceptions of their
   current relationship with the EU? What are the considerations that
   central political and societal actors bring up to explain their stances?
   What are the broader lessons for the EU's relations with non-members? We
   argue that Norway's EU affiliation is so close that we can draw on
   Catherine De Vries' benchmark theory to assess whether Brexit affects
   Norwegians' assessments of Norway's relationship with the EU. We focus
   on the Norwegian government's stance. Further, we consider opinion polls
   to understand the strength of domestic support for the EEA Agreement,
   and whether that support has changed as a consequence of Brexit. We
   thereafter look for political entrepreneurs or political change agents,
   in political parties, in interest groups, and among civil society
   activists. We find that Brexit has not served as a benchmark. It has not
   set in motion efforts to change Norway's EU affiliation. Opponents
   diverge on alternatives, although share concerns about what they see as
   the EU's neoliberal orientation. The analysis shows that we cannot
   assess Brexit as a benchmark without paying attention to the sheer size
   and magnitude of the EU-Norway power asymmetry.},

Abstract = {The authors view the main issues raised in Charles Merriam's article The
   Present State of the Study of Politics in the context of the current
   trends in the development of political knowledge in Russia and
   worldwide. Merriam proposed a new view of Political Science as a
   scientific discipline with its own research goals related to the
   empirical study of the political behavior of people. Merriam's approach
   to determining the status of Political Science within the framework of
   social knowledge assumed delineating its own problem field and
   identifying those factors that determine events taking place in this
   field. Merriam emphasized the relativity of both the autonomy of
   politics and the significance of the impacts that are exerted upon
   politics.
   Professional organization and coordination of political studies (one of
   Merriam's key initiatives) at the beginning of the 21st century are
   associated with the competition between hierarchical and network models
   of interaction between representatives of the Political Science
   community. Moreover, the current state of discipline in Russia is
   largely determined by the specifics of its institutionalization. Unlike
   the United States, where the evolution of Political Science took place
   under the decisive influence of formalized knowledge, the Russian
   Political Science is still influenced by some of the approaches inherent
   in the old-fashioned institutionalism. The movement of Political Science
   in the direction of interdisciplinary synthesis, which received its
   impetus from the scientific and organizational activities of Merriam,
   was not linear. The current methodological configuration of the
   discipline is most adequately expressed in the concept of
   ``multiparadigmality{''}, which does not solve the problem of bringing
   together conflicting methodologies.},

   Enlightenment had also penetrated them, who anxiously longed for the
   arrival of a definitive turn that would culminate in a radical
   transformation of society, where, finally, there would be room for both
   sexes on equal terms. However, the acclaimed proclamation of the
   Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, approved in Paris
   in 1789, above all expectations, will exclude them from the sphere of
   human rights There were many reactions in Europe against such injustice,
   among them the publication, in Italy, in 1794, of the treatise Breve

Title = {Left Accelerationism, Transhumanism and the Dialectic: Three Manifestos},
Journal = {NEW PROPOSALS-JOURNAL OF MARXISM AND INTERDISCIPLINARY INQUIRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-154},
Abstract = {Left accelerationism and the transhuman subject who embodies this
   movement's political potential have multivalent relations to Marxism.
   Whilst recent interventions such as Srnicek and Williams' \#Accelerate:
   Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics and Bastani's Fully Automated
   Luxury Communism (FALC) situate themselves within the Marxist tradition
   (typically relying heavily on the ``fragment on machines{''} section of
   the Grundrisse), immediately apparent is a problem of both politics and
   epistemology. In positing a transhuman subject that resolves
   ontologically the antagonism between labour and capital, left
   accelerationism flattens and dehistoricizes the specific and contingent
   historical and material conditions that make possible the thinking of
   this subject at all, and lapses from a properly dialectical mode of
   thought in its breathless rush to adumbrate the ``inevitable{''}
   conditions for this subject's emergence. Here, we are close to
   Althusser's notion of history as a ``process without a subject{''}
   (Althusser 1969), and a similar lack of dialectical rigour can be
   discerned. E.P Thompson's polemic against Althusser reminds us of what
   is at stake in a Marxism that is fundamentally antagonistic to a
   thorough engagement with - and immersion in - history, specifically
   history as lived and made by real human subjects, and we can likewise
   trace in left accelerationism's idealised transhuman a subject for whom
   history offers no socially embedded place, only an abstract theoretical
   subject-position. In short, despite the inventiveness and optimistic
   constructivism evident in Bastani and Srnicek and Williams' manifestos,
   these very qualities speak to the lack of a properly and consistently
   dialectical epistemic framework: they thus implicitly reject what
   Jameson describes as ``the austere dialectical imperative{''} necessary
   to think capitalism as ``progress and catastrophe all together{''}
   (Jameson 2000, 226). Drawing on Noys, Brassier, Wood, Thompson and
   Jameson, this paper will critique left accelerationism's consistent
   divergence from a materialist dialectic, and show how these lapses elide
   the contingent and always in-process nature of the political struggles
   that determine who the subject/s of any future historical period will be
   or can be. Left accelerationism contains seeds of radical political
   potential, however the lapses into idealism and techno-utopianism to
   which it is so prone result precisely from an abandonment of dialectical
   materialism in the very instances where a generic transhuman subject is
   articulated: in conceiving class relations thus, an inattention to ``the
   hard lesson of some more genuinely dialectical way to think historical
   development and change{''} (Jameson 2000, 225) is revealed. The paper
   will contrast Srnicek and Williams and Bastani's manifestos with the
   Xenofeminist Manifesto, arguing that this latter offers a more promising
   basis for an emancipatory class politics precisely because it demands
   serious and sustained engagement with the forces and relations of
   production at the level of their bounded and contingent historical
   specificity. It is only by resisting the abandonment of the dialectic in
   order to imagine the future that we might seriously arrive at a useful
   picture of our destination.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the contribution of housing squats and Housing
   Rights Movements (HRMs) in Rome in envisioning a new model of public
   estates that could respond to the surge and complexification of the
   post-2008 housing crisis. The first part of the article fleshes out the
   theoretical and methodological framework for investigating the
   peculiarities of housing squats in comparison to other forms of housing
   informality and urban squatting. In the second part, it analyses the
   development and composition of housing struggles since the post-Second
   World War. It then details the new demographics of the housing crisis in
   Rome to provide a framework for the innovation in the HRMs'
   confrontational politics and demands towards a more comprehensive notion
   of the `right to the city'. Their emphasis upon the role of city
   developers and real estate agents, and the opposition towards the
   exclusionary nature of contemporary social welfare, have in fact
   redirected squatting actions towards different urban vacancies that are
   repurposed for habitation. I conclude by suggesting that these practices
   prefigure a new model of public housing estates that is economically,
   environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive, whereby it pivots
   around use value and commoning.},

Abstract = {The modern world community is concerned about the search for humane,
   non-forceful methods for solving hybrid conflicts that characterize the
   system of international relations of the 21st century. That is why the
   concept of preventive diplomacy has become popular and in demand. The
   conflict in the East of Ukraine has shown that this concept has some
   flaws in terms of its implementation in practice. Using the historical
   method, the key means of implementing preventive diplomacy are revealed.
   The article analyzes examples of the use of preventive diplomacy methods
   for solving conflicts in Europe by the Organization for Security and
   Cooperation in Europe. The authors used the method of comparative
   analysis to compare examples of implementation of the principles of
   preventive diplomacy by different international players. Attention is
   drawn to the fact that excessive caution of the OSCE and unwillingness
   to call Russia a participant in the conflict and even more, so an
   aggressor country led to skepticism about the organization itself in
   Ukraine.},

Title = {Policy Assemblages and Policy Resilience: Lessons for Non-Design from
   Evolutionary Governance Theory},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {451-459},
Abstract = {Evolutionary governance theory (EGT) provides a basis for holistically
   analyzing the shifting contexts and dynamics of policymaking in settings
   with functional differentiation and complex subsystems. Policy
   assemblages, as mixes of policy tools and goals, are an appropriate unit
   of analysis for EGT because they embody the theory's emphasis on
   co-evolving elements within policy systems. In rational practice,
   policymakers design policies within assemblages by establishing
   objectives, collecting information, comparing options, strategizing
   implementation, and selecting instruments. However, as EGT implies, this
   logical progression does not always materialize so tidily-some policies
   emerge from carefully considered blueprints while others evolve from
   muddled processes, laissez faire happenstance, or happy accident.
   Products of the latter often include loosely steered, unmoored, and
   `non-designed' path dependencies that confound linear logic and are
   understudied in the policy literature. There exists the need for a more
   intricate analytical vocabulary to describe this underexplored `chaotic'
   end of the policy design spectrum, as conjuring images of `muddles' or
   `messes' has exhausted its usefulness. This article introduces a novel
   metaphor for non-design-the bird nest-to bring studies of policy design
   and non-design into lexical harmony.},

Abstract = {Based on documentary scientific methodology, the legal aspects of the
   circulation of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine and other countries of the
   world are analyzed. The relationship between the state's level of
   economic development and the level of its interest in cryptocurrencies
   is demonstrated. It was shown that almost all successful states can
   create and implement their own cryptocurrency. In addition, it was noted
   how important the issue of choosing the proper form of legal regulation
   of the cryptocurrency industry is today. For example, many researchers
   and experts have emphasized that a kind of compromise must be reached on
   issues related to the legal regulation of cryptocurrencies. It is
   therefore concluded that this applies to both the sphere of domestic and
   international law, where clarity, transparency and unambiguousness of
   legal norms must prevail. Regarding the latter, it is clarified that
   cryptocurrencies should no longer exist as a shadow source of income for
   unidentified individuals. Instead, they should be completely banned and
   eliminated in both the economic and legal fields, or they should be
   legalized and regulated by current legislation.},

Abstract = {The model of the IV Industrial Revolution emerges as a new productive
   paradigm, based on technological change, with an enormous impact on
   labor markets with structural and permanent changes. The Spanish case is
   relevant because it is an economy linked to a supranational integration
   organization to which it has ceded its monetary sovereignty. The
   peculiarities of the country's economic structure explain the
   functioning of the labor market, which is highly exposed to the
   onslaught of the pandemic. However, the public authorities have the
   legitimacy and legal capacity to implement a comprehensive plan focused
   on investment and development together with active employment policies
   that will enable them to face the challenges of the post-COVID-19
   scenario.},

Abstract = {Cartoons are a form of expression of public debate that gain particular
   significance in times of suppression and a lack of political freedom.
   Poland, which has experienced many such episodes throughout its history,
   already began developing diverse versions of this genre from the 19th
   century onwards. One first high point came between the two world wars.
   In socialist Poland, political cartoonists turned to indirect criticism
   in order to escape the censors, and developed highly refined ways of
   doing so. When censorship fell away in 1989, new freedoms suddenly
   became possible, while at the same time, the number of satirical
   magazines declined. With the growing political pressure under the PiS
   government, cartoons have gained in importance once again - a fact that
   is reflected in the huge popularity of the well-known cartoonists on
   social media.},

Abstract = {The ``end of history{''} actually turned out to be the beginning of the
   end for the global hierarchy of the West, centered around societies
   which identified themselves as liberal market democracies. At present,
   one can observe a consistent weakening of Western economic, political,
   and military hegemony, accompanied by the rise of non-Western centers of
   power. The world is again moving towards conflict multipolarity, and
   this movement is determined by a number of background factors affecting
   all contemporary societies. This is the achievement of several factors:
   the limited capacity of global markets alongside the model of endless
   economic growth, the crisis of societies' class stratification, the
   strengthening of inequality, and the crisis of social policy focused on
   the labor and military usefulness of citizens. These changes allow us to
   formulate two interrelated theses developed in the article. The first
   thesis is that the globally changing economic and political ontology,
   which can be described as the rental turn, no longer can be convincingly
   described from the mainstream perspective, one of the main tasks of
   which was to ideologically legitimize Western hegemony. The second
   thesis is that the concepts of contemporary societies - running
   alternative to the neoliberal mainstream - that do not reveal in them
   the qualitative political, economic, and cultural differences lying at
   the foundation of the intellectual and institutional hierarchies are
   becoming increasingly relevant. Alternative descriptions are built
   primarily on the reassessment of capitalism, democracy, and market
   exchanges as an indispensable core of modernity, framed in the form of
   the liberal consensus. Under the public ideological variations of the
   liberal consensus, hidden mechanisms can be found, revealing themes of
   power-ownership, rent-seeking behavior, oligopolies, inherited power,
   and economic policy, far from the principles of self-regulated market
   competition. The neoliberal mainstream continues to classify these
   trends as archaic, traumatic, and unworthy deviations that need to be
   brought back to normal. The paradox is that liberal democracy itself
   ceases to be the norm, turning into a specific ideal of the political
   system, less and less attainable even in Western societies, where this
   ideal was considered to be realized in practice. The article proves the
   fallacy of the negative moral assessments of trends inconvenient to the
   mainstream. It is argued that fundamental changes, initially assessed
   within the narrow framework of liberal market modernity as archaic
   (neo-feudalism, neopatrimonialism, rent-estate society), will only
   increase ontologically. They will lead to the formation of a new
   consensus among researchers about the value-institutional economic and
   political normality of 21st century societies against the background of
   reaching the natural limits of capitalism and leveling Western hegemony.
   The new normality appears as a rent-estate society in an adaptive market
   shell, differing only in its relative thickness.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-460},
Abstract = {Existing work describes child soldiers as very violent towards
   civilians. Challenging this, I posit that children's effect on group
   behaviour is conditioned by rebels' civilian support. Because they have
   weak pre-existing norms, children are both prone to normalize violence
   and susceptible to rebel efforts to control their use of violence. They
   should thus closely follow group rules in their behaviour towards
   civilians, implying a moderating effect of these rules. I expect that
   child soldiering increases civilian victimization only for groups who
   lack incentives to show restraint towards civilians because they receive
   no support from them. Empirical tests support this expectation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-97},
Abstract = {As many commentators highlighted, a distinguishing feature of Arrighi's
   notion of hegemony lays in its Gramscian background. However, an
   in-depth analysis of the uses and problems of the Gramscian concept of
   hegemony in the work of Arrighi is still missing. The aim of this
   contribution is thus to fill this gap, by showing how the interpretation
   and use of Gramsci's ideas of hegemony by Arrighi looks far more
   problematic than himself admitted. The main argument here defended is
   that the Gramscian definition of hegemony constitutes at the same time a
   veritable cornerstone and the weakest point in Arrighi's general theory.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Pages = {96-129},
Abstract = {While critics characterize Jair Bolsonaro's supporters as authoritarian,
   they don't see themselves that way. For them, their discourses and
   practices would be truly democratic ones. Considering this premise, the
   objective of this paper is to present a preliminary research result that
   seeks to explain how Bolsonaro's supporters mobilize the tensions
   between individual freedom and democratic institutions to convey notions
   associated with the word democracy on YouTube. The article raises the
   hypothesis that these notions associated with the word democracy are
   based on the political mobilization of fears, and that they find their
   basis for construction and maintenance in the idea of a good citizen,
   and not in democratic institutions. To test the hypothesis, this article
   analyzed interpretations of the case of the arrest of Congressman Daniel
   Silveira in two self-styled channels supporting Jair Bolsonaro, Te
   Atualizei and Canal Hipocritas. Coding was used for the organization and
   analysis of the material, using the grounded theory (GT) as a
   methodology and based on a theoretical methodological debate with an
   interpretative framework. The results found confirm the raised
   hypotheses, although it concerns the particular cases analyzed, without
   the pretense of generalization.},

   (The Cases of Kostroma and Yaroslavl)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {3},
Pages = {38-56},
Abstract = {This article describes the findings of a study into the municipal public
   policy (MPP) of four municipal entities (ME) in the Kostroma and
   Yaroslavl regions. The focus of MPP is placed on the peculiarities of
   local proprerties oriented around social order, based on the balance of
   interests between major local community social groups and local
   authorities, cross-sector partnerships, and the principles of the
   coordination of interests for the common good of development on the
   territory. On this basis, the typological features of MPP are studied.
   It is shown that in Kostroma (an urban district) a centered-type MPP has
   formed, albeit with a certain tendency to break. In Krasnoe-on-Volga
   (another urban settlement) an MPP with potential breakage has instead
   formed. Yaroslavl is characterized by its balanced MPP. In Rostov
   Veliky, the MPP's properties stand out to a large extent due to their
   fragmentary nature. In general, there is a tendency that the less
   pronounced the level of socio-economic development of a municipality and
   the degree of its urbanization, the lower the quality of public
   interaction between the three sectors of the local community. Based on
   the index approach, the analysis of the features of institutions and
   mechanisms of MPP in four municipalities - according to the criterion of
   the viability of the necessary institutions - is presented. An indicator
   to show the completeness of the functional of actors and subjects of MPP
   is introduced, and the features of the subject activities at the
   municipal level are studied in four MEs. The nature of the existing MPPs
   in the analysed municipalities is characterized by state paternalism,
   which somewhat limits the possibilities of local self-government as an
   institutions of civil society.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the work is to analyze the transformation and efficiency
   of the organizational and legal mechanism of Ukraine's state policy in
   the field of tourism and hospitality. Methods of grouping, modeling, and
   forecasting, methods of theorization and historicalformalization,aswell
   asmethods of analysis, comparison, sampling, and description of the
   system were used to substantiate scientific principles and approaches
   for the development of organizational and legal mechanisms of Ukrainian
   state policy in the field of tourism and hospitality. In addition, the
   study identifies the conceptual foundations of the organizational and
   legal mechanism of Ukraine's state policy in the field of tourism and
   hospitality, which corroborates the importance of updating national
   legislation, its unification with international, including European,
   improving the Tourism and Resorts Strategy of Ukraine. As contributions
   of the research andoutline the objectives and prioritymeasures of the
   state policy in the field of tourism and hospitality, the strategic
   tasks of the state policy in this area are formulated, namely: to ensure
   progress towards the formation of a unique tourist space with other
   countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).},

Abstract = {While congressional committee members sometimes hold hearings to collect
   and transmit specialized information to the floor, they also use
   hearings as venues to send political messages by framing an issue or a
   party to the public which I refer to as ``grandstanding.{''} However, we
   lack clear understanding of when they strategically engage in
   grandstanding. I argue that when committee members have limited
   legislative power they resort to making grandstanding speeches in
   hearings to please their target audience. Using 12,820 House committee
   hearing transcripts from the 105th to 114th Congresses and employing a
   crowd-sourced supervised learning method, I measure a ``grandstanding
   score{''} for each statement that committee members make. Findings
   suggest that grandstanding efforts are made more commonly among minority
   members under a unified government, by nonchair members of powerful
   committees, and in committees with jurisdiction over policies where the
   president wields primary power, such as foreign affairs and national
   security.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes, through seeing how Russian media reported about
   the COVID-19 pandemic, the images thus created of different countries.
   It approaches this issue in the context of popular critical geopolitics.
   465 texts from Russian media (in the period 01.01.2019-03.20.2020) were
   identified based on the keyword ``coronavirus{''} and processed using
   computer linguistics. For eastern countries (China, Iran, South Korea
   and Japan) and western ones (USA, Italy, Spain, France), as well as for
   ``Russia{''}, semantic fields were reconstructed. Based on the analysis
   of semantic fields, the images the media created of countries facing the
   pandemic were interpreted. It turned out that the east was written about
   in the context of a border beyond which there is a danger of infection.
   The image of eastern countries in the news about the coronavirus is
   consistent with the prevailing media images of the east as a distant and
   little-known geopolitical space. The media discourse on the pandemic in
   China contains people and viruses as storytelling actors, which,
   according to the author of the article, may indicate that the outdated
   strategy of the ``demonization{''} of China (as a habitat for the
   infection) remains strong. Western countries in the media discourse on
   coronavirus are lined up in a hierarchy. The United States and France
   are personified directly based on their political leaders. Ordinary
   people suffering from coronavirus disappear in the media discourse on
   the pandemic in the US; all media attention is focused on President
   Trump. The image of the United States is one of a hegemonic country. The
   image of France is semantically one of the most complex and ambivalent.
   The image of Spain is being reconstructed through the suffering of
   people in a pandemic, as well as through the participation of the state
   in protecting citizens from the infection. The image of Italy is one of
   a close, sympathetic, and vulnerable country. Russia, in the discourse
   of Russian media at the initial stage of the pandemic, is constructed as
   not infected, instead resisting the pandemic. It turns out that the
   geopolitical media discourse in a pandemic preserves the most typical
   intentions.},

Abstract = {The essay analyses the recent constitutional reform in Italy that has
   significantly reduced the number of parliamentarians. It also focuses on
   the Government bill which aims to reform the electoral system of the
   High Council of the Judiciary's members. Regarding the first question,
   the essay reviews the process followed for the approval of the reform
   law, the constitutional referendum of September 2020 and the reasons
   which inspired the reform. To this end, it reproduces, briefly, the
   debate held by the constitutional doctrine during the referendum's
   electoral campaign, and the regulatory changes that must be made to
   implement the reform are indicated. On the other hand, regarding the
   proposed reform of the CSM's electoral system, the reasons and content
   of the bill are analysed as well as the aspects that could affect the
   CSM's constitutional design.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Abstract = {In 2020, Venezuela has gone through a process of autocratic
   consolidation. This consolidation has taken place amid substantial
   economic reforms that have allowed the government of Nicolas Maduro
   survive sustained international and domestic pressure. In this article,
   we analyze this process of autocratic consolidation. We explain how, by
   focusing on the establishment of an ``interim-government{''} in 2019,
   the Venezuelan opposition has been unable to coordinate an inclusive
   strategy to successfully bring about a democratic breakthrough and
   instead became further divided. We address the economic transformations
   witnessed in the country as policies of fragmented liberalization
   through opaque privatizations and an uneven multi-currency system, which
   have resulted from a deep recession, the collapse of the oil economy and
   sanctions. Finally, we discuss the implications of these political and
   economic processes for the social fabric of the country. We highlight
   that despite the government's attempts at criminalizing autonomous
   activism, the relative strengths of civil society allowed the survival
   of minimal democratic spaces that have spurred dialogue and resistance.},

   approaches of a certain bourgeois idealist drift. The possibilities of
   Marxist cultural materialism are offered. The structural dysnamism of
   the system of needs/capabilities is presented as an intercultural or

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {124-134},
Abstract = {The European Semester became an essential part of the revised governance
   architecture of the Europe 2020 reform strategy for the Single European
   Market under the conditions of the global financial crisis and the
   emerging eurozone crisis a decade ago. The article examines to what
   extent the European Semester offers channels to establish throughput
   legitimacy by granting national parliaments the ability to effectively
   scrutinise executive decision-making in the annual policy cycle. Poland
   is chosen as the case study for parliamentary scrutiny of the EU's
   system of multi-level governance in the East-Central European region.
   The analysis adopts a liberal intergovernmentalist two-level approach.
   On the domestic level it concentrates on the involvement of the Sejm,
   the lower house of parliament, on the drafting of the Polish National
   Reform Plans for the annual Semester policy cycle between 2015 and 2020.
   The basis for the analysis are official transcripts from the plenary
   debates in the relevant committees, the European Affairs Committee and
   the Public Finance and the Economic Committee. The Polish case study
   illustrates that the European Semester represents a predominantly
   elitedriven process of policy coordination, which is strongly geared
   towards EU-level executive bargaining processes between national
   governments and the European Commission at the expense of domestic
   parliamentary scrutiny.},
