Abstract = {The article justifies why the collapse of the Soviet Union should be
   analyzed as the intersection of a number of diverse processes and
   phenomena. According to the author, the existing discord within the
   discussion about the reasons for the collapse of the USSR can be largely
   explained by the fact that researchers are not trying to determine the
   essence of the phenomenon they are studying and to reveal the totality
   of its features. The lack of the reflection on what exactly the end of
   the existence of the USSR was and when it happened, leads to isolating
   individual components of the process. As a result, some authors
   associate the collapse of the USSR with the dire economic straits,
   others consider the rise of nationalism to be the main culprit, others
   emphasize the role of specific actors, etc.
   In order to determine what exactly the collapse of the USSR meant and
   when it happened, the author identifies the fundamental characteristics
   of the entity itself, dividing it into the USSR-system and the
   USSR-state, and traces how these characteristics changed. His research
   shows that the collapse of the USSR can be divided into at least two
   different, albeit related processes: the collapse of the system and the
   collapse of the state. The collapse of the system meant a change in a
   self-describing narrative, the most important elements of which were the
   discourse of the indisputable achievements of the 1917 October
   Revolution, the CPSU's monopoly of power and its monolithic nature,
   confrontation with the capitalist countries and the socialist
   (state-owned) economy. It is the breakdown of these ``load-bearing
   structures{''} that predetermined the future collapse of the state,
   making it possible for destructive factors to materialize in the form of
   a fiscal crisis, intra-elite conflict and mass mobilization.},

Abstract = {The eighth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in November 2021
   marked two decades since the first major contemporary Sino-African
   meeting was held in Beijing in 2000. Despite the framework being
   entrenched as the principal inter-governmental and functional platform
   for China-Africa diplomacy and an avenue through which China's policy
   toward Africa and Africa's policy toward China is charted, doubts remain
   among some reviewers about the true nature of the framework. The
   arguable contention has been whether FOCAC is a self-interested grand
   machination imposed by China as the dominant actor to aid its global
   resurgence or African-oriented, serving the interests of Africa's great
   power diplomacy in the twenty-first century. This paper maintains that
   both standpoints misinterpret what the forum truly represents. It argues
   that, contrary to the contending perspectives, FOCAC is a ``bargained
   institutional framework{''} for shared impacts. Consequently, FOCAC
   represents a policy platform for collective engagement and serves as a
   knowledge production platform for developing and exchanging ideas and
   experiences to advance shared development goals.},

Title = {Trumping Hate on Twitter? Online Hate Speech in the 2016 US Election

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {To what extent did online hate speech and white nationalist rhetoric on
   Twitter increase over the course of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential
   election campaign and its immediate aftermath? The prevailing narrative
   suggests that Trump's political rise - and his unexpected victory - lent
   legitimacy to and popularized bigoted rhetoric that was once relegated
   to the dark corners of the Internet. However, our analysis of over 750
   million tweets related to the election, in addition to almost 400
   million tweets from a random sample of American Twitter users, provides
   systematic evidence that hate speech did not increase on Twitter over
   this period. Using both machine-learning-augmented dictionary-based
   methods and a novel classification approach leveraging data from Reddit
   communities associated with the alt-right movement, we observe no
   persistent increase in hate speech or white nationalist language either
   over the course of the campaign or in the six months following Trump's
   election. While key campaign events and policy announcements produced
   brief spikes in hateful language, these bursts quickly dissipated.
   Overall we find no empirical support for the proposition that Trump's
   divisive campaign or election increased hate speech on Twitter.},

Abstract = {The article sets out to deconstruct a certain common sense that has been
   articulated on merit as the fairest criterion for the distribution of
   rewards and positions within society. To this end, a double path will be
   followed, first of all, a historical one, by which an attempt will be
   made to synthetically detail the history of the category in the 20th
   century, its antecedents, and its transformation into a principle of
   legitimization of the inequalities agreed upon and unobjectionable.
   Second, theoretical, by which we will review the most lucid analyses
   around the concept, in particular the objections that from the
   heterogeneous liberal family (family where a priori is supposed to have
   greater acceptance) have been carried out in order to recapitulate the
   different dimensions and problems that accompany the concept.},

Abstract = {Latin America is considered a politically turbulent region but, after
   the end of the independence wars, a relatively peaceful geopolitical
   environment. It is usually related by its distance from main
   international conflicts and the consolidated dominance of a superpower
   over the region. Indeed, since the Second World War, the role played by
   the United States is crucial to understand regional conflict dynamics.
   But has this dominance guaranteed stability to the region? In order to
   understand conflict dynamics in the Inter-American subsystem and
   possible changes according to the international system transition, we
   explore data on Inter-American conflicts and map 55 years of economic
   and military disputes in the American continent. Using these data, we
   systematize conflictive interactions to identify patterns and changes in
   US-Latin America interplay. We present evidence of a significant change
   in the kind of conflict, from military to economic, from the Cold War to
   its immediate aftermath. Our findings also indicate a predominance of
   military interventions during the Cold War, especially as a US response
   to intrastate wars (revolutions and civil wars), targeting predominantly
   small Central American and Caribbean countries. After the end of the
   Cold War, economic sanctions dominated the agenda, with the US targeting
   mostly Latin America's three largest countries, Brazil, Mexico, and
   Argentina.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {260-273},
Abstract = {United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) supporters and non-voters in
   England participate respectively in forms of engaged and disengaged
   anti-political activity, but the role of individual, group-based, and
   collective emotions is still unclear. Drawing upon recent analyses of
   the complex emotional dynamics (e.g., ressentiment) underpinning the
   growth of right-wing populist political movements and support for
   parties such as UKIP, this analysis explores the affective features of
   reactionary political stances. The framework of affective practices is
   used to show how resentful affects are created, facilitated, and
   transformed in sharing or suppressing populist political views and
   practices; that is, populism is evident not only in the prevalence and
   influence of illiberal and anti-elite discourses but also should be
   explored as it is embodied and enacted in ``past focused{''} and
   ``change resistant{''} everyday actions and in relation to opportunities
   that ``sediment{''} affect-laden political positions and identities.
   Reflexive thematic analysis of data from qualitative interviews with
   UKIP voters and non-voters (who both supported leaving the EU) in 2015
   after the UK election but before the EU referendum vote showed that many
   participants: 1) shared ``condensed{''} complaints about politics and
   enacted resentment towards politicians who did not listen to them, 2)
   oriented towards shameful and purportedly shameless racism about
   migrants, and 3) appeared to struggle with shame and humiliation
   attributed to the EU in a complex combination of transvaluation of the
   UK and freedom of movement, a nostalgic need for restoration of national
   pride, and endorsement of leaving the EU as a form of ``change
   backwards.{''}},

   emphasizing that a ``democracy deficit{''} results in conflict. Leaders
   of democracies are more prudent in power usage so that they refrain
   themselves from launching aggression, a model of democratic governance.
   The third is the ``peace through development{''} approach, arguing that
   a ``development deficit{''} is the root cause of conflict. China favors
   ``peace through development,{''} advocating a development-focused peace
   initiative to address the peace-development-security nexus in the Middle
   East. China offers developmental aid and human resources training to the
   target countries in order to improve their capacity with key
   infrastructure and livelihood projects as the centerpiece. Beijing
   places a high premium on infrastructure inter-connectivity between the
   Middle Eastern countries and attempts to builds these countries into a
   community of interest for regional peace by way of the Belt and Road
   Initiative.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the actions as an object of
   civil law regulation. The market contributes to the accumulation of
   capital and its transformation into investment resources for the
   financing of the productive and social spheres, which improves the
   general well-being of the population. Meanwhile, the legal nature of the
   shares has not yet been clearly defined in Russian law and there is,
   consequently, a dichotomy in the choice of ways to protect the owners of
   securities, including shares. For the development of the research,
   methods such as synthesis, theoretical analysis, abstraction, deduction,
   induction, classification, comparative law, refutation were used. Based
   on the legal acts that regulate the stock market, a comprehensive study
   of the problems of legal regulation of the rotation of shares is carried
   out, to determine the prospects for development and ways to improve the
   legal regulation of shares, as well as to look for ways to protect the
   rights of securities holders. Among the most significant results, the
   legal nature of the action was revealed, the meaning of categories such
   as: document, security and action was cleared, and the definition of
   action was formulated.},

Abstract = {Alexei Navalny's rise from blogger on the margins, to virtuous warrior
   against corruption, and then to the best-known opposition figure in
   Russia, has taken ten years. Using social media and visual
   communication, he has established a counter-public arena and has created
   a political infrastructure that covers the entire country, despite the
   repressive measures against him. His fame increased from year to year.
   Yet the majority of the population does not support him. Older people
   and TV consumers in particular have proven susceptible to the Kremlin
   propaganda: Navalny is said to be a spy from the West, and to have
   staged his poisoning in August 2020 himself. Navalny's incarceration
   could mean the end of his political career. Yet the corruption,
   stagnation and self-isolation of the Putin system will continue to
   provoke attacks by the opposition. It would be premature to write
   Navalny off - assuming he survives prison.},

   the risk of becoming a victim of a hegemonic war against China waged by
   the United States and its Quad partners, a pessimistic scenario for the

   centrality should play a leading role in shaping the emerging regional
   architecture. ASEAN's unique geopolitical position, the ASEAN Way as a
   special socialization process, and its extensive engaging networks with
   major powers can help the regional grouping obtain bargaining power to
   maintain its centrality. Also, the robust China-ASEAN relations can also
   facilitate ASEAN to maintain its centrality and thus avoid the trap of
   great power rivalry in the Indo-Pacific.},

Abstract = {In February 2014, an amateur archaeological team unearthed thousands of
   bones and other remains from an old well in the town of Ajnala, located
   in the Indian state of Punjab. These remains are believed to belong to
   282 Indian sepoys who were summarily executed en masse on 1 August 1857
   under the orders of Deputy Commissioner Frederic Cooper, during the
   height of the Indian Uprising of 1857. The discovery of the bodies has
   not only reignited fierce debates about the violent history of the
   British Empire in India, but also offers an interesting glimpse into
   some of the ways that Indian history and national identity are currently
   being remade and negotiated in relation to the colonial past. This
   article is about the contested historical narrations, memories, and
   ongoing efforts to commemorate the Ajnala Massacre. It reveals how the
   history and public memory of colonial violence remain poorly understood,
   and the ways that calls for the recognition of previously forgotten,
   absent, or erased memories can prompt difficult and highly politicized
   discussions about the meaning of history, identity, and politics.},

Abstract = {Ethnic pandering, in which candidates promise to cater to the interests
   of coethnic voters, is presumed to be an effective strategy for
   increasing electoral support in Africa's emerging multiethnic
   democracies. However, ethnic political mobilization may be disdained by
   citizens for its divisive and polarizing effects, particularly in urban
   areas. As a result, pandering may fall on deaf ears among Africa's urban
   voters. This study examines how voters in Kenya's capital city, Nairobi,
   respond to ethnic pandering using data from a vignette experiment
   conducted in 2015 and a replication study implemented in 2016. Results
   show that respondents are more supportive of candidates who make
   ethnically inclusive rather than targeted appeals, regardless of whether
   the candidate is identified as a coethnic. We propose that the results
   are driven by a broad distaste among urban voters for parochial
   politics, rather than by strategic calculations related to candidate
   viability.},

Abstract = {The literature on the participation paradox, stealth democracy,
   political transformation and populism implicitly refers to the existence
   of different participation profiles, but its empirical evidence focuses
   on separate actions. While several studies have examined the existence
   of distinct combinations of actions, such participation profiles have
   rarely been placed within a theoretical framework or connected to the
   motivations and resources that shape participation. In this article
   these connections are given a theoretical basis and empirically tested
   via latent class analysis of a unique set of 12 different political
   activities. After establishing the participation profiles, it is
   assessed how political motivations (e.g. interest, efficacy) and
   resources (time and skills) explain profile membership by using
   fractional multinomial logistic regression models. Combining these two
   steps helps to reassess what levels of political participation actually
   imply for the functioning of our democracies. Crucially, the
   participation elite is small; faithful voters are numerous but not
   particularly engaged; and systemically dissatisfied citizens tend to
   disengage - only a few try to transform the system. Supplemental data

Abstract = {Challenges to the value of active civic engagement are an increasingly
   common phenomenon in introductory American government courses as there
   is a rise in populist sentiment and a lethargic democratic public.
   Traditional methods of civic participation and ideal citizenship are
   difficult to model and teach against this backdrop. Here, we offer
   instructors a curricular approach that teaches the fundamentals of
   American government while recognizing students' roles in a politically
   dynamic and contentious environment. This semester-long portfolio
   project, called iCitizen, incorporates exercises in practical political
   communication, comparisons to historical and fictional systems of
   citizenship, and personal reflections on ideology and political
   participation designed to cultivate students' civic skills and
   conceptual understanding. Assignments are progressive and experiential
   in nature, requiring students to actively engage in common civic and
   political experiences and pathways. In this way, the portfolio exposes
   students to fundamental questions of politics and citizenship, which can
   challenge populism's core charge that ``the people{''} are ignored in
   favor of elites. In this article, we provide a description of the
   portfolio, logistical and practical considerations for instructors, and
   preliminary thoughts on the portfolio's effectiveness.},

   Lessons Learned from Practice},

Abstract = {A Model United Nations (MUN) conference is one of Political Science's
   most enduring and iconic formats for active learning and a defining
   event for many undergraduate students and high school students. Despite
   its established place in the discipline of Political Science, a MUN
   conference is an event that defies attempts at perfection, due mainly to
   the experience being out of the hands of faculty. This paper identifies
   five lessons learned from delivering hybrid MUN conferences at a
   mid-sized university campus (6,500 undergraduate students) between
   2015-2019. The faculty member collaborated with upper-level
   undergraduate student organizers to organize and deliver conferences
   that included delegates participating in partial fulfillment of course
   credit, delegates from local high-schools, and university students
   participating for the experience. The connecting theme of these lessons
   is a consideration of achieving balance between the two roles of the
   participating faculty member as both the authoritative decision-maker,
   and that of a delegating supervisor providing oversight and allowing
   students the freedom to assume the responsibilities of serving as
   secretariat or as delegate.},

Abstract = {The essay is devoted to the specifics of the contemporary Russian
   opposition and civil society. We describe the characteristics of
   contemporary `intellectual activism' and the growing network of small
   civil and political groups in today's Russia. We show that Russian civil
   society remains fragile and fragmented; the public discussion is not
   focused on strategies of resistance to arbitrariness but on constructing
   moral categories such as the wide and vague concept of `new ethics'. We
   also show how outsiders appear among contemporary Russian dissidents,
   who are not supported by most independent leaders and intellectuals -
   these are young `new leftists' and feminist activist groups. These
   political activists find themselves under pressure from both the
   siloviki and the authorities, and in the focus of criticism of
   opposition leaders, becoming, in fact, dissidents among dissidents in
   contemporary Russia.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, facing an increase in Al-Shabaab's activities on its
   soil, Kenya has tightened up its counter-terrorism policy, intensifying
   security operations in vulnerable areas. However, Kenyan
   counter-terrorism measures have been criticised for overstepping legal
   boundaries, often degenerating into practices of indiscriminate
   repression against suspect communities. Adopting a social movement
   theory approach, this article investigates whether, and above all how,
   such practices may have detrimental effects, increasing radicalisation.
   The article shows that, by exacerbating frictions and widening
   socio-political divisions in the country, indiscriminate repression has
   increased a motivation to mobilise into terrorism among targeted groups
   while, at the same time, shaping conducive conditions enabling them to
   do so through emerging connections with Al-Shabaab. Such findings have
   substantial implications, highlighting the need for more targeted
   strategies tackling terrorism without setting in motion dynamics of
   violent interaction further undermining national security.},

Abstract = {Forest nature conservation is an environmental and climate-relevant
   policy field that is characterized by strong conflicts between interests
   on protection and utilization. Based on central conflicts, the article
   examines the extent to which the policy outputs of the state governments
   correspond to the conflicting interests of the nature conservation and
   forestry sectors, and what influence different political parties have on
   this. In doing so, he makes an empirical contribution to the partisan
   theory in a field that has not been well researched. The data are
   collected between 2002 and 2020 according to legislative periods, for
   each of which a position value is determined based on the interests of
   the sectors. The comparison of these values makes it possible to
   identify policy change. Government involvement and departmental
   responsibilities are used to measure party influence. The result shows
   that the policy outputs are predominantly forest-oriented, but there is
   a strong trend towards nature conservation. There has been a nature
   conservation-oriented policy change in almost all Bundeslaender, in a
   few cases forest-oriented ones as well, and in all the states there has
   also been the preservation of the status quo. The Greens have made a
   decisive contribution to policy change towards nature conservation
   interests, to a lesser extent the SPD and in some cases the CDU/CSU,
   which, however, predominantly advocated maintaining the status quo. This
   shows a clear difference between the parties. In the policy field, which
   is strongly characterized by ministerial competencies, the measurement
   of party influence through departmental responsibility has proven its
   worth. The party affiliation of the ministers proves to be an important
   factor for the policy orientation.},

Abstract = {Alison McQueen's study of the historical role of apocalyptic ideas in
   realist political theory cautiously proposes the `redirection' of
   apocalyptic thought as a plausible alternative to its rejection.
   Apocalyptic redirection, so understood, uses apocalyptic language to
   describe potential future catastrophes in order to inspire drastic
   action to prevent them. Although McQueen acknowledges that apocalyptic
   redirection may have certain risks, she suggests it may be an
   appropriate response to the crisis of climate change. In this article, I
   aim to show that this use of the discourse of apocalyptic redirection is
   ideologically problematic. I argue that it involves conflating the
   interests of those who are at least moderately materially comfortable
   with the interests of humanity as a whole. I will also draw on the 2019
   `Stop Adani Convoy' in Australia as a case study to show how the
   ideological character of this discourse renders it ill-suited to
   generating popular support for action on climate change, and liable to
   reproduce existing power relations.},

Abstract = {The \#MustFall campaigns attacked symbols of the past - physical but
   also mental legacies of the colonial and apartheid periods - using
   specific disruption mechanisms along with ideological frameworks that
   are sometimes consciously and/or unconsciously borrowed from previous
   generations of South African students. In that respect, the students
   claim a continuity of their present day struggle with that led in the
   1970s under the banner of Black Consciousness. All the while, the
   born-frees completely reject the main outcome of the struggle for
   National Liberation - that is, the negotiated settlement signed by
   Nelson Mandela and F.W De Klerk in the 1990s, which could appear
   paradoxical. The aim of this article is to shed light on both the
   continuities and ruptures between the \#MF campaigns and traditions of
   national liberations in order to discuss the political practices they
   entail in a post/decolonial context. Theoretical shifts in \#MF notably
   through the engagement with concepts such as intersectionality,
   non-racialism and decolonization had certainly a great impact on their
   modes and means of protest. This comparative analysis may lead to a
   deeper understanding of the different interpretations of decolonization
   in practice between generations and the nature of the discrepancies not
   only between but also within political traditions of liberation.},

Abstract = {A growing literature examines democratic backsliding, but there is
   little consensus on when, where, and why it occurs. Reviewing more than
   100 recent articles and working papers, this research note argues that
   inattention to the measurement of backsliding and the underlying concept
   of democracy drives this disagreement. We propose three remedies. First,
   we outline several questions that help researchers navigate common
   measurement challenges. Second, we argue that conceptual confusion
   around backsliding is driven in large part by inconsistent definitions
   of democracy. We show how outlining a comprehensive concept of democracy
   enables researchers to better account for the diversity of instances of
   democratic backsliding. Our third contribution is drawing attention to a
   previously overlooked form of backsliding: when governments lose the
   effective power to govern or voters and elites increasingly disagree
   about truths and facts. The research note urges scholars to pay closer
   attention to the conceptualization and measurement of backsliding prior
   to empirical analysis.},

Abstract = {We present the first field experiment on how organized interest groups'
   television ads affect issue opinions. We randomized 31,404 voters to
   three weeks of interest group ads about either immigration or
   transgender nondiscrimination. We then randomly assigned voters to
   receive ostensibly unrelated surveys either while the ads aired, one day
   after they stopped, or three days afterwards. Voters recalled the ads,
   but three ads had a minimal influence on public opinion, whereas a
   fourth's effects decayed within one day. However, voters remembered a
   fact from one ad. Our results suggest issue ads can affect public
   opinion but that not every ad persuades and that persuasive effects
   decay. Despite the vast sums spent on television ads, our results are
   the first field experiment on their persuasive power on issues, shedding
   light on the mechanisms underpinning-and limits on-both televised
   persuasion and interest group influence.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the ``closing space{''} argument is much nuanced if
   we widen the conceptualizations of both ``closing{''} and ``space{''}.
   ``Closing{''} would thus include state attempts to restrict not only the
   promotion of democratic/human rights norms, but also other types of
   norms (conservative, right-wing, Islamist). A broader definition of
   ``space{''} would likewise include not only the space occupied by CSOs,
   but also that of other politically important actors, such as political
   parties and religious communities. Lastly, we stand to gain from putting
   the spotlight on democratic states' efforts to control outside
   influences on its domestic political sphere. The article thus proposes
   an analytical framework focusing on state regulations of foreign funding
   to CSOs, political parties, and religious communities, which is applied
   in two exploratory case studies of Israel and Tunisia. The article finds
   that the two states attempt to control norm diffusion not only via
   domestic CSOs, but also through political parties and religious groups.
   Regulations do not always target human rights and democratic norms.
   Foreign funding regulations have at times favoured foreign funding for
   nationalistic, right-wing norms: at others, democratic norms over
   Islamic norms. Thus, the ``closing space{''} phenomenon is more complex
   than usually understood.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of Angela Merkel's chancellorship, German care
   policy changed considerably. Social policy has gained in prominence and
   this has affected people with caring responsibilities. Against this
   background, this paper compares childcare and elderly care policies in
   terms of gender equality. We focus on policy measures introduced and
   implemented during the Merkel era and we consider Chancellor Merkel's
   role in shaping these policies. Based on interviews with parents of
   young children as well as male and female elderly carers, our analysis
   discusses the impacts of Merkel-era care policies on lived experiences.
   We concentrate on effects on caregivers' employment status (maintaining,
   reducing, or leaving gainful employment for caring). Furthermore, we
   focus on gender equality effects depending on socio-economic status
   (SES). The comparison of both policy fields shows that gender
   in/equality and the gendered division of labour are essentially
   moderated by Merkel's way of facilitating reconciliation policies. We
   argue that recent childcare and elderly care policies particularly
   address middle-class caregivers. In both fields, care policies offer a
   framework that is used, interpreted, and negotiated differently by
   individuals, couples, and families, depending on their SES and existing
   gender norms. Consequently, Merkel-era care policies can reinforce or
   mitigate gender inequalities.},

Abstract = {Is religion a form of political tribalism? Conventional wisdom suggests
   it is. Discussion of religion and American politics generally focuses on
   the ``God Gap{''}-the tendency for religious Americans to vote
   Republican, while the nonreligious vote Democratic. However, there is
   also reason to argue that religion cannot be reduced to political
   tribalism. The God Gap is found mostly among white voters; among people
   of color, religiosity is a far weaker predictor of the vote. Even among
   white voters, the size of the God Gap varies across different religious
   traditions. Furthermore, there is more nuance to the non-religious
   population than suggested by the standard account of the God Gap. When
   the analysis includes the full scope of the American religious
   landscape, religion is not as ``tribal{''} as conventional wisdom
   suggests.},

Abstract = {Is dialectical thinking essential to anti-capitalism? Under this central
   question in the tradition of Marxist and post-Marxist thought, Mark
   Fisher reviews Fredric Jameson's monumental effort to save ``the

   on 11 March 2010 in the journal Mute, this text shows the undoubted
   interest Fisher had not only in Jameson's work, but also in the
   theoretical and practical possibilities it raises for breaking the iron
   fetters of capitalist realism and its blockade of the political

Abstract = {This introductory article to Democratic Theory's special issue on the
   marginalized democracies of the world begins by presenting the lexical
   method for understanding democracy. It is argued that the lexical method
   is better than the normative and analytical methods at finding
   democracies in the world. The argument then turns to demonstrating,
   mainly through computational research conducted within the Google Books
   catalog, that an empirically demonstrable imbalance exists between the
   democracies mentioned in the literature. The remainder of the argument
   is given to explaining the value of working to correct this imbalance,
   which comes in at least three guises: (1) studying marginalized
   democracies can increase our options for alternative democratic actions
   and democratic innovations; (2) it leads to a conservation and public
   outreach project, which is epitomized in an ``encyclopedia of the
   democracies{''}; and (3) it advocates for a decolonization of
   democracies' definitions and practices and decentering academic
   democratic theory.},

Abstract = {On 21 April 2021, the European Commission presented its long-awaited
   proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonized rules on AI.{*}{*} The
   proposal, which is based on Articles 16 and 114 of the TFEU on data
   protection and the internal market respectively, aims at a risk-based
   approach that respects EU values and protects personal data and
   fundamental rights at the same time. This contribution aims to
   critically examine which AI tools fall within the scope of AI Act, how
   these are classified and whether the proposed approach poses concerns
   for the protection of fundamental rights. To that end, the next section
   provides a snapshot of the proposal to inform the subsequent analysis,
   followed by an analysis on which migration-related AI systems aiming to
   identify potential loopholes. In addition to an appraisal of which AI
   systems are envisaged within the scope of the proposal, this article
   assesses Article 83 of the proposal, which excludes several AI
   initiatives from its scope.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {The Baltic States have been guided in EMU by two motives of, first,
   being part of the EU's core to hedge against external security risks
   and, second, maintaining economic policy tools to catch up with the rest
   of the EU. Their approach to co-operation with Germany has been
   influenced by the latter's role in reinforcing military presence of NATO
   in the Baltics and the importance of economic links with Germany.
   However, their preferences diverge from those of Germany on some issues
   of EMU governance such as banking union or tax harmonisation. With
   respect to the debates on eurozone reform, the Baltic States have
   remained cautious and largely adopted the role of `fence-sitters'. They
   express their support for the implementation of the fiscal rules already
   in place and thus stand in the shadow of Germany in the latter's debate
   with the `South'. They coordinate their positions with the Nordic EU
   members, which excludes Germany, allowing it to play the role of a
   mediator between the `South' and the `North'. Given the emergent
   `institutional fabric' of the relationship to Germany, the Baltic States
   use both bilateral contacts to Germany and multilateral venues to pursue
   their preferences.},

Abstract = {Despite its traditional adherence to gender roles limiting women's
   responsibilities to Kinder, Kuche, Kirche, the Christian Democratic
   Party itself has been ruled by three powerful females since 2018:
   Chancellor Angela Merkel, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, and CDU
   General-Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Despite occasional waves
   of conservative-hardliner resistance, all three women have helped to
   modernise the German gender regime while opening new doors for future
   women leaders across the party spectrum. Having exited the political
   stage after the 2021 elections, the Chancellor played a significant role
   in advancing the political fortunes of German women, beginning with von
   der Leyen, who now enjoys supranational prominence as EU Commission
   President, and Kramp-Karrenbauer, ostensibly descending the national
   power ladder despite her earlier successes. These diverging trajectories
   raise new questions as to the conditions under which we might expect
   women to prove `effective' leaders. This article explores biographical
   parallels, stylistic differences, and the changing political landscape
   that may have facilitated or impeded each woman's ability to transfer
   the leadership skills she acquired at one level to the mastering of
   challenges at another. It concludes with reflections on Merkel's legacy
   in relation to `gender and politics'.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why, despite the democratic legal and
   institutional changes that have occurred in the political system in
   Veracruz over the last 30 years that now point to a competitive local
   electoral system, illiberal structures, and practices persist, through
   the continuity of a form of subnational authoritarianism. Examples of
   this system are the political controls exercised by regional caciques
   and union corporativism; the reproduction of clientelistic practices;
   the persistent problem of the low state institutional capacities; the
   lack of an effective division of powers; and-more recently-the
   empowerment of various organized crime groups. The justice system is
   broken by design. Political parties lack institutionality, credible
   leadership, and political programs. The public space is fragile and
   highly fragmented. Civil society is weak and very concentrated in the
   capital city at the federal level. Inequality and poverty are so
   widespread that working classes, peasants, indigenous peoples, and urban
   dwellers have no capacity to organize in an autonomous manner. This
   situation explains the persistence of illiberal structures and practices
   in the process of transition to and consolidation of democracy. Veracruz
   is an extreme example of all these processes.},

Abstract = {Armed groups seeking to govern territory require the cooperation of many
   civilians, who are widely perceived as enemy collaborators after
   conflict ends. The empirical literature on attitudes toward transitional
   justice focuses heavily on fighters, overlooking more nuanced
   understandings of proportional justice for civilian collaborators.
   Through a survey experiment conducted in an Iraqi city that was
   controlled by the Islamic State, we find that variations in the type of
   collaboration an actor engages in strongly determine preferences for
   punishment and forgiveness. While exposure to violence is associated
   with a greater desire for revenge, perceived volition behind an act-a
   relatively unstudied factor-is much more important. This research
   provides unique empirical data on the microfoundations of enemy
   collaborator culpability. By widening our analytical lens to consider a
   more realistically broad spectrum of enemy collaboration, we avoid
   affirming a false dichotomy between victims and perpetrators that is
   commonly adopted in postwar settings.},

Abstract = {In this papers we propose to reflect on the work of Horatio Gonzalez
   from the figure of the example. First, we investigate the figure from
   the debates that caused its use in the field of philosophy; then we

   work; finally we outline some hypotheses about the legacy of a work of
   thought crucial for our intelectual and political contemporaneity.},

Abstract = {How do governing parties respond in terms of ideological positioning
   when voted out of office? We study both theoretically and empirically
   the factors that shape parties' responses following a loss. Studying
   national elections in advanced industrialized democracies over the past
   70 years, we show that parties tend to counter their pre-election
   shifts, and do so particularly strongly following defeat. The extent of
   these ideological shifts is more limited in parties with a larger
   selectorate voting on the party leadership. Moreover, we find that
   subsequent to loss, parties are less likely to run on a centrist
   platform. Notably, shifting away from the center is associated with a
   higher probability of returning to power. We then introduce a dynamic
   model of party leadership selection and platform positioning. The model
   produces patterns of ideological positions over time that are consistent
   with our empirical findings.},

Abstract = {Multiracial self-classifiers are the fastest-growing racial population
   in the United States. While their rise signals a departure from norms of
   hypodescent, little is known about the sociopolitical meanings attached
   to multiracial labels. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for
   understanding multiracials' sense of racial group identity, linked fate,
   and racial attitudes. Examining a national opinion survey that samples
   more than 1200 multiracial adults, we compare the identity and
   attitudinal profiles of the two largest multiracial groups in the United
   States-White-Asians and White-Blacks-with those of their component
   monoracial groups. We find that while White-Asians and White-Blacks
   often distinguish themselves from their component races, on balance, the
   assertion of dual racial membership signals greater solidarity and/or
   affect toward the minority race. These findings suggest that members of
   these multiracial populations are likely to align themselves relatively
   more with their minority background than with Whites on political issues
   that are racial in nature.},

Abstract = {Online intermediaries such as social network sites or search engines are
   playing an increasingly central role in democracy by acting as mediators
   between information producers and citizens. Academic and public
   commentators have raised persistent concerns that algorithmic
   recommender systems would negatively affect the provision of political
   information by tailoring content to the predispositions and
   entertainment preferences of users. At the same time, recent research
   indicates that intermediaries foster exposure to news that people would
   not use as part of their regular media diets. This study investigates
   these unresolved questions by combining the web browsing histories and
   survey responses of more than 7,000 participants from six major
   democracies. The analysis shows that despite generally low levels of
   news use, using online intermediaries fosters exposure to nonpolitical
   and political news across countries and personal characteristics. The
   findings have implications for scholarly and public debates on the
   challenges that high-choice digital media environments pose to democracy},

Abstract = {Liquid Democracy (LD) is a recent phenomenon that could radically affect
   our understanding of democracy. Yet, there remains significant semantic
   confusion surrounding this concept, and researchers in the social
   sciences, as well as in political theory, currently lack a general
   definition that is broadly accepted as a standard reference. Therefore,
   this article addresses the following question: What is LD and how can we
   best define it? Following a classical, semantic approach to concept
   formation in the tradition of Giovanni Sartori and John Gerring, the
   article advances a new, minimal definition: LD is a decision-making
   scheme characterized by liquidity-that is the systemic and flexible mix
   of direct and representative democracy-and essentially based on the
   principles of voluntary delegation and proxy voting. This definition can
   serve as a starting point from which further theoretical and normative
   studies of LD could be conducted in the future.},

Abstract = {Very little research has considered how media discrimination could
   impact men and women's political ambition. Yet, media discrimination
   could impact both beliefs about gender roles and political competence,
   and beliefs about voter bias, both of which could decrease women's
   political ambition and increase men's. Alternatively, media
   discrimination could lead women to react against discrimination and be
   motivated politically. This study tests how political ambition of men
   and women is impacted by media discrimination in a campaign and election
   lab experiment. Media discrimination in this experiment under-reports on
   women and uses traditional, stereotypical depictions of men and women.
   The results suggest that in certain conditions, media discrimination in
   political news may lead to a reactance or positive challenge effect for
   women, increasing their political ambition. Men, instead, may feel an
   aversion to entering politics, lowering their political ambition.},

Abstract = {In this analysis, we examine the effect of party-voter linkages on
   executive and legislative influence over policymaking in democracies
   throughout the world. We expect committees in legislatures with
   programmatic parties to have more power over the public policymaking
   process than committees in legislatures with clientelistic parties do.
   We also expect executives in countries with programmatic parties to have
   less power over the public policymaking process than executives in
   countries with clientelistic parties do. Using data from the Varieties
   of Democracy Dataset and controlling for relevant factors, we find
   support for our expectations. The results of this paper shed light on
   how party linkages to constituents can affect executive and legislative
   influence over policymaking.},

Abstract = {Do ministers face gender discrimination in their career paths after
   entering presidential cabinets? Departing from past studies, which find
   little evidence of gender discrimination in more established democracies
   in Europe and the Americas, we argue that political experience can have
   a gendered effect on cabinet careers in newer democracies outside the
   West. Using fixed effects and matching designs, we analyze original data
   on the careers of 1,374 ministers from all major presidential
   democracies in Asia. Investigating the patterns of ``cabinet
   promotions,{''} where ministers transfer from their initial cabinet
   appointment to a higher-prestige post, we confirm the null direct effect
   of gender in this new context. However, we also find important gender
   differences based on political experience, which helps women's upward
   mobility in cabinets more than men. The finding that pathways to higher
   office differ by gender adds to our understanding of women's
   representation in society.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the `social conflict' theory to analyse the challenges
   to combatting violence against women in Turkey. It argues that these
   obstacles that are grounded in unequal social power relations are
   structured in the political landscape where decisions over who gets what
   are made. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP)'s `male biased'
   political decisions such as withdrawing Turkey from the Council of
   Europe's Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women
   and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) reflect the current
   conditions of the balance of societal interests in the political order.
   Turkish women's struggle for equality requires a shift in existing
   conditions of power in favour of pro-gender equality forces that would
   enable the representation of their preferences and interests in the
   political landscape, which is always tilted towards certain groups and
   their interests.},

Abstract = {Conspiracy theories are playing an increasingly prominent role worldwide
   in both political rhetoric and popular belief. Previous research has
   emphasized the individual-level factors behind conspiracy belief but
   paid less attention to the role of elite framing, while focusing mostly
   on domestic political contexts. This study assesses the relative weight
   of official conspiracy claims and motivated biases in producing
   conspiracy beliefs, in two countries where identities other than
   partisanship are salient: Georgia and Kazakhstan. I report the results
   of a survey experiment that depicts a possible conspiracy and varies the
   content of official claims and relevant contextual details. The results
   show that motivated reasoning stemming from state-level geopolitical
   identities is strongly associated with higher conspiracy belief, whereas
   official claims have little effect on people's perceptions of
   conspiracy. Respondents who exhibit higher conspiracy ideation are more
   likely to perceive a conspiracy but do not weight motivated biases or
   official claims differently from people with lower conspiratorial
   predispositions. The findings indicate the importance of (geopolitical)
   identities in shaping conspiracy beliefs and highlight some of the
   constraints facing elites who seek to benefit from the use of conspiracy
   claims.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
   Africa) as an alternative force to the West has ignited a debate within
   the discipline of international political economy on the nature of the
   group's rise. Global governance scholars either debate the role of the
   BRICS in transforming the world order (playing the game) or focus on the
   domestic sources of the BRICS nations' preference formation (the
   position of states within the game). This article goes beyond the
   game-versus-player debate, by focusing on the structural power of the
   BRICS to `change the rules of the game'. The article investigates how
   the BRICS-created New Development Bank as an alternative circuit for
   actors to exchange goods in the area of development finance has been
   integrated into global governance. The article argues that the New
   Development Bank does not grant the BRICS the structural power needed to
   change the rules and norms that underpin the game.},

Abstract = {While many states move from elite to mass higher education (HE) systems,
   little is known as to why some authoritarian developing states resist
   this transition. In post-Soviet Uzbekistan the tertiary system was
   consciously restricted to cover roughly 10\% of the population; a
   situation that continued for more than two decades. This paper argues
   that it is the securitization of the role of HE growth that confronts
   the transition of HE from elite to mass systems. To support this
   argument, the paper analyses Uzbekistan's HE policy and the notorious
   1992 student protests that legitimized the securitization of HE
   expansion in the country.},

Abstract = {Does the Kremlin have a coherent approach in the way it deals with the
   memory of the Soviet atrocities? If so, what does it consist in? In this
   paper, I address these questions by turning to a study of the
   ``Russia-My History{''} chain of multimedia historical parks. I
   reconstruct the interpretation of the Soviet atrocities as it is
   (re)produced in the Moscow-located headquarters of the chain and the
   broader historical interpretation that this interpretation-at the same
   time statist and patriotic-is nested within. I argue that this
   interpretation is indicative of the Kremlin's way of dealing with
   Russia's difficult past, which consists in transforming it into a tool
   of ingenious political manipulation.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {During the twentieth century, Mexican federalism was characterized by a
   centralization of power in the hands of the federal government. Since
   the 1980s, different decentralization processes gradually increased the
   political influence and income of states, as well as their participation
   in social policymaking. However, the effects of decentralization on
   social spending at the state level has scarcely been analyzed in Mexico.
   The purpose of this study is to analyze the evolution and
   characteristics of social spending at the state level in Mexico from
   2000 to 2018. This analysis uses data from state public accounts of the
   31 states and Mexico City. On average, state social expenditure per
   capita increased in the last two decades, but at a slower rate than
   overall state expenditure. Furthermore, education, the biggest share of
   total social expenditure, and healthcare both grew steadily, while other
   forms of social spending grew in more varying rates over time.},

Abstract = {This review of Yahya Madra's Late Neoclassical Economics centers on a
   claim made by mainstream economics to have surpassed the narrow horizon
   of neoclassical economics, understood as general equilibrium or
   Walrasian economics, having differentiated into a pluralist field.
   Through a detailed study of neoclassical economics, Madra distills the
   misplaced nature of this claim and disputes the propositions that
   neoclassical economics is nothing but Walrasian and that its new diverse
   theories belong to the nonneoclassical domain. Rather, the diverse
   theories of mainstream economics are shown to share with Walrasian
   economics, and with one another, a common problematic of theoretical
   humanism in the form of reconciling individual and
   aggregative/collective rationality in order to achieve a socioeconomic
   order. This review discussion ends by raising some issues that are
   absent or latently present in Madra's book.},

Abstract = {Robert Linhart's translated 1966 text provides a framework for examining
   the Soviet transition as an overdetermined development, drawing a
   balance sheet of the strategy and tactics of the New Economic Policy
   (NEP). Reading Lenin's shifting practical analyses of the situation from
   1918-23, Linhart takes a thorough inventory of the principle (between
   the proletariat and the peasantry) and secondary class struggles-a
   ``complex system of alliances{''}-and discerns the ``thresholds{''}
   beyond which changes in the conjuncture imposed strategic turns and
   alternatives. Informed by a conception of a complex social formation in
   transition as unevenly articulated and marked by intense contradictions,
   Linhart analyzes the NEP as a revolutionary strategy that responded to
   and reconstituted the ``disrupted equilibria{''} of social forces,
   operating (subjectively) against objective limitations. This
   necessitated not only the political transformation of state apparatuses
   but also, for Linhart, crucially emphasized a necessary Cultural
   Revolution to socialize the productive forces (popular control and
   accounting of production, circulation, and distribution).},

Abstract = {I consider a model of political agency in which an incumbent politician
   makes two decisions in sequence, having private information about the
   correct decision in each period. I find that policy reversals signal
   that a politician is incompetent. This suggests that the stigma
   associated with flip-flopping can be rationalized as a simple heuristic
   to select competent politicians. Furthermore, the negative impact of
   policy reversals on reputation gives the incumbent politician an
   incentive to disregard new information and stick to his initial policy.
   When reputation concerns are sufficiently strong, these incentives
   inhibit policy responsiveness, resulting in an inefficient degree of
   policy persistence. Term-limited politicians, or politicians with
   particularly safe (or compromised) election prospects, are more likely
   to reverse decisions. Relatedly, politicians are only willing to reverse
   decisions after a sufficient amount of time has passed or when there is
   sufficient evidence that the state of the world might have changed.},

Abstract = {The attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 was extraordinary.
   Analysts and commentators quickly attributed the attack as having been
   motivated by ``populism{''} without much nuance or recognition of the
   diversity of voices and attitudes embedded in the insurrection. This
   commentary assesses the populist ideas and attitudes expressed by the
   insurrectionists in an effort to understand why they felt drawn to
   Washington, D. C. that day, as well as why they felt their attack on the
   U.S. Capitol was legitimate. In so doing, it addresses the particular
   ways the insurrectionists framed and legitimated their attack (at least
   to themselves). The January 6 insurrection was an extraordinary attack
   on American democracy, but it was related to deep themes and elements of
   US political culture. Understanding those dynamics is crucial to
   preventing such attacks in the future.},

Abstract = {This article studies candidate selection by party leaders and asks
   whether poor information about public preferences can lead elite choices
   to diverge from mass opinion. Working with a political party in Nepal,
   we show that while elites value voter preferences, these preferences
   only explain one-third of elite candidate selection. Next, we embed an
   experiment in actual candidate selection deliberations for this party
   and find that party leaders not only select different candidates when
   polling data are presented to them, but that their updated decisions
   also improve the party's vote share. By opening the black box of
   candidate selection, this article demonstrates that closing the
   information gap between elites and voters has the power to improve the
   quality of representation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {What role does information play in shaping mass support in dominant
   party settings? We conduct a field experiment during the 2016 Ugandan
   parliamentary elections that provides voters with information about
   candidates from all competing political parties. Specifically, we
   produce and screen videorecorded candidate interviews in randomly
   selected villages just before the election. Voters have lower baseline
   knowledge about opposition candidates compared to ruling party
   candidates. We find that the video screening reduced this knowledge gap
   and caused voters to update more positively about the opposition.
   Further, those who watched the videos were less likely to vote for
   ruling party candidates, and those initially leaning toward ruling party
   candidates were more likely to vote for the opposition. These findings
   suggest that information asymmetries play a role in sustaining mass
   support for ruling parties in dominant party settings and that reducing
   them may strengthen electoral competition.},

Abstract = {Item nonresponse rates across regime assessment questions and
   nonsensitive items are used to create a self-censorship index, which can
   be compared across countries, over time and across population subgroups.
   For many authoritarian systems, citizens do not display higher rates of
   item nonresponse on regime assessment questions than their counterparts
   in democracies. This result suggests such questions may not be that
   sensitive in many places, which in turn raises doubts that authoritarian
   citizens are widely feigning positive attitudes towards regimes they
   secretly despise. Higher levels of self-censorship are found under
   regimes without electoral competition for the executive.},

Abstract = {Political security is often viewed as a necessary precondition for
   rulers to develop property-protecting legal institutions. I argue that
   because these institutions can build political support and generate
   revenue, domestically insecure rulers may also invest in them. I test
   this argument using newly collected 12th-century data on the operation
   of the nascent English common law system. Leveraging the 1192 shipwreck
   and subsequent kidnap of Richard I as an exogenous shock to domestic
   political security, I find that the catastrophe appears to have prompted
   the English Royal Court's short-term deployment to raise political
   support in areas vulnerable to rebellion. I present suggestive evidence
   that this effect in vulnerable areas persisted into the medium-term, and
   appears to have expanded to the rest of the country. Drawing on this and
   other evidence of changes in Royal Court funding, activity, and
   organization between 1184 and 1203, I argue that the shock may have
   helped to bring about a permanent increase in the Court's capacity and
   accessibility. These findings are relevant to studies of the common law
   and the political economy of legal institutions generally.},

Title = {Look where you're going: the cultural and economic explanations of class
   voting decline},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Scholars have shown a consistent decline in class voting over time,
   arguing that social class no longer structures political competition.
   Yet, the loss of the explanatory power of social class should be
   attributed to the shift of left-wing parties towards less friendly issue
   positions for their class-based electorate and not entirely to
   demand-side explanations. This article focuses on the explanatory
   factors underpinning the decline of class voting, in particular economic
   and cultural ones. It does so by relying on a longitudinal dataset
   including survey data from the EES and party manifesto data from the CMP
   over the last 25 years in 12 European countries. Results show that when
   class-based parties adopt pro-labour positions, class voting is
   reinforced. By contrast, when class-bloc parties stand out for their
   pro-multiculturalism positions, class voting weakens significantly.

Abstract = {Ever since the debate between ideal and nonideal theory emerged in
   political theory, a ``strong position{''} has been defended, which holds
   that ideal theory is useless for theorizing what ought to be done to
   make our actual societies more just. Varieties of this position have
   been put forward, but the criticism has been underdeveloped. In the last
   couple of years, however, the strong position has been defended in a
   more systematic way and on other grounds than previous proposals. It is
   argued that ideal theory is entirely uninformative for theorizing
   nonideal principles. It is this version of the strong position that is
   scrutinized in the present paper. We make two claims. First, we argue
   that the arguments put forward fail to demonstrate that ideal theory is
   uninformative in the intended sense. Second, we sketch plausible ways in
   which ideal theory may be informative in construing principles for our
   current conditions.</p>},

   China's naval buildup through sea-denial strategies},

Abstract = {As manifest challenger of the United States (US)-led international
   order, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has inaugurated a
   revisionist strategy that encompasses a multifaceted spectrum of
   initiatives, including an ambitious naval military build-up. History has
   shown that revisionist and challenging powers tend to defy the
   established order through arm races. US Admiral Mahan and German Admiral
   Tirpitz theorized two different approaches to naval strategy, the former
   focusing on global maritime hegemony and the latter on regional
   counterbalance based on risk theory. This article attempts at explaining
   the puzzle of China's naval buildup through the lenses of geopolitics,
   adding a geopolitical dimension to the current debate. It suggests that
   the PRC's naval military development does not follow a Mahanian global
   maritime strategy aimed at challenging the US primacy worldwide, but
   rather a Tirpitzian regional approach focused on counterbalancing the US
   presence within the scope of China's sea power projection, that is, the
   Pacific region. To substantiate this hypothesis, the study compares
   diachronically contemporary Chinese naval arm race with Wilhelmine
   Germany's High Seas Fleet. The findings underscore that, in maritime
   terms, China's revisionism vis-a-vis the US somewhat resembles that of
   Imperial Germany vis-a-vis Imperial Britain, both aiming at regional
   counterbalance and anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) tactics rather
   than global maritime counterhegemony. Although Chinese sea power is
   still far from posing a serious threat to that of the US and its allies,
   an unrestrained continuation of Beijing's naval buildup could encourage
   arms races and direct confrontation due to regional security dilemmas.},

Abstract = {The expectation that voters behave rationally has been challenged
   through studies suggesting that ``irrelevant events{''} like natural
   disasters and sports results change voting behavior. We test the effect
   of irrelevant events by matching candidate-level election results from
   Irish general (1922-2020) and local elections (1942-2019) with games in
   the men's Gaelic football and hurling championships, the most popular
   sports in Ireland. Although Irish citizens care deeply about sports, we
   fail to find any relationship between match results and support for
   incumbents or politicians of government parties. These findings hold
   when applying an ``unexpected event during survey design{''} to two
   representative surveys. Our results contribute to the literature on
   political accountability and point to conditional effects of irrelevant
   events.},

Abstract = {The Prometheus myth has long now provided inspiration for those who
   envision solutions to environmental issues. Prometheus is the figure par
   excellence of human forethought and progress in the anthropocene. In
   this article, we introduce the concept of ambient Prometheanism to
   describe the way of thinking that foregrounds foresight and anticipation
   and advances technological solutions developed by capital and
   energy-intensive projects. We question this stance, arguing that ambient
   Prometheanism, with its emphasis on technofix, leads to the
   economisation and depoliticisation of planetary environmental issues.
   Following Bernard Stiegler, we recover from the myth the figure of
   Epimetheus, Prometheus' brother, as well as his associated faculty,
   epimetheia to theorise what we call an `Epimethean politics'. Thinking
   the anthropocene from the perspective of ambient Prometheanism and
   Epimetheanism means to consider the role of technology in climate
   politics, and in particular to make the case for the importance of
   afterthought in face of unintended consequences and accumulated errors.
   To substantiate our argument, we outline the challenge posed by emerging
   solutions focussed on technological intensification (geoengineering) and
   socio-economic acceleration (green growth and accelerationism). An
   Epimethean politics of the climate requires to use reflexivity as a
   capacity to anticipate, but also to mobilise epimetheia to account for
   accidents and past mistakes. Such a politics builds from an alternative
   conception of technology, one that radically differs from ambient
   Prometheanism. Finally we read as actualisations of Epimethean politics
   contemporary eco-political struggles and their imperatives for
   multispecies living and convivial livelihoods.},

Abstract = {This article applies the concept of `policy styles' to Turkey in order
   to contribute to the scholarly debate on the relationship between policy
   styles and political regime. By uncovering the distinctive features of
   Turkey's policy processes through a within-case comparative approach, I
   advance two arguments. First, while policy styles are commonly viewed in
   literature as determined by administrative traditions, political
   institutions and policy paradigms, Turkey's policy style has been more
   responsive to electoral politics, and, until recently, problem
   situation, in particular crises. Second, policy style is both a cause
   and a consequence of regime change. Turkey's policy style has displayed
   both continuities as well as differences as it descended into
   authoritarianism. The characteristics of the policy style gradually
   undermine institutions of democracy. As democratic backsliding proceeds,
   government redesigns the institutional context of policy-making,
   reinforcing and consolidating the anti-democratic features of the policy
   style.},

Abstract = {The Irish party system has been an outlier in comparative politics.
   Ireland never had a left-right divide in parliament, and for decades,
   the dominant centrist political parties competed around a centre-right
   policy agenda. The absence of an explicit left-right divide in party
   competition suggested that Irish voters, on average, occupy centre-right
   policy preferences. Combining survey data since 1973 and all Irish
   election studies between 2002 and 2020, we show that the average Irish
   voter now leans to the centre-left. We also show that income has
   recently emerged as a predictor of left-right self-placement, and that
   left-right positions increasingly structure vote choice. These patterns
   hold when using policy preferences on taxes, spending, and government
   interventions to reduce inequality as alternative indicators. We outline
   potential explanations for this leftward shift, and conclude that these
   developments might be anchored in economic inequalities and the left
   populist strategies of Sinn Fein.},

Abstract = {In May 2019, three Irish local authorities ran plebiscites alongside
   their local elections: Cork City Council, Limerick City and County
   Council, and Waterford City and County Council. The plebiscites were run
   to judge support for Government proposals to introduce a reformed,
   directly-elected mayoral office. The results were, in some ways, the
   worst possible from a Government perspective: a mix. While voters in
   Limerick backed the plan by a slight majority, it was marginally
   rejected in both Cork and Waterford. Faced with disappointing a large
   group of voters no matter the course of action taken, the Government
   shelved the plans for Cork and Waterford indefinitely, though the plan
   for Limerick may proceed. Despite the 2019 rejections, the 2020 UCD
   Online Election Poll (INES 1) found indications of high levels of
   support for these reforms: four-in-five respondents agreed that mayors
   should be directly elected, which is a significantly higher proportion
   than the Yes vote in any of the three plebiscite areas. This research
   uses further data from the online poll to establish correlates of
   support for these reforms, and tentatively suggests that partisan
   dynamics in turnout are why this support wasn't reflected in the
   plebiscite results.},

Abstract = {Presidents' unilateral sway over policy is of global concern to
   scholars, practitioners and the general public. While pending actions
   provoke media speculation about how much authority presidents have to
   change policy without legislatures, scholarship has yet to
   systematically measure presidential discretion across areas of public
   policy. This study surveys an interdisciplinary panel of scholars, using
   discrete choice experiments to estimate the latent level of discretion
   that US presidents have in fifty-four policy areas. Consistent with
   models of delegation and unilateralism, these measures confirm that
   presidents have more discretion in foreign affairs, and that discretion
   promotes executive action. This approach presents the opportunity to
   examine differences in presidential discretion and public perceptions of
   presidential power, and can be applied beyond the US case.},

Abstract = {This article turns to postcolonial Mexico to analyze the importance of
   Indigenous political thought for the transformation of radical
   republicanism during the Age of Revolutions. I argue that Mexican
   insurgents deployed Indigenous genealogies to instantiate what I call
   ``restorative revolution,{''} a form of revolutionary thinking that
   prioritized memorialization over absolute foundation. Mexico's
   restorative project began with calls for the return of the Anahuac
   Empire, an Indigenous genealogy that memorialized histories of popular
   self-rule to legitimize postcolonial demands. I suggest that the Anahuac
   movement transformed the principles of radical republican thought by
   mobilizing around religious, plebeian, and hemispheric identities. Each
   of these characteristics problematizes dominant interpretations of
   republicanism as a secular, elite, and national enterprise. This article
   uses popular objects and archival ephemera to illustrate the importance
   of engaging with the political contributions of marginalized groups from
   the spaces, practice, and languages they used to envision postcolonial
   emancipation in collective terms.},

Title = {Prisoners' rights implementation in Japan: breaking the shackles with
   suspects},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Several decades have passed since the first call was made toward
   political scientists, among other social scientists, to devote attention
   to human rights and enrich, through empirical investigations, our
   understanding of how human rights implementation works. Today, the
   political science discipline is finally beginning to respond to this
   appeal, with an increasing number of scholars making it their goal to
   isolate variables that obstruct or facilitate human rights
   implementation. The current paper joins this burgeoning body of
   literature by offering a within-case analysis of Japanese prison
   policy-making. In particular, I compare the 2005 bill updating the
   Prison Law (Kangoku ho) that had been in force in Japan since the Meiji
   era with an earlier draft version of that bill which appeared in
   parliament on three occasions since the early 1980s. On the basis of the
   convergence of these bills in terms of seeking to align Japan with the
   evolved new global standards for convicted prisoners' treatment, I argue
   that a three-decade delay occurred in the implementation of prisoners'
   rights in Japan. To account then for this delay, I point to a provision
   pertaining to the criminal procedure (i.e., pre-conviction) which was
   incorporated in the law in question in 1908 merely for pragmatic
   reasons, and with regard to which the modern-time stakeholders of the
   bar and the police could not find agreement. Ultimately, the message
   that this case deals to the political science of human rights is that
   institutional-infrastructural factors, such as ties of legal nature,
   matter to human rights implementation.},

Abstract = {Open political debate on immigration and integration policies (IIP)
   among Canadian political parties has been relatively limited. As
   Canada's immigration and integration systems become more decentralized,
   what about political debates about IIP in Canadian provinces? This
   article examines how IIP evolved across time by focusing on political
   parties' claims, frames and pledges in party platforms and newspapers,
   using the cases of Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, IIP were primarily
   framed as an economic and social resource. However, following the event
   of 9/11, new frames began to be introduced, contributing to a heightened
   salience and polarization. In contrast to Quebec, however, this
   politicization was not sustained. In Quebec, IIP were only marginally a
   matter of debate until the mid-2000s. This changed following the
   Herouxville event, as these topics became salient, and dominant frames
   of immigration as economic and social resources were challenged by those
   of immigration as economic and cultural threats.},

Abstract = {This work aims, first of all, to shed light on the complex relationships
   between politics and religion in Tocqueville's thought. For this
   purpose, it enhances the traditional image of ``ethical liberalism{''}
   with the categories of ``liberal religious thought{''}. In fact, the
   idea of an individual subject structurally oriented towards
   transcendence and bearer of a sacred space exceeding political
   contingencies forms the theoretical core underpinning Tocqueville's
   liberal theory. In this perspective, the article tries to reconstruct
   the conception of religion that emerges from Tocqueville's thought and
   to analyze the relationship between democracy and Christianity, that
   Tocqueville considers as an expression of the more general
   correspondence between socio-political order and forms which religious
   sentiment takes.},

Abstract = {When it comes to gender and voting behaviour Britain had become
   something of an outlier. Whilst more countries shifted along Inglehart
   and Norris' ``rising tide{''} continuum from traditional gender gaps, to
   realignment, into modern gender gaps (Inglehart and Norris 2000, ``The
   Developmental Theory of the Gender gap: Women and Men's Voting Behaviour
   in Global Perspective.{''} International Political Science Review 21
   (4): 441-462, 2003, Rising Tide: Gender Equality and Cultural Change
   Around the World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), Britain
   remained at the realignment stage. But in 2017 a modern gender gap
   emerged with a greater proportion of women than men voting for Labour,
   and a greater proportion of men than women voting Conservative. In this
   paper we examine the 2019 European Parliament and General elections to
   assess whether the modern gender gap persists in Britain. We show that
   whilst in the 2019 General election we again observed a modern gender
   gap, it nevertheless is rooted in the specifics of the political context
   in Britain, specifically post-EU referendum cleavages. Moreover, the
   gender gaps in the European Parliament election reveal a more nuanced
   picture, and demonstrate how the electoral context shapes the gender
   vote gaps we see. Our results indicate that the presence of the modern
   gender gap in Britain is contingent, rather than the result of long-term

Abstract = {The article reviews cooperation between the BRICS countries (Brazil,
   Russia, India, China and South Africa) and their collective efforts to
   promote reform of international financial institutions, shape global
   financial regulation and improve financial cooperation. The authors
   focus on the BRICS-G20 engagement for global economic governance reform.
   To assess the progress so far, the study employs original quantitative
   data on the BRICS and G20 commitments and compliance, and qualitative
   analysis of the BRICS and G20 discourse and the transformation of the
   international economic architecture. The results suggest that, contrary
   to the common perception of the BRICS as a challenger of the traditional
   western-dominated international monetary and financial system, it acts
   in a cooperative manner, seeking to make the international financial
   architecture and global regulation more representative and responsive to
   emerging markets and developing economies needs, and strengthen the
   stability and resilience of international and domestic financial
   markets.},

   communist dictatorships?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-218},

Abstract = {Much has been written about civil society's role in transforming
   communist regimes; however, scholars have largely ignored the officially
   sanctioned organizations. Yet, when political openings arise, official
   organizations evolve into `semi-civil society and play an important role
   in bringing down communist-led regimes. When a reformist regime begins
   opening up, semi-civil society turns to the regime and pressures it to
   reach make farther-reaching reforms, which can lead to a negotiated
   transition. When the regime is less open, semi-civil society turns to
   the opposition, which can help bring about an uprising. Semi-civil
   society by itself cannot bring down a regime or make it more pluralist,
   but it provides a missing link that has been absent from previous
   analyses of the collapse of communist regimes. This article applies
   these insights to a reformist Asian communist-ruled country: Vietnam
   (with reference to China). In such communist-ruled countries, semi-civil
   society is already making society more pluralist and we can it expect it
   to be a driving force for the further pluralization of society and
   possibly even its democratization. If these countries eventually
   democratize, semi-civil society will help them follow the Hungarian path
   to negotiated transitions rather than the Czechoslovak path to change
   through an uprising.},

Abstract = {The longing for total revolution described in Bernard Yack's seminal
   book, which he analyzes as an effort to find a place for human freedom
   and morality in a world governed by natural necessity, can be traced to
   Reformation debates between predestinarian Calvinists and free-will
   theologians. These debates were reflected in Kant's efforts to establish
   the very possibility of freedom and in those of Hegel, Marx, and
   Nietzsche. Considered in this light, the longing for total revolution is
   a yearning not merely to overcome dehumanization but to become something
   more than human, which must always come up short in the face of human
   finitude and mortality.},

Abstract = {This study presents a measure of federal constitutional values as a
   dimension of federal political culture derived from four key features of
   federal systems. Tested in six federal and two non-federal countries, we
   find the measure is stable and taps enduring values, including
   confirmation that citizens who support devolutionary reform have
   stronger federal constitutional values. Defining federalism success as a
   system where citizens have strong federal constitutional values and high
   satisfaction with their current polycentric system, our results find
   Switzerland and Canada being the most viable, followed by the United
   States, Australia, and Germany, while Belgium is not very successful. In
   the non-federal countries, substantial support for devolution and
   possibly federalism is found in France, but devolution is more contested
   in the United Kingdom. The results affirm the importance of public
   attitudes and political culture in understanding the performance of
   federal political systems and public support for federalist-type
   reforms.},

Title = {Recognition politics in Northern Ireland: from cultural recognition to

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-84},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The idea of recognition is often taken to support the notion of
   `pluralist accommodation' between nationalists and unionists. This
   relies on a distinctive `cultural' model of recognition as requiring
   identity affirmation as essential to conflict resolution. It is argued
   that the cultural model relies on a weak analysis of social recognition
   and is, consequently, a poor guide to understanding the politics of
   recognition in Northern Ireland. Firstly, it does not give sufficient
   weight to struggles for equal recognition. Secondly, the vague notion of
   `affirming' identities does not capture the way recognition struggles
   arise over social positioning in wider status hierarchies. An
   alternative, `recognition struggle' account is developed which focuses
   on conflicts over authority and which explains why recognition politics
   in Northern Ireland often centers on defying the other. Finally, the
   cultural model fails to see that cultural groups are themselves the
   product of internal struggles for recognition and wrongly assumes the
   politics of recognition must resist attempts to transform group
   identities. Taking recognition seriously requires us to move beyond
   `cultural recognition' and `pluralist accommodation' in Northern
   Ireland.},

Abstract = {Democracies worldwide are under stress. Two distinct families of
   explanation can be identified by the relative emphasis they place on the
   cultural versus the economic. Protesting against this dichotomy, there
   are those who insist that economic and cultural grievances interact. A
   conceptual scheme which ties together the economic and the cultural
   through interaction, however, rests on a prior separation. In this
   article, a richer and more plausible account of the relationship between
   transformations of work and contemporary democratic decay is developed.
   This account is based on a social practice model of work, in which the
   economic and the cultural are entirely intertwined. The social practice
   of work is among other things a privileged site for the realisation of
   certain `goods of work'. These include self-respect, self-esteem and
   self-realisation. It is by altering expectations about the realisation
   of the goods of work that transformations of work have contributed to an
   environment within which democracies are under stress.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for a more sustained consideration of how fandom - as
   both a set of practices and topic of political conversation - underpins
   a broader ``celebritization{''} of politics and public life. It
   analyses, via a Twitter-based qualitative content analysis, the ways in
   which fandom is expressed and spoken about in relation to three
   contrasting politicians from the UK, namely Margaret Thatcher, Tony
   Blair and Jeremy Corbyn. While the precise dynamics of fandom vary
   depending on the politician in question, our analysis identifies a more
   general tendency whereby overtly fannish discourses and practices
   co-exist with expressions of unease or hostility toward the figure of
   ``the fan.{''} This in turn reflects longstanding cultural
   representations of the figure of the fan as improper and excessive,
   particularly in the context of democratic politics. These contradictory
   responses to fandom in politics are crucial to understanding the
   ambivalent character of the celebritization of politics more generally.},

Abstract = {Although most ballots in the United States have historically been cast
   in-person, Americans are increasingly voting by mail, a trend that
   accelerated in the 2020 General Election. Mail ballots can be rejected
   after being cast, and our analysis of the Florida general elections of
   2016, 2018, and 2020 shows that voters inexperienced with mail voting
   disproportionately submit ballots that end up rejected due to (1) late
   arrival at elections offices or (2) signature defects on return
   envelopes. Inexperienced mail voters are up to three times more likely
   to have their ballots rejected compared to experienced mail voters, and
   this inexperience penalty varies by a voter's party registration,
   race/ethnicity, and age. Our findings hold when controlling for
   additional voter characteristics and geographical fixed effects. The
   effect of inexperience on the likelihood of vote-by-mail ballot
   rejection risks exacerbating existing inequities in political
   representation already faced by younger and racial/ethnic minority
   voters.},

Abstract = {Many studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between
   education and political knowledge. However, some scholars have recently
   challenged this idea, arguing that the positive correlation between
   education and knowledge may disappear once confounding variables are
   considered. In this paper, we replicate a recent study that used the
   discordant twin design to examine the association between education and
   political knowledge. More specifically, we analyze the relationship
   between education and political knowledge within monozygotic (MZ) twin
   pairs, which enables us to bypass sources of confounding of the
   relationship (i.e. genes and socialization) because MZ twins reared
   together share both. Using data from a 2019 survey of twins from the
   Danish Twin Registry, we find that, consistent with earlier work, after
   accounting for familial factors, the relationship between education on
   political knowledge is small and not statistically significant.},

Abstract = {Correspondence study field experiments with political elites are a
   recent addition to legislative studies research, in which unsolicited
   emails are sent to elites to gauge their responsiveness. In this
   article, we discuss their ethical implications. We advance from the
   viewpoint that correspondence study field experiments involve trade-offs
   between costs and benefits that need to be carefully weighted. We
   elaborate this argument with two contributions in mind. First, we
   synthesize ethical considerations in published work to explore what the
   specific trade-offs are and how they can be mitigated by experimental
   design. We conclude that correspondence study field experiments with
   political elites are worth pursuing given their potential to further
   good governance. But they also involve distinct trade-offs that are
   particularly challenging. Second, we draw from our own considerations
   while designing a comparative correspondence study field experiment and
   stress challenges resulting from cross-national designs. In sum, we aim
   to facilitate further reasoned discussion on an important methodological
   issue.},

   outcome. Founded in 1971, the DUP's three previous leaders had either
   been self-appointed (Ian Paisley, the party's founder) or nominated
   without a rival opponent (Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster). Foster's
   unseating in an internal coup triggered a contest between Northern
   Ireland Executive minister Edwin Poots and Westminster MP Sir Jeffrey
   Donaldson. The outcome was determined by one of the smallest
   selectorates of any party in the UK or Ireland, twenty-eight DUP members
   of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs) and the party's eight
   Westminster MPs. They voted narrowly to elect Edwin Poots as their new
   party leader. Yet, Poots lasted merely twenty-one days in the job,
   replaced by Donaldson, who was unopposed when the leadership vacancy
   re-arose. This article analyses an extraordinary saga.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic touched every part of the United States.
   Government officials were tasked with communicating information to the
   public about a quickly changing crisis. This article aims to ask and
   answer important questions surrounding how differently situated
   legislators discussed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus of 2019 and
   resultant pandemic of COVID-19 with their constituents in official
   communications. We assess a theory of responsive representation as well
   as a theory positing that co-partisan legislators took their cues from
   the president, which we call follow the leader politics. To facilitate
   this study, we have created a new dataset of COVID-19 deaths by
   congressional district. We find that legislators who saw more
   in-district fatalities in the earlier parts of the pandemic sent more
   COVID-19 communications than others. We also find that co-partisans were
   more likely to use derogatory terminology to refer to COVID-19 in
   official communications and were more likely to tout hydroxychloroquine.
   There are limits to follow the leader politics, however: when it came to
   mask use, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress encouraged
   constituents to do so as soon as the CDC and Surgeon General guidelines
   indicated.},

Abstract = {Developments in the Black Sea region since 2014 have combined to
   transform Romania into the Western alliance's linchpin in southeastern
   Europe. Regrettably, successive Romanian governments have underfunded
   defense and the modernization of the armed forces, leaving them with
   incoherent capabilities. This essay examines the Romanian defense
   institution on four levels. First, outputs of the armed forces are
   examined in a critical light. Second, key inputs into defense execution
   are assessed. Third, the paper proposes a different manner by which to
   examine these challenges with the objective of finding practical
   solutions. The fourth and final section examines the critical issue of
   finding the necessary resources to fund increased training, maintenance,
   and modernization.},

Abstract = {Citizens need to trust in the integrity of news reporting for the free
   press to fulfill its role as a democratic institution that enables
   citizens to hold representatives accountable. Growing research has shown
   that increased use of social media erodes trust in legacy news. However,
   trust-reducing social media messages are not contained to social media
   platforms; they are widely recirculated by the mainstream media. We
   argue that mainstream media corporations select social media messages to
   recirculate precisely because of their trust-reducing features in order
   to respond to short-term competitive market incentives. We turn to
   Donald Trump's Twitter posts as examples of trust-reducing messages and
   show that the media cites more trust-reducing messages more quickly and
   more frequently than less trust-reducing messages. These findings
   implicate mainstream media corporations alongside social media platforms
   in the systematic and ongoing degradation of trust in legacy news
   reporting.},

Abstract = {The Czech 2020 regional elections were won by ANO, a party led by prime
   minister Andrej Babis. ANO received a plurality of votes in 10 of the 13
   regions, but joined the regional government in only 3 of them. This
   election report explains this puzzling outcome as a result of three main
   causes: the national political polarization which facilitated
   coordination between the fragmented opposition parties against the
   winner, the electoral collapse of the historical Left (the Social
   Democrats and the Communists), and profound shifts in the voter turnout
   of key demographic groups. Registering a sharp increase in the regional
   presence of the Pirate Party and moderate overall gains of the
   centre-right opposition, these regional elections amplified the
   polarization of Czech national-level politics. They also increased the
   regionalization of political competition.},

Title = {Threat or Corrective? Assessing the Impact of Populist Parties in

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Volume = {57},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scholars have long debated whether populism harms or improves the
   quality of democracy. This article contributes to this debate by
   focusing on the impact of populist parties in government. In particular,
   it inquires: (1) whether populists in government are more likely than
   non-populists to negatively affect the quality of democracies; (2)
   whether the role of populists in government matters; and (3) which type
   of populism is expected to negatively affect the quality of
   liberal-democratic regimes. The results find strong evidence that the
   role of populists in government affects several qualities of democracy.
   While robust, the findings related to (2) are less clear-cut than those
   pertaining to (1). Finally, regardless of their role in government,
   different types of populism have different impacts on the qualities of
   democracy. The results show that exclusionary populist parties in
   government tend to have more of a negative impact than other forms of
   populism.},

Abstract = {Recent work on the influence of social identities reveals that
   placed-based attachments serve as a powerful heuristic when making
   political assessments. When a politician makes a place-based appeal-such
   as cuing rural origins-individuals who share that identity more strongly
   support the candidate. Yet, other important identities-namely,
   partisanship-are strongly related to place. Here, we attempt to
   disentangle the unique influence of a place-based identity (and the
   strength thereof) on candidate support. Additionally, we ask whether
   shared place can compel supportive behavior, rather than merely increase
   expressive support. Using a unique survey experiment, we find that those
   who strongly identify with a place are more willing to donate to the
   campaign of a shared-place candidate, relative to weaker place
   identification, but only among co-partisans. We find little evidence
   that place attachment influences supportive behavior beyond the role of
   partisanship. Disparate identities-here, place and partisanship-that
   create cross-pressures can operate in tandem.},

Abstract = {How do judges decide issues of equality? While prior scholarship
   demonstrates that judicial attributes such as partisan identification,
   gender, race, age, and career backgrounds help elucidate judicial
   decision-making, considerably less attention has been devoted to how
   judicial empathy may influence or condition judicial decision-making.
   Such scholarly attention is especially lacking in the study of courts
   outside of the United States. To bridge this critical gap, we examine
   how judicial empathy affects decision-making behavior by analyzing data
   from the Supreme Court of Canada from 1982 to 2015. We find compelling
   evidence that trailblazer women's unique personal experiences exert a
   strong influence on judicial behavior within the Canadian Supreme Court.
   In fact, our findings demonstrate that the effects of judicial empathy
   extend across a broader array of discrimination cases in Canada compared
   to previous findings on the American courts. We find that trailblazer
   women have a greater propensity to vote in favor of discrimination
   claimants compared to their male peers. Normatively, these effects
   manifest as judicial empathy in discrimination cases where trailblazers
   themselves likely faced upward mobility challenges.},

Abstract = {The article reveals the problematic issues for ensuring financial
   security in the context of globalization in global financial systems.
   The modern stage of development of state financial systems is
   characterized by difficulties in ensuring national financial security.
   Despite the urgency of this problem, the international community is
   focusing on ensuring economic security during the formation of universal
   and regional legal instruments, leaving out of sight issues of legal and
   practice-oriented guidance in financial security. The article examines
   the main directions of implementation of state policy aimed at improving
   the effectiveness of legal and national and international means to
   ensure financial security in the context of the globalization of growing
   threats to economic security. The focus is on the modernization of legal
   instruments to regulate public relations related to financial security.
   Particular attention was paid to the correlation of international legal
   bases, national legislation, and regional laws. It is concluded that the
   development of state financial policy that guarantees the security of
   the budgetary system is fundamental.},

Abstract = {Has the global COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the scholarly
   productivity of academics? Do gender and parenting magnify its effect?
   To obtain insight into the changes the pandemic has wrought in the lives
   and careers of women and parents in academia, we surveyed scholars in
   political science and international studies. The survey was in the field
   during the period in which many academics were experiencing
   shelter-at-home orders and adjusting to a new reality. It captures
   initial reactions to changed circumstances as well as the fears and
   anticipated consequences of the disruptions. We find that perceptions of
   a negative impact are broadly shared. The open-ended responses suggest
   that the pandemic may widen the gender and parent productivity gaps.
   Although further analysis is needed to better understand the effect of
   the pandemic on scholarly productivity, we conclude that the pandemic
   exacerbates existing structural inequalities.},

Abstract = {Foreign students are one of the most significant immigrant categories in
   many North American and Western European countries. Yet, as their
   numbers have swelled, many governments have experienced increasing
   pressures to cap their entry. This is true despite the sizable benefits
   that foreign students bring to host countries, and despite standard
   political economy concerns about immigrants-that they take away jobs or
   abuse public entitlements-not applying to foreign students. We field a
   nationally-representative survey experiment in the UK, one of the top
   destinations for foreign students, to examine potential activators of
   public support for capping the number of foreign students. Results show
   that support for caps is most activated when citizens are primed to
   think about foreign students competing with domestic students for scarce
   admissions slots at universities.},

Abstract = {V-Dem experts have proposed an empirical methodology to determine the
   dynamics of authoritarianism/democratization of the electoral process
   (Electoral Democracy Index). In the Slovak Republic, the successful
   institutional reforms of the late 1990s and early 2000s, followed by the
   deepening and implementation of Euro-integration processes, were among
   the main factors affecting the electoral process democracy level.
   Factors influencing the authoritarianization of electoral processes
   include the relationship between the voter turnout and the electoral
   process transparency, radicalization of the political party space, and
   the dominance of one political actor in the party system and government
   structures (SMER-SD). Slovakia managed to go through all possible stages
   in the electoral process dynamics, this accounting for the complex
   democratic transformation of the country, e.g.: the decline of
   authoritarianism (1993-2000), stagnation (2001-2016), and increasing
   authoritarianism (2017-2019). In early 2020, parliamentary elections,
   following a deep political and governmental crisis, became an electoral
   snapshot of Slovak society.},

   Maududi's critique of nationalism had greater depth and complexity than
   most commentators have recognized, and taking seriously his stated
   interest in moving beyond the ``intellectual slavery{''} engendered by
   colonialism the essay argues for reading his analysis of nationalism in
   modern democracies and his proposed solution of jizya as an attempt at
   decolonizing political theory through conceptual innovation that
   employed Islamic resources to address limitations of European thought
   and practice, and inverted colonial hierarchies of thought. Recognizing
   it as such deepens our understanding of the challenges involved in and
   raised by decolonizing political theory.},

Abstract = {Modern technologies offer the public administration new tools,
   potentially very useful both for its non-provisional activity and for
   decision-making. In the latter context, however, delicate questions
   arise, especially with regard to discretionary activity. In particular,
   difficulties arise in the event that the decision of the p.a. is assumed
   on the basis of an algorithm. The national legislator has not (so far)
   intervened to regulate the matter in an organic and exhaustive way; the
   reference principles are found above all in the legislation prepared at
   European Union level. An important role was played by administrative
   jurisprudence, especially by the State Council, which developed a sort
   of ``statute{''} for the algorithmic provision, highlighting how the
   issues posed by the new technological tools are, on closer inspection,
   largely attributable to the traditional problems of administrative
   action.},

Journal = {REVISTA MEXICANA DE ANALISIS POLITICO Y ADMINISTRACION PUBLICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to investigate the scope of the electoral
   and legislative transfuguism in the subnational sphere that Morena would
   have generated in the framework of the local elections of 2018, 2019 and
   2020. For this purpose, 972 biographical records of the deputies of the
   local congresses of the 32 federative entities and it was investigated
   how many legislators recognize that they were part of other political
   forces before acceding to their seat and how many changed parties after
   being installed as popular representatives. The hypothesis that guided
   the analysis establishes that morenism attracted politicians from all
   parties, generating an unprecedented high level of transfuguism.
   However, the results allow us to infer that the existing transfuguismo
   did benefit Morena but was marginal in relation to the total number of
   registrations and that it focused on the PRD, PT and PES, that is, it
   was the product of the breakdown of PRD and the electoral arrangements
   with the coalition partners of morenism.},

Abstract = {We explore mediated representations of parties' campaign interactions in
   multi-party systems. Actors in multi-party systems can engage with
   different actors on multiple issues. One crucial aspect of such
   engagement is the element of negativity-voicing criticisms of other
   actors' actions and policy proposals. This contribution argues that the
   media systematically exaggerate patterns of negativity based on issue
   ownership structures, such that attacks originating from or targeting
   issue owners are significantly more likely to be covered. We analyze a
   broad sample of news content from the 2013 Austrian national election
   campaign with generalized exponential random graph models to capture the
   complexities of mediated campaign negativity in a multi-party system
   while controlling for non-mediated campaign negativity. The results show
   that issue owners are more likely to be featured as attackers and
   targets in owned policy domains, suggesting a violation of the normative
   ideal of a fair representation of campaign interactions.},

Abstract = {There exists a longstanding debate over the global institutional
   implications of Immanuel Kant's political philosophy: does such a
   philosophy entail a federal world government, or instead only a
   confederal `league of nations'? However, while the systematic nature of
   Kant's tripartite `doctrine of right' is well recognised, this debate
   has been conducted with all but exclusive focus on `international right'
   in particular. This article, by contrast, brings `cosmopolitan right'
   firmly into view. It proceeds by way of engagement with the two Kantian
   arguments made in defence of a `league of nations' in discussion of
   international right, each of which appeals to aspects of states'
   supposed `personhood': the first appeals to states' distinctive moral
   personality; the second to states' physical manifestation. The article
   considers what happens when we assess these arguments not just in light
   of the demands of international right, but also in light of cosmopolitan
   right, and thus in light of public right more comprehensively. The
   answer is that such arguments cannot succeed as full defences of a
   league of nations. Indeed, when we assess such arguments with
   cosmopolitan right in view, they point instead - either tentatively or
   definitively - in the direction of world government.},

Abstract = {Diplomatic settlement on the Korean peninsula demonstrates Russian
   capacity, despite decrease in influence in 1990s, to de-escalate
   tensions when relations among the other parties in the region are at its
   absolute worst. This is a testimony to Moscow's little-publicized
   ability to exercise leverage on North Korea and to break the deadlocks.
   The first Kim Jong-un-Vladimir Putin summit in April 2019 and Moscow's
   good relations with Moon Jae In administration of South Korea created an
   opportunity for a greater Russia's role in resolving Korean peninsula
   issues. North Korea's new diplomacy towards South Korea and the United
   States and the start of the search for a negotiated solution to the
   Korean issue created a window of opportunity for Russia to achieve
   cooperative security and economic interaction in the region. This
   article suggests options on how Russia can evaluate the stakeholders'
   chances to converge their approaches and how Moscow can contribute to
   them.},

Abstract = {The Subnational Research (SNR) and Multilevel Governance (MLG) research
   programs have tackled some of the crucial questions in comparative
   politics. Despite their shared principle that actors and institutions
   located at one territorial level are shaped by and shape other levels of
   government, each tradition has developed its own set of concepts and
   theories without fully acknowledging the other. We believe that this has
   been detrimental for knowledge accumulation. We argue that more
   knowledge accumulation in the study of territorial politics is possible
   if (1) scholars engage with each tradition, and (2) they are attentive
   to differences, or blind spots, in each traditions' theories, concepts,
   and scope conditions. Drawing on two examples, the Regional Authority
   Index (RAI) and Kent Eaton's work (2021) we show the benefits of
   transcending the boundaries of each tradition. We conclude by proposing
   a unified framework for the study of territorial politics that
   incorporates both SNR and MLG.},

Abstract = {How can the growing personalization of power be identified and measured
   ex ante? Extant measures in the authoritarian literature have
   traditionally focused on institutional constraints and more recently on
   individual behaviour - such as purging opposition members from (and
   packing allies into) government bodies. This article offers a different
   strategy that examines leaders' individual rhetoric. It focuses on
   patterns of pronoun usage for the first person. The author argues that
   as leaders personalize power, they are less likely to use `I' (a pronoun
   linked to credit claiming and blame minimizing) and more likely to use
   `we' (the leader speaks for - or with - the populace). To test this
   argument, the study focuses on all major, scheduled speeches by all
   chief executives in the entire Chinese-speaking world - that is, China,
   Singapore and Taiwan - since independence. It finds a robust pattern
   between first-person pronouns and political constraints. To ensure the
   results are not driven by the Chinese sample, the rhetoric of four other
   political leaders is considered: Albania's Hoxha, North Korea's Kim Il
   Sung, Hungary's Orban and Ecuador's Correa. The implications of this
   project suggest that how leaders talk can provide insights into how they
   perceive their rule.},

Abstract = {This essay develops an account of Martin Luther King Jr.'s justification
   for and use of what I will call ``democratic propaganda{''}-truthful
   propaganda that is aimed at promoting and fostering democratic political
   action by stirring readers' emotions. I interpret King's famous ``Letter
   from Birmingham Jail{''} in the broader context of his work and argue
   that it is a piece of democratic propaganda. I give an account of what
   led King to support the use of democratic propaganda and why he hoped it
   would help to overcome a central problem in the civil rights movement:
   the political inaction of the white moderates. King emphasizes shame in
   the Letter, and I argue that this concept offers us a new way of
   thinking about the efficacy of democratic propaganda. I close by
   considering the relevance of King's approach for today's Black Lives
   Matter movement. Despite the innovativeness of King's use of shame, I
   suggest it may be time for a new approach to Black politics and
   activism.},

Title = {Going Feminine: Identifying How and When Female Candidates Emphasize
   Feminine and Masculine Traits on the Campaign Trail},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {3},
Pages = {691-705},

Abstract = {Female candidates face a messaging challenge. There is a strong
   association between masculinity and political leadership. Stressing
   masculinity can result in a likability backlash for female candidates
   often seen as lacking feminine qualities, such as warmth. Preventing a
   likability backlash by highlighting feminine qualities can also harm
   female candidates. Current scholarship offers conflicting conclusions
   about how female candidates balance these gendered challenges. We fill
   this empirical and theoretical gap with a trait-balancing theory
   clarifying how and when female candidates use feminine and masculine
   traits to manage competing expectations. We use original data merging
   information on candidate advertising strategies across three election
   cycles. We show that female candidates strategically balance masculine
   and feminine stereotypes in ways that often differ from their male
   counterparts but also differ based on female candidate partisanship and
   incumbency. These results are consequential because they highlight how
   female candidates manage gendered pressures in campaign strategies,
   which can affect their ability to win elections and, ultimately, women's
   representation in government.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has had a huge impact on the global economy and
   politics. Closures and lockdowns stopped international trade resulting
   in an economic slowdown. It has changed the daily lives of people and
   the way business takes place. Politics has also been affected by the
   pandemic. Discussions about the changing world order have gained a new
   dimension and momentum. In this article, the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic in international relations is analyzed. Has COVID-19 triggered
   a change in the world order? If it has, what are the nature, scope, and
   content of this change? As a rising regional power in the Eastern
   Mediterranean region, how has Turkey been affected by this, and how did
   it respond to the changing situation? Signs of deteriorating world
   order, declining U.S. leadership, escalating geopolitical competition
   amongst global powers were in the air before the pandemic. Turkey's
   adaptation to this new world order pre-dates the pandemic, when it
   changed its political system, and invested in its security and cohesion.},

Abstract = {They describe the electoral spot as a ``compressed communication format,
   the main audiovisual communication space between the electorate and
   political parties{''}, it is loaded with persuasive political marketing
   techniques that seeks to generate a certain capacity for influence
   (negative or positive) on the electorate. The advertising piece has also
   been defined by scholars of political communication as video politics.
   This article shows the use of the spot in the electoral campaigns of
   some candidates to the presidency in Colombia during the nineties and
   the beginning of the new millennium, of candidates to the Colombian
   Congress in 2014, especially in the department of Boyaca and the
   election process to the Congress of the Republic 2018. There, the
   candidates for Boyaca consolidate the use of Information and
   Communication Technologies-ICT to achieve the visualization of their
   spots. Some theoretical elements developed obey the terms electoral
   media ecosystem; the stories that manage to be told in the videos, based
   on seven communicative codes: linguistic language; kinesic language;
   proxemic language; iridological language; physiological language;
   fashion; and non-verbal values voice. The work is a product of the
   finalized project Electoral behavior in Boyaca 2018: from the Congress
   of the Republic and Presidential contests.},

Abstract = {The United States and its allies are entering an era of strategic
   simultaneity for which the `Transatlantic Alliance is ill-prepared. The
   prospect of concurrent conflict or pressure from opposing sides of the
   Euro-Atlantic region would stretch existing resources beyond
   commitments. It would also risk undermining Article 5 and 70 years of
   stability and prosperity for NATO in Europe. As the U.S. pivots to the
   Indo-Pacific, the Biden administration should pursue closer relations
   with the Alliance as a fourth offset strategy which seeks to bolster
   European defense and better align strategy at the national and
   multinational levels. In so doing, the United States can enhance the
   security and stability of the political West with a view towards the
   emerging geopolitical environment of the coming decades.},

Abstract = {There has been praise of how female leaders have handled the Coronavirus
   pandemic relative to their male counterparts by presenting a more
   ``caring{''} leadership. Of similar coverage has been the role of public
   trust for how successful governments have been in containing outbreaks.
   In this paper, we build on these two literatures to understand different
   determinants of trust during the pandemic between men and women.
   Following social role theory, we argue that female citizens' trust
   judgements are more likely to be driven by the perception that leaders
   are more caring than are men, whilst men's judgements are more likely to
   be driven by competence judgements than women's. We test this argument
   using original survey data from three countries. We find that this
   relationship holds in the United States, but not the United Kingdom or
   Italy. This adds to variation in gender gaps in the USA and Europe; at
   the same time, it also suggests that the propensity for women to be less
   trusting than men is not down to (perceived) leadership traits.},

Title = {The downstream consequences of long waits: How lines at the precinct
   depress future turnout},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Researchers have increasingly paid attention to the impact that the
   administrative component of elections has on voter behavior. Existing
   research has focused almost exclusively on the effect that legal
   changes-such as voter identification laws-have on turnout. This paper
   extends our understanding of the electoral process by exploring how one
   aspect of the precinct experience-standing in line to vote-can shape the
   turnout behavior of voters in subsequent elections. I demonstrate that
   for every additional hour a voter waits in line to vote, their
   probability of voting in the subsequent election drops by 1 percentage
   point. To arrive at these estimates, I analyze vote history files using
   a combination of exact matching and placebo tests to test the
   identification assumptions. I then leverage an unusual institutional
   arrangement in the City of Boston and longitudinal data from Florida to
   show that the result also holds at the precinct level. The findings in
   this paper have important policy implications for administrative changes
   that may impact line length, such as voter identification requirements
   and precinct consolidation. They also suggest that racial asymmetries in
   precinct wait times contribute to the gap in turnout rates between white
   and non-white voters.},

Abstract = {The article intends to advance the study of e-participation in renewed
   directions by focusing on a category of actors that has long been
   overlooked: elected politicians. It zeroes in on legislators who while
   key actors of representative democracy chose to be involved in an
   e-participation initiative. This article generates theoretical
   propositions on how they make use of e-participation platforms in their
   work as parliamentarians. Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews
   about the main e-participation platform in France, Parlement \&
   Citoyens, the article shows that parliamentarians' usages of such
   participatory tools tend either toward a policy-oriented logic or a
   vote-seeking purpose. These usages can also be categorized as tending
   toward either a representative or a participatory democracy logic. The
   article concludes that if platforms are originally designed as online
   participatory alternatives to conventional legislative processes, they
   are chiefly used as adjuvants to traditional political representation
   practices.},

Title = {Political Incorporation, Interrupted? The Effects of Loss and Distress
   Following the 2016 US Elections on the Civic Attitudes and Involvement
   of Latino Immigrants},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The wellbeing of democracy depends on ``losers' consent,{''} i.e.,
   unsuccessful electoral coalitions accepting defeat. Yet for some,
   disappointing losses after an election and ensuing distress under the
   new administration may lead to an erosion of political trust, efficacy,
   and engagement in public affairs. The election of Donald Trump in 2016
   posed such a possibility for Latino immigrants, given Trump's combative
   anti-immigrant stances. Drawing from a three-wave panel survey of
   foreign-born Latinos, this ``civic erosion{''} hypothesis is examined.
   Results indicate that post-election losses and worries about the
   wellbeing of friends and family led to a decline in political trust and
   efficacy. However, there was no corresponding drop in interpersonal
   trust; nor did these concerns prompt immigrants to consider leaving the
   U.S. Furthermore, immigrants who backed an unsuccessful presidential
   candidate or were worried about risks to family members and friends
   under the Trump administration were significantly more likely to take
   part in marches and demonstrations. Such resilience and engagement bode
   well for the continued incorporation of immigrants into American civic
   life.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the review symposium on Ryan Patrick Hanley's works
   on the relatively neglected early modern philosopher Francois Fenelon
   (1651-1715) provides a brief overview of the symposium itself before
   turning to Hanley's treatment of Fenelon's work on the intersection of
   politics and religion, culminating in a comparison of Fenelon with his
   most celebrated admirer, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The article sketches how
   both francophone thinkers employ conceptions of divine justice as a
   measure to counter the dangers of amour-propre, contrasting Fenelon's
   thick theology with Rousseau's thin theology.},

Abstract = {Which types of civil society organizations are politicized as indicated
   by regular political engagement and why? If they are, how wide-ranging
   are their political action repertoires? This article proposes an
   `organizational governance perspective' on civil society organizations'
   political engagement by arguing that organizations resembling
   traditional `voluntary associations' are less likely to be politicized
   and to employ a broad political action repertoire than those resembling
   highly professionalized `voluntary agencies'. Applying event count
   regressions to new data from four recent population surveys widely
   substantiates the proposed perspective, thereby challenging prominent
   arguments about the detrimental effects of professionalization and state
   dependency on organizations' ability to contribute to democratic
   representation.},

Abstract = {During the financial crisis of 2008-2010, governments have had varying
   success in containing the fiscal costs of stabilizing their financial
   sectors. This article challenges the existing literature that attributes
   these differences purely to national factors and contends that the
   international dimension affects a government's capacity to share the
   costs across borders. Specifically, if a country shares a leveraged
   creditor with other countries, concerns about regional contagion will
   drive decisions by outside actors to participate in or prevent external
   burden sharing. A comparison of the role of the Swedish government
   during the financial crisis in Latvia and the ECB's influence on Ireland
   shows that these decisions can both facilitate or prevent international
   burden-sharing. While Latvia benefited both from maintained exposure by
   Swedish banks and an internationally coordinated response to its crisis,
   the Irish government accumulated losses because foreign banks reduced
   their exposure and the European Central Bank vetoed ``bailing in{''}
   bondholders of bankrupt banks. Future research on financial
   stabilization should therefore more explicitly consider possible
   contagion effects from bailing in foreign creditors.},

Abstract = {Explanations of Italy's and Germany's position within the Eurozone
   commonly focus on trade `competitiveness,' a concept measured in terms
   of unit labour costs. This trade-centric view offers a poor explanation
   for the evolution of the two countries external debt levels following
   the adoption of the Euro. It also fails to explain the external
   financial fragility that Italy has repeatedly experienced in the period
   since 2010. Both outcomes are better explained by dynamics in
   cross-border financial markets. Monetary union created large incentives
   for banks in the Eurozone's core states, including Germany, to direct
   funds to banks in the Eurozone's periphery (those countries whose banks
   had earlier faced higher currency-related risk premia in obtaining
   external financing). Domestic policy decisions in Germany further
   contributed to this outcome. In the period since 2010, the Eurozone's
   rules-based governance model and the failure of governments to create a
   common safe asset for banks became a major factor contributing to
   Italy's financial fragility. It remains to be seen whether Europe's
   response to the COVID-crisis will mark a watershed, and break these
   financial markets dynamics.},

Abstract = {Do radicalized individuals with no logistical assistance from opposition
   groups generate liabilities or advantages for opposition leaders? To
   address this question, we develop a theory that articulates a novel
   strategic channel connecting radicalization, defined as self-motivation
   to dissent, to repression targeting an opposition group's operational
   capacity or its leadership. Our main result shows that targeted
   repression is strictly decreasing in the proportion of radicalized
   citizens. We endogenize opposition leaders' decision to radicalize
   citizens and show that opposition leaders, even absent any direct
   benefit to radicalize, nevertheless invest effort into radicalization.
   Thus, radicalization is a political tool to deter repression by
   decreasing its usefulness. To better understand this strategic
   consequence, we analyze two common policy interventions-economic and
   psychological-and show that improving economic conditions reduces both
   radicalization efforts and dissent, while making individuals
   psychologically less susceptible to radicalization can sometimes
   backfire and increase dissent because it increases leaders'
   radicalization efforts.},

Abstract = {Faction is an old age phenomenon world over. The democratic
   consolidation in South Africa post 1994 is close to three decades but
   did not escape factionalism. Does faction phenomenon bring about havoc,
   conflicts, splits, and instability corollaries or strengthen party
   politics in response to fulfilling the general will? In responding to
   this question, South African party politics and factional battles within
   the ruling party and other political formations are discussed as a case
   study to explore the merits and demerits of factions and factionalism.
   In doing this, a discourse analysis was undertaken to understand how
   faction phenomenon brings about complots or a positive change. The
   discourse analysed arrived to the conclusion that whilst factions are
   blatantly criticised for rearing havoc and instability in party politics
   as well as signs of split-offs and threats as demerits in South Africa,
   there are also inevitable trade-offs to be welcomed as merits to create
   opportunities to drive positive change within the broader
   party-political spectrum to strengthen participatory democracy and the
   multi-party system in South Africa.},

Title = {The effect of exposure to digital appeals to participate in collective
   action posted by influentials on protest information sharing: Evidence
   from Japan and South Korea},

Abstract = {Contemporary collective action theories put large horizontal digitally
   connected networks at the center of mass political action. They posit
   that information sharing among ordinary social media users makes
   possible new forms of rapid mass political action. However, recent
   research has shown that influential individuals can play a number of key
   roles in facilitating networked political action in seemingly leaderless
   movements. Still, the role of influential individuals in stimulating
   protest information sharing on social media is an important aspect of
   networked collective action that remains understudied. This study seeks
   to address this. Specifically, it investigates the following question:
   does exposure to appeals to engage in protest increase individuals'
   motivation to share protest information? Drawing on evidence from an
   original survey experiment, this study shows that digital appeals to
   engage in collective action posted by influential individuals do elicit
   an increase in motivation to share the appeal. However, this result
   obtains only for Korean respondents, whereas influential appeals appear
   to have no effect on Japanese respondents. I argue that this difference
   is in part a function of different citizenship norms in the two
   countries, and the corresponding effects on social network dynamics.
   Preliminary analysis supports this interpretation, but further
   investigation is warranted.},

Abstract = {Simulations have long been an important pedagogical tool in the fields
   of Politics and International Relations. Their more widespread use,
   however, has been prevented by a combination of perceived barriers to
   entry in required time and planning. This article seeks to help faculty
   overcome these barriers and to lessen the burdens associated with
   simulation-based pedagogy by presenting instructors with a clear,
   systematized, and research-based approach to simulation development.
   This article draws from research in the Scholarship of Teaching and
   Learning, Instructional Design, and the learning sciences to provide
   Political Science and International Relations instructors with a clear
   model and associated step-by-step approach to designing, implementing,
   and evaluating educational simulations. This model-which we label DImE
   for Design, Implementation, Evaluation-is drawn from pedagogical best
   practice but with a strong consideration for practical implementation of
   simulations in the university classroom. In short, it seeks to provide
   faculty with a fundamental piece in their ``teaching tool kit{''} for
   developing their own simulations.},

Abstract = {ABSTACT Drawing on the concept of critical juncture, in this article we
   argue that the scale and impact of an `extraordinary' event such as the
   Covid-19 pandemic cannot be understood in full without acknowledging the
   pre-existing conditions of a country and its path-dependent trajectory.
   Against this background, we first assess the institutional legacy of the
   Covid-19 crisis in Italy, analysing the evolution of political dynamics
   within the coalition government that led the country in 2020, as well as
   the governance capacity and legitimacy of the main political actors
   involved in the management of the pandemic. Second, to shed further
   light on how Covid-19 has impacted on the institutional dimension, we
   look at multilevel governance and the relationship between central and
   regional governments during the pandemic. We argue that the sudden and
   long-lasting `shock' prompted by Covid-19 has disrupted the already
   fragile equilibria of the Italian system, impacting in a most profound
   way on its politics, institutions and society. And yet, while in the
   short term, the critical juncture of Covid-19 opened the way to new,
   unexpected changes, towards the end of the year pre-existing, systemic
   conditions prevailed.},

Abstract = {The appeal to the re-appropriation of national sovereignty has recently
   become the unifying trait of a heterogeneous group of right-wing
   parties. The underlying reasoning behind this claim is that globalised
   elites ignore the needs of the people-defined as a restricted and
   ethnically homogeneous group of natives-they are supposed to represent.
   After defining the perimeter of this party cluster, including populist,
   national conservatives and extreme-right parties, this article explores
   the extent to which the adoption of similar political platforms might
   also be reflected in a convergence of parliamentary party articulations.
   A qualitative account of the evolution of parliamentary representation
   in a few right-wing parties from Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands
   shows that a two-way street of institutionalisation might be at play in
   the complex balance between uncompromising grassroots components and a
   more pragmatic institutional component.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {From 1908 onwards, the labor movement in Rosario began a process that
   has been characterized as demobilization, which has been little studied.
   Its limited attention is due to the scarcity of major workers'
   conflicts. We believe that this representation should be rethought, and
   at the same time we present new explanatory variables to understand
   which factors led the workers' movement within this context, based on
   the analysis of the situation of the years 1907-1908.},

   about legislative corruption in Latin America since democratic
   consolidation in 1990 to 2016. We use public opinion data from
   ``Varieties of Democracy{''} project from Gothenburg University and
   Kellogg Institute, to explore the effect of partisan variables, and
   institutional variables, on the perception of legislative corruption in
   Latin America. Data shows that the lack of control by the legislative
   opposition and the ordinary courts, the commodification of electoral
   mobilization and the primacy of particularistic interests over the
   common good, are variables that increase the probability of perceiving
   parliamentary work as corrupt.},

Abstract = {Why did unemployed university graduates form collective associations in
   some countries in the Middle East and North Africa but not in others?
   Despite similar levels of grievances around educated unemployment,
   reversals in guaranteed employment schemes, and similarly restrictive
   conditions for mobilization, unemployed graduates' associations formed
   in Morocco and Tunisia but not in Egypt. Conventional
   explanations-focused on grievances, political opportunities, or
   pre-existing organizational structures-cannot account for this
   variation. Instead, I point to the power of ideologically conducive
   frames for mobilization around the time that grievances become salient.
   A strong Leftist oriented tradition of student unionism in Morocco and
   Tunisia was necessary for the emergence of a rights-based discourse
   around the ``right to work.{''} This was not the case in Egypt, where
   Islamists, not Communists, dominated student politics at the time that
   grievances around educated unemployment became salient. This article
   offers one of the first comparative studies of the mobilization of the
   unemployed in a non-Western, non-democratic context.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Political scientists often distinguish between two types of issues:
   moral versus non-moral issues or social-cultural versus economic issues.
   The implication is that these types of issues trigger different types of
   reasoning: while economic issues rely on pragmatic, consequentialist
   reasoning, social-cultural issues are said to be dependent on principles
   and deontological reasoning. However, it is not known whether this
   distinction is as clear-cut from a citizen's perspective. Scholars agree
   that understanding the morality of voters' political attitudes has
   implications for their political behaviour, such as their willingness to
   compromise and openness to deliberation. However, few studies have
   analysed whether citizens reason in principled or pragmatic ways on
   different issues. This study takes an exploratory approach and analyses
   the determinants of principled versus pragmatic reasoning in direct
   democracy, in which citizens make direct policy decisions at the ballot
   box. Using a unique dataset based on thirty-four ballot decisions in
   Switzerland, it explores the justifications voters give for their ballot
   decisions in open-ended survey answers. It distinguishes between
   pragmatic (or consequentialist) arguments and principled (or
   value-based) arguments. The analysis shows that principled
   justifications are not tied to particular issues. Voters use both types
   of justifications almost equally frequently. Moral justifications are
   more likely when an issue is personally relevant, as well as when a
   proposition is accepted, while pragmatic justifications prevail when a
   proposition is rejected. Furthermore, right-wing voters more often argue
   in pragmatic terms. Finally, the framing of the issue during the
   campaign significantly affects moral versus pragmatic justifications.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to identify which actors were present at the public
   hearings of the permanent committees of the Brazilian House of
   Representatives in the 53rd and 54th legislatures. Taking a descriptive
   analytic strategy, it verifies that the committee system was marked by a
   wide set of inputs generated by social participation. However, there is
   a clear power asymmetry characterized by the dominant role of government

Abstract = {Studies of Western parliaments find women experience greater difficulty
   than men in combining parenting with a career in parliament. Is it the
   same worldwide? Addressing this issue, we compared the marital and
   parental status of legislators in 25 diverse parliaments around the
   world while theoretically exploring whether parliamentary family gaps
   are due to individual, family, institutional, societal or global-level
   conditions. Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we
   find institutional- and societal-level factors matter. Namely, family
   gaps between men and women members of parliament (MPs) were narrower
   under conditions of higher female employment, women in parliamentary
   leadership and lower rates of child mortality. Thus, motherhood
   penalties for women MPs are likely to diminish with increases in women's
   paid employment, better social welfare provisions and more women in
   parliamentary leadership positions. Our findings also point to the
   importance of public policies, parliamentary rules and critical actors
   in reducing time demands on parents who are MPs.},

   intensive security agenda, tightened scrutiny of economic and
   technological cooperation with China, and open intervention in issues

Abstract = {This study aims to identify the types of city council decision-making
   processes that influence public perceptions of procedural fairness and
   the acceptability of decisions. Using an online experimental scenario
   survey conducted in Japan, this study found that, given the opportunity
   to participate in the decision-making process and when the decision is
   reached through a compromise among council members, people tend to feel
   that the process is fair and accept the decision even when it is
   unfavourable to them. This result is important for the governance of
   many advanced countries with low economic growth rates but great public
   demands. Additionally, this study highlights the process preferences of
   the public, which has received little attention compared with research

Abstract = {The importance of data science in society today is undeniable, and now
   is the time to prepare data science talent (National Academies of
   Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018). Data science demands
   collaboration, but collaboration within political science departments
   has been weak in teaching data science. Bridging substantive and methods
   courses can critically aid in teaching data science because it
   facilitates this collaboration. Our innovation is to integrate data
   science into both substantive and methods courses through a dedicated
   data science course and modules on data science topics taught in
   substantive courses. This approach allows not only for more
   opportunities for teaching and practice of data science methods but also
   helps students to understand how social, economic, and political biases
   and incentives can affect their data.},

Title = {An ``urban voluntary association{''} in the rural South? Urbanity, race,

Abstract = {Historians describe the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) as an
   urban movement, but the reasons for its urban focus have not been
   adequately explored. This is intriguing because the UDC was most vibrant
   during the first three decades of the twentieth century, when white and
   black citizens alike were leaving rural southern communities for urban
   centers - and as white politicians increasingly enforced Jim Crow
   restrictions. In this study, we examine the effects of urbanity and race
   on local UDC chapters and membership across the South. We find that
   although UDC chapters were not overwhelmingly urban, members largely
   joined urban chapters - particularly those located in smaller cities.
   Chapters and members were also more common in cities with larger black
   populations, suggestive of a racial contact stimulus. These findings
   lead us to question the UDC's relationship to the predominately rural
   South as well as its ability to broadly represent southern white women.
   They also speak to other research on voluntary associations during this
   period, underscoring that southern urbanity inspired civil society,
   albeit based on separation rather than integration.},

Title = {Taxing the Tails in a Global Economy: How Electoral, Party and Wage
   Bargaining Systems Interact to Determine the Taxes Paid by the Poor and

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {A prominent line of research on electoral systems and income
   redistribution argues that proportional representation (PR) leads to
   tax-and-transfer policies that benefit the poor at the expense of the
   rich. This is because PR produces encompassing center-left coalitions
   that protect the poor and middle classes. Yet countries with PR
   electoral systems tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes and tax
   profits lightly, both of which are inconsistent with this expectation.
   Both policies are regressive and seem to benefit the rich at the expense
   of the poor. This article argues that PR electoral institutions, when
   combined with trichotomous multipartism, are not as hostile to the rich
   as commonly believed, and that it is important to understand how

Title = {Party polarisation in the American Congress and the duration of
   legislated economic sanctions, 1945-2005},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {This article explores whether party polarisation in the American
   Congress affects the length of legislated sanctions. While Congress can
   enact sanctions, it usually authorises the president to waive, suspend
   or terminate them. However, Congress can prevent the president from
   ending a sanction if both parties can cooperate to block the
   presidential proposal or pass a sanction bill challenging the
   presidential preference. Borrowing from moderate polarisation argument
   that both parties can cooperate only when they are moderately polarised,
   I argue that the probability of sanction termination declines if
   Congress is moderately polarised but increases when Congress is either
   least or extremely polarised. This is because only under moderately
   polarised Congress can both parties cooperate to stop the sanction
   termination. I test this argument using TIES data (1945-2005) and find
   support for this expectation. This research contributes to our knowledge
   on the role of congressional dynamics in shaping American foreign
   policy.},

Abstract = {Over the last 40 years, Indigenous communities in Canada have negotiated
   self-government agreements that allow them to express politically their
   unique identities, traditions and beliefs within the confines of the
   federal system. In this paper, we examine the motivations and range of
   candidates that have run for political office at the regional level in
   Nunatsiavut, an Inuit self-governing community in northern Labrador
   created through the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement in 2005. In
   particular, we examine whether existing political behavior theories are
   applicable to Indigenous candidates running for office in these kinds of
   regions. To do so, we qualitatively analyze data from Nunatsiavut
   elections held between 2006 and 2017, including 11 elite interviews with
   candidates that ran for the office of Ordinary Member in 2014 and 10
   interviews with candidates from other years. Our findings suggest that
   gender, and to a lesser extent, family dynamics, as well as, public
   attitudes towards candidates and negative attacks, may be barriers to
   running for office.},

Abstract = {Which candidates are more likely to go negative, and under which
   conditions? We analyze self-reported survey data from candidates having
   run in the 2017 German federal election for the main parties. More
   specifically, we test a comprehensive set of factors supposed to drive
   the use of (a) negative campaigning in general, (b) policy attacks, and
   (c) character attacks. Our results show that for all three versions of
   negative campaigning the political profile of candidates is most
   important, followed by personality traits, perceived campaign dynamics,
   social profile, and available campaign resources. Within these
   categories, five factors are important across the board: members of the
   governing parties are less likely to attack, `extreme ideology' of the
   candidate fuels the use of attack politics, candidates who believe that
   the media can persuade voters attack more often, disagreeable candidates
   tend to go negative, and male candidates are more likely to attack than
   females.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects of Brexit on the internal boundaries
   and territorial future of the United Kingdom (UK). Divergent Brexit
   preferences, coupled with the process of negotiating and preparing for
   Brexit, have raised new questions about the ability of the UK to remain
   united. Focusing upon Scotland and Northern Ireland, where territorial
   challenges are most acute, the article draws upon and adapts Hirschman's
   voice, exit and loyalty framework to examine the strategic choices and
   options faced by institutional actors in each case when determining
   constitutional and political options in response to Brexit. The article
   contends that, while credible exit threats were used to bolster voice in
   the Brexit negotiations, the Brexit vote and subsequent process have
   exposed the limitations of territorial voice, and unleashed new exit
   dynamics. We enhance the framework by exploring the concept of re-entry,
   exploring the contrasting paths these territories would face to re-enter
   the European Union (EU).},

Abstract = {Record-high levels of international migration both toward and across
   Europe have recently given rise to a new body of research on the social
   protection of immigrants. A recurring argument in this literature
   maintains that migrants are generally more likely to gain access to
   social benefits in generous welfare states. The article offers a
   critical review of this hypothesis with a focus on unemployment benefit
   provision. The tides of European welfare politics have produced a set of
   systems in the past which are today highly stratified on the basis of
   employment. This mechanism generates a considerable benefit gap in
   reference to migration, especially for those who arrived to their
   country of residency only recently. Empirical analyses with micro-level
   data for 14 Western European countries provide supporting evidence for
   this argument. The findings indicate a negative relationship between
   generosity and social protection which has not been accounted for in
   previous research.},

Abstract = {One of the most important decisions a president will make after an
   election is what kind of relationship he/she will have with cabinet
   secretaries and agency heads. Will the president be controlling or
   autonomy giving? George H. W. Bush created a contractor presidency, one
   that subcontracted management to important officials, giving them
   considerable freedom, making them policy entrepreneurs. Yet, when it
   came time to support initiatives, Bush did not back his policy
   entrepreneurs, which ultimately led to policy failure. Bush's approach
   to government is informative because of its similarities with Donald J.
   Trump's strategy, who also created a contractor presidency. But Trump
   prevented those same executives from building their own teams and gave
   equivocal, or even contradictory, responses to their policy initiatives.
   Just as Bush's unsupportive relationship with his policy entrepreneurs
   led to policy defeat, Trump's contradicting connection with his policy
   entrepreneurs also resulted in policy failure.},

Abstract = {During the 1980s, Soviet fishing vessels from Murmansk regularly visited
   Corner Brook, Newfoundland. Project Ploughshares, a peace group in
   Corner Brook, organized visits of members of Soviet fishing crews to
   schools and homes in Corner Brook. Students and residents in Corner
   Brook were, in turn, invited aboard Soviet fishing vessels. Corner Brook
   Project Ploughshares was perhaps the most active, community-based peace
   group in Canada in the final years of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {This article examines Karl Marx's distributive justice principle ``From
   each according to his ability, to each according to his needs{''}
   (Critique of the Gotha Program, 1875). It argues that Marx advocates for
   ``unequal equality,{''} since the end result of his principle is unequal
   contribution (due to the contributors' different abilities) and unequal
   distribution (due to recipients' different needs); that Marx's principle
   avoids many pitfalls of contemporary desert theories; that while Marx is
   critical of abstract right (Recht), he maintains that right will be
   enhanced in the future communist society; that Marx's attitude toward
   work is contradictory, since work is for him both ``life's prime
   want{''} and a hindrance to the intellectual and social flourishing
   possible only in leisure time; that the widespread interpretation of the
   communist society as one of abundance where all needs can be satisfied
   has scant textual basis; and that Marx's principle continues to inspire
   theories of distributive justice, efforts to expand social services and
   endeavours to establish a cooperative, classless society.},

Title = {Constitution, Authoritarianism, and Bad Governance: The Case of Russia},
Journal = {RUSSIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {71-90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Among many arguments for constitutional changes presented in the wake of
   the 2020 campaign for the popular vote in Russia, there was the idea
   that ``cementing{''} Russia's political landscape for the sake of the
   regime's durability would serve as a tool for improvement of quality of
   governance. This argument, in a way, followed the essential point of
   Mancur Olson describing many autocrats across the globe as ``roving
   bandits{''} with their short-term time horizons and incentives for
   predatory behavior. To what extent may the constitutional extension of
   the time horizon of Russia's authoritarian regime contribute to
   conversion of Russia's state officials and top managers from the
   ``roving{''} to the ``stationary{''} model, in Olson's terms? On the
   basis of previous research, I argue that the nature of Russia's
   political regime-electoral authoritarianism under personalist
   rule-prevents such a trajectory of further evolution. Indeed, the set of
   constitutional changes adopted in Russia in July 2020 is likely to
   preserve bad governance as a mechanism of maintenance of
   politico-economic order, as intentionally built and developed during the
   post-Soviet period. While certain technocratic solutions for Russia's
   governance, aimed at ``fool-proofing{''}, may avert the risks of major
   disasters, under conditions of durable authoritarianism the use of these
   devices will not result in major advancements in the quality of
   governance. Rather, they may contribute to further decay and aggravation
   of the numerous vices of bad governance.},

Abstract = {The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the
   importance of reliable and relevant information dissemination. How well
   a crisis like COVID-19 is handled depends, in many ways, on how the
   public perceives the crisis and risks related to it, through the media.
   Therefore, how the situation is framed, what are seen as key issues, and
   who is perceived to be in charge, can have implications for the outcome.
   This article analyses Icelandic news media content about COVID-19 at the
   onset of the pandemic by using theories of agenda-setting and framing.
   The objective is to examine how the pandemic was framed, which topics
   were highlighted and who was given a voice in the media. We specifically
   investigate what kind of leadership was present during the earliest
   stages of the pandemic. Using content analysis, we examined media
   content about COVID-19 from 21 Icelandic media outlets from January 1st
   to March 31st, 2020. Our conclusions show that from the start of the
   pandemic, health related subjects, such as disease prevention, COVID-19
   statistics and the health care system were salient in the media, though
   tourism and economic factors were also quite prominent. Furthermore,
   experts were at the helm of communication whilst politicians remained
   more in the background. The dissemination of instructions and rules
   illuminates the relationship between the experts and politicians, as the
   experts were given a voice in the media to communicate such information.
   The politicians, however, directly cited the experts, thanked them or
   endorsed them, when they spoke on instructions and rules in the media.},

Title = {Judicial orders in the trade secrets law},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With Law 1/2019, the Spanish legislator transposes EU Directive
   2016/943, and gives the necessary protection to trade secrets, in order
   to contribute to legal certainty in a delicate field, where the key is
   effectiveness. The legal protection of the trade secret is of little use
   if it is not accompanied by effective measures so that this secret is
   kept, and in case of violation, ensuring the adoption of all the
   necessary measures in order to re-establish the situation to that which
   existed before the violation, minimising the negative consequences that
   the said violation has occasioned to the prejudiced owner of the secret,
   and also compensating him/her properly for the damages already
   occasioned. Finally, the necessary measures must also be adopted to
   prevent the said violation from happening again in the future. In order
   to maximise the efficacy of the protection, judicial orders arise as an
   agile and inexpensive legal tool, available to the Courts, that allows
   them to guarantee the civil actions provided in Law 1/2019 and secures
   compliance with the judicial decisions adopted in this field, the
   ultimate goal being to improve conditions, the framework for the
   development and use of innovation, and the transfer of knowledge.},

   American and European health claims regulations},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2021},
Number = {55},
Pages = {93-117},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article analyzes North American and European health claims
   regulations. By making use of the concept of epistemic policy, we show
   that the European regulation is committed to a monistic assessment
   approach, which favors a certain scientific methodology, while the North
   American regulation is committed to a pluralist epistemic policy. The
   comparative analysis of both regulations shows that each epistemic
   policy depends on particular regulatory objectives. We conclude that
   there is no single epistemic policy that serves to achieve different
   regulatory objectives. Moreover, we conclude that the choice of one
   epistemic policy or another entrenches the objectives of regulation,
   sets the trajectory of technological innovation and it entails other
   socio-political implications. In particular, we show how the European
   epistemic policy is compatible with a hard governance mode, while the
   North American one is more compatible with a softer governance mode.
   Finally, we hold that our conclusions are extensible to current
   evidence-based policy proposals. It is not reasonable, in accordance
   with our results, to think that there is one single type of scientific
   evidence useful for all public policies objectives. Committing to one or
   another epistemic policy would lead to think that only a certain type of
   political interventions would have supporting evidence.},

Abstract = {The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence
   against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul
   Convention, was signed by Turkey on 11 May 2011. A landmark treaty for
   women's rights, the Convention designated gender inequality as the
   source of violence against women, defining violence as not solely a
   domestic issue but one of a larger societal problem. Despite being the
   most comprehensive legal framework that strives to combat domestic
   violence and gender inequality to date, Turkey withdrew from the treaty
   with a Presidential Decree at midnight on 20 March 2021. While providing
   an overview of the domestic dynamics that led to Turkey's withdrawal,
   this article shines a light on the collective struggle for gender
   equality in Turkey, arguing that society is now aware of violence more
   than ever.},

Abstract = {Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Islamophobia
   exploded across `the West,' but particularly in Europe. While Muslims
   were suffering attacks across Europe, the experience of Muslims in Latin

   Islamophobia. In the roughly 10 year period between the attacks of
   September 11, and the start of the Syrian civil war, why did
   Islamophobia rise in `the West,' but not in Latin America? This article
   attempts to answer this question through an analysis of the
   civilizational identities of both regions, in particular the countries
   of Denmark and Argentina. While the core of Denmark's identity is being
   part of the `the West,' which was `at war' with the Muslim world during
   this period, Argentina defines its identity in opposition to Western
   countries like Britain and the U.S., leaving it outside `the West,' and
   Islam not seen as a threat.},

Abstract = {In 2014, banners hung across Thailand's northern region called for a
   separate Lanna state. This rise in consciousness of a Lanna political
   identity stems from rumors that Thaksin-former prime minister and from
   the Lanna region-is the reincarnation of past Northern kings. The ethnic
   pride derived from these connections added to feelings of ethnic
   persecution as the conservative Bangkok elite attacked and lampooned
   Thaksin regarding these rumors and, indirectly, Lanna culture. While
   neither Thaksin nor his sister Yingluck have used explicit nationalist
   rhetoric, their political fates-both were ejected in military coups-have
   increasingly been interpreted in nationalist terms. I combine
   qualitative evidence from Thai newspapers, magazines, social media
   accounts, blogs, etc. that trace this development with 2015 survey data
   from Chiangmai, Lanna's capital. The survey shows that 40\% of
   respondents consider the Shinawatra siblings as the most important
   ethnoregional figures, past or present, and this correlates with
   strength of Lanna identity.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the salience of the north-south identity in Vietnam.
   Using focus groups and survey data, we argue that Vietnam is
   characterized by asymmetric ingroup bias, where southerners hold higher
   levels of ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination than the north.
   However, while north-south identity exists, its salience is limited
   because it crosscuts with other social identities. Survey data show
   little difference between the north and the south regarding nationalism,
   support for redistribution, trade, authoritarian values and traditional
   values. There are differences with the south exhibiting lower trust in
   the government and generalized trust. Also, within Ho Chi Minh City
   (HCMC) and Hanoi more specifically, we find lower support for China and
   higher support for the United States in HCMC than in Hanoi. However,
   these differences are relatively muted, and combined with focus group
   evidence, suggest that while identity differences exist, they are
   asymmetric and not as salient as often presumed.},

Abstract = {Forty million people around the world and more than one million in the
   United States live with HIV. Despite the gains in the prevention and
   treatment of HIV due to medical advances and community advocacy,
   HIV/AIDS continues to claim lives and disproportionately affect
   marginalized communities. Stigma against people with HIV remains
   powerful. While individuals with HIV have gained some visibility in the
   media, the scarcity of politicians with HIV is striking. This article
   analyzes a possible reason: voter bias. We examine voters' reactions to
   political candidates with HIV using original nationally representative
   survey experiments from the United States, the United Kingdom and New
   Zealand. Voters penalize candidates with HIV by 10-12 percentage points
   in the three countries. Prejudice, electability concerns, and the moral
   judgment that candidates are responsible for their HIV+ status explain
   bias. The lack of descriptive representation remains an obstacle to
   improved policy outcomes for this marginalized community.},

Abstract = {This article examines the interplay between social risks, welfare state
   policies and far right voting. Distinguishing between compensatory and
   protective policies and using data from seven waves of the European
   Social Survey (ESS) and social policy datasets, the article tests a
   range of hypotheses about the extent to which welfare state policies
   moderate the insecurities that drive particular social groups to vote
   for the far right. Empirical findings confirm theoretical expectations
   that several welfare state policies reduce the likelihood of supporting
   the far right among individuals exposed to high risks including the
   unemployed, pensioners, low-income workers, employees on temporary
   contracts, individuals in large families, and individuals who are
   disabled/permanently sick. These findings suggest that in order to
   understand why some individuals vote for the far right, one should not
   only focus on their risk-driven grievances, but also on policies that
   may moderate these risks.},

Title = {When institutions reinforce regional divides: Comparing Christian and

Abstract = {Contrasting colonial experiences shaped regional cleavages in the
   Philippines. Spain converted natives to Christianity but struggled with
   converting the Muslim population. Spain only succeeded in driving them
   further south. American colonialism also perpetuated this regional
   divide: Christians were under civilian rule while Muslims were under
   military rule. These administrative regional divides happened
   concurrently, but a cohesive Christian identity developed much sooner
   than a Muslim identity in the south. Why do some regional identities
   develop sooner than others? I argue that variation in the onset of
   identity formation is the result of contrasting colonial education
   policies that fell along regional lines. Christians experienced a
   penetrative education policy, which cultivated a shared experience and
   facilitated the development of a national identity. Muslims experienced
   a shallow education policy, which did not have a unifying objective.
   These factors maintained fragmentation, rather than fostering a cohesive
   Muslim national identity.},

Abstract = {What contributes toward academic productivity and impact in political
   science research publications? To consider this issue, Part I of this
   article describes the core concepts and their operationalization, using
   the h-index. The study theorizes that variations in this measure may
   plausibly be influenced by personal characteristics (like gender, career
   longevity, and formal qualifications), working conditions (academic
   rank, type of department, and job security), as well as subjective role
   perceptions (exemplified by the perceived importance of scholarly
   research or teaching). Part II sets out new evidence used for exploring
   these issues, drawing upon the ECPR-IPSA World of Political Science
   survey. This study gathered information from 2446 political scientists
   in 102 countries around the globe. Part III presents the distribution
   and analysis of the results, as well as several robustness tests. Part
   IV summarizes the key findings and considers their broader implications.
   In general, several personal characteristics and structural working
   conditions prove significant predictors of h-index scores, whereas
   motivational goals and role perceptions add little, if anything, to the
   models. Thus, who you are and where you work seems to predict
   productivity and impact more than career ambitions and social
   psychological orientations toward academic work.},

Abstract = {The UN is intimately involved in efforts to restore the rule of law in
   conflict and postconflict settings. Yet despite the importance of the
   rule of law for peace, good governance, and economic growth, evidence on
   the impact of these efforts is scant. I develop a theory to explain when
   UN rule-of-law reform is likely to succeed, then test the theory using
   original datasets capturing the number of civilian personnel deployed to
   each UN mission in Africa, the number of personnel assigned specifically
   to rule-of-law-related tasks, and the extent and nature of actual
   rule-of-law-related activities in the field. The correlation between UN
   presence and the rule of law is weak while conflict is ongoing, but
   robustly positive during periods of peace. The relationship is stronger
   for civilian than uniformed personnel, and is strongest when UN missions
   engage host states in the process of reform.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a first approach to the discursive
   representation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as an agent and some ways through
   which it is ascribed with varying degrees of agency in the current
   pandemic. We provide different conceptualizations of the term agency
   from different epistemological fields, and then we will focus on the
   relationship between virus and agency from the viewpoint of the language
   sciences. We also analyse and discuss three examples that show how
   agency is ascribed. Firstly, how it is attributed through a narrative of
   war. Secondly, ascribing agency when enacting an `other' in discourse,
   and constructing it as an antagonist. Thirdly, when representing a
   discourse of `blame' in some uses of the urban linguistic landscape.},

   extremes. Taken together with the other contributions in this issue, it
   is quite possible that national identity will increasingly shape the

Abstract = {The article covers the topic of limitations to the territoriality of
   Daesh affiliates. As attempt to establish territorial Caliphate, these
   units should demonstrate high levels of territoriality but empirically
   speaking this is not the case. The article presents the territorial
   spread of the groups and maps possible limitations that would explain
   this paradox. It concludes that unlike other territorial violent
   non-state actors, Daesh affiliates are incapable of utilising liquidity
   thus are stuck in an environment that presents them with opposition from
   all sides. It is thus improbable that the Daesh affiliates will ever
   show important territorial spread.},

Abstract = {In some countries, direct democracy is used successfully to increase
   legitimacy of decisions or mitigate conflict, and in other countries,
   authoritarian leaders seem to instrumentalize and manipulate
   referendums. How can referendum integrity be analyzed? This article
   presents an empirical instrument to evaluate the variety and integrity
   of referendums. This encompasses criteria for the analysis of direct
   democracy. First, we develop a referendum cycle model based on the
   electoral cycle framework, assessing referendum quality in a number of
   dimensions from electoral laws and electoral procedures, thematic
   limitations of referendums, to voter registration, the initiation of
   referendums, campaign and media coverage as well as campaign financing.
   The empirical instrument is designed to be used in expert surveys, and
   piloted in the Turkish constitutional referendum of 2017. The article
   presents the results of the pilot study, draws out opportunities and
   limitations of this approach and suggests avenues for its future
   development.},

Abstract = {Research on political consumerism documents a persistent reversed gender
   gap, as women boycott and buycott products more often than men. Previous
   efforts to explain the reversed gender gap rely on classical theoretical
   models developed to illuminate gender differences in political
   participation in general. Accounting for socio-economic and situational
   factors as well as socialization leaves a significant amount of the
   reversed gender gap unexplained, though. Adhering to recent empirical
   evidence of personality as an important factor influencing political
   behavior, we argue that gender differences in personality traits could
   provide an alternative explanation to account for gender disparities in
   political consumerism. We use original survey data specially designed to
   measure political consumerism in Switzerland, which also include the Big
   Five model of personality. We find empirical evidence that gender
   differences in personality traits, in particular agreeableness, explain
   a significant portion of the reversed gender gap in political
   consumerism.},

Abstract = {Based on the latest European Values Study released in 2018, this study
   investigates the characteristics that French citizens ascribe to
   democracies to be essential. So far, little is known about democratic
   notions in a comparative perspective and even less about their origins
   and political consequences. To fill this research gap, this study adopts
   an exploratory research design where notions of democracy are, at first,
   inspected as dependent variables and, subsequently, scrutinized as
   determinants of political attitudes and participation. The empirical
   evidence reveals the deviating effects that different types of
   democratic notions exert on political attitudes and action and
   underscores the impact of personality traits and political ideology.},

Title = {Revisiting Regional Security Complex Theory in Africa: Museveni's Uganda
   and Regional Security in East Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JAN 10},
Abstract = {This article revisits Buzan and Weaver's Regional Security Complex
   Theory (RSCT), and asks what is the utility of Buzan and Waever's RSCT
   framework in understanding African security issues? It includes
   theoretical insight and criticism of RSCT whilst simultaneously
   providing an empirical case study of Uganda's President Museveni within
   East Africa. It focuses in particular on a period between 2010 and 2015
   when East African security dynamics were in flux. The article argues,
   primarily, that Regional Security Complex Theory can be improved by
   including a clearer articulation of how African leaders assert influence
   within, and shape, regional security dynamics in Africa. Doing so allows
   for a better realization of how Regional Security Complexes come into
   being. The article draws on over four years of desktop research and over
   one hundred field-work interviews in East Africa and South Africa with
   regional security specialists, military personnel, politicians,
   government officials, journalists, academics, market traders, and
   economists. The paper highlights President Museveni's uniquely active
   and influential role in shaping regional security dynamics in East
   Africa.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the nature of the state and society in contemporary
   Thailand using a comparative historical analysis. Thailand is led by an
   officer corps, faithful only to the monarchy regime, while the land is
   at the disposal of the absolute sovereign who unquestionably holds
   control over its terrain, resources and people. It is a mix of Siamese
   palingenetic ultranationalist sentiment with re-interpretations of a
   conservative Buddhist ideology which is based on the morality and right
   of the rulers to rule. To the military leaders, its general officers,
   the military-monarchy nexus embodies a supreme source of secular
   morality and power with the right to dominate and where the ends
   (always) justify the means. Thai society has become irreparably divided
   by the interests of the ruling elites, defining the exceptions and, it
   is argued, comparable to historical and contemporary authoritarian
   regimes elsewhere. The article argues that the country, led by the New
   Right, articulates disarming elements of semi-fascism under the
   military, in a compact with the interests of the monarchy.},

Title = {Poliheuristic Theory and Germany's (Non-)Participation in Multinational
   Military Interventions. The Non-compensatory Principle, Coalition
   Politics and Political Survival},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article employs the poliheuristic theory of decision-making (PHT)
   to analyse German decisions to participate in, or abstain from,
   multinational military operations. PHT represents one of the leading
   theoretical efforts at bridging the cognitive-rationalist divide in
   foreign policy analysis. The theory posits a two-stage model of foreign
   policy-making: in the first stage, actors rely on a non-compensatory
   strategy as a cognitive shortcut to eliminate unacceptable alternatives
   and to reduce the choice set. In the second stage, actors switch to a
   compensatory mode of information-processing and select the alternative
   which maximises expected utility. While there is broad agreement that
   the non-compensatory dimension at the first stage of PHT concerns the
   domestic repercussions of foreign policy, it is less clear how this
   `domestic politics' dimension should be operationalised. This article
   contributes to this debate by specifying the operationalisation of the
   non-compenstaory principle in the context of coalition foreign policy
   making in parliamentary democracies. Specifically, it suggests that the
   non-compensatory dimension in coalition foreign policy consists of the
   expected impact of foreign policy on coalition survival. Empirically,
   the article argues that PHT sheds important new light on arguably some
   of the most controversial military deployment decisions (Democratic
   Republic of Congo, Lebanon, Libya) of post-unification Germany.},

   POLITICAL MOBILIZATION},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing interest among scholars in the effect of Internet
   bots, or automated social media accounts, on the processes of political
   communication and mobilization in the online sphere, the extent of bots'
   effectiveness and the specific mechanisms of their use remain largely
   understudied. The deficit of the overarching conceptual understanding
   and concrete results is arguably due to researchers' aspiration to solve
   a problem in the empirical way, without attempting to combine data
   analysis with mathematical and computational modeling.
   Having analyzed the existing models on the topic, the authors offer
   their own model that is based on the spiral-of-silence theory. The key
   features of the model that set it apart from the existing ones are the
   following: a) taking into account differences in the types of motivation
   and costs associated with expressing protest and loyalist sentiments; b)
   including ``partner effect{''} into the spiral-of-silence mechanism; c)
   employing a neurological decision-making scheme according to which the
   same stimulus can prompt action and be a deterrent.
   On the basis of a series of computational experiments with the model,
   the authors demonstrate that bots are more effective in mobilizing
   opposition members when an individual motivated for political
   participation refrains from it because his local social community does
   not share his views. In this case, the emergence of a like-minded
   partner bot can destroy the spiral of silence created by this community
   and encourage this individual to openly express his position. On the
   contrary, when mobilizing loyalists, bots are most effective in relation
   to poorly motivated individuals. The model elaborated by the authors not
   only allows us to evaluate bots' effects in a new way, but it also sheds
   light on how people make decisions in the framework of political
   communication and mobilization in social networks.},

Abstract = {Combining a variety of materials and a mixed methods approach, this
   article shows how the space of the French radical left has evolved since
   the 2000s. It outlines the transition from a Marxist to a post-Marxist
   ideology, and the creation of two new organizations - the Front de
   gauche (Left Front), which aimed to bring together the radical left, and
   La France insoumise (Unbowed France), which sought to federate the
   people using a more transversal populist strategy. The similarities and
   differences between the two strategies are put into perspective, from a
   discursive point of view and at the level of the electorate.},

Abstract = {Discussions about the practical terms of Brexit have been an
   unprecedented test for the unity of the Conservative parliamentary
   party. This article will explore the way the episode has entirely
   changed the rules of party discipline. Whereas the Maastricht crisis had
   allowed rebel MPs to ``voice{''} their opposition to a pro-Treaty
   government and led to the rise of a Eurosceptic faction, the Brexit
   turbulence not only inverted the balance of power between a pro-Hard
   Brexit leadership and rebels who oppose this option. But it also gave
   rise to a new organisational paradigm by institutionalising ``exit{''}
   and introducing ``expulsion{''} in a new form.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the stability of a multi-level government. We analyze
   an extensive form game played between two politicians leading two levels
   of government. We characterize the conditions that render such
   government structures stable. We also show that if leaders care about
   electoral rents and the preferences of the constituencies at different
   levels are misaligned, then the decentralized government structure may
   be unsustainable. This result is puzzling because, from a normative
   perspective, the optimality of decentralized decisions via a multi-level
   government structure is relevant precisely when different territorial
   constituencies exhibit preference heterogeneity.},

Title = {EU SECURITY: MICRO-AGGRESSION WITH MACRO-CONSEQUENCES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {5},
Pages = {94-108},
Abstract = {The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has convincingly shown that the very
   concept of security is going through a deep transformation in the 21st
   century. Widespread epidemics, massive illegal migration, international
   terrorism, environmental disasters, new forms of nationalism, cyber
   technology, and scarce resources challenge the traditional military
   threats that have always been at the center of theinternational
   community's attention. Undoubtedly, in the list of new non-military
   threats, the pandemic initiated by the coronavirus came to the fore,
   which raised the question of rethinking the very concept of security.
   The article analyzes the phenomenon of pandemic and security nexus, as
   well as the consequences of this phenomenon for the functioning of the
   European Union and its member states. In particular, the author examines
   the threats posed by the pandemic to human security or the foundations
   of human life, economic security, socio-political stability, and,
   ultimately, to the future of European integration. The author argues
   that the EU's response to the devastating consequences of the
   coronavirus will be a test of its viability as a unique integration
   association capable of becoming a full-fledged power center in
   post-pandemic international relations. The title of the article ``EU
   Security: Micro-aggression with Macro Consequences{''} is metaphorical
   and intended to highlight the misleading perception of the scale of the
   new non-military threat.},

Abstract = {The European Union is caught between technocracy and the politics of the
   exception, eroding in the process the very political sphere that makes
   democracy work. Partly a cause of this erosion and partly an effect, the
   EU retreats into the `rule of rules' when faced with what are, in fact,
   profoundly political problems. Whether it be in response to the eurozone
   crisis, EU-Russia-Ukraine relations or the influx of refugees, the EU's
   policies led to conflicts over geopolitics, sovereignty and
   redistribution. Its apolitical responses were as ubiquitous as they were
   inadequate. They reflect Germany's preference for consensual politics,
   which is paradoxically enforced by Angela Merkel's dictum about there
   being `no alternative'. In order to think of alternatives to the Europe
   that exists, we need to revive `the political', theorized by the likes
   of Carl Schmitt, Max Weber and Hannah Arendt at times when democracy was
   under duress.},

Title = {Managerial reforms as hinges between the state and professions},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},
Number = {135},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {For more than thirty years, managerial reforms have restructured the
   relationship between the state and professional groups. These reforms
   have been the subject of numerous works in the sociology of professions
   and the state; they describe their consequences on professional work and
   shed light on their genesis. However, the participation of professionals
   in the process of creating reforms represents a blind spot in this
   literature. Borrowing this notion from Andrew Abbott, this article seeks
   to consider managerial reforms as hinges between the state and the
   professions. This renewed perspective sheds new light on the role of
   professionals in the development of and debate around managerial
   reforms. It also sheds light on the plurality of forms of professional
   investment in managerial reforms.},

Abstract = {General social measures for the prevention of crimes against the
   environment, which include general processes of economic development,
   science, technology, which create the possibility and increase the
   effectiveness of special criminological measures and, in contrast, do
   not directly affect but indirectly the criminogenic environment,
   eliminating or neutralizing the common, most significant and common
   causes of behavior criminal in the field of ecology. The article
   analyzes Ukraine's experience in the field of preventing crimes against
   the environment. It also analyzes the measures taken in the country
   aimed at the prevention of environmental crimes. A documentary
   methodology close to content analysis was used. It is concluded that
   liability for environmental crimes is an important component of the
   legal provision of environmental management, the restoration of
   ecological objects and the protection of the environment. Legislation on
   criminal liability for violation of the right to use a natural object
   was developed within the framework of the general legal rules on
   liability for violation of environmental legislation.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a renaissance of conjoint survey designs within
   social science. To date, however, researchers have lacked guidance on
   how many attributes they can include within conjoint profiles before
   survey satisficing leads to unacceptable declines in response quality.
   This paper addresses that question using pre-registered, two-stage
   experiments examining choices among hypothetical candidates for US
   Senate or hotel rooms. In each experiment, we use the first stage to
   identify attributes which are perceived to be uncorrelated with the
   attribute of interest, so that their effects are not masked by those of
   the core attributes. In the second stage, we randomly assign respondents
   to conjoint designs with varying numbers of those filler attributes. We
   report the results of these experiments implemented via Amazon's
   Mechanical Turk and Survey Sampling International. They demonstrate that
   our core quantities of interest are generally stable, with relatively
   modest increases in survey satisficing when respondents face large
   numbers of attributes.},

Abstract = {Russia is still dealing with the legacy of widespread Soviet oppression.
   An important Rehabilitation Law adopted in 1991 established a
   compensation system for victims of state repression, including a right
   to housing in their families' pre-exile place of residence. However, the
   practical realization of these rights has been problematic, particularly
   following amendment to the 1991 Law in 2004. There is a cohort of
   elderly victims who as children were exiled with their parents. Three of
   these unsuccessfully brought claims for their promised housing and
   eventually appealed to the Constitutional Court of the Russian
   Federation. In December 2019, the Court issued a landmark ruling
   supporting the claimants. Here we explain the historical context and
   contemporary significance of this important constitutional case.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},

Volume = {73},
Number = {3},
Pages = {8-30},
Abstract = {Five years after the 2016 Referendum, the UK has formally exited the
   European Union, but Brexit is not over yet. This observation is the
   common thread to all contributions of this thematic dossier. The wide
   range of perspectives mobilized, from parliamentary studies to public
   policy analysis, is useful for revisiting the issues of democratic
   legitimacy linked to governance and public action. This introduction
   aims to present the different contributions and their added value in
   relation to a now prolific academic literature on Brexit. The common
   conceptual framework devised here refocuses the academic debate on
   dimensions still too often neglected. First, Brexit needs to be
   approached as a political and institutional process marked by types of
   turbulences - organizational, environmental and scale. Second, Brexit
   has consequences in terms of the legitimacy of British public action,
   which can be questioned through the categories of analysis devised by
   Vivien Schmidt. The articles show how the historic decision to leave the
   EU has destabilized actors and institutions, forcing them to readjust
   their rhetoric, priorities and modes of action - with varying degrees of
   success. Compared to the pre-Brexit period a relative stability seems to
   mark the temporary arrangements found.},

Abstract = {The New South Wales union movement embraced the principles of heritage
   and conservationism in the 1970s through the imposing of ``green
   bans{''} - a strategy wherein union members refused to work on
   construction projects that were a threat to the slate's natural or built
   environment. Led by radicals like Builders Labourers' Federation leader
   Jack Mundey, the green bans were seen in several sectors as a departure
   from the traditional ``Old Left priorities of securing workers' wages
   and conditions. Rather than a hard shift towards radicalism, this
   article proposes that the green bans were instead reflective of an
   already existing conservationist tradition in the New South Wales union
   movement. This reinterpretation is predicated on a content analysis of
   extant historical material such as contemporaneous news articles,
   personal memoirs, transcripts of political speeches and archival
   documents related to the policing of left-wing activism in the 1960s and
   1970s. The results show that an existing tradition of engagement with a
   broad spectrum of social issues in the New South Wales union movement
   predates the emergence of the New Left. including the commitment to
   environmental justice principles that underpinned the green bans.},

Abstract = {China's Internet governance is not immutable, nor is it dominated by the
   government, as portrayed by Western scholars. Based on an analysis of
   Beijing's Internet governance policies and practices, this paper focuses
   on the evolution of China's Internet governance from the
   non-governmental stage through the government control stage to the
   multi-actor coordination stage. In terms of governance paradigm,
   Beijing's Internet governance is transitioning from one-way management
   to multi-dimensional governance, from offline management to online and
   offline integration, and from ``prior control{''} to ``panoramic
   governance.{''} In terms of governance system, Beijing's Internet
   governance has evolved from an ad hoc pattern through problem-solving to
   a strategic planning paradigm. Internet governance in China has
   demonstrated three features, namely, pragmatism, state centralism, and
   preemption. These characteristics have paved the way for the rapid
   development of China's Internet but also present many challenges.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {There has long been concern over the power of the Canadian Prime
   Minister, particularly their ability to abuse the prerogative power to
   advise the dissolution, prorogation, or summoning of parliament. To
   address this problem, this paper argues for a strong interpretation of
   the Crown's right to refuse advice of First Ministers. This will be
   presented via Eugene Forsey's theory of parliamentary government, which
   conceives of the Governor General as the guardian of parliament and
   responsible government. Such a conception allows us to see how an
   empowered Governor General could serve as an effective check against the
   potential partisan misuse of the executive's prerogative powers.},

Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Oriented by the studies on governmentality, this paper analyzes the
   emergence of the Argentine soldiers buried in the Falklands as
   governmental problematization. In the first part we develop the WPR
   approach that interrogates the political proposals as discourses, based
   on the ways in which the problems are represented, that is, not taking
   politics as a sphere of resolution but of creating problems in order to
   make intelligible its space of action and government. In the second part
   we approach a series of policies texts produced between 1982 and 2015
   that focused on problematizing the status of the bodies interred in
   Malvinas, their identification, their relationship with sovereignty and
   simultaneously the possibility that their relatives can carry out the
   ritual of mourning. We concluded by showing that the way of presenting
   the problem of the dead and buried did not vary from the first military
   proposals, notwithstanding the stabilization of democracy.},

Abstract = {The text examines two critiques of the single-family home model in
   post-World War II North American suburbs. On the one hand, it
   investigates the struggles for wages for housework in order to highlight
   the critique of the processes of female subjectification that take place
   within the house walls. On the other, it analyses the critique of
   masculinity that emerges from the pages of Playboy and the Playboy
   Townhouse project. Finally, it uses these critiques to highlight the
   different ways in which the home can be seen as a place of work and a
   space open to the outside world.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain the political fact of the Spanish
   neoconservatives who, following the American neoconservatives, imported
   their doctrines on foreign policy, especially the Benevolent Hegemony
   theory that justifies by virtue of North American power and its
   democratic ideals: the subordination of the states Westerners to the
   United States. The article makes generic considerations about the
   neoconservative phenomenon in Spain. The main writings of the most
   recognized Spanish neoconservatives are studied, especially those
   related to the Iraq War His influence on public opinion and his critical
   opinions on Rodriguez Zapatero's Foreign Policy. The article ends by
   denying the opinion of renowned professors such as Celestino del Arenal,
   Jose Antonio Sanahuja and Manuel Iglesias Cavicchioli, who argue that
   the Spanish neoconservatives were responsible for the turn in foreign
   policy of Jose Maria Aznar in his second term between 2002 and 2004.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Pages = {311-342},
Abstract = {Rebels groups adopt different organisational structures, emerging in
   various shapes and sizes. Some rebel groups construct distinct military
   and political wings, delegating their military and political operations
   to specialised units. While recent studies have made great strides
   towards understanding militant groups' activities on and off the
   battlefield, the literature has been less attentive to the root causes
   of the structural arrangements which groups form for these purposes. I
   argue that rebel leaders' pre-war military and political experiences
   shape the structure of the organisations they lead into war. Using
   original data, I find that differences in leaders' pre-war military
   experience, rather than political experience, are associated with
   discernible probabilities of rebel operational specialisation. In
   addition to offering practitioners and academics a comparative framework
   with which to evaluate the patterns of militant leadership, this study
   demonstrates how leaders wield independent agency over group structure
   and operations in the civil war environment.},

Abstract = {The text reflects on the mechanisms of financing education provided by
   the private sector, presenting as a fundamental hypothesis the existence
   of an individual subjective right of all students to an equivalent
   financial benefit from the State. The assumption of the argument lies in
   the solidarity between State and Family and the duty to educate. Its
   first complementary hypothesis is that the State's exemption from
   providing financial assistance to students who join the private school
   system would imply an offense to equality. His second complementary
   hypothesis is that this financing can be better guaranteed by deducting
   the calculation base of Personal Income Tax. It uses the
   logicaldeductive method for the analysis of propositions, with the
   technique of legislative, documentary and bibliographic research. It
   concludes that the investigated proposition is in accordance with the
   protection of the individual subjective right and the principles that
   govern Brazilian taxation, in addition to constituting an efficient
   mechanism for stimulating social cohesion and the protection of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Parties in government prioritize issues that voters trust them to handle
   more than other parties. However, scholars disagree about whether this
   relationship exists because parties strategically prioritize issues that
   voters trust them to handle or whether voters first observe core party
   priorities while in government and then trust them to handle those
   issues. This article disentangles these two explanations, arguing that
   issue ownership is caused by the core priorities of elites. I evaluate
   this argument by leveraging the privately financed structure of US
   party-aligned think tanks, which provide important policy information to
   US political parties. I introduce new data on the policy content of
   15,897 white papers published by the leading party-aligned think tanks
   in the United States. I find that think tanks aligned with both parties
   tend to distribute more policy attention to their owned issues, although
   the process works differently for Republicans and Democrats, and that
   these patterns are durable. I conclude that these results are strong
   evidence to support elite prioritization explanations for issue
   ownership, although they do not rule out other explanations.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on redefining the social genesis of ressentiment.
   The concept of ressentiment, widely used today in the form shaped by
   Friedrich Nietzsche and fine-grained by Max Scheler, turns out to be
   both overly and insufficiently connected to the social structure of the
   societies, for the analysis of which it is used. The reason is that
   although Nietzsche's and Scheler's ideas about ressentiment refer to the
   socio-structural aspects of its genesis, they do so in a contradictory
   and incorrect manner. Without noticing their own contradictions, both
   thinkers elevate genesis of ressentiment to the moral standards of the
   lower classes. Using the examples of younger heirs and bastards of the
   medieval aristocratic families, as well as the examples of other
   relatively privileged social groups, the author shows that one should
   rather seek the genesis of ressentiment within higher social strata. At
   the same time, the author shows that the moral feelings and behavioral
   strategies germane to ressentiment can be adopted and are adopted by
   representatives of other classes. In this form, it attracts attention in
   times when the oppressed classes obtain real opportunities to change
   their position, or, at the very least, they receive reasons to believe
   that they could achieve more if such an opportunity had been given to
   them.},

Title = {Do Newspapers Benefit Incumbents? Evidence from Denmark 1849-1915},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {505-532},
Abstract = {Scholars have long been interested in how the media shapes electoral
   accountability, but most of the existing empirical evidence suffers from
   endogeneity issues. Exploiting the inflow of newspapers engendered by
   the abolition of censorship in Denmark, this paper studies how
   newspapers affect the advantages enjoyed by members of parliament. I
   collect a new dataset on parliamentary candidates (1849-1915) and link
   them to the complete universe of local Danish newspapers, as well as
   candidate-level information on news coverage obtained from a database of
   scanned newspaper pages. Employing a series of difference-in-differences
   and regression-discontinuity designs, I document three main findings.
   First, office holders enjoy privileged access to local press coverage.
   Second, the entry of local newspapers leads to an increase in reelection
   rates. Third, the benefits enjoyed by incumbents are most pronounced
   when MPs and newspaper editors are affiliated with the same political
   party. Taken together, these findings could suggest that office holders
   in low-information environments benefit more directly from the presence
   of local media than previously assumed.},

Abstract = {Amongst Aristotle's foundations of political science, methodology stands
   out for its particular relevance. One of his methodological
   considerations can be found in a brief passage at the beginning of
   Politics' book VI. Political science is presented as a practical science
   dominated by a theoretical tension. Our analysis focus on this
   constitutive tension and goes further on the four main statemens of the
   fragment. These statements resume the political knowledge until
   Aristotle contributions and anticipate the realistic-descriptive
   orientations of modern political thinking. This fragment shows a
   stunning insight on the political science field and an analitical
   ability that perdures over the centuries.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Number = {10-12},
Pages = {243+},
Abstract = {The EU and the United States have imposed sanctions, economic and
   financial, on authoritarian or dictatorial regimes in Russia, Belarus,
   Iran, and North Korea. The purpose of these sanctions is to punish and
   prevent violations of peace and international law, as well as domestic
   repression and human rights violations. Sanctions research is divided
   over the question whether economic sanctions are an appropriate means to
   these ends. The prevailing opinion is that sanctions are
   counterproductive. They give regimes an economic, political, and
   power-sociological pretext for intensifying domestic repression. But
   there is no proof.},

Abstract = {Inequality is unevenly distributed across the territory and national
   averages obscure this variation. This study investigates which
   subnational level factors can help explain differences in inequality
   among districts. It analyzes how subnational coalitions resist or
   support national governments' redistributive policies. The main argument
   is that the type of national governing alliance (regressive or
   progressive) affects the level of provincial inequality, but mediated by
   the type of subnational coalition that supports or resists that national
   policy. This work empirically examines this claim analyzing the
   configurations of the national and subnational distributive alliances in
   two Argentine provinces and in relation to labor rights regulations in
   the agricultural sector between 2003 and 2015.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the sustained growth of the
   state sector in the Chinese economy shows that Chinese model is very
   different from state capitalism, even more from liberal capitalism. In
   our view, China's market socialist system can be interpreted as
   classified as a ``New Socioeconomic Formation{''} (NSEF). The most
   important attribute of the NSEF is complexity, as it is marked by the
   coexistence of different modes of production. China's market socialism
   is still in its embryonic stage, and is governed by an ever-evolving
   combination of different modes and relations of production. In this
   framework, some basic laws of motion of China's socialist market economy
   can be identified.},

   Reply to Pedro Rey-Araujo},
Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {154-161},
Abstract = {This reply to Pedro Rey-Araujo's essay ``Ernesto Laclau's Oblivion of
   Political Economy{''} appreciates the importance of Rey-Araujo's attempt
   to situate political strategy at the core of post-Marxist discourse
   theory (PDT) but finds several problems with the execution of this move.
   First, Rey-Araujo sets out to resolve PDT's so-called ``institutional
   deficit{''} but overlooks the existence of a substantial literature
   tackling this issue. Second, Rey-Araujo's treatment divorces
   institutions from the hegemonic logics that play out within their
   confines. This ontological dualism negates the crucial insight that PDT
   brings to institutional research, notably that institutions are
   fundamentally discursive in nature and cannot be separated from the
   political processes that constitute them. Finally, this ontological
   dualism unduly limits the scope for strategic reflection through PDT. In
   postulating the inherently capitalist nature of the institutions within
   which hegemonic struggles play out, several potential political
   strategies are foreclosed.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on Turkey as a rising drone power in the
   international arena in recent years. In this context, the article will
   scrutinize the case of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which broke out
   on September 27, 2020. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, one of the frozen
   problems in the Caucasus region, was ended in favor of Azerbaijan less
   than two months later. Turkey took on a game-changing role in the region
   by supplying its ally Azerbaijan with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   for use in the conflict, and significantly contributed to Azerbaijan's
   victory. Turkey's political, diplomatic, and military contributions to
   Azerbaijan will likely be discussed on the global agenda for years to
   come; this study will contribute to the literature on the role and
   impact of Turkey's military support, especially its drones, on
   Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh victory.},

Abstract = {Czech society is considered the most secular in Europe. However, a look
   at the thousand-year history of religion in Bohemia and its
   interpretation in the 200-year history of the modern Czech nation
   reveals that the religious orientation towards West and East, struggles
   between confessions, and the conflict-ridden intertwining of political
   and religious power have shaped politics and society in the Czech
   Republic to this day. The dispute over the restitution of church
   property provided an example of Czech society's distrust of the Catholic
   Church, which is still the country's largest confession. At the same
   time, leading politicians of all stripes, with the support of church
   dignitaries, are today invoking alleged ``Christian values{''} that must
   be defended against the corrupting influences of the globalized world.},

Title = {Reassessing the gap-hypothesis: Tough talk and weak action in migration
   policy?},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {174-186},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on migration policy has proclaimed a gap between
   what parties say and what parties do. The ``gap-hypothesis{''} expects
   political parties to deliver ``tough talk{''} and ``weak action{''} on
   the issue of migration. This article tests this idea empirically by
   asking whether political parties keep their electoral promises on
   migration policy. The analysis of governments across 18 West European
   countries between 1980 and 2014 makes use of a new cabinet-based data
   set of migration policy outputs and two different data sets measuring
   parties' preferences on migration. The results show that governing
   parties enact systematically more liberal policies on immigration and
   integration than their electoral manifestos would suggest. The purported
   democratic deficit in migration policy is substantially the result of a
   limited fulfillment of the electoral mandate by governing parties.
   Nevertheless, governing parties act upon their electoral mandate
   dependent on the governing constraints and the electoral incentives.
   Overall, governments tend to deliver on their integration policy
   positions but not on their immigration policy positions. The
   manifesto-policy link is stronger in the domestic policy dimension where
   governments face fewer external constraints.},

Abstract = {What leads elites to break their democratic commitments? How do the
   partisan loyalties and democratic values of citizens influence these
   choices? This article formally analyzes incumbent abuse in democracies,
   the most common modern initiator of democratic breakdown. If an
   incumbent attempts to consolidate power, the opposition can try to rally
   protest but can also cry wolf without incumbent abuse. In a democratic
   equilibrium, incumbents avoid abuse, the opposition calls for protest if
   and only if abuse occurs, and citizens protest in sufficient numbers to
   deter elites. Results show that non-winner-take-all institutions, high
   media accuracy, low partisanship, and citizen support for democracy
   typically promote democratic survival. However, under some conditions,
   higher democracy support can threaten democracy. Model extensions allow
   incumbents to pursue democratic erosion instead of full breakdown,
   promote ``fake news,{''} and strategically inflame partisanship. The
   article explores several implications for democratic survival and
   incumbent strategies for subverting it.},

Abstract = {This article refers to the topic of parliamentary elections in Poland.
   The authors maintain the hypothesis that more and less stable regional
   clusters of electoral behavior, which undergo some changes over time,
   exist in Poland. The study traces a pattern between the formation of
   regional clusters and a number of factors, such as their proximity to
   the borders of other states, ideological orientation of the party
   programs, the traditions of political culture that have developed in the
   regions and the division of regions into urban and rural. The study uses
   Moran's index to describe the neighborhood effect. Local clusters of
   spatial association were calculated by means of local Moran's index.
   Maps of cluster locations were constructed on the basis of the results
   of the 2007-2019 parliamentary elections. This allowed us to consider
   their spatial changes in perspective. The novelty of the work consists
   in use of the mathematical method of spatial autocorrelation in
   electoral study and consideration of the results both from the point of
   view of the percentage ratio and neighborhood index. It was concluded
   that some regional clusters remain stable throughout four electoral
   cycles, however, they undergo minor changes. Most of these clusters are
   located in rural areas. As a rule, cities are not included in stable
   clusters, they form separate centers, distinguished by the variety of
   the electoral preferences of citizens. The four analyzed electoral
   cycles show a tendency of reduction of the spatial dependence between
   the results of voting in constituencies and stability of regional
   clusters in Poland.},

Abstract = {Recent research demonstrates that the salience of EU affairs in domestic
   parliaments is mainly driven by government parties. This has been
   interpreted as illustrating the so-called opposition deficit thesis and
   mainly explained considering governments' informational advantages and
   reporting duties. Drawing on a dataset on oral questions introduced in
   plenary meetings in the Spanish parliament, this article sheds new light
   on government and opposition MPs' incentives to raise attention to the
   EU. Results show that in Spain, where there is no party conflict on
   European integration, government MPs pay attention to EU affairs
   following credit-claiming strategies. These strategies are likely in the
   context of EU events and when the perceived benefits of integration are
   high, and unlikely under critical junctures, when the EU cannot be
   framed as a governmental success. Opposition MPs pay less attention to
   EU affairs but they still use the EU to give visibility to issues that
   are of interest to their voters.},

Abstract = {The essay criticises legal `Westernism', and challenges the
   universalistic approach to public/constitutional law based on
   fundamental/human rights. To this extent, it highlights how
   globalisation harshly confronts social, cultural, political, economic,
   and legal pluralism. After analysing common elements among different
   cultures and traditions, it suggests an alternative
   constitutional/transnational ``hard core{''}. The proposed new
   ``hard-core{''} focuses on different values, i.e. community, solidarity,
   and fraternite as the funding elements of Western, as well as Eastern
   and Southern, legal traditions. In so doing, the essay rejects the
   `orientalist' approach based on an allegedly Western Grundnorm, and
   avoids the theoretical -and potentially pragmatic- imperialism of
   fundamental/human rights and dignity.},

Abstract = {Sanctions have proven to be unsuccessful means of stopping global energy
   flow. In the 20th century, this also applied to the cross-border trade
   in Soviet fossil fuels that were in great demand on the world market.
   During the Cold War, Western embargoes served little purpose, because
   the West Europeans had a far greater interest in importing raw materials
   and expanding trade relations with the socialist ``Eastern bloc{''} than
   the Americans. Transatlantic divergences in dealing with the Soviet
   Union were already noticeable in the NATO pipe embargo in 1962. In
   1981/1982, they were expressed even more clearly in the fierce
   American-West European dispute over the construction of the first gas
   export pipeline from Siberia to Europe.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article was to identify the characteristics of
   crime investigation in the action of provoking someone's suicide on the
   Internet, identifying the main problems, characteristics of the
   investigation and prospects for improvement of the crime investigation
   methodology. For the development of the article the following methods
   were used to meet the objectives: comparative legal method, historical
   and comparative methods, which made it possible to analyze the state,
   problems, and prospects for the development of Ukrainian legislation in
   the field of liability for causing someone to commit suicide. The
   article also involves the method of systematization, which provided the
   opportunity to study the genesis and changes in the legislation that
   regulates the matter. It was concluded that there was a lack of good
   practices and an effective system for investigating Internet crimes, due
   to the peculiarities of the development and use of the Internet, as well
   as rapid technological advancement. Comparing the experience of the EU
   and the US, it was determined that preventive and educational functions
   are the main ones in this area, helping to prevent relevant crimes.},

Abstract = {Judicial practice shows that the request of all lawyers is not answered,
   so the study of the role of the application is relevant. The objective
   of the research was to carry out a theoretical and legal analysis of the
   role of the lawyer's request in the field of the defense of human rights
   due to the peculiarities of its normative support as a means of legal
   communication. The following methods were used: direct observation;
   comparison method; analysis of the content of the documents governing
   the procedure for giving and receiving a response to a lawyer's request.
   Documents and normative-legal programs that regulate the order and
   peculiarities of the legal work of lawyers and their requests were
   identified. The article also examines the legal practice of using
   applications and analyzes the activity of lawyers to ensure the role of
   the application as an effective means of legal communication. It was
   found that, in Ukraine, the application practice itself remains an
   ineffective means of legal communication. However, the attorney does not
   always collect the information and documents necessary for the defense
   in due time.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to study European integration and the
   expansion of the European union together with the Atlantic alliance
   during George W. Bush's second term (2004-2008), for which the
   historical method was used. Despite the tendency that most researchers
   in the field of modern history and political science tend to focus on
   current events, and according to this logic it would be more appropriate
   to analyze Trump's foreign policy, in order to better understand the
   contemporary tension between the EU and the United States, today it is
   imperative to take a look at some contemporary historical processes. It
   is concluded that, to which George W. Bush's rhetoric has much in common
   with Donald Trump, he also laid the groundwork for change in U.S.
   foreign policy during Barack Obama's presidential term (2008-2016). The
   one-sided approach promoted primarily during George W. Bush's first term
   went from a gradual transformation of coalition building and the full
   support of the Atlantic alliance allies for the operation in Afghanistan
   in 2001, to more controversial rhetoric about ``rebel states.{''}},

Title = {RESETTING BILLS: DISCONTINUITY AS A POLITICAL TECHNOLOGY FOR BLOCKING
   POLICY DECISION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {176-191},
Abstract = {The article deals with discontinuity procedure as a political technology
   used to reject legislative initiatives in case a Parliament has not
   adopted a public political decision in a scheduled time. Complementary
   veto players theory by George Tsebelis is used in this article. In
   particular, the authors set out to study not only institutional and
   partisan veto players, but also the other participants in the
   legislative process: veto actors (in other words, ``gatekeepers{''}).
   The authors create a concept of ``veto-technologies{''}, enabling the
   expansion of the analytical potential of the theory through studying
   specific initiative-blocking technologies such as discontinuity. In this
   article, we review studies on the discontinuity of political science,
   the features of its influence on the parliamentary agenda, and the
   timing of legislative initiatives. During the study on the use of
   discontinuity in fourteen countries, the authors identified universal
   procedural characteristics that determine the configuration and
   significance of this technology in the legislative process: the
   effective period (session, convocation, calendar year); the conditions
   under which discontinuity is not applied; the document that consolidates
   the discontinuing procedure. The authors also offer an analysis of this
   theory's application in the Russian Empire. The possibilities of
   applying discontinuity in modern Russia are considered in three
   dimensions in which the Government works with the State Duma:
   institutional, partisan, and positional. In the meantime, the procedure
   can be established through the amendments to the Regulations of the
   lower house. This obviates the need to coordinate such a decision with
   other institutional veto players. Discontinuity in perspective can help
   eliminate the political risks of making unpopular domestic and foreign
   policy decisions and, as a result, strengthen Parliament's position in
   relations with the other public authorities. Adverse effects of the
   introduction of discontinuity may be the further development of
   non-public and informal procedures to negotiate the positions of
   stakeholders, as well as a decrease in the political weight of ordinary
   deputies in comparison with veto-actors setting the parliamentary
   agenda.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-279},
Abstract = {Ranked choice voting (RCV) is experiencing a surge of interest in the
   United States, highlighted by its 2018 use for Congressional elections
   in Maine, the first application of a ranked ballot for national-level
   elections in American history. A century ago, the same system was
   introduced in another federal, two-party continental-sized democracy:
   Australia. RCV's utility as a solution to inter-party coordination
   problems helps to explain its appeal in both countries, underscoring the
   potential benefits of a comparative analytical approach. This article
   examines this history of adoption and then turns to a comparison of
   recent RCV elections in Maine with state elections in New South Wales
   and Queensland, the two Australian states which share the same form of
   RCV as that used in the United States. This comparison shows how
   candidate and party endorsements influence voters' rankings and can,
   over time, promote reciprocal exchanges between parties and broader
   systemic support for RCV. Such cross-partisan support helps explain the
   stability of RCV in Australia, with implications for the system's
   prospects in the United States.},

   REALITIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {14-25},
Abstract = {This article develops the concept introduced in The Modern World Order:
   Structural Realities and Great Power Rivalries (Polis. Political
   Studies. 2021. No. 3). The core structural element of the current world
   is defined as a mismatch between material globalization and ideational
   universalism-the former continuing its ascendance while the latter
   declines. The material interdependence of actors who are ideationally
   divergent leads to conflictual relations that are not well explained
   within realist or liberal narratives of International Relations. These
   realities are not simply transitional, on the way to a new world order,
   but are sustainable, and taken together constitute the current world
   order, with its extremely high risks of international conflict. Hence,
   new approaches are needed for the stabilization of the international
   system. This article offers a new interpretation of the civilizational
   approach. While the very notion of civilizations is vague and debatable,
   the authors outline key features of civilizations that fit the
   contemporary structural realities. The authors conclude that
   ideationally resilient civilizations, nearly irrelevant and indifferent
   to each other, can stay materially interconnected without inclination
   for securitization of various agendas of their relations.},

Abstract = {Nicaraguan Augusto C. Sandino was one of the most important
   anti-imperialist leaders of the 20th century. From 1926 he led a
   campaign against the American presence in his country until 1933, when
   he succeeded in expelling the Marines from it. His political thought,
   exposed in a fragmentary way in hundreds of letters, communiques,
   speeches, war reports, etc., has an anti-imperialist matrix that
   revolves around the need for unity of the ``Latin American
   Nationality{''} to defeat the Northern enemy. This is the main meaning
   of the two documents collected here: to urge Latin American rulers to
   reject the Monroe doctrine, to organize politically, to integrate as a
   political community in the wake of Simon Bolivar, and to defend Latin
   American sovereignty and independence.},

Abstract = {A familiar framework for interpreting the politics of presidential
   nomination, built on an accumulating body of social science research
   plus the extended observations of experienced commentators, received
   remarkably little use in the day-to-day reportage of the Democratic and
   Republican contests of 2016 and 2020 as they unfolded. So this paper
   begins by sketching out the factional structure of themodern Democratic
   and Republican parties, along with the bandwagon dynamic that
   recurrently resolves their factional disputes. It then applies these
   foundational interpretive factors to the two most recent pairs of
   nominating contests. What results are four orthodox and recurrent
   stories that stand in sharp contrast to media narratives that were all
   too frequently a mix of incomplete basic understandings plus wildly
   overemphasized idiosyncrasies.},

Abstract = {The work that we have the honour to present here in its first Italian
   translation is a short essay published by Carl Schmitt in the first half
   of the `10s in the German Journal Die Rheinlande and titled Don Quixote
   and the public (1912). A very brief but at the same time dense piece of
   literary criticism in which the future Kronjurist of the Third Reich, in
   those years still engaged in his legal practice, offers to the readers a
   juvenile proof of his vastly and hetero-geneous interests, trying to
   determine which is the proper interpretation of the renowned masterpiece
   of Miguel de Cervantes: Don Quixote of the Mancha. A juvenile work,
   therefore, in which Schmitt, as we will try to highlight in the
   introduction that accompanies the translation, offers an interpretation
   of the novel and particularly of its main character focusing on the
   contraposition between the level of the simple reading and that of
   erudite valorisation, applying a methodology similar to that he used in
   the coeval Law and Judgement (1912) that in some ways anticipate the
   critique of Romanticism that he will develop just a few years later in
   Political Romanticism (1919).},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {176-186},
Abstract = {The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the importance of
   technology as a pillar for the implementation of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). Technology innovation promises benefits
   especially for the implementation of SDG 2 to end hunger, achieve food
   security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.
   Contributing to current debates on SDG implementation, technology
   innovation, and cross-sectoral governance, we argue that technology
   innovation carries both the potential to contribute to global goal
   implementation and the risk of posing new governance challenges.
   Applying a food-water-technology nexus (FWTN) perspective, we conduct a
   case study on an emerging technology in urban agricultural production in
   Germany. The technology connects the wastewater treatment system and the
   agricultural production system and projects the transformation of a
   conventional sewage treatment plant into a `NEWtrient (R)-Center', which
   draws the essential resources for urban hydroponic plant cultivation
   from municipal wastewater. Building on qualitative and participatory
   research methods, the study provides deeper insights into the governance
   implications of FWTN issues stemming from the emerging technology. The
   analysis shows that this technology has the potential to facilitate SDG
   implementation, but simultaneously fuels new sector interlinkages
   between water and food and policy demands that substantiate the need for
   more integrated policymaking to ensure the smart use of technology to
   reach the SDGs.},

Abstract = {In the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, intellectual
   movements and trends of all kinds (socialism, anarchism,
   regenerationism, spiritualism, krausopositivism, etc.) converged in
   Europe, together with artistic trends such as aestheticism, decadentism,
   symbolism, literary modernism, expressionism, etc., as a reflection of
   the spiritual state of the time, with an anti-bourgeois and profoundly
   anti-positivist attitude. This intellectual and cultural hatching is
   known under the expression ``fin de siecle{''} and is associated with
   the aesthetic currents, influenced by the Nietzschean philosophy, which
   will be grouped under the expression ``art noveau{''}; diverse currents
   among themselves but coinciding in their discriminatory attitude towards
   women. In this paper we analyze their influence on the birth of a new
   feminine stereotype, linked to a particularly ominous and exaggerated
   image of evil, which will end up populating through the artistic and
   literary bohemia of the time the aesthetic imaginary of the twentieth
   century. Now the rejection of the new woman takes place in the field of
   image and words.},

Title = {DONALD TRUMP AND ``NEW POPULISM{''} IN AMERICA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {5},
Pages = {176-183},
Abstract = {The emergence of Donald Trump in American political life was an
   unpleasant surprise for the mainstream elite, even though it could have
   been predicted. Unresolved domestic problems had been steadily growing
   and aggravating. The political elite, expert community, and mass media
   had already started an anti-Trump campaign in 2016 that turned into
   political war. Its peak happened in November 2019 when procedure of
   impeachment was initiated in the House of Representatives, and was
   continued in 2021 after Trump left office. The collective monograph
   ``Trump Phenomenon{''}, prepared in INION RAS by a group of well-known
   specialists in American and international studies, and edited by A.
   Kuznetsov, a well-known Russian scholar and member correspondent of the
   Russian academy of sciences, presents a profound inter-disciplinary
   analysis of contemporary America (7 parts, 37 chapters). The United
   States remains a superpower, and its global offensive policy exerts
   visible influence on the course of world development and world order
   formation. The authors analyze the domestic and foreign policies of the
   United States during the Trump administration, the social and economic
   situation, aspects of American political culture, the phenomenon of new
   populism, and Trump as its manifestation. Debates about Trump will
   continue. Questions of primary interest are: ``How could it happen that
   a non-systemic candidate emerged in presidential elections and won them
   with the support of practically 50\% of Americans?{''}; ``Why did the
   mainstream American liberal elite react so outrageously to the results
   of the elections?{''}; ``Will political crises continue, and what impact
   could it have on relations with Russia?{''}. Answers to these important
   questions, and many other questions related to them, can be found in the
   book.},

Abstract = {What was the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
   in the Brexit saga? And what will the impact of Brexit be over the
   future structure and activity of the CJEU? This article deals with this
   twofold question and explores three different issues. Firstly, we will
   offer a reflection on the questions and the risks raised by the Wightman
   case, where the CJEU ruled on the unilateral revocation of the UK
   notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union under
   Art. 50 Treaty of the EU. Secondly, we will analyse the impact of Brexit
   on the composition of the CJEU and, particularly, the risks for the
   independence of the Court raised by the advanced termination of the
   mandate of the British Advocate General. Thirdly, we will provide some
   insights on the scope of the jurisdiction of the CJEU in the post-Brexit
   Union, emphasising how the Withdrawal Agreement maintained its
   jurisdiction during and even beyond the transition period. This article
   reflects the events that took place up to 6 October 2020.},

Title = {Carbon Ruins: Engaging with Post-Fossil Transitions through
   Participatory World-Building},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {87-99},
Abstract = {While many pathways to post-fossil futures have been articulated, most
   fail to engage people in imagining themselves as being part of those
   futures and involved in the transition. Following recent calls for more
   immersive experiences, the 2019 initiative ``Carbon Ruins-An Exhibition
   of the Fossil Era{''} (Carbon Ruins) is a performance set around a
   historical museum from the future, which uses recognisable, culturally
   powerful physical objects to bridge the gap between abstract scenarios
   and everyday experiences. Through its physical presence and extensive
   media coverage, Carbon Ruins struck a chord with scientists, activists,
   creative professionals, policy makers, civil society organisations, and
   the general public. Like other imaginary worlds, Carbon Ruins is not
   finished. It is an open-ended process of narrating, imagining, and
   representing (the transition to) a post-fossil future. In this article
   we reflect upon Carbon Ruins as a participatory form of world-building
   that allows for new ways of knowing, and new ways of being, in relation
   to post-fossil transitions. We discern three different kinds of
   authorship that were taken on by participants: as originators, dwellers,
   and explorers. While the originator makes the future world a
   recognisable place, the dweller can engage active hope in place of a
   passive sense of urgency, and the explorer can transform resignation
   into commitment, with a fresh determination to leave the fossil era
   behind. Situating Carbon Ruins within a critical political tradition, we
   find post-fossil world-building to be a form of critique that
   destabilises accustomed ways of thinking and opens up new fields of
   experience that allows things to be done differently.},

   complex and collaborative undertaking that deserves to be acknowledged
   in full. The Carbon Ruins exhibition is the result of several
   initiatives at Lund University, Sweden (LU), most notably the Narrating
   Climate Futures initiative (funded by the LU ViceChancellor), the
   Climaginaries project (funded by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS),
   and the think tank LU Futura (funded by the LU Vice-Chancellor). The
   core group who crafted the exhibition included Ludwig Bengtsson Sonesson
   (LU Sustainability Forum), Roger Hildingsson, Sylvia Lysko, Johannes
   Stripple (Department of Political Science, LU), Caroline Martensson
   (independent artist), and Alexandra Nikoleris (Department of Technology
   and Society, LU). Karl Holmberg and Paul Graham Raven (Department of
   Political Science, LU) deserves special mention, as does Valentin Vogl
   (Department of Technology and Society, LU), for extensive participation
   in storycrafting and initial worldbuilding. The guided tours and the
   participatory workshops were convened by Ludwig, Roger, Alexandra,
   Johannes, and Anna Romeling. We are immensely thankful for all the
   creative work that members of the abovementioned initiatives and
   projects, and research colleagues and practitioners in the expert
   workshops, put into crafting the stories, characters, and events which
   make up the Carbon Ruins storyworld. We also thank all visitors who have
   engaged with and helped develop this world even further. Finally, we are
   grateful for valuable comments by two anonymous reviewers, as well as
   our copy editor Katrina Zaat, who not only improved the language of our
   manuscript but also challenged some of our ideas. Read more about Carbon

Abstract = {Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for
   public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern
   differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and
   managerial expertise, businesspeople in office adopt policies favorable
   to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test
   these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and
   legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal
   budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression
   discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase
   expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education
   spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure
   brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term
   accumulation of human capital. Businesspeople also do not reduce budget
   deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting
   contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all,
   businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business,
   rather than like a business.},

Abstract = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar are similar in many aspects,
   including social structure, political life, and religious identity.
   However, there exists a considerable difference in their foreign
   policies toward one of the most important regional non-state actors, the
   Muslim Brotherhood. Since its independence in 1971, Qatar has developed
   strong relations with the Muslim Brotherhood organization. On the other
   hand, some of the Gulf countries, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and
   Bahrain, have remained skeptical toward having good relations with the
   movement. Particularly, after the Arab revolutions of 2011, the Emirati
   leadership pursued an anti-Muslim Brotherhood policy together with other
   regional allies. During this period, Qatar was under severe criticism as
   a consequence of its support for the Muslim Brotherhood movement. This
   distinction might be observed comprehensively in practice, yet it has
   not been adequately examined in a historical and ideological context.
   There is a lack of studies on the core determinants of Qatar and the
   UAE's policy toward the Muslim Brotherhood. In light of this gap in
   literature, this work seeks to clarify why these two countries have such
   diverging policies toward the movement. Therefore, this study focuses on
   how the policies of Qatar and the UAE toward the Muslim Brotherhood
   diverged significantly, particularly in the past two decades.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to analyze the main international
   regulations on overcoming corruption in the police, as well as the laws
   of Ukraine aimed at combating this phenomenon in the National Police.
   The theme of the study is the analysis of the legal framework for
   combating corruption in the police. The research methodology includes
   the following general and special legal methods: dialectical, logical,
   system-legal, normative-dogmatic, comparative-legal, and legal modeling
   method. The results of the investigation indicate the most effective
   means of combating corruption in the police of the most developed
   countries. By way of conclusion and with practical significance,
   Ukrainian anti-corruption legislation against police officers has been
   shown to be repressive, so it cannot be effective without measures to
   encourage law-abiding behaviour and the sense of anti-corruption of law
   enforcement officers. Emphasis is placed on the need to take measures to
   encourage the anti-corruption behaviour of police officers and to
   enshrine these provisions in relevant regulations.},

Abstract = {China's rise is ushering in a new era of geostrategic contestation
   involving foreign aid. In many traditional OECD donors, aid policy is
   changing as a result. We report on a survey experiment studying the
   impacts of rising Chinese aid on public opinion in traditional donors.
   We randomly treated people with vignettes emphasising China's rise as an
   aid donor in the Pacific, a region of substantial geostrategic
   competition. We used a large, nationally-representative sample of
   Australians (Australia is the largest donor to the Pacific). As
   expected, treating participants reduced hostility to aid and increased
   support for more aid focused on the Pacific. Counter to expectations,
   however, treatment reduced support for using aid to advance Australian
   interests. These findings were largely replicated in a separate
   experiment in New Zealand. Knowledge of Chinese competition changes
   support for aid, but it does not increase support for using aid as a
   tool of geostrategy.},

Title = {MIRACLE AS THEOLOGICAL PARADIGM OF SOVEREIGN POWER},

Abstract = {The article justifies the approach to the essence of sovereign power
   from the point of view of the Western Christian theological paradigm. In
   this regard, the author considers the ``miraculous{''} aspect of the
   power of the sovereign, derived from the idea of the absolute power of
   God, whose volitional decision is capable of limiting/suspending the
   operation of natural laws in the manifested form of a miracle. In the
   most general sense, a miracle is understood as a divine act that is
   extraordinary (exceptional) in nature, an act that interrupts the usual
   phenomenological series, proclaims the will of God and has the property
   of ``salvation{''}. Thus, the theological concept of a miracle turns out
   to be a paradigm of secular sovereign power, based on the exclusive
   right to decide on a state of emergency. The concept of sovereignty,
   which includes the notion of the absoluteness and indivisibility of the
   supreme power, has a theological origin, since absolute power can only
   be an attribute of an absolute being, that is, God. The secularization
   and politicization of theological concepts build sovereign power on the
   basis of the equality between the sovereign and God, giving the state
   ruler the place that God occupied in the universe. The personified image
   of the sovereign represents a logically necessary completion of the
   hierarchical system of power. The transformation of the monarchic
   principle of sovereign power into the people's democratic one leads to
   the formation of an administrative-bureaucratic state, where the
   criterion of sovereignty is not legitimacy, but the effectiveness of
   managerial actions, which involves the permanent use of emergency
   measures. The ``salvation{''} of God's miraculous actions finds its
   manifestation in the ``salvific{''} purpose of emergency measures aimed
   at ensuring public safety by preventing fictitious threats. The
   totalization of the threat establishes a mode of functioning of the
   sovereign power, which within an exception to the law ({''}a
   miracle{''}) becomes equal to the law.},

Abstract = {We examine the role of societal modernization and women's political
   empowerment in generating support for women politicians amongst
   citizens. Using a global analysis of 116 countries with a new dataset of
   micro- and macro-level longitudinal data, we show that societal
   modernization and women's political empowerment only have positive
   effects on support for women in politics when the other is also present.
   For citizens who experienced either societal modernization or women's
   political empowerment, but not both, we do not see this positive
   relationship. Crucially, these patterns hold when analysing the current
   social and political context, as well as the context experienced by
   citizens during their formative years. We argue that both social and
   political changes are required to develop supportive attitudes towards
   women in politics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Unobserved heterogeneity is ubiquitous in empirical research. In this
   article, I propose a method for estimating binary outcome models with
   panel data in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, called the
   Penalized Flexible Correlated Random Effects (PF-CRE) estimator. I show
   that this estimator produces consistent and efficient estimates of the
   model parameters. PF-CRE also provides consistent estimates of partial
   effects, which cannot be calculated with existing consistent estimators.
   Using Monte Carlo simulations, I show that PF-CRE performs well in
   finite samples. I also illustrate the performance of PF-CRE in two
   real-data applications: a small T study on party contacts and tactical
   voting during the 2015 UK general election and a large T panel dealing
   with the effect of economic sanctions on government stability. In both
   cases I find that PF-CRE is a valid approach that reduces bias or
   generates efficiency gains in the estimation.},

Abstract = {Following a series of deadly attacks, and increasingly in recent years,
   incels have entered not only the public lexicon but also piqued
   scholarly interest, especially in terrorism research and programmes
   aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE). However, much of the
   current analyses largely interpret incel communities as homogenous, and
   in doing so ignore the complex and often contradictory nature of incel
   communities. CVE recommendations made by these scholars are often
   founded on misconceptions of incel identity and community. Through a
   critical feminist lens, in this article we argue that the focus on
   incels should seek to understand the role of male supremacy,
   antifeminism, and misogyny in society. Additionally, we argue against
   the trend of attempting to classify and securitise incels as a unique
   form of misogynistic violence, and identify the dangers of a lack of
   focus on male supremacy.},

Abstract = {Conservative women in US state legislatures outpace their male
   colleagues in introducing anti-abortion policies. In doing so, they
   often frame anti-abortion policy standpoints in feminist terms. They
   assert abortion physically and emotionally damages women, and abortion
   providers fail to inform women. By centering women's welfare,
   conservative women seek to enhance their representation, and wrest the
   mantle of being ``pro-woman{''} from feminists. In this article, I
   analyse the use of feminist framing of anti-abortion bills by
   conservative women representatives. Their words signify a rise in the
   cooption of feminist language by conservative women and challenge the
   notion of representation.},

Abstract = {The following contribution sheds light on the norms at stake when it
   comes to international cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI).
   International cooperation on AI involves two conceptual pillars:
   international regulation and global diffusion of AI-powered
   technologies. While the international regulatory discourse is concerned
   with establishing frameworks for minimizing and mitigating negative
   consequences of AI development and deployment, the global diffusion of
   AI technologies presents global policy makers with an ethical dilemma.
   AI represents an important tool to realize social development, but also
   an instrument that can amplify pre-existing norm violations. Based on an
   analysis of the moral dilemmas posed by international cooperation on AI,
   the authors advocate focusing on the avoidance of complicity in human
   rights violations while maintaining technology transfer of AI solutions
   critical for human development.},

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In open-list proportional representation systems, choosing candidates
   based on issue proximity can improve policy congruence. However, in
   practice, voters may not know enough about individual candidates to do
   so. Hence, we examine whether voters infer individual positions from
   cues provided on ballots, namely age and residence. Studying the Swiss
   parliamentary elections of 2019, we focus on environmental policy, both
   a very salient issue and featuring considerable intra-party
   heterogeneity of positions. We combine comprehensive candidate data with
   a representative voter survey and conduct a survey-embedded experiment
   (N = 10,758). We find that citizens have indeed little knowledge of
   candidate positions. However, ballot cues predict policy differences
   among candidates within parties only to a limited extent, and the
   experiment does not suggest that voters use ballot information to
   predict positions directly. Instead, as suggested by additional
   analyses, citizens may perceive candidates who resemble their own
   sociodemographic profile as having positions closer to their own.},

Title = {Context matters: Economics, politics and satisfaction with democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Economic and political considerations are important in determining
   citizens' level of satisfaction with their democratic system, but
   research analyzing which criteria prevail in which contexts is still
   limited. We examine under what conditions citizens chiefly rely on
   economic or political considerations in assessing their level of
   satisfaction with democracy. Using the Comparative Study of Electoral
   Systems dataset covering 72 elections in 45 unique countries
   (1996-2016), we show that the relative weight of economic and political
   criteria in citizens' evaluation of their democratic regime is a
   function of their nation's affluence. On the one hand, citizens in
   poorer countries mostly rely on the economy to assess their level of
   satisfaction with democracy. On the other hand, political considerations
   are crucial in citizens' evaluations of richer societies. Our results
   entail strong implications to understand why citizens' recipes for
   satisfaction for democracy vary across time and space.},

Title = {Envisaging global balance-sheet capitalism: The Bank for International
   Settlements as a collective organic intellectual},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {401-425},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Bank for International Settlements, as a
   collective organic intellectual of finance capital, has sought to
   maintain the hegemony of financial globalization in the context of an
   increasingly fractured global order following the 2007-2009 financial
   crisis. I show how the Bank for International Settlements' defence of
   financial globalization has pivoted around the construction of a new
   `economic imaginary' of global capitalism in which the global financial
   cycle, which culminates in systemic financial crises, threatens economic
   and political stability. Asserting that this cycle can be `properly
   managed', the Bank for International Settlements has advocated a set of
   formal shifts in macro-policy frameworks. Focusing on the temporality of
   economic governance as envisioned by the Bank for International
   Settlements, I highlight two important dimensions of the organization's
   discourse: the reduction of policy to process and the fetishization of
   policy innovation. Here, the pursuit of principles of `good' economic
   management is prioritized over the achievement of concrete economic or
   social outcomes. In traversing this economic imaginary, this article
   offers insights into how global capitalism and its management are
   envisioned by elites in the current period of hegemonic disorganization
   and political-economic turmoil.},

Abstract = {Franco-German leadership may be necessary for European integration, but
   it is insufficient. Other countries also have to follow. Sometimes they
   refuse. Examples include the Dutch rejection of the 1962 Fouchet Plan
   and the efforts by the new Hanseatic League to block implementation of
   the 2018 Meseberg Declaration. The opposition of Austria, Denmark, the
   Netherlands, and Sweden to the Franco-German recovery programme during
   the Covid-19 pandemic may be a third. Importantly, these are not moments
   of intergovernmental bargaining, with posturing leading to give-and-take
   that results in a negotiated compromise; they are moments where small
   states simply reject the plans the French and Germans put forward. This
   choice is puzzling. The smaller countries are more dependent upon the
   rest of Europe than the rest of Europe is on them. Not only do they have
   an important stake in the success of the European project, but this
   dependence makes them vulnerable to the threat of exclusion. Hence,
   France and Germany should be able to exercise the kind of go-it-alone
   power that will drag the smaller countries along (Gruber 2000, Ruling
   the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions.
   Princeton: Princeton University Press). This paper explores two
   explanations for small state intransigence, one centred on political
   instability and the other on the politics of shared beliefs.},

Abstract = {The income gradient in political participation is a widely accepted
   stylized fact. Based on nine panel datasets from six countries, this
   research note asks whether income changes trigger short-term effects on
   political involvement. Irrespective of indicator, specification, and
   method (hybrid random effects models, fixed effects models with lags and
   leads, and error correction models), there are few significant
   short-term effects of income changes. In conjunction with earlier
   research, this finding suggests that the income gradient in political
   participation is likely to reflect stable differences between rich and
   poor voters emerging early in the life course.},

Abstract = {When he delivered his first annual message in 1801, Thomas Jefferson
   departed from prior presidential practice and delivered the message to

   the meaning and significance of his action. This article examines new
   historical evidence on the question. The evidence is a commentary in
   Jefferson's presidential newspaper that explained the reasons for his
   action; a letter Jefferson wrote explaining his action; and commentaries
   on the action from Federalist Party opposition newspapers.},

Abstract = {In the past two decades, Indonesia has become more active in
   humanitarian affairs, despite a preoccupation with natural hazards and
   political hurdles at home. In so doing, the Indonesian government
   employs ``humanitarianism as diplomacy{''} - humanitarian action to
   promote its national interests - instead of deploying its efforts under
   a narrow understanding of humanitarianism. This is demonstrated in the
   country's humanitarian foci, which form part of its leadership ambitions
   in resolving crises in ASEAN and in supporting Muslim communities
   globally. As such, the Indonesian government's contributions are more
   pronounced in cases which promote Indonesia's regional and global
   leadership, such as in the Rohingya crisis and the Palestine issue.
   Indonesia also actively participates in disaster mitigation efforts in
   disaster-prone countries, which expands its international presence
   beyond ASEAN and the Middle East. This article identifies the foundation
   of Indonesia's humanitarianism and its key drivers, humanitarian
   contributions, and captures the involvement of state and non-state
   actors in such engagements.},

Abstract = {While social pressure is widely believed to influence voters, evidence
   that information passed between social ties affects beliefs, policy
   preferences, and voting behavior is limited. We investigate whether
   information about unemployment shocks diffuses through networks of
   strong and mostly weak social ties and influences voters in Denmark. We
   link surveys with population-level administrative data that log
   unemployment shocks afflicting respondents' familial, vocational, and
   educational networks. Our results show that the share of second-degree
   social ties-individuals that voters learn about indirectly-that became
   unemployed within the last year increases a voter's perception of
   national unemployment, self-assessed risk of becoming unemployed,
   support for unemployment insurance, and voting for left-wing political
   parties. Voters' beliefs about national aggregates respond to all shocks
   similarly, whereas subjective perceptions and preferences respond
   primarily to unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree ties in
   similar vocations. This suggests that information diffusion through
   social ties principally affects political preferences via
   egotropic-rather than sociotropic-motives.</p>},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In this essay, I offer some thoughts on the problem of self-reflexivity
   in critical theory, with special attention to the way in which this
   problem is thematized in The Authoritarian Personality (1950). The
   problem of self-reflexivity is a defining feature of any social theory
   that means to account for the conditions of its own possibility within
   the society it describes. I argue that The Authoritarian Personality is
   less a study of distinctive and socially isolable personality
   ``types{''} and more concerned with the rise of ``conventionalism{''} as
   a generalized problem that afflicts all of modern society. In this
   respect the book shares in common a major focus on the problem of
   conformity that was also studied by other classic mid-century works of
   sociology. The question of conventionalism, however, brings into sharp
   relief a dilemma of self-reflexivity, namely, how can the researchers
   account for their own critical posture if the world they describe
   encourages conventionalism and disables criticism? By examining Adorno's
   comments on the themes of realism and utopia and the distribution of
   these attributes between high-scorers and low-scorers, respectively, I
   offer one possible answer to this dilemma.</p>},

Abstract = {This paper discusses global reserve currencies from the perspective of
   structural global justice. Drawing on notions of structural justice and
   background justice, it suggests that the structures of global finance,
   by creating positions of privilege and disadvantage, can lead to
   injustices both with regard to distributive outcomes and with regard to
   domination. While the role of the dollar and Euro as global reserve
   currencies is not the only factor that contributes to these structural
   injustices, they need to be taken into account to fully grasp the
   dynamics of global finance. They also have an impact on other
   mechanisms, such as sovereign debt, capital flows, and the governance of
   international financial institutions. The paper's arguments support the
   claim that one cannot conceptualize global justice as justice between
   independent states. Rather, the global monetary regime constitutes a
   case of `background injustice'.},

Abstract = {We provide a comprehensive assessment of the influence of television
   advertising on United States election outcomes from 2000-2018. We expand
   on previous research by including presidential, Senate, House,
   gubernatorial, Attorney General, and state Treasurer elections and using
   both difference-in-differences and border-discontinuity research designs
   to help identify the causal effect of advertising. We find that
   televised broadcast campaign advertising matters up and down the ballot,
   but it has much larger effects in down-ballot elections than in
   presidential elections. Using survey and voter registration data from
   multiple election cycles, we also show that the primary mechanism for ad
   effects is persuasion, not the mobilization of partisans. Our results
   have implications for the study of campaigns and elections as well as
   voter decision making and information processing.},

Abstract = {Politicians are increasingly relying on outrage to engage the public.
   President Donald Trump used outrage to fuel his unlikely 2016
   presidential victory and 2020 reelection effort. Was Trump's outrageous
   behavior a boon to his political fortunes or political malpractice? I
   draw on research in political psychology, populism, and presidential
   appeals to examine President Trump's outrageous behavior and its effect
   on the public. Using a series of original experiments, I find support
   for my expectation that Trump's outrageous behavior is a politically
   advantageous public relations strategy. My results show that Trump's
   outrageous behavior increases his support among self-identified
   Independents. However, contrary to popular conception, the results do
   not support claims that racial resentment or affinity for populism makes
   individuals more amenable to Trump's outrageous behavior.},

Abstract = {At a time when the world is becoming more mobile, and migration levels
   are high, relatively limited attention has been paid to return migrants.
   Yet returners can play an important role in their homeland. In Scotland,
   with a sluggish population growth fuelled entirely by immigration,
   return movement is an important way of growing the population and the
   economy. This paper reports on a study of return migrants to Scotland in
   2019/20 and discusses their reasons for return, their experiences and
   their long-term commitment to the country. Respondents generally felt
   positively about their return and there was considerable support for
   Scottish independence, particularly if that led to rejoining the
   European Union. Brexit was an important factor in making Scots feel
   unwelcome in England and helping to encourage return to Scotland.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has affected almost every
   aspect of our lives. While millions of people fought with the disease,
   economies, societies and institutions faced side-effects of government
   measures resisting the spread of the virus. This article describes the
   effects of the pandemic on the legislative behaviour of MPs in one of
   the worst-hit countries in the world, the Czech Republic. The results
   show that the number of bill proposals and roll calls substantially
   increased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times. Since the
   start of the outbreak, a third of roll calls and a half of bill
   proposals concerned the pandemic. Nonetheless, the outbreak did not
   substantially affect the voting unity of parliamentary party groups nor
   the opposition became more supportive of the cabinet. Still, while the
   liberal Pirates became more cooperative during the pandemic than the
   pre-pandemic period, the rightist antisystem party Freedom and Direct
   Democracy receded from the rest of the parties on the pandemic issues.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I defend the claim that addressing dominating ontologies
   is crucial for achieving Indigenous self-determination. Consequently,
   the struggle for Indigenous self-determination comprises not only an
   engagement with political practices, structures, and institutions, but
   also with political ontology. I first argue that implementing Indigenous
   self-determination requires an engagement with political ontology. I
   then introduce Iris Young's conception of self-determination as
   non-domination as a way to engage with diverging ontologies within the
   political framework of federalism. In the final section of the paper, I
   present two constructive proposals concerning how Indigenous peoples and
   settler states can establish an ontology at the federal level that
   facilitates Indigenous self-determination.},

Abstract = {During the Merkel era, Germany moved from a traditional gender binary to
   a gender triad by introducing a third sex category. Why did a nation
   that has historically lagged on gender issues become the first country
   in Europe to take this extraordinary step? This article sheds light on
   changing LGBTQI discourses in Germany and the successful politicization
   of intersex concerns. Initial reform was prompted by transnational
   social activism at the UN and top-down international pressure, while the
   second phase was dominated by competition among German domestic parties
   and the courts. I process-trace policy-making throughout the Merkel era
   to show how claims by intersex activists morphed from the private to the
   public sphere. Once the issue gained visibility, most political actors
   expressed support for social movement claims for physical inviolability
   framed as human rights. Semi-autonomous medical authorities resisted
   change, however, and maintained a correction paradigm that discursively
   came to be perceived as a `private wrong'. As a result, the state's
   legal recognition of a third sex preceded the ban of invasive medical
   procedures on intersex children. Recent far right anti-gender discourses
   have challenged these achievements and tried to limit the visibility of
   and broader accessibility to a third sex category.},

Title = {Do politicians anticipate voter control? A comparative study of
   representatives' accountability beliefs},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {699-717},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Representation literature is rife with the assumption that politicians
   are responsive to voter preferences because their re-election is
   contingent upon the approval of those voters, approval that can be won
   by furthering their desires or, similarly, that can be threatened by
   ignoring their wishes. Hence, scholars argue that the anticipation of
   electoral accountability by politicians constitutes a crucial guarantor
   of (policy) responsiveness; as long as politicians believe that voters
   are aware of what they do and will take it into account on election day,
   they are expected to work hard at keeping these voters satisfied. If, on
   the other hand, politicians were to think what they say and do is
   inconsequential for citizens' voting behaviour, they may see leeway to
   ignore their preferences. In this study, we therefore examine whether
   politicians anticipate electoral accountability in the first place. In
   particular, we ask 782 Members of Parliament in Belgium, Germany, Canada
   and Switzerland in a face-to-face survey about the anticipation of voter
   control; whether they believe that voters are aware of their behaviour
   in parliament and their personal policy positions, are able to evaluate
   the outcomes of their political work, and, finally, whether this
   knowledge affects their vote choice. We find that a sizable number of
   MPs believe that voters are aware of what they do and say and take that
   into account at the ballot box. Still, this general image of rather
   strong anticipation of voter control hides considerable variation;
   politicians in party-centred systems (in Belgium and some politicians in
   Germany that are elected on closed party lists), anticipate less voter
   control compared to politicians in more candidate-centred systems
   (Canada and Switzerland). Within these countries, we find that populist
   politicians are more convinced that voters know about their political
   actions and take this knowledge into account in elections; it seems that
   politicians who take pride in being close to voters (and their
   preferences), also feel more monitored by these voters. Finally, we show
   that politicians' views of voter control do not reflect the likelihood
   that they might be held to account; politicians whose behaviour is more
   visible and whose policy profile should therefore be better known to
   voters do not feel the weight of voter control more strongly.},

Abstract = {Despite its illiberal tendencies, the Bolsonaro presidency, particularly
   the Christian Evangelical head of its women's policy agency, does have a
   specific agenda to advance substantive gender claims. The current
   government's rejects strongly feminist public policy claims, equating
   feminism to a radical leftist subversion of the Brazilian family and the
   country's societal values. Feminine-centric public policy, in contrast,
   is portrayed as one of the key paths to restore a nation in which, as
   Bolsonaro's campaign slogan epitomizes, ``Brazil is above all things,
   and God is above all{''}.},

Title = {Hidden in plain sight? Irregularities on statutory forms and electoral
   fraud},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The most common method of tabulating election results around the world
   is manually compiling paper forms at the local level. Recent election
   disputes in developing democracies, particularly in Africa, have
   centered on irregularities observed on these forms. However, scholars do
   not yet have a good understanding of the distribution of these
   irregularities, nor of their relationship to systematic fraud. In this
   paper, we theorize a catalog of irregularities that goes beyond simple
   vote tally editing. We use deep neural networks to identify these
   irregularities on forms from about 30,000 polling stations in Kenya's
   2013 presidential election. We find that although irregularities
   manifest differently in government and opposition strongholds, they do
   not correlate with election outcomes, and they are unaffected by the
   presence of electoral observers. Taken together, our findings suggest
   scholars of election integrity should pay greater attention to problems
   of benign human error and overtaxed bureaucrats.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Social media have the potential to transform democracies as they allow
   for direct contact between representatives and represented. Politicians
   can use social media to show their policy positions but they can also
   give insight into their private lives. Based on survey experiments in
   Germany and Switzerland we show that social media messages about
   politicians' private lives rather deter voters. Instead, we find that
   voters prefer candidates that communicate policy positions. The effect
   of a policy-oriented communication style on Twitter can even lead to
   appreciating a politician from a different party in Switzerland, which
   has an electoral system that gives a strong incentive to cultivate a
   personal vote.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has positioned itself as a global climate
   leader. The EU's engagement with external climate governance is most
   visible in the six post-Soviet states of Eastern Europe. This article
   asks what drives the EU's engagement with climate governance in the
   region. To answer this question, I distinguish between three logics of
   external climate action: self-interest, functional, and civilizing. By
   analyzing climate cooperation between the EU and the six states, I
   demonstrate that a combination of all three logics explains the EU's
   engagement in external climate governance, but that the functional logic
   is slightly more prominent than the other two.},

Abstract = {Relative to the well-developed theory and extensive survey batteries on
   people's preferences for substantive policy solutions, scholarly
   understanding of people's preferences for the mechanisms by which
   policies should be adopted is disappointing. Theory rarely goes beyond
   the assumption that people would prefer to rule themselves rather than
   leave decisions up to elites and measurement rests largely on four items
   that are not up to the task. In this article, we seek to provide a
   firmer footing for ``process{''} research by 1) offering an alternative
   theory holding that people actually want elites to continue to make
   important political decisions but want them to do so only after
   acquiring a deep appreciation for the real-world problems facing regular
   people, and 2) developing and testing a battery of over 50 survey items,
   appropriate for cross-national research, that extend understanding of
   how the people want political decisions to be made.},

Abstract = {In a stark departure from the historical stance that Germany is ``not a
   country of immigration{''}, Angela Merkel has made it a priority to
   welcome and integrate newcomers into German society. Over the course of
   her four terms, various Merkel-led governments have paid increased
   attention to the integration of newcomers, and specifically to the
   integration of women and girls. Drawing on key documents, including the
   four coalition agreements, I identify three different phases in the
   incorporation of gender into German integration policy. I also find
   evidence of several different, yet at times overlapping frames which
   shape the ways in which gender is framed into the integration discourse.
   Drawing on two case studies, I then draw attention to the fact that the
   shifts in discursive and policy frames at the federal level, are not
   immediately evident in policy initiatives as. As such, barriers to the
   integration of women and girls remain, even though Merkel has made this
   a central priority in her governments},

Abstract = {This article studies the spatial dimension of the social selection of
   local elected officials that takes shape through the geographical
   selectivity of the elected officials' places of residence. Based on data
   on the places of residence of local elected officials in Zurich and
   Lausanne (1980-2016), we show that the residential dispersion of local
   elected officials is not random but driven by a logic of class
   socio-spatial selectivity. We also show that this spatial selectivity
   varies according to the partisan affiliation of elected officials and
   the existence or not of electoral districts at the municipal level. By
   analysing the concentration or absence of elected officials according to
   the socio-economic level of the neighbourhoods of Lausanne and Zurich,
   this article explores a new approach to the sociology of political
   elites: by adding a spatial dimension - the place of residence - we thus
   refine the study of the profile of elected officials and their
   representativeness.},

Abstract = {Concerns have been raised about weakening social cohesion in French
   society against the backdrop of economic slowdown over the last decade.
   To understand how economic conditions are associated with social
   cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and
   macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their
   cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with
   year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008-2018)
   show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social
   trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes.
   Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can
   have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a
   macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public
   attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and
   social order. The results of this study suggest potential negative
   consequences of micro- and macroeconomic hardship for various dimensions
   of social cohesion and suggest the need for a comprehensive policy
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Bureaucracies increasingly use quantitative measures to monitor
   personnel behavior. I develop a model of the incentives created by
   metrics management, a bureaucratic accountability technique, using
   policing as a case to show that monitoring can lead public-interest
   motivated bureaucrats to focus on work not in the public interest.
   Second, I develop a new measure of data manipulation in crime
   statistics: although theory predicts the presence of manipulation,
   researchers observe only the altered data. I solve this using the fact
   that police departments can reclassify rapes (but not other violent
   crimes) as ``unfounded,{''} concluding the reported crime did not occur.
   Finally, I test the effects of metrics management in policing using a
   novel data set. CompStat is associated with at least 3,500 additional
   minor arrests per city-year, substantial data manipulation, and no
   decrease in serious crime. These results have implications for
   bureaucracies implementing metrics management, scholarship using
   administrative data, and legal implementation.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between ethics and political theory? In
   particular, is the study of interpersonal and social morality continuous
   with inquiry into how we should lead our political lives? This article
   evaluates the call for firmer boundaries between moral and political
   thought that is central to recent realist critiques of analytical
   political theory. I identify, and reject, three versions of this
   position, which I term ``discontinuity realism.{''} My critique draws
   attention to an important silence within discontinuity realism,
   concerning how its call to address politics from within relates to the
   feminist insight that politics is deeply intertwined with our personal
   choices and interpersonal relationships. The article goes on to defend
   an alternative ``continuity{''} approach to the study of ethics and
   political theory. This approach better realizes the realist's own
   aspiration for greater sensitivity to empirical detail in normative
   political theory.},

Abstract = {Can competent political leaders bring significant policy changes to
   communities otherwise doomed by ``bad{''} informal institutions? This
   question has remained unanswered because of the lack of a convincing
   measure of politicians' competence. I develop a novel survey technique
   to measure the administrative competence of executive politicians, and I
   apply it in interviews with 306 Italian mayors. I study the impact of
   mayors' administrative competence on the policies they enact, using a
   difference-in-differences approach. Results show that more competent
   mayors are associated with better policies, but the association is only
   present in cases where the quality of informal institutions is low. In
   these municipalities, the election of more competent mayors translates
   into a more effective use of funds, an increase in long-term
   investments, and better service provision without an increase in taxes.
   Results hold across different measures of institutional quality.},

Abstract = {Pushed by technological, cultural and related political drivers, a `new
   plebiscitary democracy' is emerging which challenges established
   electoral democracy as well as variants of deliberative democracy. The
   new plebiscitary democracy reinvents and radicalizes longer-existing
   methods (initiative, referendum, recall, primary, petition, poll) with
   new tools and applications (mostly digital). It comes with a
   comparatively thin conceptualization of democracy, invoking the bare
   notion of a demos whose aggregated will is to steer actors and issues in
   public governance in a straight majoritarian way. In addition to
   unravelling the reinvented logic of plebiscitary democracy in conceptual
   terms, this article fleshes out an empirically informed matrix of
   emerging formats, distinguishing between votations that are
   `political-leader' and `public-issue' oriented on the one hand, and
   `inside-out' and `outside-in' initiated on the other hand. Relatedly, it
   proposes an agenda for systematic research into the various guises,
   drivers and implications of the new plebiscitary democracy. Finally, it
   reflects on possible objections to the argumentation.},

Abstract = {It is well known that regime types affect international conflicts. This
   article explores political parties as a mechanism through which they do
   so. Political parties operate in fundamentally different ways in
   democracies vs. non-democracies, which has consequences for foreign
   policy. Core supporters of a party in a democracy, if they are hawkish,
   may be more successful at demanding hawkish behavior from their party
   representatives than would be their counterparts in an autocracy. The
   study draws on evidence from paired experiments in democratic Japan and
   non-democratic China to show that supporters of the ruling party in
   Japan punish their leaders for discouraging nationalist protests, while
   ruling party insiders in China are less likely to do so. Under some
   circumstances, then, non-democratic regimes may be better able to rein
   in peace-threatening displays of nationalism.},

Abstract = {Public faith in politicians and associated systems of governance is
   desperately low. At the same time, public opinion of politicians is
   characterized by a vernacular of psychological accusations pertaining to
   greed, self-interest and careerism. This article tests the verity of
   these claims by comparing quantitative data on the Basic Human Values
   (Schwartz 1992) of 106 UK Members of Parliament (MPs) and 134
   unsuccessful parliamentary candidates with data collected from the
   British public in the seventh wave of the European Social Survey. It
   explores (a) how politicians differ psychologically from those they
   govern and (b) how personality characteristics such as basic values
   inform candidate emergence. The study finds that politics is a
   profession few `ordinary' people care to enter. MPs attribute
   significantly more importance to Self-Transcendence values than the
   comparatively conservative population they govern, but the relative
   importance they ascribe to Power values seems to have an equally strong
   predictive effect on candidate emergence.},

Abstract = {The economic and political influence of China in the Asian region is
   growing amidst global geopolitical challenges. Economic corridors such
   as the new Silk Road have been identified as enablers of strategic
   growth and geo-economic power development in a context of significant
   political instability. Beijing's strategic approach and the importance
   of Pakistan and Iran to its aspiration to realise China's dream through
   its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are examined in this comparative
   study. The rising role of China in the region and its engagement with
   Iran and Pakistan and the part that these two countries can play need
   careful attention. Political and economic joint interests have brought
   together these three countries with significant links to China's
   economic corridor and energy projections. But the future of the
   partnership is very fragile as it is characterised by historical
   hostilities between Iran and Pakistan that can act as a major
   impendiment to China's ability to progress. In addition, economic and
   trade figures show an unbalanced relationship that clearly favours
   Chinese interests. The BRI and the Chinese plans for those territories
   still remain blurry as any long-term crisis that characterises fragile
   and complex international alliances.},

Abstract = {The Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) pursuit for a Zone
   of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN) first began during the Cold
   War, at a time of intense superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia. ASEAN
   reaffirmed the importance of this principle in 2020, amid growing
   concerns of instability in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of
   increasing tensions between the United States (US) and China. Through an
   examination of the ZOPFAN principle, this paper seeks to develop a
   greater understanding of ASEAN's ability to respond to periods of
   geopolitical crisis and Great Power rivalry. It asks whether a ZOPFAN in
   Southeast Asia has ever been successfully realised, and what is the
   likelihood of one being achieved in the future. As analysis of recent
   security challenges will show, ZOPFAN falls short as both a framework
   for regional security and as an expression of regional autonomy. This
   raises serious questions about ASEAN's coherence in the post-Cold War
   era, and its ability to uphold regional order in light of renewed Great
   Power security competition.},

Abstract = {Do foreign investors have subnational political preferences? The
   political economy of foreign direct investment (FDI) involves not only
   choosing among host countries, but also the subnational location of the
   assets. However, factors affecting investors' decisions about
   subnational location likely differ from the ones affecting international
   investment. This paper studies the effect of state-level partisanship on
   new FDI inflows to Mexican states. I argue that investors prefer states
   ruled by left-wing governors because they are more likely to invest in
   human capital. Statistical analyses using new data on subnational
   allocation of FDI in Mexican states between 1999 and 2017 support the
   main hypothesis. Given the persistence of authoritarian enclaves in
   Mexico, I also disentangle the effects of partisanship from subnational
   democratization. The partisan effect is independent from party turnover
   and political competition at the subnational level, and it is robust to
   different model specifications and estimation strategies. Additional
   evidence supports the plausibility of the argued mechanism.},

Abstract = {Declining turnout, declining party membership, declining aggregate vote
   for mainstream parties and increasing vote for anti-party-system parties
   all suggest a crisis of liberal party democracy. One suggested cure for
   the crisis of party democracy is more democracy within parties. But
   increased intraparty democracy, and increased use of instruments of
   direct democracy, such as recall, have their own potential costs.
   Following the example of de Tocqueville in looking to the United States,
   where intraparty democracy has a longer and deeper history, for lessons
   and warnings that might be applicable to Europe, this article points to
   polarization, alienation, intransigence, and decreased responsibility of
   political leaders - all feeding the anti-party-system narrative - as
   suggesting that the cure of more democracy may indeed be worse than the
   disease.},

Abstract = {In spite of the concern about the political influence of the new digital
   media, especially social media, a large amount of circumstantial
   evidence suggests that their impact on mass political attitudes and
   behaviour, which is the focus of this article, may be small. Online news
   is less widely trusted than the news consumed via the legacy media (TV,
   radio, newspapers and magazines) and social media are least trusted of
   all. Most people rely heavily on the mainstream legacy media for their
   news, which are also the most popular online news sources-especially the
   BBC and much the same news is accessed on the new and old media. The
   majority of people have a fairly mixed diet of politically neutral and
   partisan news and there is little evidence of political `echo
   chambers'-even among the small minority that rely heavily on a single,
   partisan source. All age groups gather their news in similar ways,
   including the youngest, who make heavy use of the social media.
   Nevertheless, in the absence of rigorous research on causal effects on
   mass political attitudes and behaviour, we do not know whether the
   impact of the new media is strong or weak. The circumstantial evidence
   suggests they are likely to be weak.},

Abstract = {U.S. presidential candidates aspire to have a ``presidential image.{''}
   Political communication researchers, media pundits, political
   scientists, pollsters, campaign consultants, and other political
   marketers speculate about who is ``presidential{''} and
   ``unpresidential.{''} No prior research, however, has empirically
   measured and validated a presidential image construct. Based on data
   collected prior to the 2020 U.S. presidential election (N = 618
   registered likely voters), we tested congeneric models of
   presidentiality. Results indicated (1) a six-item, single-factor model
   fit well when single group confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were
   performed separately on ratings of Donald Trump (Study 1) and Joe Biden
   (Study 2), (2) multiple-group CFA indicated configural and metric
   invariance (generalizability across candidates) of the model, and (3)
   presidential image factor scores were strongly associated with the
   candidate participants planned to vote for in the election. The
   resultant indicators also advance theorizing that a U.S. president is
   expected to serve as both ``head of state{''} through components of
   personability and as ``head of government{''} through components of
   capability. Theoretical implications for political marketing are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {An increasing amount of research on the concept of national ownership in
   EU soft law governance has generated a lot of insights on: (1) its
   conceptualization; (2) how EU institutions foster national ownership;
   (3) the extent to which member state governments and other stakeholders
   obtain ownership. Despite all of this valuable progress, however, it
   remains unclear as to whether increased national ownership really
   improves the implementation of soft law. Based on the insights from the
   important management school of compliance theory, this study begins by
   theorizing why the member states would comply with international
   agreements, which they have ownership of. Then, based on an analysis of
   a unique dataset from the European Semester, the findings indicate that
   member states implement the EU recommendations better when the
   governments have a high level of ownership. Therefore, this study
   confirms the potential of enhancing national ownership in improving soft
   law implementation in the EU.},

Abstract = {In contemporary Bosniak historiography on the Independent State of
   Croatia (NDH), Muslim resolutions have an important place - six
   political petitions sent by members of the Muslim religious and secular
   elite to the NDH authorities and to the public in autumn and winter of
   1941. In the first part of the article, I describe the
   historical-political context in which the resolutions appeared. After
   that I point out the motives that prompted interest in those documents
   which were found in their alleged concealment and forgery in Yugoslav
   politics and historiography during the communist period. In the second
   part, I present interpretations of the content and meaning of the
   resolutions in the revisionist current of Bosniak historiography. In the
   third part, by using discursive analysis of resolutions, and by
   describing the war ideological and political profile of many of their
   prominent signatories, I show the real nature of these documents. In the
   concluding part, I analyze the dynamics and logic of the revisionist
   interpretation of Muslim resolutions - spatial and social dissemination
   and ideological and political falsification - as one of the foundations
   of the construction of anti-fascist history of Muslims/Bosniaks in World
   War II in general. I conclude that the Muslim resolutions were neither
   antiUstasha nor anti-fascist acts, but protest letters that had limited
   political goals: to influence the state to curb and control religious
   and ethnic violence and to protect the Muslim population from violence
   against it, but also to absolve it of responsibility for violence
   against other communities.},

Abstract = {This epilogue to the special issue of the Swiss Political Science Review
   on ``Democratic Challenges of Differentiated (Dis)Integration{''} raises
   some notes of caution about differentiated integration in the European
   Union (EU). While the articles in this special issue identify challenges
   concerning differentiated integration, they generally view it in a
   positive light as a set of institutional arrangements that is likely to
   enhance the legitimacy and democratic accountability of the EU. This
   epilogue calls into question some of the main benefits widely associated
   with differentiated integration and emphasizes instead its dangers. The
   epilogue underlines some reasons why differentiated integration may be
   problematic from a democratic standpoint and explains why, if taken to
   an extreme, differentiated integration could even encourage the
   disintegration of the EU.},

Abstract = {In the latter half of the 1970s, Michel Foucault's reflection on power
   eventually led to the emergency of the categories of biopolitics and
   apparatuses of security. As the article contends, rethinking freedom as
   an inherent element of power relations became a troublesome issue,
   particularly concerning the birth of political economy. Foucault
   attempted to overcome it by analyzing governmentality and introducing
   the idea of pastoral power. However, some key passages of the 1979
   lectures on neo-liberalisms offer the clue to show the potential of
   Foucault's intuitions and the necessity of moving beyond the preliminary
   limits of his frame of thought.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been an explosion of legislative and
   litigation campaigns to ban conversion therapy for sexual orientation
   and gender identity. In championing such bans, the American LGBTQ+
   advocacy movement has incorporated its massive network of scientific and
   medical allies into legal arguments, legislative testimonies,
   educational materials, and political cultural discourse more generally.
   By linking these recent campaigns to the long history of scientific
   influence in LGBTQ+ politics, I demonstrate how biomedical and mental
   health institutions and ideas have become foundational to the character
   of American LGBTQ+ advocacy. I do so by marrying theories and
   methodological approaches to studying political identity and social
   movements, American political development, and public opinion to those
   in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and biopolitical citizenship
   studies. This joint perspective reveals both the power of scientific
   authority as well as the political, legal, and normative pitfalls that
   attend certain biomedical articulations of identity and personhood,
   legal rights claims, and demands for full and equal citizenship. This
   approach demonstrates how scholars might conceptualize and study the
   role of extra-political institutions and ideas that become constitutive
   components of minority rights coalitions.},

Abstract = {This article introduces readers to the Lobbying and Democratic
   Governance in Canada (LDGC) research project. We describe the project's
   origins and objectives as well as the types of information within the
   LDGC dataset, including data gathered from one of the most comprehensive
   and systematic lobbying registries in the world. We then review the
   methodological and theoretical contributions of research that have thus
   far come out of the project. Finally, we consider why the LDGC data will
   be of interest to international scholars whose research might not
   normally cover Canada. First, we identify unique aspects of the LDGC
   data compared to data used by researchers from other countries and
   explain how the LDGC allows researchers to investigate some, as of yet,
   unanswered questions about the nature of lobbying and the role it can
   play in modern governance. Second, we identify similarities between the
   LDGC and data used in extant research and consider how scholars can use
   the LDGC to engage in more comparative thinking about differences and
   similarities in the nature and role of lobbying across political
   systems.},

Abstract = {Populism is widely considered to be one of the most significant
   political phenomena of the past decade. Yet for all the scholarly and
   media attention it receives, how important it is in driving support for
   populist radical right parties is debatable. Scholars have long
   theorised that nativism and authoritarianism are likely to be equally if
   not more important than populism in driving support for populist radical
   right parties, but the empirical evidence to support this argument has
   been limited. We conduct a cross-national analysis on a representative
   sample of voters from the United States, United Kingdom and Australia (n
   = 4650) to test this proposition. We demonstrate that rather than
   populism, it is primarily nativism driving support for populist radical
   right parties. Populism is, therefore, shown to be less important than
   often suggested.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research note presents the results of an experimental design to
   study the effects of poll releases in Mexico's 2018 presidential
   campaign. Our research design allows us to test the conditions in which
   polling information can alter voters' reported preferences. The results
   show that the exposure to polling results makes respondents more likely
   to identify themselves as undecided. We interpret this change as a sign
   of voters' willingness to form veridical attitudes. To support this
   interpretation, we show that the effect is stronger among citizens with
   the ability and motivation to elaborate on the polling information. The
   findings contribute to the debate about the consequences of publishing
   pre-election poll results that show a clear advantage for one of the
   candidates.},

Abstract = {Political economists have argued that the design of political
   institutions bears important consequences for the quality of public
   policy, especially in areas like the privatization and regulation of
   utilities. Our study looks at how variations in key institutional traits
   of executive and legislative branches (specifically presidents'
   legislative powers, presidents' prerogatives to designate the director
   of the regulatory agency, and legislative fragmentation) affect
   investment in Latin American telecommunications, a critical sector for
   economic development. Institutional factors influence how easily
   executives and important political (legislative) parties can alter
   policies related to the telecommunications sector. We find that resolute
   institutional designs foster investment in the sector, but only under
   private ownership. For state-owned firms, decisive institutional designs
   have better effects on investment.},

Abstract = {Metro mayors are the latest addition to the complex jigsaw of
   subnational governance in England, and were introduced from 2014 to
   lead, allegedly, a `devolution revolution'. This article focusses on the
   2021 election to reflect on the roots and first mandate of these new
   mayors, to understand how they fared at the ballot box, and to assess
   whether and in what ways they are making an impact. The analysis shows
   that metro mayors are maturing as institutions, and they are becoming
   more rooted in the public imagination. Harnessing `the power of place'
   was a key driver of success: some metro mayors have shown a potential to
   `reboot localism' and, with it, devolution. However, resistance from
   central government to let go of power persists and could hinder both the
   metro mayors' and the devolution agendas going forward.},

Abstract = {Opposition responsibility is a neglected field, and if at all noticed,
   opposition parties are often placed in the irresponsibility frame. The
   purpose of our paper is to examine to what extent, under which
   conditions, and in which ways opposition parties can be considered to
   act responsibly. This article will develop the concept of opposition
   responsibility and test the expectations in the behaviour of opposition
   parties in three countries: Hungary, Italy and Spain. The analysis
   highlights that opposition responsibility exceeds-although does not
   exclude-policy making and scrutiny activities as it has broader
   implications. We shall regard the opposition's general performance and
   their political system-related behaviour as components of
   responsibility.},

Title = {Discursive Alliances in the Debate on Migration? Political Parallelism
   Between Media and Parties in the Framing of the 2018 Debate on Refugee

Abstract = {Our study on political parallelism in Germany examines the extent to
   which media reflect the parties' central frames in the debate on refugee
   and asylum migration. Thereby, we consider discursive alliances of
   individual media outlets and parties. In this context, we moreover
   address important questions of public sphere theory: Do the media
   function as organs of particular viewpoints, or do they set the ground
   for free opinion building by a broad and balanced representation of
   competing frames? In addition, we discuss the extent to which the media
   offer political parties a fair opportunity to make their positions
   observable to the public. Empirically, we analyze the extent of
   political parallelism based on a content analysis of 18 media outlets
   and official documents of the seven parties in the German Bundestag. At
   the level of issue-specific statements, we measure value-based frames.
   This approach enables us to describe the substance of mediated
   viewpoints concisely and to identify similarities between media and
   parties with regard to the framing of the issue. Furthermore, our method
   allows us to locate media and parties within the space of a basic
   political cleavage (integration vs. demarcation). Referring to a concept
   of political sociology enables us to describe the proximity and distance
   of media and parties in a condensed way.},

Abstract = {In a multidimensional environment, parties may have compelling
   incentives to obscure their preferences on select issues. This study
   contributes to a growing literature on position blurring by
   demonstrating how party leaders purposively create uncertainty about
   where their party stands on the issue of European integration. By doing
   so, it theoretically and empirically disentangles the cause of position
   blurring-parties' strategic behavior-from its intended political
   outcome. The analysis of survey and manifesto data across 14 Western
   European countries (1999-2019) confirms that three distinct
   strategies-avoidance, ambiguity, and alternation-all increase expert
   uncertainty about a party's position. This finding is then unpacked by
   examining for whom avoidance is particularly effective. This study has
   important implications for our understanding of party strategy,
   democratic representation, and political accountability.},

Abstract = {Government formation in multiparty systems requires election winners to
   strike deals to form a coalition government. Do voters respond and how
   do they respond to coalition government deals? This paper examines the
   short-term consequences of coalition government formation on voters in
   European democracies relying on survey panel data and original content
   analysis of coalition agreements. It tests theoretical expectations that
   deal with both the actual and perceived ideological shifts parties make
   when joining coalition deals as well as the effect of a much simpler
   heuristic cue based on preferences. The findings indicate that coalition
   deals have consequences on party preferences, but voter perceptions play
   a much stronger effect than the actual content of coalition deals. These
   results have important implications for our understanding of public
   opinion and provide important insights into the current difficulties and
   challenges of government formation and representative democracy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how China's COVID-19 aid efforts affected its
   soft power in Italy through analyzing data on China's COVID-19-related
   aid from Italy's main national newspapers during the period March-April
   2020. Previous research has focused on China's mask diplomacy in
   relation to its impact in Europe, primarily discussing the geopolitical
   nature of Chinese aid and arguing that China manipulated the pandemic to
   change COVID-19 narrative. While these scholars provided significant
   insights into China's aid in Europe, their research failed to provide
   country specific studies and lack inquiry into the domestic role played
   by China's public diplomacy overseas. This article finds that, while
   China's COVID-19-related aid have often been negatively portraited in
   European media, this has not been the case for Italy, when analyzing the
   news reports on the arrival of China's aid in national newspapers during
   the period March-April 2020. Through assessing secondary data collected
   from newspapers, this article argues that China's aid allowed the
   country to increase its visibility in Italy, especially during the
   initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if there is no direct
   correlation between higher visibility and increased soft power, this
   paper finds that increasing visibility in national newspapers allowed
   Italians to see China more positively. The paper concludes that China's
   understanding of soft power is still undergoing enormous changes and
   that one should not simply understand China's aid as a way to increase
   its soft power globally, but its overseas aid are considered a powerful
   tool to boost its domestic conviction that it is global responsible
   leader helping the world.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of sustained critique of the South African
   Constitution, this article undertakes an empirical examination of
   post-apartheid transformative constitutionalism using the example of
   mineral rights adjudication. Focusing on a series of emblematic mineral
   rights cases tackling a range of transformation fault lines and
   interests, the article explores how the judiciary, as arbiter of
   transformative constitutionalism, has interpreted the transformation
   mandate in response to contestation by marginalised groups and
   interests. In doing so, the article highlights the receptiveness of the
   constitutional framework to increasingly disruptive transformative
   claims, including those that have begun to pit community struggles
   against more conservative government notions of transformation.},

Abstract = {Hegel calls social life ``the living good,{''} but what this means is
   unclear. The idea expresses an ontological claim about the kind of being
   that human societies possess, but it is also normatively significant,
   clarifying why the category of social pathology is an appropriate tool
   of social critique. Social life consists in processes of life infused
   with ethical content. Societies are normatively and functionally
   constituted living beings that realize the good similarly to how
   organisms achieve their vital ends: via specialized, coordinated
   functions. In distinction to living organisms, the living good realizes
   itself through the consciousness and will of individual social members.},

Abstract = {One of the most important decisions coalition partners make when forming
   a government is the division of ministries. Ministerial portfolios
   provide the party in charge with considerable informational and
   agenda-setting advantages, which parties can use to shape policies
   according to their preferences. Oversight mechanisms in parliaments play
   a central role in mitigating ministerial policy discretion, allowing
   coalition partners to control each other even though power has been
   delegated to individual ministers. However, we know relatively little
   about how such mechanisms influence the agenda-setting and gatekeeping
   powers of ministers and how much influence minister parties have on
   policy output relative to the government as a whole in different
   institutional settings. We fill this gap by analyzing original data on
   over 2000 important social and economic policy reform measures adopted
   in nine Western European countries over 20 years, based on a coding of
   more than 1200 country reports issued by the Economist Intelligence Unit
   and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
   We find that parliaments with strong oversight powers constrain the
   agenda-setting capacity of minister parties but have limited impact on
   their gatekeeping capacity. Our findings have important implications for
   our understanding of policy-making and democratic accountability.},

Abstract = {We use the quasi-random assignment of cases to three-judge panels on the
   US Courts of Appeals to assess the consistency of adjudication of death
   penalty appeals. We find clear evidence that panels apply different
   standards depending on whether a majority of the panel was appointed by
   Democratic or Republican presidents. Unlike previous work on panel
   effects in the US Courts of Appeals, we show that these effects persist
   to the end of the process of adjudication. Since the early 1980s, the
   probability of ultimate execution has been increased for inmates when
   their first court of appeals case was assigned to a panel with a
   majority of Republican appointees.},

Abstract = {Talk of fraud dominated President Donald J. Trump's campaign and time in
   office. In this article, we explore whether members of Congress followed
   Trump's lead in discussing all types of fraud, including electoral fraud
   as well as fraud, waste, and abuse. Using a unique dataset of the
   universe of congressional electronic newsletters from 2010 to 2021, we
   show that Republicans wrote to constituents about fraud much more than
   Democrats, especially about electoral fraud after Trump's election, but
   it was Democrats who used angrier rhetoric to discuss fraud, a check on
   the President and many of the false claims about voter fraud in 2016 and
   2020. These findings show an important aspect of the inter-party and
   inter-branch dynamics at play during Trump's presidency; once keen to
   focus on fraud, waste and abuse in government congressional Republican
   attention shifted once the head of the executive branch was a
   co-partisan to parroting the claims of electoral and voter fraud made by
   the President.},

Abstract = {Signaling games are central to political science but often have multiple
   equilibria, leading to no definitive prediction. We demonstrate that
   these indeterminacies create substantial problems when fitting theory to
   data: they lead to ill-defined and discontinuous likelihoods even if the
   game generating the data has a unique equilibrium. In our experiments,
   currently used techniques frequently fail to uncover the parameters of
   the canonical crisis-signaling game, regardless of sample size and
   number of equilibria in the data generating process. We propose three
   estimators that remedy these problems, outperforming current best
   practices. We fit the signaling model to data on economic sanctions. Our
   solutions find a novel U-shaped relationship between audience costs and
   the propensity for leaders to threaten sanctions, which current best
   practices fail to uncover.},

Title = {Crisis signaling: how Italy's coronavirus lockdown affected incumbent
   support in other European countries},

Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {451-467},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is an unparalleled global crisis. Yet, despite the
   grave adversity faced by citizens, incumbents around the world
   experienced a boost in popularity during the onset of the outbreak. In
   this study, we examine how the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in one
   country affected incumbent support in other countries. Specifically, we
   leverage the fact that the first country-wide lockdown on European soil,
   in Italy on 9 March 2020, happened during the fieldwork of surveys
   conducted in four other European countries, France, Germany, Poland and
   Spain. This allows us to examine how an event abroad that alerted
   citizens to an imminent crisis-prior to a similar domestic government
   response-influenced incumbent support. Our results indicate a crisis
   signal effect of Italy's COVID-19 lockdown, as support for the incumbent
   increased domestically in other European countries after the lockdown.
   Importantly, these findings suggest that incumbents can benefit from a
   crisis unfolding in other countries, even when their own performance in
   response to the same crisis is not yet fully clear. They illustrate the
   importance of developments abroad for incumbent approval and the
   difficulty facing citizens seeking to disentangle performance signals
   from exogenous shocks.},

   phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, with a method of monographic
   procedure and technique of searching for indirect documentation,
   highlighting bibliographic sources and news about the selected theme.
   Therefore, it is concluded that the media criminology in practice in
   Brazil maintains the invisibility of massive social damage, managing
   information and data in a differential way, while adapting to digital
   media stimulates the consumption of violence related to crime, ignoring
   the profound problems that affect the Brazilian reality. Thus, the
   attention to algorithms as a fundamental part of the media definition
   helps to understand how the population's direction is moved away from
   complex issues, unprecedented, leveraged by strategies that prompt
   immediate reactions towards the profitability of the current model of
   crime consumption.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to interpret the concept of democracy
   from some social, political and philosophical assumptions. Although
   democracy is a political system based on the participation of the people
   to elect rulers, currently scholars such as Anthony Giddens, Norberto
   Bobbio, David Held and others in this line have been given the task of
   rethinking the concept keeping in mind the social and political
   perspectives. Therefore, the article explores, from the perspective of
   several authors, the conceptual contributions that allow broadening the
   horizon of understanding of those practices, institutions and values
   that, together with legal norms, structure democracy and enable it to
   fulfill its objectives, without which its operation would be defective
   or it could even cease to exist. To achieve this, a hermeneutic
   methodology is proposed, which not only allows the interpretation of the
   texts, but also comes to converge with the experience of understanding
   about the world, about the thing, that experience that makes us close to
   what un-hides. In this sense, democracy is not something given, but is
   in continuous improvement, always looking for an ideal to follow, which
   allows improving the quality of life of its governed and limiting the
   abuses of power.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyse the consumption patterns
   incorporating the demographic effects in Mexico using the ENIGH-2018.
   The main results show that the consumption patterns for different goods
   i can be specified as a function of total expenditure, of the
   demographic variables and the control variables such as economic and
   social characteristics. The demographic characteristics such as the
   number of members and children in the household affects the expenditure
   patterns of the household. For example, the proportion of expenditure in
   food and house with respect to total expenditure of the households is
   larger in households without children than with children and the
   proportion of expenditure with respect to total expenditure is larger in
   education and amusement in households with children than without
   children. Furthermore, the number of members and children modified the
   expenditure in food, education, housing, transport and clothes and the
   Engel expenditure elasticities indicate that food and clothes are
   necessary goods and education and amusement are, in general, luxury
   goods.},

Abstract = {From the moment that he first announced his presidential candidacy until
   his final days in office, Donald Trump's signature personal political
   cause was the restriction of immigration. Media coverage and public
   debate often focused on Trump's rhetorical invocation of this issue and
   emphasized his opposition to undocumented immigration in particular, as
   symbolized by his famous proposal to build a wall across the southern
   border of the United States. But while the wall itself was not
   completed, the Trump administration worked aggressively through the
   federal bureaucracy to reduce all forms of immigration. The Trump
   administration's record on immigration should therefore be understood as
   extending far beyond charged presidential rhetoric and sporadic
   wall-building efforts, leaving a much more consequential substantive
   legacy in American immigration policy that will not be quickly or easily
   reversed by future presidents.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted to identify the environmental component in the
   development of agrotourism and its impact on the psychological state of
   society in the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience of European countries
   shows the environmental, economic, and social benefits of agrotourism.
   The methodological basis of the study is the general scientific methods
   of cognition and social processes (analysis, synthesis, generalization,
   classification) together with sociological methods of obtaining
   empirical data. The National Tourism Organization of Ukraine has
   declared 2020 as the year of green rural tourism, an important component
   from which agrotourism arises. It is concluded that, la peculiarity of
   the development of agrotourism in Ukraine at the current stage is the
   acquisition of innovative forms of organization according to the growing
   needs of consumers, the efficient use of the natural, ecological,
   socioeconomic, and historical-cultural potential of the territory and
   the achievement of the required level of profitability. The situation of
   crisis and instability is accompanied by the presence of uncertainty
   associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to form the concept of
   tourism development 4.0; introduction of ICT and development of
   innovative technologies in agrotourism in rural areas; training of
   professionals in the field of agrotourism.},

   very important and in the case of Andalusianism the mythification of

Title = {Housing Policy Reframed? How Conceptual Framing Affects Support for
   Social Housing Policies in Germany},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {381-402},

Abstract = {Housing policy is a growing problem in many countries. Three online
   experiments were conducted to test framing effects in the context of
   housing policies in Germany. In experiment 1 (N = 303), urban growth was
   either described as `rural exodus' or `influx' of the rural population
   into urban areas. Experiment 2 (N = 300) focused on framing effects in
   the current expropriation debate in Germany. A reacquisition policy of
   private housing was either framed as a measure of `expropriation' or
   `repurchase'. In experiment 3 (N = 311), a vacancy taxation was either
   labelled to `punish' or `overcome' actual problems with housing
   shortage. A mini meta-analysis across all three studies shows that
   conceptual framing affects policy support in a consistent way. The data
   supports our hypotheses that framing has the power to influence mental
   representations of policy and solutions. Moreover, moderation analyses
   were conducted to systematically test the influence of political
   ideology and perceived issue relevance on framing effects. Results
   indicate that participants' ideological self-placement partly affects
   the effectiveness of linguistic framing in some contexts. Thus, the
   results expand existing knowledge about the effectiveness of political
   framing, by making visible not only the possibilities but also the
   boundaries of framing strategies.},

Abstract = {Japan has emerged as a critical strategic actor in East Asia amidst
   intensifying US-China structural competition since 2010. Southeast
   Asia/ASEAN is an important dimension of Japan's foreign policy
   expansion. This paper argues that Japan's foreign policy is driven by
   the aim of becoming an alternative source of strategic stability in
   Southeast Asia/ASEAN as opposed to the United States and China. This is
   explained by analysing Japan's foreign policy in regional balance of
   power and ASEAN-led multilateralism.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study is to analyze the rule of law in the context
   of the implementation of reforms of the judiciary, the judiciary, and
   related legal institutions as a direction to ensure the accessibility of
   administrative justice in Ukraine, revealing its relationship and
   interdependence. The study found that the availability of administrative
   procedures is provided by the requirements of all these generic
   subsystems of the principles that determine modern standards of activity
   in European countries. The methodology includes a comprehensive analysis
   and generalization of the available scientific and theoretical material,
   as well as the formulation of relevant conclusions. During the research,
   scientific cognition methods were used: terminological,
   logical-semantic, functional, system-structural, logical-normative,
   comparative. They highlight in the conclusions that the study found that
   the amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine in the context of judicial
   reform made it possible to revise the classical principles of the
   judiciary, but there are still important unresolved aspects to ensure
   full compliance with the rule of law, its specification in the
   constitutional provisions and legislative acts of Ukraine of substantive
   and procedural content, among other aspects.},

Title = {Ethiopia: Trump's Securitization `Speech Act' on the Grand Ethiopian

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {36},
Pages = {66-82},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The involvement of the United States in the negotiation process of the
   GERD was taken as a good step forward to end the belligerent water
   diplomacy between Egypt and Ethiopia. However, America's peace proposal
   which is named `the Trump deal' ends up further complicating the two
   countries water diplomacy. Trump's securitization `speech act' calling
   Egypt to `blow up' Ethiopia's dam further escalated the risk of water
   war between the two states. Eventually, the Trump lead negotiation
   eroded the perception that the United States would generate a good
   proposal to halt the belligerency of the Ethio-Egypt relations. This
   article is intended to chart a new insight on the following questions:
   given the unpleasant water diplomacy between Egypt and Ethiopia how the
   Trump deal' and securitization `speech act' further complicated the
   matter? Why President Trump worked in securitizing the construction of
   the GERD on the Blue Nile? And how does the nature of securitization and
   counter-securitization activities worked in the water diplomacy between
   Egypt and Ethiopia? In the process of analysis the Copenhagen School
   (CS) concept of securitization is employed.},

Abstract = {Effective counteraction to corruption remains relevant in some countries
   of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, given that manifestations
   of corruption are a real obstacle to the realization of human rights,
   social justice, economic development and jeopardizes the proper
   functioning of a market economy. However, if such countries of the
   region, such as Poland, succeeded in ensuring the implementation of an
   effective anti-corruption policy, a number of post-Soviet countries, in
   particular Ukraine, faced significant obstacles to overcoming corruption
   and effectively implementing national anti-corruption policies.
   Therefore, within this article, a comparative legal analysis of the
   anti-corruption legislation of these countries has been carried out. The
   state of implementation of national anti-corruption policies and the
   formulated conclusions, which provide answers to the questions of
   improving the implementation of national anti-corruption policy, in
   particular Ukraine, are considered. Thus, the existence of modern
   national anti-corruption legislation that best meets the requirements
   and recommendations on which the state relies on relevant international
   treaties can be the key to successful anti-corruption efforts.},

Abstract = {An increasing literature has studied the recent growth of populist
   parties and the determinants of their electoral success. This article
   contributes to this body by addressing the question of whether cordon
   sanitaires or tainted coalitions are more effective at hindering the
   electoral success of populist parties. Building on the populist parties
   and cost of governing literatures, we hypothesize that populist parties
   suffer considerable loses at the ballot box when they join coalition
   governments as junior partners. Moreover, we test various mechanisms for
   this negative effect: poor economic conditions, the existence of
   parliamentary majorities, ideological extremism and low intra-cabinet
   conflict. Using data from ParlGov and Kluver and Spoon, we find strong
   support for the main hypothesis, and additional analyses suggest that
   when populists join coalitions as junior partners they lose extra
   electoral support if they are ideological extreme, there is low
   intra-cabinet conflict, or their coalition has a parliamentary majority.},

Abstract = {Civil liberties are a linchpin of liberal democracy, and are central to
   the practice and discourse of American politics. However, there is
   little research exploring whether or to what extent group attitudes
   influence public opinion on constitutionally guaranteed liberties. For
   this reason, we seek to shed light on whether the public actually views
   rights as fundamental, or whether attitudes toward groups - in this
   case, racial groups - moderate attitudes about civil liberties. We use a
   series of survey experiments to assess whether public support for
   constitutional protections - such as those found in the First, Second,
   and Fifth Amendments - is contingent on respondents' attitudes toward
   the group identity of those benefiting from these protections. We show
   that while Americans do hold civil liberties in high esteem, attitudes
   toward a variety of constitutional rights are significantly conditioned
   by attitudes toward the group exercising a given right. Our findings
   indicate a gap between the ideal of civil liberties and what we see in
   reality, and suggest that racial attitudes may be endangering a core
   tenet of our political system.},

Abstract = {Combining insights from the history of citizenship with contemporary
   legal analysis, this article both highlights and problematizes what we
   may call sorting strategies - restrictive closure and selective openness
   - which rely on `varieties of affluence' (income, wealth, equity,
   credit, and the like) in shaping possibilities for entry, settlement,
   and naturalization. By emphasizing the growing significance of income
   barriers and thresholds on the one hand, and fast-tracked
   investment-based entryways on the other, this article investigates the
   role of wealth as both accelerator and barrier to citizenship,
   contributing to the varied toolbox used by governments to advance goals
   that may at times appear contradictory; these tools both tighten and
   relax the requirements of access to membership at the same time. These
   new developments represent different facets of the same trend. Without
   explicitly stating as much, programs that turn wealth into a core
   criterion for admission conceptually reignite an older, exclusive, and
   exclusionary vision according to which individuals must hold property
   (in land, resources, or in relation to one's `dependents,' including
   women, slaves, and children) in order to qualify as a citizen. While
   such a trajectory is no stranT8ger to ancient models, it raises profound
   challenges to modernist accounts of political membership that place
   equality at their core.},

Abstract = {On 17 March 2021, just four days before the England and Wales census
   date, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) conceded in a judicial
   review case. The case concerned the meaning of the sex question in the
   census, and the guidance to accompany this question. How did the ONS end
   up in court defending its guidance on a question which most people would
   deem self-explanatory? This article explains the legislative and
   political context around gender recognition, and the consequences for
   data collection. Drawing on my own experiences, I explore the
   politicisation of the definition of sex, and argue that the ONS gave
   undue weight to lobby groups with a particular viewpoint on sex and
   gender identity.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {25},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {This article examines the rise of `defiant citizenship' in Hangberg, a
   historic fishing village set on the lower slopes of the Sentinel
   Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa. Defiant citizenship affirms
   membership of the state, but on terms that assert the primacy of
   residents' right of belonging in, and sovereignty over, the place of
   Hangberg, even against the will of the state. This form of citizenship
   is rooted in long-standing experience of racial, economic and cultural
   marginality, deep disappointment with the post-apartheid order, and a
   strong attachment to local place.The defiant citizenship of Hangberg is
   explained by national and local, as well as international, dynamics.
   International dynamics centre on the precarity of tenure linked to the
   neo-liberalisation of property relations. National dynamics centre on
   perceptions of enduring and systemic racial exclusion from the
   post-apartheid order, and local dynamics refer to a history of local
   place-making associated with the environment of the sea and the
   mountain. We show how residents of Hangberg have constructed a new form
   of political subjectivity from a marginal and racialised position that
   disrupts citizen/foreigner notions of inclusion and exclusion, and
   reclaims marginality through implicit and explicit appeals to belonging
   and local sovereignty of place.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, a wave of Islamist-related terrorist attacks took
   place in Western Europe, mainly in France and Belgium but with relevant
   episodes also in the United Kingdom whereas so far Italy did not suffer
   any attack of this kind. Each of these countries hosts a large number of
   Muslim immigrants and communities, participated in military missions in
   the Middle East, and has been repeatedly threatened by ISIS (Islamic
   State of Iraq and Syria) or other Islamist-related radical groups. What
   then explains the difference in the number and intensity of
   Islamist-related terrorist attacks in Western European countries? Using
   qualitative cross-case comparison case studies and relying on the Global
   Terrorism Database (GTD) and the Association of Religion Data Archive
   (ARDA), I argue that countries directly discriminating toward Islamic
   communities are more likely to suffer these kinds of attacks because
   this discrimination causes grievances against the host state within the
   discriminated minority. This effect is higher in the presence of
   religious and cultural networks where these grievances can be brought at
   the center of the public debate and be connected together because of the
   presence of large audiences, resulting in the possible development of
   more radicalized positions of small portions of the discriminated
   community. This is particularly true for highly secular states like
   France, where the interpretation of secularism makes accommodation for
   religious minorities extremely challenging, also resulting in laws that
   regulate religious behavior of minorities, therefore increasing outrage
   and frustration of the minority group.},

Abstract = {How do the transaction costs of office holding affect congressional
   careers? These costs may influence the kinds of people who select into
   public office and therefore the representativeness of democratic
   institutions. Gaining causal leverage on this question has been
   difficult given that many costs associated with office holding are
   endogenous to characteristics of legislators. Using a natural
   experiment, we examine the effect of exogenous changes in transaction
   costs in the US Congress caused by changes in the availability of direct
   flights from home districts to Washington, DC. We find that gaining an
   airport that provides a round-trip direct flight to Washington, DC, is
   associated with an approximately 1.6 percentage point increase in the
   probability that a member runs for reelection. One implication of these
   results is that members more sensitive to office-holding costs-such as
   moderates or members of underrepresented groups-may be less likely to
   seek and maintain political careers.},

Abstract = {What informs ordinary citizens' attitudes toward the use of force?
   Previous research identifies several key concerns in public opinion
   toward war, but does not directly evaluate the relative importance of
   these considerations. We articulate three distinct logics of war
   support-moral, legal, and instrumental-and use an experimental survey
   with 3,000 U.S. respondents to test how ordinary citizens make
   trade-offs among multiple competing imperatives relevant for decision
   making in war. Our design is the first to isolate to what extent
   substantive legal demands, instrumental military imperatives, and
   specific moral principles are reflected in respondents' preferences.
   Although all logics have some resonance, we find that respondents'
   preferences are remarkably consistent with several core demands of
   international law even though respondents are not told that the legality
   of the use of force is at stake. Only the imperative to minimize U.S.
   military casualties overwhelms both legal and moral demands.},

Abstract = {Image-building has been an important goal of China's foreign policy.
   Humanitarian diplomacy provides a useful instrument to build a benign
   international image, given the altruistic nature of humanitarian action.
   China's humanitarian diplomacy has undergone changes in recent years,
   such as substantial increases in humanitarian spending, institutional
   reforms and the emergence of Chinese non-state actors. The existing
   literature on China's humanitarian activities is scant due to the
   country's limited engagement in global humanitarian action previously.
   This article aims to contribute to the scholarship by examining China's
   humanitarian activities in Southeast Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic
   through the lens of image-building. Specifically, it answers the
   questions of how China uses humanitarian action to improve its
   international image and how effective such efforts have been. This
   article finds that the outcome of China's image-building through
   humanitarian activities is influenced by the severity of the crisis, the
   national response of the country affected and the perceived legitimacy
   of China's action. It concludes that China's humanitarian diplomacy has
   achieved mixed outcomes in Southeast Asia. While China has been
   recognized as a major provider of help during the pandemic, its
   assistance has not substantially improved its image in the region.},

Abstract = {The presidential candidacy announcement or declaration speech represents
   a major political marketing effort. Much goes into its staging, text,
   and performance. Campaigns rely on this debut to stake out a strategic
   position with respect to their declared and expected competitors, one
   that will yield a prevailing share of votes from a coalition of voters
   the campaigns will try to assemble out of the eligible population. In
   this study I examine the rhetorical composition of these heralding
   events based on a quasi-literary analysis of speeches and debut
   alternatives (such as a video) by 37 major candidates who announced
   their candidacies in 2015 (for the 2016 nominations and election) and
   2019 ( for 2020). I review the historical development of the declaration
   speech and set out ten of its formal elements. I show how a rich sense
   of a candidate's character -political orientation, style, and
   comparative strengths and weaknesses- can be discerned in these
   addresses. I contend that the choices behind and the qualities of the
   declaration speech reveal much about the aptness of a candidate for the
   office of president.},

Abstract = {Debt has become an essential part of many people's daily lives. This
   article develops a new comparative political economy perspective on the
   relationship between welfare states and household borrowing. I argue
   that the ways in which welfare states distribute benefits, and credit
   regimes provide access to credit, affect how individuals address social
   risks and, as a consequence, shape patterns of indebtedness. Permissive
   credit regimes substitute for social policies in limited welfare states,
   pushing economically disadvantaged groups into debt. Alternatively,
   credit markets complement social policies in the provision of financial
   liquidity in comprehensive welfare states, protecting vulnerable groups
   through government benefits while allowing less-protected affluent
   groups to borrow money. In restrictive regimes, people instead rely on
   savings, expenditure cuts, and family support. I test these arguments
   using an original measure of credit regime permissiveness,
   cross-national survey data, and full-population administrative records
   from Denmark and panel data from the United States.},

Abstract = {In 2018, the Japanese government introduced a controversial education
   policy, which made moral education (dotoku) a formal (as opposed to
   supplementary) subject in elementary schools, and the new scheme intends
   to teach, foster, and grade patriotic feelings among school children. By
   referring to semi-autobiographical narratives of 80 Japanese college
   students, this exploratory study delves into the question of how the
   Japanese college youth perceive the efficacy of patriotic education. Do
   we need to teach school children how to love Japan? If so, how? If not,
   why? This study suggests that the youth narratives do not necessarily
   align with this shift.},

Abstract = {Scholars of mining policies are beginning to understand how the most
   recent boom in commodity prices (2000-2014) influenced the institutional
   development of the mining sector in Latin America. We contribute to this
   literature by studying the design, dynamics, and outcomes of
   interorganizational coordination in Colombia and Ecuador. Our findings
   show that, despite their divergent policies, both countries failed to
   integrate the mining sector's three main policy games-formalizing
   artisan and small-scale operations, increasing the number of large-scale
   projects, and tackling illegal extraction. Several characteristics of
   the design of coordination initiatives influenced policy failure-the
   reliance on hierarchy mechanisms to motivate coordination, the lack of
   specificity of the coordination mandates, and the lack of specific
   resources for coordination. Contextual factors also shaped the dynamics
   and outcomes of coordination. The limited geographical spread of
   artisanal and small-scale mining and of illegal extraction, the
   environmental sector's weakness, and the creation of a multilayered
   structure for public-sector coordination contributed to policy
   effectiveness in Ecuador. On the other hand, the ample spread of
   artisanal and small-scale mining and of illegal extraction, the lack of
   a clear coordinating structure, and the environmental sector's growing
   vigor contributed to sustained policy failure in Colombia.},

Abstract = {Political collective action requires assembling and motivating
   supporters. Many theories view emotions as functional tools for managing
   relationships, including within groups. We study what leads citizens to
   use the emotions anger and gratitude as social pressure. Specifically,
   we test what determines the use of these emotions to prevent potential
   exiters from leaving a political group and to encourage potential
   recruits to join. Because parties are enduring social affiliations
   (compared to transient or issue-focused groups), we predicted that
   partisans would express stronger emotions. We tested this proposition in
   two separate studies-one an observational study featuring a
   representative sample of US adults and one an experimental study
   conducted in Denmark. As predicted, people with a partisan mindset,
   whether naturally occurring or experimentally manipulated, felt more
   anger and gratitude at potential exiters and recruits. Citizens strive
   to fortify and expand their ingroups and sometimes use emotions as
   social pressure to do so.},

Abstract = {Several political scientists argue that electorally vulnerable
   legislators should be more likely to cast, rather than skip, legislative
   roll call votes. However, most empirical studies find limited evidence
   to support this claim. In this article, we argue that electorally
   vulnerable members serving in the House of Representatives are more
   likely to engage in position taking, via casting a roll call vote rather
   than abstaining, on a certain subset of legislative votes. We suggest
   that roll call votes that the president has publicly addressed should be
   especially ripe for legislators to engage in position taking because of
   the executive branch's unique influence on electoral politics for
   legislators. When examining all roll call votes in the 84th through the
   112th Congress in the House of Representatives, we find that members who
   barely won their last election are associated with a higher attendance
   record on roll calls that the president has revealed his preferences on.
   We also find that electorally vulnerable members are less likely to
   abstain on roll call votes that pass or fail by a narrow margin. These
   findings shed light on legislative-executive relations.},

Abstract = {Recent studies directing attention to how people perceive and define
   politics have provided valuable contributions to our knowledge of what
   people do and do not think of as politics. Taken together, the results
   suggest that individuals' conceptualisations of politics tend to vary.
   Considerably less is known, however, about how conceptualisations are
   related to behaviour. This study aims to fill that gap, by testing the
   hypothesis that those with a wider conception of what constitutes
   politics are also more likely to participate in political activities.
   Drawing on data from a survey administered to students at a Swedish
   University, the key result shows a clear and positive correlation
   between conceptualisations of politics and political participation,
   suggesting that the more issues that people perceive as politics, the
   more likely it is that they are involved in varieties of political
   participation. Furthermore, the relationship was still present during
   analyses including other well-known predictors of participation. This
   indicates that conceptualisations of politics seem to capture variation
   in individual political participation better than traditional predictors
   such as political interest, internal political efficacy, and political
   awareness. It further suggests that perceptions of politics constitute a
   distinct political orientation, above and beyond these well-known
   important factors for understanding political participation. Overall,
   these results are a first indication that future studies of political
   participation should not neglect. We therefore suggest that the field of
   political participation should incorporate indicators of both
   conceptualisations of politics and political participation.},

Abstract = {The progressive militarization of outer space presents a range of policy
   and legal challenges for NATO due to its reliance on space assets for
   operational effectiveness and the increased vulnerabilities of these
   assets. Indeed, dependence on space-based assets and services in the
   conduct of military operations has become something of an Achilles heel
   for NATO as peer and near-peer competitors are honing their
   counter-space capabilities. Given the vulnerability of space-based
   assets and services to hostile interference, the question presents
   itself whether, and under what circumstances, the collective defense
   commitment, as set out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (NAT),
   arises in space. NATO's ability and resolve to counter threats in space
   could be challenged due to the uncertain parameters of the right of
   self-defense itself when exercised in space and the geographical limits
   that Article 6 of the NAT imposes on the operation of Article 5 of the
   NAT.},

Abstract = {The rally-around-the-flag effect describes the tendency of public
   opinion to become more favourable toward political leaders in times of
   crises. Political leaders rarely can exchange this initial
   rally-around-effect into long-term support, however. The central
   question addressed in this paper is, why political leaders cannot
   maintain this increase in support over time. Based on three-wave panel
   data collected during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden (N
   = 1716), this paper investigates why political leaders cannot maintain
   initial popular support in the long run. Empirically, we find that
   perceptions of how Sweden is affected by the crisis and political
   ideology are both important drivers to understand the declining
   government approval following a rally-around-the-flag effect.},

Abstract = {There are growing concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic is strengthening
   nationalism around the world by fueling discrimination, unilateralism,
   and economic crises. However, there have been few empirical analyses of
   the effect of the pandemic on individuals' level of nationalism. Using
   evidence from two original surveys conducted in Canada in 2019 and 2020,
   I show that public support for international economic integration has
   increased rather than decreased since the outbreak of the pandemic. The
   survey data point to economic anxiety induced by the pandemic as a key
   mechanism shaping individuals' attitudes towards international economic
   integration. While the existing literature has found that negative
   economic sentiment depresses support for international economic
   integration, economic anxiety appears to be positively related to
   support for integration in the COVID-19 era. My findings therefore run
   counter to current arguments about the effect of the pandemic and to
   expectations based on the existing literature. Gaining a better
   empirical understanding of the relationship between the pandemic and
   nationalism in public opinion is particularly important at a time when
   international cooperation is needed to address both COVID-19 and its
   economic effects.},

Title = {The comparative effectiveness of populist rhetoric in generating online
   engagement},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Worldwide, voters are supporting populist candidates who promise to
   upend ``politics as usual.{''} Despite all we know about populism, we
   still do not know how individuals respond to populist content during
   campaigns, particularly compared to other common content in liberal
   democracies. This paper adapts framing theory to an online electoral
   context to argue that populist campaign messages will generate more
   online engagement compared to three alternative conceptions of the
   relationship between the people and the elites: pluralism, technocracy,
   and neutral messages. The paper adapts Snow and Benford's seminal 1988
   theory of resonance to studies of populist communication and assess
   whether populism resonates more with online social media users. An
   original dataset using the campaign Tweets of 22 national-level actors
   across five countries is used to test the theory: Brazil, Mexico,
   Colombia, Italy, and Spain (N = 1777). The findings suggest that
   citizens on Twitter engage with populism more than its alternatives in
   certain contexts.},

Title = {An unjustified bad reputation? The Dark Triad and support for populism},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While research concludes that populist leaders stand out for their
   ``dark{''} personalities, studies on the psychological underpinnings of
   citizens' populist attitudes are scant and inconclusive, with some
   agreement on the association between disagreeableness and populist
   attitudes. By bringing the Dark Triad personality traits of narcissism,
   psychopathy, and Machiavellianism into the picture, we aim to answer
   whether populist citizens -like populist leaders-score higher in this
   dark traits, and whether the addition of the Dark Triad helps to better
   understanding the populist personality. Using an online Spanish sample,
   our analyses find that using the Dark Triad does indeed add to our
   understanding of populist attitudes. In opposition to widespread
   intuitions about the character of populists, we find that psychopathy
   and Machiavellianism are negatively associated with support for
   populism, with only narcissism being positively related to the
   people-centric dimension of populist attitudes.},

   fostering resilience to strengthen security perceptions},

Abstract = {To what extent does societal resilience help to prevent governance
   breakdown? The EU's southern neighbourhood has been troubled by multiple
   security risks in recent years. The security situation of many citizens
   is uncertain and local populations frequently feel insecure, an
   indication of governance breakdown. Resilience has become a new focus in
   preventing a breakdown of governance. Yet, the extent to which
   resilience can help prevent governance breakdown remains unclear.
   Building on original survey data from Libya and Tunisia this study
   contributes empirical evidence to the debate. The article shows that
   limited statehood and order contestation do not necessarily lead to a
   breakdown of governance. Although both risks affect Tunisia and Libya to
   different degrees none of them are strongly correlated with the security
   perceptions of local populations. Additionally, resilience is key in
   preventing governance breakdown. Social trust and the legitimacy of
   governance actors are two main sources of resilience helping to prevent
   a breakdown of governance. Moreover, resilience has divergent effects on
   different dimensions of security governance breakdown. While resilience
   has stronger effects on national security perceptions, local security
   considerations are partly driven by other factors such as individuals'
   economic resources.},

Abstract = {Scholars of foreign policy decision-making have argued that
   international interactions ultimately are grounded in people acting
   singly or in groups. Unfortunately, data limitations prevent many of
   these crucial foreign policy decision-making theories from being
   rigorously tested and systematically compared with theories from
   alternative perspectives. A promising approach to remedying this
   deficiency is the addition of decision-making variables to existing,
   large-N data sets. In this study, we coded a series of foreign policy
   decision-making variables for all U.S. cases in the International Crisis
   Behavior (ICB) data set, and examined how these decision-making
   variables compared with structural factors in shaping crisis outcomes.
   The results reveal that when controlling for structural factors such as
   conflict setting and power discrepancy, foreign policy decision-making
   variables related to leaders' traits, advisory structure, and the
   political context shaped the severity and centrality of violence
   employed by the United States. We conclude that including
   decision-making variables alongside structural variables will enhance
   the quality of data analysis in the areas of conflict studies and
   foreign policy analysis.},

Abstract = {Studying patterns of interest representation in politics is a central
   concern of scholars working on interest groups and lobbying. However,
   systematic empirical analysis of interest group representation entails a
   large amount of coding and is potentially prone to error. This letter
   addresses the potential of two computational methods in enabling
   large-scale analyses of interest group representation. We discuss the
   trade-offs associated with each method and empirically compare a manual,
   a query-based, and an off-the-shelf supervised machine learning approach
   to identify interest groups in a sample of 3000 news stories. Our
   results demonstrate the potential of automated methods, especially when
   used in combination.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on the grant of citizenship by naturalization
   largely focuses on the experience of Europe and the immigrant-founded
   states of the Americas and Australasia. This article considers the
   African experience. It sets out the comparative law on naturalization,
   and the limited information that exists on the implementation of these
   rules in practice, noting that formal naturalization is rare in all
   countries in the continent. The article argues that amendments to the
   rules on naturalization are mainly performative, rather than aiming at
   any broader public policy outcome. Although there have been some
   important initiatives by some states to reach out to particular groups
   excluded from citizenship, these are rare. Yet public attitudes to
   acquisition of citizenship by foreigners are more open than the
   practice. Historically, integration of foreigners into the citizen body
   has happened largely through local processes of certification of
   identity. New efforts to strengthen identification systems in Africa may
   well make these processes more closed, and also make the difficulty of
   formal naturalization more visible.},

Abstract = {Migration and citizenship studies tend to see naturalization as a highly
   ambivalent process which simultaneously includes and excludes migrants.
   Moving beyond this inclusion/exclusion divide, I conceptualize
   naturalization as a subject-formation regime that encourages naturalized
   citizens to transform themselves into political, economic and cultural
   assets to the nation-state, a subjectivity which I term (alluding to its
   overstraining character) the `Super Citizen'. How, then, is the call for
   the Super Citizen received and answered? Based on a thematic analysis of
   interviews with migrants applying for citizenship in either Germany or
   the United Kingdom, this article examines migrants' experiences of
   naturalization and identifies three types of response to the Super
   Citizen call: embrace, contestation, and disaffection. I argue that
   subject-formation is powerful, but not as deterministic as the
   literature suggests. The Super Citizen produces a competition for state
   recognition and new hierarchies among naturalized, national-born, and
   non-national citizens.},

Abstract = {Teaching social sciences frequently involves politically and
   ideologically fraught issues. This study examines the effect of
   students' perceived ideological distance from their professors on their
   academic experience, drawing on a survey of 1,257 students from Social
   Science and Law faculties in Israel across five different universities.
   Congruent with previous findings from the US, the study's results
   demonstrate that perceived ideological distance lowers students'
   evaluations of their professors' commitment to their success.
   Implications of the findings are discussed with reference to the current
   underrepresentation of right-wing and conservative academics in the
   social sciences.},

Abstract = {Terrorism in Pakistan poses a significant risk towards the lives of
   people by violent destruction and physical damage. In addition to human
   loss, such catastrophic activities also affect the financial markets.
   The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of terrorism on the
   volatility of the Pakistan stock market. The financial impact of 339
   terrorist attacks for a period of 18 years (2000-2018) is estimated
   w.r.t. target type, days of the week, and surprise factor. Three
   important macroeconomic variables namely exchange rate, gold, and oil
   were also considered. The findings of the EGARCH (1, 1) model revealed
   that the terrorist attacks targeting the security forces and commercial
   facilities significantly increased the stock market volatility. The
   significant impact of terrorist attacks on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday
   confirms the overreaction of investors to terrorist news. Furthermore,
   the results confirmed the negative linkage between the surprise factor
   and stock market returns. The findings of this study have significant
   implications for investors and policymakers.},

Abstract = {The effects of austerity in response to financial crises are widely
   contested and assumed to cause significant electoral backlash.
   Nonetheless, governments routinely adopt austerity when confronting
   economic downturns and swelling deficits. We explore this puzzle by
   distinguishing public acceptance of austerity as a general approach and
   support for specific austerity packages. Using original survey data from
   five European countries, we show that austerity is in fact the preferred
   response among most voters. We develop potential explanations for this
   surprising preference and demonstrate the empirical limitations of
   accounts centered on economic interests or an intuitive framing
   advantage. Instead, we show that the preference for austerity is highly
   sensitive to its political backers and precise composition of spending
   cuts and tax hikes. Using a novel approach to estimate support for
   historical austerity programs, we contend that governments' strategic
   crafting of policy packages is a key factor underlying the support for
   austerity.},

Abstract = {The emergence of social movements representing strategies of
   emancipation and claims of different grievances has brought several
   shocks to contemporary political thought. The abandonment of the idea of
   a single historical subject is at the basis of different responses such
   as those of ``multitude{''} or ``articulation{''} of claims. The thesis
   of this paper is that intersectional thinking allows us to better
   understand these transformations if we accompany the ideas of
   articulation with a distinction between fraternity based on shared
   experiences and solidarity based on the accompaniment of different
   social claims.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {115},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Speech and dialogue are the heart of politics: nearly every political
   institution in the world involves verbal communication. Yet vast
   literatures on political communication focus almost exclusively on what
   words were spoken, entirely ignoring how they were delivered-auditory
   cues that convey emotion, signal positions, and establish reputation. We
   develop a model that opens this information to principled statistical
   inquiry: the model of audio and speech structure (MASS). Our approach
   models political speech as a stochastic process shaped by fixed and
   time-varying covariates, including the history of the conversation
   itself. In an application to Supreme Court oral arguments, we
   demonstrate how vocal tone signals crucial information-skepticism of
   legal arguments-that is indecipherable to text models. Results show that
   justices do not use questioning to strategically manipulate their peers
   but rather engage sincerely with the presented arguments. Our
   easy-to-use R package, communication, implements the model and many more
   tools for audio analysis.},

Abstract = {Cyber operations targeting government computers and network
   infrastructure are becoming increasingly common and have the potential
   to be extremely damaging. Interstate rivalry has been shown to shape a
   wide range of global patterns. This paper examines the intersection
   between these two important phenomena. It builds upon previous
   scholarship by developing a broader and more nuanced theory of the
   rivalry-cyber operation relationship and testing it empirically with
   newly developed data on cyber operations from 1990 to 2009. Our results
   go beyond existing studies to demonstrate that certain types of
   ``cold{''} rivalries experience elevated numbers of cyber operations,
   while other ``hot{''} rivalries experience fewer incidents. This finding
   sheds new light on our general understanding of the volume and location
   of cyber operations in the international system. It also underscores
   important distinctions among rivalries that help to explain significant
   cyber activities and may help to improve our grasp of other emerging
   threats.},

Abstract = {The following work aims at inquiring into the concepts of ``people{''}
   and ``populism{''} in the theories elaborated by Ernesto Laclau and
   Rodolfo Kusch putting at the core the notions of affection and language.
   For this purpose, Laclau's Politica e ideologia en la teoria marxista
   will be looked at first, followed by La razon populista. In a second
   instance, a revision of Kusch's works will be carried out, namely La
   seduccion de la barbarie and La negacion en el pensamiento popular. In a
   third moment, the authors' view regarding the notions of ``people{''}
   and ``populism{''} will be compared and contrasted. To conclude, the
   importance of affection and language will be considered.},

Abstract = {Rational deliberation helps to avoid cyclic or intransitive group
   preferences by fostering meta-agreements, which in turn ensures
   single-peaked profiles. This is the received view, but this paper argues
   that it should be qualified. On one hand we provide evidence from
   computational simulations that rational deliberation tends to increase
   proximity to so-called single-plateaued preferences. This evidence is
   important to the extent that, as we argue, the idea that rational
   deliberation fosters the creation of meta-agreement and, in turn,
   single-peaked profiles does not carry over to single-plateaued ones, and
   the latter but not the former makes coherent aggregation possible when
   the participants are allowed to express indifference between options. On
   the other hand, however, our computational results show, against the
   received view, that when the participants are strongly biased towards
   their own opinions, rational deliberation tends to create irrational
   group preferences, instead of eliminating them. These results are
   independent of whether the participants reach meta-agreements in the
   process, and as such they highlight the importance of rational
   preference change and biases towards one's own opinion in understanding
   the effects of rational deliberation.},

Abstract = {The status of Taiwan is the most crucial security issue in the Asia
   Pacific region. This article aims to analyze the political and economic
   relations between the United States, Taiwan and the People's Republic of
   China (PRC) between 2008-2018 (the pivotal period in the
   re-establishment of relations across the Strait of Taiwan), and how
   these relations have changed with the new DPP government in Taipei. The
   main conclusion is that for PRC the reunification with Taiwan represents
   a vital point of its geopolitical projection, and a symbolic act of the
   rejuvenation of the nation. Nevertheless, it affects the relations with
   the United States on many different levels. However, the use of
   political and economic instruments to achieve that goal is viewed with
   great suspicion in both Taipei and Washington.},

Abstract = {Post-communist democracies have been notorious for their
   under-institutionalized party systems and unstable governments. However,
   two exceptional cases stand out in the region: Liberal Democracy of
   Slovenia (LDS) ruled the country for 12 years uninterrupted, and the
   Estonian Reform Party (RE) was in government for an unbroken 17 years.
   The article explores the factors that contributed to the success of both
   parties. The results show that long-term governmental parties may emerge
   under the conditions of proportional representation (PR) electoral
   systems and in fragmented and less-institutionalized party systems, if
   those parties use clever coalition strategies, introduce a
   politico-ideological hegemony, and rely on their own internal resources
   in which leadership or organizational capacities are crucial.},

Abstract = {A political epistemology that enables us to determine if political
   actors are likely to know what they need to know must be rooted in an
   ontology of the actors and of the human objects of their knowledge; that
   is, a political anthropology. The political anthropology developed in
   Power Without Knowledge envisions human beings as creatures whose
   conscious actions are determined by their interpretations of what seem
   to them to be relevant circumstances; and whose interpretations are, in
   turn, determined by webs of belief built from somewhat heterogeneous
   streams of incoming ideas. This anthropology, then, has two components.
   Ideational heterogeneity undermines the aspiration of technocracy to
   predict human behavior and the aspiration of social science to arrive at
   lawlike generalizations about it. Ideational determinism, however, which
   is less important than ideational heterogeneity to the critique of
   technocracy, may be more important to generating epistemological
   approaches to other forms of politics, all of which involve the actions
   of human beings who, as such, are largely at the mercy of the fallible
   ideas to which they have been exposed.},

Abstract = {Between 1998 and 2010 public private partnership models, of which the
   private finance initiative (PFI) was the best-known and most widely
   used, became the favoured option to procure school buildings and
   facilities in the UK. This article looks at the multifaceted legacy of
   PFI from a threefold perspective: financial, educational and
   architectural. It highlights the long-term effects of those schemes on
   schools and local authorities and the challenges arising from the burden
   of the debt and the nature of the contracts. Positive changes have been
   observed over time, but also a growing financialisation of school
   projects which has deepened an already sharp divide between the
   different stakeholders. Financial value has been prioritised over
   educational value in the management of contracts, while the procurement
   and construction method has had a clear impact on the quality of school
   buildings. Twenty years on, the PFI experience in education shows the
   persistent flaws of a system in which public authorities cannot fully
   exercise control over projects but have retained responsibility for the
   provision of quality learning environments.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {As evidenced by the 2016 US presidential election, conspiracy theories
   such as birtherism, the belief that Barack Obama is not a natural-born
   citizen, have become more impactful on modern-day liberal democracies.
   This study investigates the consequences of the conspiratorial
   narratives espoused by populist candidates, arguing that the creation of
   a narrative involving a ``conspiring{''} establishment figure can
   positively benefit populist candidates during elections by allowing them
   to position themselves as defenders of ``the people{''}. Taking the case
   of Donald Trump and the birther conspiracy theory, empirical testing
   indicates that by helping to spread birtherism, Donald Trump was able to
   create for himself a core group of supporters who turned out to vote for
   him in both the Republican primaries and general election. Moreover,
   when tests are performed to investigate whether this was a consequence
   of rallying a right-wing base or mainstreaming the fringe conspiracy
   theory, significant positive relationships are demonstrated not with
   more conservative birthers, but instead with the more moderate ones,
   testifying to the strength of the mainstreaming effect.},

Abstract = {US House members have become increasingly reliant on out-of-district
   individuals for fundraising. Yet we have little evidence on how such
   donations might affect representatives' policy decisions. Given the high
   partisanship known to dominate House roll calls, do the preferences of
   individual donors influence policymaking at all? And are members who
   rely on out-of-district contributions more responsive to the preferences
   of the national donor base? This article examines these and related
   questions, producing three main findings. First, even accounting for
   well-established partisanship in House voting, representatives are
   responsive to the policy preferences of the national donor base. Second,
   this donor responsiveness is positively associated with electoral
   safety, including when redistricting exogenously induces the safety.
   Third, the higher a member's reliance on out-of-district donations, the
   greater is their responsiveness to the preferences of the national donor
   base. Together, these findings suggest that current fundraising dynamics
   skew representation in significant ways.},

Abstract = {Despite their alleged anti-systemness and `non-coalitionability',
   radical right and radical left parties have, since the early 1990s, both
   supported and entered coalition governments in a number of European
   liberal democracies. Using the classical `size and ideology' framework,
   this study sets out to examine how - or, put differently, under what
   circumstances - radical right and radical left parties are able to
   overcome the obstacles associated with governing and enter coalition
   governments. Inspired by previous observations regarding the complex and
   multicausal nature of radical government participation, the study relies
   on a configurational method. By means of a fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 37 radical parties at 207 coalition
   formation instances in 22 (Western and Central and Eastern) European
   countries, the article sheds light on different paths that lead to
   government inclusion (and exclusion) of radical actors. The empirical
   evidence indicates that electoral success in combination with a fairly
   similar policy position to a weak prime minister party is sufficient for
   government inclusion. The paths to government exclusion, by contrast,
   underline the importance of ideological distance in combination with
   size-related factors.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article is the result of a study on the social actions of
   entrepreneurs and aims to map the relationships of what is
   conventionally called the third sector (Institutes and Business
   Foundations) and NGOs in the so-called democratic field. To this end, we
   are based on theoretical reflections that dominated the debate on civil
   society in Brazil between the 1990s and mid-2000, and we also present
   data on the performance of these actors. As results and conclusions, we
   find that the mapping of these entities points to a convergence of the
   `field of rights with the field of the market', and how this convergence
   even changes the profile of people who work in entities linked to
   business institutes and foundations. These data are based on interviews
   and surveys of their actions, as well as of the social actors who work
   in this field of civil society, which I called `the operators of
   societal politics'.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The article begins with a framework that takes up the main
   investigations and studies carried out around Clara Zetkin's pedagogical
   thought, identifying emphases and gaps in said works. Subsequently, the
   pedagogical thinking of Clara Zetkin is deepened from a review around
   her conceptions about childhood, the role of the family in educational
   processes, the protection of childhood and the transformations to school
   as institution. For this, texts produced between 1891 and 1914 were
   analyzed mainly, that is, from the time Zetkin assumed the direction of
   the newspaper Die Gleichheit until the outbreak of the First World War.
   Finally, some contradictions in her thinking are mentioned and paths and
   potentialities are pointed out to continue with the development of
   research focused on Zetkin's work.},

Abstract = {Cognitively demanding electoral systems increase the chance that voters
   make their choices based on politically irrelevant cues. To illustrate
   this argument, I analyze the effect of candidate name complexity-a
   visual cue that contains no politically meaningful information-in Japan,
   where voters need to write their preferred candidate's name on a blank
   ballot paper. I find that when electoral systems require voters to weigh
   a large number of candidates and simultaneously reduce the usefulness of
   partisan cues, candidates with more complex names tend to receive lower
   vote shares. By contrast, under less cognitively demanding systems,
   candidate name complexity has no effect on election outcomes. These
   findings have important implications for the debate on the ``best{''}
   electoral system design.},

Abstract = {In this text we take a journey through the interrelation between
   ethnography and body studies, taking as a case study the Technical
   University of Esmeraldas, analyzing and interpreting classroom workshops
   (micro) in relation to Afro-feminist social movements (meso) in the more
   northwestern and historically peripheral Ecuadorian province (macro);
   Next, we briefly relate some feminist contributions in their activist
   and epistemic aspects, focused above all on non-Eurocentric feminisms;
   and we dedicate a final section to elaborating an ethnographic proposal
   around the study of the body (vagina as a trope), centered on the
   academic theorization of black feminism in Esmeraldas. The conclusions
   section responds to how feminist ethnographies are not only possible,
   but they have already been practiced for a long time; and, at the same
   time that they are necessary, they are discoveries of marginalized
   spaces in the form of imagined hiding places - created for black women
   in Esmeraldas.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualizes the relative absence of youth in
   legislatures, a feature we perceive as a democratic deficit with
   detrimental consequences. It introduces a new operationalization: the
   Youth Representation Index. Rather than calculating youths'
   representation by the percentage of Members of Parliament 35 or 40 years
   old and younger or legislatures' median age, we argue that scholars
   should assess youths' parliamentary presence relative to their
   proportion of the voting-age population. We contribute by assessing the
   magnitude of youths' underrepresentation across countries, finding that
   adults 35 years old and younger are generally underrepresented in
   legislatures by a factor of three and those 40 years old and younger by
   a factor of two. We illustrate that youths' presence increases under
   proportional representation electoral systems and with candidate age
   requirements set at 18 years. Finally, our results illustrate that
   countries with a younger population display a stronger discrepancy in
   youth representation.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The following article proposes to analyze how the image of the USSR was
   captured and communicated from the different elaborations contained in
   the left press, and therefore, subsumed in an ideological space of open,
   interconnected and distant borders of sharp delimitations during the
   1920s. Basically, the study of newspapers and magazines is used, pointed
   out in ``La Correspondencia Sudamericana{''} and ``Revista de
   Oriente{''}, representative options of the spatial-temporal cut involved
   and of varied compositions. At the same time, an analytical tracking is
   combined that focuses attention on issues such as: the advantages of the
   planned economy vs. capitalist system, working conditions and working
   class life, in addition to the ongoing cultural development. For the
   above, it is hoped to crystallize how these elaborations could shape
   ways of making strategies of information dissemination and even
   political-party penetrations that would nourish the exercise of
   digesting the irruption of the USSR.},

Abstract = {The outcome and impact of the EU Referendum result in 2016 has raised
   some interesting questions about living with ideological divisions in
   Northern Ireland and about how the traditions in Northern Ireland, and
   on the island of Ireland, now stand in relation to one another. There
   are questions of the `identity effects' on Brexit on unionism and
   nationalism, where old prejudices have found new contexts for expression
   and questions around how old political traditions and arguments have
   been reshaped or reimagined by Brexit. We argue that there have been
   some clear ironical inversions of argument since 2016 and that these
   ironies are traceable first, to the clearly changing balance of power
   between the two main communities and second, to the changing ideological
   ethos of the Republic of Ireland vis-a-vis Northern Ireland, provoking
   what we call separation or castration anxiety for both unionism and
   nationalism in the context of a reimagined future.},

   regional and local-kraevedcheskii-museums across several regions of

   across the selected case studies: displacement; depersonalization;
   ahistorical representations. The In the majority of the case studies
   Gulag is still a geo-historical ``blank spot,{''} erased both from
   geographical imagination and from the local historical narrative. Still
   there are few expositions that present the Stalinist repressions as an
   inseparable part of a place's identity.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {This study analyses a particularly auspicious and seemingly thriving
   kind of democratic innovation in terms of its potential to deal with
   epistemic and democratic demands to policy-making at the same time. In
   focus are highly complex, multi-layered arrangements of policy
   deliberation, consultation and advice that combine an array of input
   channels and actor groups in a shared quest for a joint, consensual
   solution to a policy problem. The study asks under which conditions
   these democratic innovations manage to deal with the double challenge of
   delivering reliable expertise and providing for substantive
   participation of all affected viewpoints. Two cases from the German
   environmental policy context are analyzed in-depth, i.e. the committee
   on the final storage of nuclear waste and the dialogue on the
   government's climate action plan. The comparative case analysis is
   guided by an assessment framework that builds on input-oriented
   democratic theory, participatory governance research as well as
   sociological and epistemological debates of expertise and knowledge in
   the policy context. Based on the case analyses, the study traces
   favourable institutional design conditions for striking a balance
   between the multiple normative demands at play.},

Abstract = {This article examines speech participation under different parliamentary
   rules: open forums dedicated to bill debates, and closed forums reserved
   for non-lawmaking speeches. It discusses how electoral incentives
   influence speechmaking by promoting divergent party norms within those
   forums. Our empirical analysis focuses on the Chilean Chamber of
   Deputies. The findings lend support to the view that, in forums
   dedicated to non-lawmaking speeches, participation is greater among more
   institutionally disadvantaged members (backbenchers, women, and members
   from more distant districts), while in those that are dedicated to
   lawmaking debates, participation is greater among more senior members
   and members of the opposition.},

   control of data by EU citizens. This article explores the extent to
   which interest groups have been able to successfully achieve their goals
   through actions in the European Union institutional spaces that
   construct privacy and data protection legislation. Specifically, it
   investigates the intervention of interest groups utilizing the `right to
   be forgotten' (RTBF) in the EU General Data Protection Regulation as a
   case study. The article shows that issue salience and conflict as well
   as institutional politicization and lobbying by a union of `strange
   bedfellows' are important factors in determining interest group
   preference attainment and success and ultimately who the winners and
   losers have been in the RTBF decision-making process.},

Abstract = {How can incumbent governments benefit when they control the timing of
   elections? The conventional wisdom is that incumbents gain an advantage
   by timing elections to coincide with favorable economic conditions. An
   alternative mechanism that has received less attention is the element of
   surprise: the incumbent's ability to exploit the opposition's lack of
   election preparedness. I theorize and empirically test this surprise
   mechanism using candidate-level data from Japanese House of
   Representatives elections (1955-2017). The results show that in surprise
   elections, opposition parties recruit fewer, lower-quality candidates,
   spend less money campaigning, coordinate their candidates less
   effectively, and ultimately receive fewer votes and seats. Evidence from
   fixed effects models and exogenously timed by-elections further suggest
   that surprise matters more in shorter, competitive election campaigns
   and helps incumbents more with confronting inter-party as opposed to
   intra-party electoral competition. These findings add to our
   understanding of how strategic election timing can undermine electoral
   accountability.},

Abstract = {The ongoing commodification of housing and urban space in Europe has led
   to the formation of a burgeoning housing movement, consisting of large
   anti-eviction networks in Southern Europe, as well as tenants' unions
   and right-to-the-city networks in Central and Northern Europe. These
   different forms of housing activism have become increasingly connected
   at the transnational level, primarily due to the work of the `European
   Action Coalition for the Right to Housing and to the City'. Consisting
   of activist groups from over 20 different countries, this coalition
   facilitates mutual exchange, organises collective campaigns and has
   begun engaging in institutional advocacy at the European Union level. It
   steadily expands in size and tactical repertoire, aiming to develop a
   more unified transnational strategy for attaining affordable and
   self-determined living space across Europe. Drawing on the writings of
   Antonio Gramsci, this article makes the case that the `European Action
   Coalition for the Right to Housing and to the City' increasingly
   performs the function of a `collective intellectual' that organises a
   transnational struggle against neoliberal hegemony. Based on qualitative
   analyses of documents, interviews and field notes, it demonstrates that
   the `European Action Coalition for the Right to Housing and to the City'
   exhibits a counter-hegemonic perspective that opposes neoliberal
   capitalism as a whole and manages to facilitate mutual solidarity across
   different activist communities explicitly on the basis of class
   struggle. At the same time, instead of organising a democratic
   centralist political project the `European Action Coalition for the
   Right to Housing and to the City' pursues a more decentralised approach
   to collective intellectual leadership that prioritises domestic
   struggles, yet also lacks a cohesive long-term strategy.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why Quebec funds private schools while the
   neighbouring province, Ontario, does not give them any direct aid. The
   author argues that these policies are linked to the religious
   configuration of the two provinces at the time of the establishment of
   their school systems. In Quebec, where Catholicism was dominant, the
   authority of the state over education was contested until the middle of
   the 20(th) century by the Catholic church. By contrast, in Ontario,
   Protestant churches, which represented the predominant religious
   affiliation, did not oppose the development of public schools. The state
   therefore rapidly asserted itself as the supreme authority in matters of
   education. During the 20(th) century, the policies of the governments of
   the two provinces were shaped by the policy legacies of the decisions
   taken a century earlier.},

Abstract = {In many countries, constitutional amendments require the direct approval
   of voters, but the consequences of fundamental changes to the powers and
   operations of the state are difficult to anticipate. The referendums
   literature suggests that citizens weigh their prior beliefs about the
   merits of proposals against the heuristic provided by the partisanship
   of the proposer, but the relative salience of these factors across
   constitutional issue areas remains underexplored. This paper examines
   the determinants of citizen preferences on 12 diverse constitutional
   issues, based on a novel survey experiment in Japan. We show that
   support for amendments is greater when its proposer is described as
   non-partisan. However, constitutional ideology moderates this effect.
   Those who prefer idealistic constitutions that elevate national
   traditions tend to value proposals that expand government powers,
   compared to those who prefer pragmatic constitutions that constrain
   government authority. These results highlight the significance of
   constitutional beliefs that are independent of partisanship.},

Abstract = {Recent work suggests that partisan dealignment should undermine
   political parties by giving members of Parliament (MPs) greater
   incentives for personal vote seeking. The key mechanism underlying such
   arguments is that voters with stronger party ties are less responsive to
   the records of individual MPs. However, existing tests of this mechanism
   are largely either indirect, based on responses to rebellious voting or
   nonlegislative behavior, or drawn from the United States. This article
   thus provides a new test of whether partisan voters are less responsive
   to MPs' parliamentary activity. I present two complementary analyses-a
   natural experiment in New Zealand and a survey experiment in the United
   Kingdom. Both suggest that more active MPs are more popular, but that
   this relationship is moderated by voters' partisanship. MPs'
   parliamentary activity chiefly influences the behavior of voters with
   the weakest partisanship. This offers new evidence that partisan
   dealignment heightens legislators' incentives for personal vote seeking.},

Abstract = {This study leverages population registry data from Sweden to examine
   whether immigrants who live in areas with a high concentration of ethnic
   minorities are more or less likely to be nominated for political office.
   It exploits a refugee placement program in place in Sweden during the
   late 1980s and early 1990s that restricted refugees' opportunities to
   freely choose their place of residence. The article presents evidence
   that immigrants who live in areas with a high ethnic density are less
   likely to be nominated for political office. The findings have important
   implications for local integration policies as well as refugee placement
   policies, as many countries consider local context when resettling
   refugees.},

Title = {Becoming Mainstream? The Emergence of Digital Policies in German
   Regional Party Politics},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {583-604},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Debates on the future trajectory of Germany's digital transformation
   have recently entered mainstream party politics. Rather than forming a
   coherent trend, however, some parties have begun to signal a much
   stronger commitment to digital policies than others. Drawing on the
   issue competition literature, we address two questions: First, which
   parties strongly emphasise digital policies in their policy portfolios,
   and do they exhibit clear commonalities? Second, is there a uniform
   tendency or are there systematic differences regarding the aspects of
   digital change that these parties emphasise the most? Our evidence
   points towards a negative status quo rather than being a winner of the
   political game as a necessary condition for parties to show major shifts
   in their policy portfolios. We also find a trend of homogenisation
   regarding the issue areas in which digital policies are emphasised. The
   studied parties thus seem to have a shared understanding about what
   matters most, rather than systematically taking up digitisation on
   issues on which they already have issue ownership. Altogether, our
   analysis sheds light on how digital policies as an emerging topic gain
   traction on the supply-side of party politics.},

Title = {Affective polarization in multiparty systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Affective polarization captures the extent to which citizens feel
   sympathy towards partisan in-groups and antagonism towards partisan
   out-groups. This is comparatively easy to assess in two-party systems,
   but capturing the pattern of affect towards multiple parties is more
   complex in multiparty systems. This article first discusses these
   challenges and then presents different ways of measuring
   individual-level affective polarization using like dislike scores, a
   widespread measure of party sympathy. Using data for 51 countries and
   166 elections from five modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral
   Systems, I then show that affective polarization adds to existing
   concepts as a way of understanding political participation and
   democratic orientations. Studying affective polarization outside the US
   could therefore have important consequences for our understanding of
   citizen perceptions of politics as well as citizen behaviour, but we
   need the appropriate measures to do so.},

Abstract = {This article responds to recent research highlighting the need for
   greater focus on the dynamics of climate mobility and destination state
   policies. Bangladesh's low-lying landmass, dense population and long
   coastline has raised the risk of climate change-induced destabilization
   due to sea-level rise. There is increased risk of long-term,
   cross-border movement of climate refugees into India which previously
   experienced a short-term, intense exodus of ten million East Pakistani
   refugees from the 1971 Bangladesh War. This study understands India's
   state, NGO, and societal responses to the 1971 crisis using the concept
   of framing and developing a ``perception-capability-policy output{''}
   approach to garner policy lessons for potential future climate
   change-induced migration. Limitations of the ``conflict versus climate
   migration{''} comparison are acknowledged, even as its utility is
   highlighted. The article ends by noting the crucial role of NGOs and
   social capital in filling capability voids of the state, constrained by
   a polarizing political environment.},

Abstract = {Surveys constitute the main method of studying elite behavior. A concern
   with survey data is that they reflect what elites report they do - not
   what elites actually do. Alternative, process-oriented approaches such
   as direct observation can help to address this concern. Examining
   elected representatives' engagement in debates concerning service
   provision in the local councils of Albania, I show that observation data
   - opposed to survey data - portray a picture that is less positively
   biased towards men and less divided along male and female domains of
   representation. Findings underscore the importance of using measures
   that tap into how the behavior of political elites unfolds in practice.},

Abstract = {This article argues that a liberal cosmopolitan approach to feminist
   foreign policy reproduces existing relations of power, including gender
   power relations and Western liberal modes of domination. I suggest that
   a critical feminist ethic of care offers a potentially radical and
   transformative account of ethics as a basis for a transnational feminism
   - one that reveals and troubles the binary gender norms that constitute
   the international and which exposes the ways in which patriarchal orders
   uphold political hierarchies that obstruct the building of empathy and
   repairing of relationship. To illustrate this argument, I address the
   recent diplomatic crises faced by Sweden and Canada in their
   relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Policymakers and
   diplomats must aim to build understanding by recognizing the material
   and discursive factors that have constructed, over time, the
   relationships between Saudi Arabia and Sweden/Canada, as well as the
   ways in which patriarchal structures - across the globe and at multiple
   scales - hinder the possibility of attentive listening and connection
   across borders. It is only through the prism of this relationship -
   where difference takes on meaning - that the more complex role of
   Western states in the contemporary system of transnational militarism is
   revealed.},

Abstract = {The growth of the carceral state over the last few decades has been
   remarkable, with millions of Americans in prison, jail, on parole or
   probation. Political science explanations of this phenomenon identify
   partisanship as a key explanatory variable in the adoption of punitive
   policies; by this theory, Republicans are the driving force behind
   growing incarceration. This article argues this explanation is
   incomplete and instead emphasizes the bipartisan coalition that
   constructed the carceral state. I argue Democratic governors are
   incentivized to pursue more punitive policies to compete with
   Republicans when those Democrats are electorally vulnerable. I test this
   proposition using a series of regression discontinuity designs and find
   causal evidence for Democrats' complicity in the expansion of the
   carceral state. Democratic governors who barely win their elections
   outspend and outincarcerate their Republican counterparts. This article
   highlights Democrats' role as key architects in the creation of vast
   criminal justice institutions in the states when those Democrats are
   electorally vulnerable.},

Abstract = {Intelligence agencies play a prominent role in the production of
   knowledge about national security threats and their evaluation. This
   function is not just a value-neutral technical activity, but a social
   and political action. The purpose of this article is to explore the ways
   in which the Slovak Information Service, an intelligence agency
   responsible for the protection of national security, discursively
   constructs security threats and assigns enemy images to specific actors.
   The analysis was conducted on the publicly available parts of the
   agency's Annual Reports. It utilised qualitative document analysis,
   supplemented by quantitative analysis of the frequency of use of
   specific keywords. The analysis, which identified the main threats
   connected to internal security, is constructed in a manner which
   connects terrorism with migration and the Muslim faith, assigning terror
   identities to specific groups. The agency's constructions of internal
   threats were also utilised in the political discourse. Moreover,
   securitisation rhetoric was used in connection to the movements
   promoting human rights and fighting fascism, labelling them as left-wing
   extremists. In the field of foreign threats, their construction depends
   on both international developments and domestic political dynamics.},

Abstract = {Do voters use the race or ethnicity of a candidate in selecting whom to
   support? This paper examines the voting behavior of Asian Americans in
   elections in California. The analysis hinges on co-partisan elections
   stemming from California's open primary system where two candidates from
   the same party compete, and thus a candidate's party no longer serves as
   a reliable cue for voters at the ballot box. Using surname matched vote
   returns for seven state assembly and two congressional elections between
   2012 and 2018, I find evidence of bloc voting in every race where an
   Asian American candidate is pitted against a non-Asian. When Asian
   candidates compete, however, evidence of polarization at the national
   origin level is found. The findings have theoretical implications for
   understanding the dynamics of co-ethnicity and descriptive
   representation for Asian Americans, as well as practical implications
   for the study of elections and minority voting rights.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have been unable to establish the link between
   corruption perceptions and political participation. This is partly due
   to a disregard of different types of political participation, ignoring
   gender differences in how corruption perceptions affect political
   participation, and overlooking the importance of context. We therefore
   here examine gender differences in the links between corruption
   perceptions and three types of political participation: voting,
   institutionalized participation between elections, and
   noninstitutionalized participation between elections. We also examine
   how the context in the form of the national level of corruption affects
   these linkages. The data come from International Social Survey Program
   Citizenship II and includes 31 democracies, analyzed with multilevel
   regression models. Our results show that women become more likely to
   vote when faced with corruption, whereas men become more likely to
   engage in elite-challenging forms of participation when faced with
   corruption while women remain unaffected.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of minority identity strategies in
   Transylvania within the context of competing nationalisms. The case of
   Magyar communities perfectly illustrates the great complexity of many
   contested regions after WWI. On the one hand, a substantial number of
   Transylvanian Hungarians maintained a solid connection with the official
   revisionist aims of the Hungarian government and showed a fierce and
   violent refusal to accept the end of historical Hungary. On the other, a
   minority of Transylvanian Hungarians tried to assume a different
   perspective of the past and develop new strategies of integration,
   focusing on the multicultural legacy of Transylvania in order to renew
   the cultural milieu of the community and offer new responses to changed
   conditions. This article conducts a historical examination of these
   responses, analyzing the interwar cultural experience of Magyar
   intellectuals in relation to categories such as minority rights,
   regionalism, or national indifference. It concludes that it was not
   exactly indifference that characterized the fight for the defence of
   minority rights or ideas such as Transylvanism. This, it is also argued,
   failed in providing an alternative representation of Transylvanian
   history and multiculturalism, and was thus unable to break the monopoly
   of nationalist imaginary.},

Abstract = {A growing number of parliaments around the world have adopted
   anti-defection laws that protect the unity of legislative party groups.
   Although they remain rare among established democracies, India, Israel,
   and New Zealand have enacted such legislation with important
   consequences for the politics of executive-legislative relations. The
   paper argues that the introduction of anti-defection laws in the three
   democratic legislatures can be understood as an attempt to keep
   governments safe from defections rather than reduce the overall
   frequency of party switching. As such, anti-defection laws constitute an
   important albeit often overlooked institutional source of government
   stability.},

Abstract = {A robust literature on citizens' satisfaction with democracy argues that
   system satisfaction is based on the policy outcomes that citizens
   anticipate from electoral results. A tacit assumption in this research
   is that there are differences between the parties and that citizens are
   aware of the ideological and preference diversity in their political
   environment. Some citizens, however, fail to perceive these differences.
   Using a multi-national set of post-election surveys, regression
   analysis, and propensity score matching, perceived party difference is
   shown to substantially impact citizens' systemic satisfaction. Those who
   believe all parties are the same are substantially less satisfied with
   the functioning of their democracy. The negative effect of perceived
   party homogeneity is mitigated by closeness to a political party and
   sense of representation. By manipulating the public's reserve of
   democratic satisfaction, this perception of party homogeneity threatens
   democratic stability.},

Abstract = {Judith Shklar has been invoked by contemporary realists as an example of
   how history is a better source of political knowledge than abstract
   philosophy. This emphasis on history challenges the predominant
   understanding of her political theory that stresses the universality of
   fear of cruelty. This contrast between history and moral universalism
   invites a serious investigation of Shklar's historical method. This
   article takes up this task by reconstructing a Shklarian historical
   method based on a tripartite relation between historical memory,
   democratic citizenship, and historically minded political theory. This
   reconstructed historical method challenges the boundaries of Shklar's
   liberalism and broadens the possibilities that her political theory can
   offer.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article examines the complex relationship between neoliberalism and
   the Brexit campaign. It proposes to move beyond simplified explanations
   that see in Brexit a `populist' revolt against the neoliberal status quo
   by drawing attention to neoliberal ideas surrounding Europe and the free
   market. The article contends that from the 1990s onwards, many prominent
   neoliberal thinkers came to see the European Union as a threat to free
   trade and individual liberty, prompting them to support Brexit as a
   means of subverting the growing influence of European federalism. In
   building this argument, the article maps and analyses the key
   theoretical elements of neoliberal Euroscepticism, focusing in turn on
   the neoliberals' interpretation of the European project, their critique
   of European Monetary Union, and their approach to the question of
   national sovereignty. It then documents how several neoliberal think
   tanks came increasingly to support and spread this neoliberal form of
   Euroscepticism. In closing, the article reflects on the influence of
   neoliberal Euroscepticism on the current Conservative government.},

Abstract = {This article stresses the importance of learning in the transformation
   of an incumbent Islamist party within the context of polity
   re-configuration. Borrowing from the literature on diffusion and
   learning, it offers a case study of how Tunisia's Ennahda Movement
   responded to the interplay of multi-level challenges. Main argument is
   that Ennahda has significantly re-tailored its positioning since the
   critical juncture of 2013, not only by taking the route of moderation
   once again, but also by exercising self-restraint under the impulse of
   external counter-examples. Based on process-tracing readings, the
   analysis contained herein demonstrates how key regional and domestic
   events have helped reshape the party's political discourse and
   practices, designed to maximise the likelihood of its survival and
   progressive empowerment in a more markedly hostile environment. The
   paper thus empirically identifies three main strategies implemented by
   the party and reflecting learning on its part: readiness to negotiate, a
   reassuring attitude, and self-containment.},

Abstract = {Previous game-theoretic analyses of the settlement of the United States
   assume that Indigenous peoples and settler colonizers either engaged in
   free exchange or total war for land. We reframe the model to consider
   that violence, including coercion, was present in most of their
   interactions; that is, we allow for the settler colonizer to engage in
   coercion to strategically lower their appropriation costs for Indigenous
   peoples' lands. We find that the settler strategically uses violence to
   pay less in exchanges for Indigenous peoples' lands. In addition, we
   examine how uncertainty, about whether an agreement can ensure the
   avoidance of all-out conflict, affects initial violence and resistance.
   We find that the likelihood of all-out conflict affects settler violence
   and it critically depends on whether the Indigenous people can seek
   compensation.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Brexit negotiations raise the question of what Britain's future role
   in the world should be. Brexiters have drawn on ideas of the Anglosphere
   to imagine what that future might be. The Anglosphere belongs in a long
   line of thinking about uniting English speaking communities around the
   world. Different conceptions of the Anglosphere such as CANZUK are
   identified. The Anglosphere appeals to many Brexiters because it gives
   them a positive vision of `Global Britain' as an alternative to EU
   membership. The advantages to Britain of regaining full sovereignty and
   associating once more with its `true friends' are stressed. What is
   ignored is the lack of support among Anglosphere countries for much
   closer relationships except in the security sphere, and the inability of
   increased economic ties with the Anglosphere to begin to match what the
   UK will lose by severing itself from its most important economic
   partner.},

Abstract = {The relationship between `Germany' and `power' remains a sensitive
   issue. While observers tend to agree that Germany has regained the
   status of the most powerful country in Europe, there is a debate whether
   that is to be welcomed or whether that is a problem. Underpinning this
   debate are views, both within Germany and amongst its neighbours,
   regarding the kind of power Germany has, or should (not) have. Against
   this backdrop, the article reviews the dominant role conceptions used in
   the expert discourse on German foreign policy since the Cold War that
   depict Germany as a particular type of `power'. Specifically, we sketch
   the evolution of three prominent conceptions (constrained power,
   civilian power, hegemonic power) and the recent emergence of a new one
   (shaping power). The article discusses how these labels have emerged to
   give meaning to Germany's position in international relations, points to
   their normative and political function, and to the limited ability of
   such role images to tell us much about how Germany actually exercises
   power.},

Abstract = {The first Conte government, which led Italy from 2018 until early
   September 2019, was the first government in the EU to express a negative
   attitude to the Euro. Both parties that formed the government (the Lega
   and the Movimento 5 Stelle) opposed the Eurozone and the common currency
   and repeatedly proposed to take Italy out of the Euro or at least to
   consult Italian citizens about this possibility. Although anti-Euro
   proposals disappeared from the Government's programme, EU institutions
   and the financial markets perceived a concrete risk of Italexit. The
   fear of Italexit and the confrontational approach to the EU institutions
   adopted by the new government generated financial tension and a rise in
   the spread on Italian government bonds, thereby contributing to internal
   conflict within the Italian government and its final collapse. This
   article analyses the rise of anti-Euro sentiments in Italy, their role
   in shaping the European policy of the first Conte government, and the
   reasons for the changing attitudes of the Movimento 5 Stelle to the Euro
   and Italexit during its period in office. This article also demonstrates
   the relevance of external constraints and the prudent but firm
   negotiation style adopted by the EU Commission to frustrate the
   ambitions of radical anti-Euro campaigners. Finally, the article
   considers the implications the Italian experience will have in the event
   that other anti-Euro governments take office in Italy or in other
   Eurozone member states, in particular in those countries where support
   for anti-Euro parties is growing quickly.},

Abstract = {In this article, I focus on a subset of Obama's foreign policy views,
   namely his beliefs about the appropriate circumstances under which the
   United States should engage in armed conflict. I argue that the Iraq war
   served as a formative event in the development of Obama's worldview. He
   derived distinct lessons from this policy failure, leading him to
   articulate a restrictive set of conditions that should be met before the
   United States considered intervening in the internal politics of another
   nation, absent a direct threat to national security. I undertake a
   detailed examination of two case studies - the administration's debates
   leading to the 2011 intervention in Libya and the decision not to
   intervene in Syria in 2013 - and demonstrate how the lessons of Iraq
   shaped Obama's policy choices at critical junctures in the
   deliberations.},

Abstract = {The Muslim world has been plagued by imperial interests, cultural
   ravaging and plundering, unequal partnership with the West. However,
   since the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, the Arab world has moved to
   the center of political and cultural debates and attracted the major
   number of representations in American writings. These writings form a
   new phenomenon called neoorientalism and revolve around a major theme:
   Muslim Arabs as victims of fundamentalist dogma. This study explores the
   ways in which neo-orientalism developed and was communicated to the
   reader in the United States after 9/11. The literature on this
   phenomenon is limited; therefore, there exists a need for the study of
   neo-orientalism through contemporary fictions that deal directly with
   Arab-American relationship. This study also investigates the assumption
   implicit in the conception that contemporary American novel is in
   solidarity with the state ignoring its imperial ambitions and its
   saturation with hegemonic practices. In response to the terrorist
   attacks, novel has been one of the most effective genres to represent
   the feelings of the nation and the concern of the country. This part of
   the study will refer to different attitudes and political orientations
   of novelists, which allow novel to follow the mainstream politics and do
   not grapple with the hegemonic interests.},

Abstract = {The relationship between centralization and decentralization of power in
   Venezuela has been extensively studied. But, Why it is necessary to
   study this issue again in Venezuela between 1999-2015?, Why the ruling
   elite of that period manipulated the territorial distribution of
   political power? The objective of this article is to answer these two
   questions from the perspective of interpretivism, in order to understand
   the motivations, means and actions carried out during the process of
   recentralization of power, and its political context. In general, the
   results show that the particularities of this new stage of concentration
   of power are the motivations and the means used. They are substantially
   different from the past because they have allowed the ruling elite to
   implement a system of authoritarian political domination that
   dangerously brings the Venezuelan State closer to the boundaries of
   totalitarianism.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {240-251},
Abstract = {This article examines the organisation of VOX, a new radical right party
   in Spain. It shows that the party has taken early and uneven steps to
   build a mass organisation and initially opted for open membership
   recruitment with participatory organisational elements. Also, the
   party's rapid growth and quick entrance into political institutions at
   different state levels led the party leadership to establish more
   centralised control and limit members' prerogatives, though recruitment
   continued. Centralisation in part responds to organisational needs given
   the party's quickly acquired political relevance, but also to the desire
   of the central party leadership to forestall the articulation of
   territorial interests, or prevent them from escaping their control.
   Today, VOX exhibits elements of mass party organisation and highly
   centralised decision-making in the hands of national party leaders.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study is to identify the key factors of the
   stability of state information in the face of terrorist threats based on
   the review of existing research in this area, and to identify the main
   approaches to ensure the stability of state information in the face of
   terrorist threats. Based on the analysis of scientific works, the
   factors of the state's resistance to cyberterrorism are identified and
   the main approaches are organized to ensure the stability of state
   information in the face of terrorist threats. The results of the study
   provide an understanding of the key factors needed to achieve the legal,
   technical, organizational, and operational areas of state resilience to
   cyber threats. Further research may aim to perform empirical
   calculations of indicators from around the world to determine certain
   dependencies in the field of cybersecurity. It is concluded that factors
   such as the growing impact of information and communication technologies
   on public relations, production activities, the operation of
   infrastructure facilities and the activities of public authorities,
   indicate that the issue of security as a line of scientific research is
   urgent.},

Abstract = {Russia was implementing massive military equipment modernization
   programs in order to bring all Russian branches of the Federation Armed
   Forces from Soviet era robust as well as obsolete massive forces to new
   modern military force. This article analyses significant military
   armament modernisation projects implemented and ongoing in the Russian
   Federation conventional forces in Ground Forces, Aerospace Forces and
   Naval Forces in order to reduce technological gaps between Russia and
   other world military powers. The objective of the research is to find
   out, based on available open sources information analysis, how Russia
   introduced lessons learned from the latest conflicts, gradually
   developing its Armed Forces in such specific areas like personnel,
   command and control reform, and unmanned and robotic vehicles'
   introduction into Russian Federation Armed Forces. The major results are
   that wide scale military modernization projects have been adopted in all
   Russian Federation Armed Forces including major branches Ground Forces,
   Aerospace Forces and Naval Forces. The Russian Federation defence
   industrial complex is highly involved in modernisation programs and
   based on its strategic position in the Russian economy coming from the
   Soviet era legacy, playing crucial role in it. The practical
   implications of the research point to the fact that, despite inherited
   outdated technology, Russia, thanks to new armaments projects, is
   levelling out the differences between the great powers and is once again
   becoming a major strategic player.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the qualification problems of armed conflicts. The
   study was conducted through the analysis of international legal
   doctrine, international treaties, decisions of international
   organizations. Attention is paid to the jurisprudence of the
   International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the
   International Criminal Court. It is noted that International
   Humanitarian Law has been in place since the beginning of the armed
   conflict. Therefore, the application of International Humanitarian Law
   does not require any recognition of the existence of armed conflict
   (international or non-international); this conflict exists because of
   armed clashes. It is emphasized that the need to classify the conflict
   arises in view of domestic and international legal factors (to bring to
   international criminal justice those who have committed war crimes;
   state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, etc.). Attention
   was paid to the non-existence of a single body, which was empowered to
   determine the existence of an armed conflict. Different international
   agencies may have different qualifications for the same armed conflict.
   It is concluded that it is necessary to establish a Committee of Experts
   under the UN Secretary-General, to avoid different qualifications from
   the same armed conflict.},

Abstract = {This article aims to investigate the challenges to combat depopulation
   in the rural sphere, from the inter- and transdisciplinary perspectives
   of the right to environmental sustainability. In this sense, given that
   the environment must have considered its intrinsic value and the vital
   cycles of nature must be preserved as much as possible, in order to
   avoid the socio-environmental problems that exist today in the world,
   one wonders: what are these problems and how will they be minimized in
   an interdisciplinary and therefore legal partner perspective, in the
   Brazilian and Spanish space? Thus, the specific objectives are: a) to
   analyze the conceptual contributions of the environment in Brazil and
   Spain: an approach from the binomial sustainability and coping with
   rural depopulation; b) to study sustainability and its implementation as
   a subjective right of the community in the Brazilian and Spanish rural
   areas. For this, the monographic procedure and deductive approach
   methods are used, and the research technique is bibliographic. It is
   concluded that it is clear the need to think about alternatives to
   socio- environmental problems, either through public policies or through
   law in the construction of guidelines, aiming to minimize, or even
   solve, the problem of rural depopulation and environmental degradation,
   thus implementing smart rural communities and sustainability as a
   fundamental right, and, consequently, making the rural environment more
   productive, both in Brazil and Spain.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Policy work in government is often framed as existing in a ``black
   box{''}. It is assumed that public administrators, as ``insiders{''},
   have more knowledge of policy development processes than those outside
   of government. Are black box narratives of policy work constructed by
   practitioners? Or is the idea of a ``translucent{''} box more
   appropriate to understand policy work within the bureaucracy? Based on
   interviews with sub-national civil servants in one provincial government
   in Canada, this article finds that black box narratives are used by
   practitioners to understand policy work. I interpret these results to
   argue that a theory-practice gap does not necessarily exist when it
   comes to constructions of policy work: practitioners in the field, like
   scholars, employ black box narratives to frame policy work in the
   bureaucracy. Yet, academics may still find that translucent box theory
   provides a more nuanced way of understanding government's internal
   policy processes.},

Abstract = {As a reaction against contemporary democracy's inherent
   short-sightedness in solving problems that are likely to affect distant

   different kinds of democratic representation of future persons. This
   article shows that even though there can be no such thing as political
   representation of future persons, the relevant affected interests of the
   as-yet unborn can still be taken into consideration in political
   decision making. This aim is achieved by focusing on the political
   representation of children as special cases of semi-future members of

Abstract = {Scholarship on the politics of secrecy in international relations and
   foreign policy has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. This
   article begins by providing an overview of this literature, analyzing
   the conditions under which leaders opt for secrecy in both economic and
   security domains. These motivations differ greatly depending on whether
   the presumed audience from which a leader keeps a secret is domestic,
   international, or corporate in nature. Next, it considers methodological
   innovations and challenges, particularly in the measurement of secrecy.
   Finally, it reflects on the lessons learned and discusses some exciting
   questions that scholars could explore in future research. As a
   burgeoning field within international relations, the study of secrecy
   offers a variety of promising and potentially fruitful directions.},

Abstract = {Under which conditions is EU Cohesion Policy effective? Which are those
   `conditioning factors' that help in explaining where, when, and how the
   Cohesion Policy is effective? This article adopts an Hirschmanian
   approach to argue that that the institutional characteristics of
   domestic authorities involved in the management of funds, as well as the
   decisions of policy makers, represent the key factors for understanding
   the effects of the Cohesion Policy in European regions. By using
   Cohesion Policy implementation in Italy and Spain as a pilot study, this
   article empirically investigates the interaction of three different
   types of factors (institutional, strategic {[}related to the types of
   investments made], and administrative), and elaborates an original
   framework for comparing different Cohesion Policy implementations, and
   existing studies analyzing the impact of the Cohesion Policy. The
   framework presented in this article could be extended to other European
   countries by political scientists who are interested in studying the
   Cohesion Policy as a case of development policy.},

Abstract = {Resentment is a complex, multi-layered emotion, within which perceptions
   of unfairness and feelings of anger are central. When linked to
   politics, it has predominantly been associated with the alleged ``crisis
   of representative democracy{''} and populism. However, recent studies
   have shown that resentment can intervene positively in people's
   relations to politics and political institutions by facilitating certain
   types of political participation (Capelos \& Demertzis, 2018). Despite
   this, the concept of resentment, and hence its role in contemporary
   representative democracy, is often poorly defined, with empirical
   investigations of its manifestation(s) remaining scarce. Borrowing a
   conceptualization of resentment as ``resentful affectivity,{''} our
   article draws on the analysis of focus groups carried out in Belgium
   (2019-2020) with individuals where resentful affectivity is likely to be
   observed (i.e., contemporary movements of contestation such as the
   Yellow Vests, Youth for Climate, and individuals who occupy a socially
   disadvantaged position). We find that experiences of intense anger,
   fear, disappointment, and the unfairness of representative democracy,
   i.e., of how representative democracy works on the ground, coexist
   simultaneously with remaining hopes in the democratic system. We show
   how this complex blend of emotions confronts citizens with what we call
   a ``democratic dilemma.{''} We document the different ways in which
   citizens cope with this dilemma and conclude by highlighting both the
   positive and negative ways in which resentment intervenes in the
   contemporary ``crisis of representative democracy.{''}},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {170-188},
Abstract = {The markedly high levels of preventable death and injury from COVID-19
   in the UK have been refracted by government appeals to ``British
   common-sense{''} in response to the crisis. We critically explore this
   appeal as a generator of harm continuous with free-market common-sense
   (FMCS) that stretches back to the start of the 1980s and the Thatcherite
   assault on state protections, ``enemies within{''} and expertise in the
   public realm, driving and legitimating a broad landscape of harm under
   neoliberal restructuring. This is the context for understanding
   government responses to COVID-19 and the Grenfell fire, both of which
   have resulted in avoidable death and injury and both of which illustrate
   the role of ``common-sense{''} in the demonisation and blaming of the
   victims of state violence along with a deligitimation of expertise in
   public health. Following Gramsci's conceptualisation of common-sense and
   its role in cultivating a never-guaranteed consensus for the continuance
   of capitalist state power, we explore the emergence of Gramsci's ``good
   sense{''} in the current juncture and its challenge to the harms of
   state that FMCS has generated.},

   Social Europe},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-78},
Abstract = {This article assesses the political and power dynamics of the Ordinarily
   Legislative Procedure (OLP) in social Europe and the likely impact of
   the UK's departure in the field for future integration. It provides a
   detailed analysis of the OLP in social Europe during two recent periods
   of integration in the field-the first Barroso Commission (2004-2009) and
   the Juncker Commission (2014-2019). It finds the dynamics of the OLP
   have shifted from intergovernmental deadlock during the Barroso
   Commission to the characteristics of a new intergovernmental core state
   power during the Juncker Commission, even though the policy area is not
   a core state power per se. Despite the use of qualified majority voting
   policy agreements can only be achieved when there is near unanimity
   support in the Council, the Commission remains a neutral broker, and the
   Parliament shifts its position to that of the Council. As a result,
   continued opposition to integration in social Europe by Northern and
   Eastern Members means the removal of UK political agency will have only
   a marginal impact on the slow and piecemeal approach to integration in
   the field.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a feminist policy and politics perspective to
   examine gendered shifts in mobilization of Trade Unions in Ireland.
   While Unions enjoyed access to policy-setting contexts in a form of
   social partnership from the late 1980s to 2008, this process was
   abolished in the economic crisis and was replaced by austerity-era
   public pay stability agreements. Adopting a case study approach, this
   research scrutinizes Trade Union campaigns for feminised occupations to
   examine how gender is used to do political and ideational work in
   feminised campaigns. This analysis raises larger questions about what
   happens when national corporatist models decline and Unions in response
   look to `gender' campaigns and mobilise feminised occupational sectors.},

Abstract = {This article explores the incidence of open science in academic research
   in the field of Political Science. Open science's goal is to shed light
   on information about data, research procedures, and results of academic
   work, thus making information accessible to reviewers and the general
   public. This practice is not prevalent across the social sciences
   although there is increasing interest on the importance of
   reproducibility in building or rejecting theory and knowledge. However,
   important epistemological and methodological debates have evolved around
   the feasibility and desirability of adopting these practices as a
   standard in the discipline. This article systematically collects and
   analyzes data on publishing requirements of the top journals in the
   fields at point, including pre-registration. We also provide a state of
   the art on the implementation of these best practices in Latin America.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},

Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {We expand the discussion on the fulfillment of campaign promises to
   include promises made by presidents in office. Drawing on the literature
   on presidential legislative success, we suggest four hypotheses on the
   determinants of promise fulfillment. We test them with information on
   the 945 pledges made by presidents in their twenty-eight annual speeches
   to Congress in Chile (1990-2017). Although the presidents of Chile
   cannot be immediately reelected, we claim that they nonetheless have
   incentives to fulfill the promises they make while in office. We find
   that first-year promises are more easily fulfilled, whereas four-year
   promises suffer the opposite outcome. Presidents also fulfill more
   promises when they have higher approval rates and when promises are made
   on areas where they exercise issue ownership.},

Abstract = {There is an important but underappreciated ambiguity in Hobbes' concept
   of personhood. In one sense, persons are representatives or actors. In
   the other sense, persons are representees or characters. An estate agent
   is a person in the first sense; her client is a person in the second.
   This ambiguity is crucial for understanding Hobbes' claim that the state
   is a person. Most scholars follow the first sense of `person', which
   suggests that the state is a kind of actor - in modern terms, a
   `corporate agent'. I argue that Hobbes' state is a person only in the
   second sense: a character rather than an actor. If there are any
   primitive corporate agents in Hobbes' political thought, they are
   representative assemblies, not states or corporations. Contemporary
   political theorists and philosophers tend to miss what is unique and
   valuable about Hobbes' idea of state personality because they project
   the idea of corporate agency onto it.},

Number = {2},
Abstract = {This paper deals with the process of collective memory reconstruction
   linked to ETA's violence. It pays attention to the controversies
   connected to the public management of such memory, trying to identify
   its main challenges and looking at the political and social tension that
   emerge when reconciled with the purpose of victim reparation. To this
   end, it will first address oblivion as a form of injustice towards
   victims. It will then reflect on the ``battle for the story{''}, an
   expression that is being used when identifying the controversies caused
   by institutional memory policies and that, in addition, will allow us to
   land in the connections between memory and history, as well as in the
   centrality of interpretations and sense. Finally, it will point at the
   limits and potentialities of memory when it comes to understanding the
   present, without avoiding the central issue of responsibility over
   actions as a prerequisite for aspiring to some form of justice.},

Title = {FRANCE'S NEW POLITICAL ELITE AGAINST THE OLD RECRUITMENT SYSTEM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {6},
Pages = {60-72},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the French experience of institutionalization of
   the political elite's recruitment process. Although there are various
   channels for the recruitment of the French political elite, the
   education system is central in creating a framework, norms and
   procedures to train civil servants who make up the core of the political
   elite. The main issue is how appropriate it is for the state to have an
   active engagement in the process, characterised by the formation of a
   separate ecosystem of schools empowered to train the political elite,
   unequal financing, specific process of employment. On the one hand, such
   a system is increasingly close to meritocratic ideals, ensures the
   foreseeability of methods and expertise of the ruling class. On the
   other hand, it provokes criticism about the alleged closeness of the
   political elite, the divide between elite's mindset and lifestyle and
   those of the majority of population. The ``yellow vests{''} protest
   against the Parisian political elite fueled discontent, making the
   government commit to reform what is widely thought to be the main pillar
   of elitism in the French education - the National School of
   Administration. The article analyzes whether ENA's reform really changes
   the recruitment procedure and makes the political elite more open and
   representative, leading to a comprehensive reform of elite education. It
   studies the key recruiting education institutions, calculates the
   concentration indexes and assesses the real role of the National school
   of Administration in the process of recruitment. While studying the
   strengths and weaknesses of the system and the French government's
   efforts to mitigate them, the French experience characterised by a high
   level of institutionalization is compared with the British one, where
   the education system is as efficient a channel of recruitment, despite
   being less regulated. In conclusion, the authors suggest possible
   measures for an optimal reform of the elite education system in order to
   preserve its advantages.},

Abstract = {In the context of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the debate
   on whether climate change should be included and how has been ongoing
   since 2007. This article contributes to existing research on this
   problem by expounding a three-fold analysis. First, it assesses the
   conceptual approach to the climate-security nexus from the joint
   statement of 10 UNSC member states in 2020. Second, it critically
   exposes the confusion of different climate-security conceptions and
   uncovers shared assumptions of the UNSC-member states in 2020 by
   comparing their different positions, which makes a soon-to-come
   agreement likely. Third, it critically evaluates whether the proposal to
   include climate change into the UNSC will lead to a transformative
   change of the institution, of the meaning of security, and on how this
   would correspond to the existential threats outlined in the Anthropocene
   context. The theoretical framework of analysis draws on critical
   security studies. It takes as its empirical basis the primary sources of
   the UNSC debate of 2020 and is also informed by the secondary literature
   on climate and security and the Earth System Sciences descriptions of
   the state of the planet.},

Abstract = {Until the early 2010s, the Czech Republic had the most stable party
   system among all of the countries in East Central and Eastern Europe. It
   resembled West European systems and provided the foundation for a
   representative democracy. This model has fallen into a deep crisis.
   Voter turnout has declined, parties are losing members, and voter
   turnover is high. The programmatic parties became cartel parties without
   social mooring, but with a tremendous interest in campaign reimbursement
   from the state and posts in the government. This development is also
   known from Western Europe. In the meantime, however, there is a man at
   the head of the Czech government who has come to power by using proceeds
   from his corporate conglomerate to found his own business party and to
   counter the idea of a pluralistic competition of ideas by offering the
   technocratic model of better management.},

Abstract = {What are Americans' views on liberal democracy? Have their attitudes
   changed since the 1950s? How do their attitudes about liberal democracy
   shape political behavior, such as vote choice? We replicated McClosky's
   (1964) seminal study on a module to the 2016 Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study. Our exploration of 26 survey questions reveals both
   continuity and change in Americans' attitudes toward liberal democracy.
   Whereas Americans have become more hostile toward some standard
   democratic procedural rules of the game, we also find that they harbor
   more tolerant attitudes toward racial and ethnic equality. We subjected
   respondents' answers to an exploratory factor analysis, which reveals
   three distinct dimensions regarding democratic values: elitism,
   authoritarianism, and racial supremacy. We find that elitism and racial
   supremacy significantly influenced political behavior in the 2016
   presidential election and note that these factors contributed to mass
   unrest in 2020, exposing fault lines deeply rooted in America's
   contentious political history.},

   gathering techniques, the study examines insurgency and conditions of
   IDPs camps in Nigeria, focusing on NYSC camp in Girei Local Government,
   Adamawa State. The study finds that the condition in NYSC IDP camp is
   deplorable as IDPs lack access to basic essentials of life. The study
   recommends among others the need for the government to be more committed
   to the welfare of IDPs and also curb corruption of government officials
   in the camp as this has worsen the already deplorable condition of IDPs.},

Abstract = {From the perspective of essay, this article is an analytical, but above
   all hermeneutic, reading of the relationships that education has
   maintained with thought, language, and power. The research is based, in
   the first place, on a rigorous and systematic documentation, and then
   move on to the selection of those texts that, in the opinion of the
   author, have greater relevance to the subject and that, in addition,
   represent the nuclear approaches of Michel Foucault and Edgar Morin. The
   arguments of these two authors are detailed and analyzed, as arduous
   critics of classical pedagogy, its actors, and strategies. It is
   concluded that, in both authors, there is an effort to find the threads
   of power that sustain in the periphery, some discourses, typical of an
   education that questions the dominant rationality and that postulate
   different ways of thinking, such as: an archaeology of knowledge in the
   style of Foucault or the complex thought proposed by Morin.},

Title = {PROFESSIONAL TABOOS IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL CONSULTANCY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-168},
Abstract = {This study examines the ethics of political consultants in Russia using
   the materials of 73 interviews with election campaigners (political
   consultants, chiefs of staff, field workers, lawyers, etc.). The study
   suggests that it is impossible to speak of Russian political consultants
   as a single community sharing common values. This professional group is
   heterogeneous and includes people with different perceptions of norms
   and ethical boundaries. Based on the analysis of the interviews, a
   classification of political consultants' professional taboos was
   developed: universal human morality, ideological orientation,
   professional orientation, procedural taboos, and legal boundaries.
   Interestingly, some of the informants used the rhetoric of justification
   when talking about ethical restrictions. The existence of certain
   standards of behavior was justified by the fact that the informant was
   somehow different from the ``correct{''} political consultants
   (professional biography, belief system, etc.). The absence of ethical
   boundaries in several cases could be interpreted as a norm and a sign of
   professionalism, as opposed to as an anomaly.},

   Strikes for Climate in Belgium},

Abstract = {Much has been written about the challenges of tackling climate change in
   post-political times. However, times have changed significantly since
   the onset of the debate on post-politics in environmental scholarship.
   We have entered a politicised, even polarised world which, as this
   article argues, a number of voices within the climate movement
   paradoxically try to bring together again. This article scrutinises new
   climate movements in a changing world, focusing on the School Strikes
   for Climate in Belgium. It shows how the movement, through the
   establishment of an intergenerational conflict line and a strong
   politicisation of tactics, has succeeded in putting the topic at the
   heart of the public agenda for months on end. By claiming that we need
   mobilisation, not studying, the movement went straight against the
   hegemonic, technocratic understanding of climate politics at the time.
   However, by keeping its demands empty and establishing a homogenised
   fault line, the movement made itself vulnerable to forms of
   neutralisation and recuperation by forces which have an interest in
   restoring the post-political consensus around technocratic and
   market-oriented answers to climate change. This might also partly
   explain its gradual decline. Instead of recycling post-political
   discourses of the past, this article claims, the challenge is to seize
   the `populist moment' and build a politicised movement around climate
   change. One way of doing that is by no longer projecting climate change
   into the future but reframing the `now' as the moment of crisis which
   calls on us to build another future.},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {227-236},
Abstract = {Emotions have always been invested in politics. Politicians and
   politically biased public intellectuals manage citizens' emotions for
   various purposes: to alienate them from the rival political camp and to
   make them participate in elections or in politics in general.
   Ressentiment is an affective style of great political potential and it
   is present throughout democratic European societies. By analysing the
   discourses of the culture war between the political camps in Hungary
   since 2018, this article presents the components, drivers, mechanisms,
   and some typical outcomes of ressentiment on the levels of the
   individual and the political communities. It argues that in political
   communication both political sides are trying to appeal to the citizens'
   ressentiment. Both camps use communicative means to incite, channel, and
   reorient ressentiment by, e.g., scapegoating, identity work, and
   transvaluation to attract citizens, stabilize their own support, and
   nudge followers towards specific political activities.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to conduct a study of the role of
   criminal analysis in modern models of police activity. To achieve this
   objective, several methods were used, namely: analysis of official
   documentation, scientific literature, logical analysis,
   concrete-historical, dialectic, or empirical methods. The article
   presents the most common classifications of police models today, as well
   as the interpretation of criminal analysis in them. It is concluded that
   a relatively new model of intelligence-led surveillance needs to be
   implemented in the police. Within the police model of social
   orientation, specific ways of solving various problems are carried out
   by carefully and detailed analysis of the causes of such problems,
   actors, and characteristics of the area, as well as the prevention of
   serious crimes through the approach of police work in places of
   concentration of minor infringements (model of ``broken windows{''}). It
   was noted that Comp Stat focuses on street crime and in series with
   short-term responsibility for addressing new criminal challenges; for
   its part, the intelligence-led surveillance (ILP) model includes a
   long-term strategic component that can be applied to transnational
   organized crime operations.},

Title = {The ``New Normal{''} in China's Assertive Power Projection in the South
   China Sea: Maritime Hybrid Threats},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-276},
Abstract = {The People's Republic of China's (PRC) assertive power projection in the
   South China Sea (SCS) and its consequences in the form of hybrid threats
   have increasingly become an accepted reality of the region. China has
   gradually constructed this ``new normal{''} or ``fait accompli{''} under
   the framework of its assertive policies which have generated
   geostrategic repercussions both in the regional and global landscape.
   Despite the fact that most of the recent studies particularly address
   China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or regional politics, a holistic
   assessment of China's assertive behavior requires a concentrated focus
   on China's employment of maritime hybrid instruments in the service of
   its declarative, demonstrative and coercive actions. Rather than
   engaging in open military confrontation in the SCS dispute, China
   skillfully synchronizes the military, political, economic, cyber and
   information sources of power in different operational domains to
   influence, intimidate and coerce the competing claimants. Furthermore,
   with a structural approach, the impact of China's employment of
   assertive maritime hybrid instruments go beyond regional level to have
   possible repercussions on the future of global-level power shifts. The
   current conditions of China's growing material power, its will to use
   hybrid instruments, and increasing vulnerabilities and lack of a
   coordinated response seem to reinforce a breeding ground for future
   assertiveness and a possible shift in the balance of power. However, in
   the long-term it would not be surprising to see stiffened counter
   efforts to disrupt its initiatives on a global landscape. Therefore,
   this study aims to shed light on the context and cumulative effects of
   China's assertive employment of maritime hybrid instruments while
   discussing increasing international concerns on the altering dynamics of
   balance of power.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do judiciaries act assertively against
   authoritarian regimes? I argue that the judiciary coalesces around
   institutional norms and preferences in response to the preferences of
   institutions and networks, or ``audiences,{''} with which judges
   interact, and which shape the careers and reputations of judges.
   Proposing a typology of judicial-regime relations, I demonstrate that
   the judiciary's affinity to authoritarian regimes diminishes as these
   audiences grow independent from the regime. Using case law research,
   archival research, and interviews, I demonstrate the utility of the
   audience-based framework for explaining judicial behavior in
   authoritarian regimes by exploring cross-temporal variation across
   authoritarian regimes in Pakistan. This study integrates ideas-based and
   interest-based explanations for judicial behavior in a generalizable
   framework for explaining variation in judicial assertiveness against
   authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing movement toward accessibility in arts spaces,
   including recent legislative changes and commitments at individual,
   organizational, and systemic levels to integrating access into the arts
   across Canada. In this article, we explore Relaxed Performance (RP) in
   the context of this movement. We present the results of a reflexive
   thematic analysis of interviews conducted with participants who
   completed RP training offered by the British Council to understand the
   training's effectiveness and impact. We explore the significance of the
   training, and of RP in general, and in relation to disability studies
   and cultural and political activism. We undertake this exploration
   against a backdrop of interrogating who RP is for and by. The themes we
   describe are: Committed to Access. Training is Critical, Inviting Bodies
   to be Bodies, and Imagining Audiences. These themes tell a story of how
   RP relates to broader access work, the importance of training grounded
   in and led by disability/difference, the need to consider the
   relationships between bodies and spaces, and the tensions inherent to
   billing RP as `for all.{''} We conclude with an exploration of possible
   modifications, enhancements, or theoretical imaginings that could help
   RP to become more radically open to difference as it emerges, shifts,
   and changes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to attempt to determine an objective
   definition of social justice as a category in political science. The
   author draws attention to the fact that since the times of ancient
   Greece, this has been a central concept accompanying in-depth analyses
   of politics. Making refer- ences to classical approaches, the author
   tries to determine the main formal elements common in publicly
   postulated interpretations. The concept proposed by the author relies on
   differentiation between two perspectives on the idea as part of a
   discursive understanding of politics. Within this framework, solely
   integration of distribution and recognition allows for capturing the
   phenomenon of overlapping economic inequalities and hierarchical status
   orders in societies. Both mechanisms are united by the fact that the
   starting point for implementing the principles of social justice is the
   sanctioning of equal moral significance to every member of a political
   community.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {291-319},
Abstract = {The explosive growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020 presented
   a sharp challenge to the institutional and economic capacity of
   countries around the world. This article examines efforts to confront
   and cope with the pandemic in a specific case, that of Colombia. It
   identifies a crisis of governability in the country that has been
   exacerbated by the pandemic, but which preceded COVID-19 and is likely
   to outlast it as well. We describe the context in which the pandemic
   unfolded and the government's response, which has laid bare the
   fragility of Colombia's socioeconomic and political achievements,
   evidencing deeper structural problems. The country is subject to a high
   level of informality in the economy's, a lack of social safety nets for
   more than half of the population, and the ongoing presence of violence
   and illegal groups. With the pandemic added to this backdrop, social
   tensions rose, and blame games and confrontations between national and
   subnational governments became part of the daily news. Policy measures
   were undertaken to reduce the number of infections, including extensive
   lockdowns; while assessments of their effectiveness in meeting their
   stated objectives vary, there has undeniably been significant regression
   on economic and social indicators. The dynamics of the 2022 elections
   will undoubtedly be marked by the consequences of the COVID-19
   emergency.},

Abstract = {This paper is aimed to analyze political communication 2.0 on candidates
   for mayor of Valencia's Twitter profiles whom, according to the CIS,
   were expected to obtain representation in the city council. The analysis
   includes all tweets published in these profiles during the electoral
   campaign held between May 10th and 24th, 2019. The study is carried out
   at two levels: a quantitative one, in which the published messages are
   collected and accounted for, and another qualitative, in which they are
   classified thematically. In addition, the interaction with the
   citizen-voter is investigated through the tools availables for users.
   The results reflect a decisive, strategic and dissimilar use of profiles
   by different political leaders. The study shows that, despite the
   increasing use of this microbbloging network by political
   representatives, this instrument offers endless possibilities that
   leaders must still learn to exploit in order to reach their electorate
   and gain their support in the polls.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a theoretical reflection on the treatment of
   inequality at present, considering, in particular, the contributions of
   this concept in the analysis of social structure. Although the
   reflection arises from readings essentially located in Latin America,
   the question far exceeds it as a territorial axis, and it places the
   issue as one of the most current ones in social studies. It is an
   eminently theoretical reflection built from the re-reading of classic
   and current texts intentionally selected for analysis. From this, the
   current relevance of the various perspectives on inequality, its
   dimensions and its ways of being linked can be deduced for the analysis
   of the social structure.},

Title = {Communal Conflicts in Nasarawa State, North Central Nigeria: A
   Socio-Contextual Rethink},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-100},
Abstract = {Nasarawa State in North Central Nigeria has been notorious for communal
   conflicts. Such conflicts have often assumed complicated dimensions
   reflective of the social dynamics of the state. Oftentimes, the
   conflicts are framed in terms of identitarian differences and
   contestations, whilst the underlying drivers derive essentially from the
   socio-structural dynamics of the conflict context. By way of mixed
   research that is predicated on a combination of field and desk sources,
   this article interrogates the contemporary manifestations of communal
   conflicts in Nasarawa State through the combined lenses of liberal
   political ecology and conflict analysis. The article observes that the
   ethno-primordial cleavages of the focal state have provided veritable
   pretexts for the prevalence of communal conflicts, making such conflicts
   problematic to understand as well as resolve. The outcome of the
   analysis indicates that communal conflicts in the focal state have been
   both dynamic and opportunistic, often feeding into the existing
   primordial and structural fault -lines to assume multiple complications.
   There is therefore a need to understand the peculiar nature and dynamics
   of such conflicts in order to know how best to interpret, analyse and
   mitigate them.},

Title = {Electoral Realignments Within the Left in the Aftermath of Neoliberal
   Crises. A Critical Juncture Framework for Latin America and Southern

Abstract = {The Latin American ``Turn to the Left{''} consisted in either the
   consolidation of traditional left-of-centre parties or the emergence of
   new anti-neoliberal populist projects that decisively shaped the
   respective national party systems in reaction to major neoliberal
   crises. Some Southern European countries similarly experienced the rise
   of new populist parties (Podemos, Syriza and the Five Star Movement)
   while in Portugal we witnessed the consolidation of the existing
   left-of-centre parties. This article proposes a middle-range theory to
   give a cross-regional account of the eventual emergence of different
   anti-neoliberal populist parties in the aftermath of a neoliberal
   economic crisis. The argument focuses on the heterogeneity of such an
   `Anti-Neoliberal Populism' category, by looking at the party
   organisation and the relationship with the unions and with the
   anti-austerity social movements. The framework thus proposes four
   different categories of ``successful political projects{''} emerged in
   the aftermath of the crisis: a ``Labour-based Left{''} (in Uruguay and
   Portugal); a ``party-rooted populism{''} (in Argentina and Greece); a
   ``movement ( based) populism{''} (in Bolivia and Spain); and a
   ``leader-initiated populism{''} (in Venezuela and Italy).},

Abstract = {In the city of Milan, the pandemic generated by the spread of Covid-19
   in 2020 led to increased inequality between different social groups.
   This paper reports the case of a neighbourhood community fund promoted
   by a group of non-profit organisations in one of the poorest areas of
   the city during the first lockdown (February-June 2020). While providing
   emergency aid to people who did not access institutional measures during
   the pandemic, this initiative has also boosted a process of
   reconfiguring the local network structure, supporting a collective
   redefinition of the practices and meanings of territorial networking for
   welfare provision. Referring to direct social action (DSA) theory, the
   article reflects on the role of community-based DSAs in innovating
   welfare policies and addressing social and territorial inequalities,
   looking at network-shaped forms of cooperation among third sector
   organisations.},

   ultimately, what scope it can have; that is, what the consequences can
   be, and what evidential value their reports can have in the framework of
   a process. All this with the purpose of framing the private
   investigation in the demands derived from the constitutional text of
   respect of the fundamental rights, starting from its effectiveness so
   much vertical, as horizontal; taking into account that the action of the
   detectives, more and more demanded, affects rights that are nuclear,
   notably, the protection of the domicile, the secret of the

Title = {Measuring objective and subjective class: the effects of survey
   questionnaires on the study of class voting},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Despite its crucial role for social scientists, the concept of social
   class remains elusive and its measurement inconsistent. Building on the
   class voting literature, this study presents an updated assessment of
   the explanatory power of vote of objective class indicators (occupation,
   income and education) and subjective class measures. To do so, it uses
   three class schemes commonly used in survey questionnaires: two of them
   refer to the lowest categories as `lower' or `working' class
   alternatively, while the third one uses a numerical scale. This article
   scrutinizes (a) the link between objective indicators and subjective
   class, (b) the association between the two sets of measures and voting
   behaviour and ideology and (c) the influence of different subjective
   class measurements on the results. Based on an experimental survey
   fielded in Catalonia, the results show that different subjective class
   schemes result in substantially different distributions of class
   identities. Despite these differences, all subjective class measures
   appear to be more robustly associated with political preferences and
   behaviour than objective indicators. Once subjective class is controlled
   for, the significance of the association between objective indicators
   and the dependent variable is influenced by the stratifying power of the
   survey question used to measure class identity.},

Abstract = {The article aims to understand the policy developed since 2018 in
   Brazil, in the light of Weber's thinking. For this purpose, the
   expository path between Rationality and the Weberian Reason of State was
   adopted, as well as the death policy that presents itself with more
   evidence from the pandemic (COVID-19). The text uses
   hypothetical-deductive methodology and bibliographic research. The
   conclusion reached is that the Reason of State can constrain the Law to
   make a death policy feasible and cause negative effects to the
   Civilizing Process.},

Abstract = {This article explores civilian agency and civil resistance under
   Islamist insurgents' rule in southern Somalia in the period 2006 to
   2012. After almost two decades of civil war, local institutions were
   weakened and the communities could not resist tight Islamist control.
   The traditional authorities either fled or chose to cooperate with the
   new rulers. However, while treading a fine line, traditional authorities
   were still able to raise community concerns and influence the Islamist
   rulers' behaviour through limited forms of civil resistance. Although
   not changing the overall political situation, traditional authorities
   were instrumental in reducing tension and improving civilian life.},

Abstract = {Contemporary history of the Middle East has seen at least four periods
   of active inter-state alliance formation - three of which led by the
   United States. The return of Russia to the Middle East has helped shape
   new alliances and coalitions. Unlike the American ``philosophy{''} of
   alliance formation underpinned by the imperative for a comprehensive
   politicomilitary presence as well as prevention of, first, Soviet and
   then, Iranian regional expansion, the Russian model is oriented toward
   the players, cooperation with which could solve a current or a potential
   crisis at a specific time period. Coupled with consistent and pragmatic
   foreign policy course, it was nontrivial strategies for flexible
   alliance-formation that enabled Moscow to establish itself as one of the
   leading player in the turbulent region as well as a responsible global
   power. At the same time, the comparative analysis of the Russian
   campaign in Syria and Moscow's relations with key states in the region
   shows that Russia has been exercising elements of at least three
   alliance-formation strategies.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the criminal responsibility for illegally
   organizing migration, using a comparative documentary-based methodology.
   Constant changes in public life suggest the need to improve states'
   criminal policy in the field of establishing responsibility for
   organizing illegal migration, both nationally and internationally. An
   analysis of the provisions of international criminal law makes it
   possible to consider various legal approaches to the criminalization of
   acts in the field of migration. The document underpins the need to
   develop a unified approach to determining the characteristics of the
   crime in question, as it is transnational. It is concluded that,
   regardless of the different approaches of States to recognize illegal
   population migration, the organization of this illegal activity, in the
   presence of certain particular signs, should be recognized as a crime.
   At the same time, the organization of illegal migration is defined as
   the commission by a criminal group (association of criminal groups) of
   actions aimed at creating the conditions for the illegal movement of
   foreign nationals across the state border or their illegal presence in
   each country.},

Title = {From Decentring Agenda to Decentring Application An Illustrative Case of

Abstract = {In recent years the international landscape has undergone major shifts
   and deep transformations. These facts are mirrored in the academic
   literature introducing concepts of Global International Relations,
   pluralization of agency and norms contestation. Particularly, European
   studies is now confronted with a challenging task to contribute to the
   identification, analysis and further outline of the appropriate
   strategies for the EU in this new complex and more demanding reality.
   One of the latest conceptual attempts proposes solutions which `make
   sense of our multipolar order and. reconstitute European agency in a
   non-European world' arrived in the package of the so-called `Decentring
   agenda' (Nikolaidis \& Fisher Onar 2013). Recently authors have
   delivered on the operationalization of the decentring agenda into
   various spheres of scientific inquiry dealing with European affairs
   (Keukeleire \& Lecocq, 2018). This article aims to further extend the
   reach of decentring, specifically towards practical application of
   decentring in strategic policy planning and policymaking. The EU's
   External Human Rights Policy (EHRP) is a particularly sensitive subject
   calling for the application of the decentring approach. Particularly in
   this paper, decentring is demonstrated and illustratively applied on the
   very basic, direct and strategic level of Human Rights and Democracy
   Country Strategies (HRDCS). It intends to fill the small but crucial gap
   between academic conceptual work, which is still not fully in touch with
   practical application, and the demand from the side of policymakers who
   lack time for study and `translation' of conceptual innovations stemming
   from political theory and political science into their daily practice.},

Abstract = {This article explores the forms of housing and living of the subaltern
   classes in the French urban context of the early 19th century affected
   by the social consequences of the Industrial Revolution. It focuses on
   the social representations and discourses developed by the liberal
   elites in order to retrace the genesis of the concepts of ``domestic
   comfort{''} and ``public hygiene{''}. The cholera epidemic of 1832 and
   the growth of the hygienist movement are identified as crucial driving
   forces for the emergence of plans of urban and housing reform for the
   working class aimed at protecting the social order and public health.},

   The first part of the article focuses on the study of far right from a
   social movement studies perspective, analyzing through a review
   literature the methodological implications that a qualitative approach
   can arise and how dealing with them. The second part of the article is
   based on the fieldwork experienced during my research on CasaPound
   Italia, reporting the ethical implications and the challenges linked to
   researching far-right movements from a close-up perspective. In
   particular, is focuses on the ethical and political dilemmas arising as
   a consequence of methodological and theoretical choices used by the
   researcher, dealing with the whole research project.},

Abstract = {In international public law, the concept of state crime has been
   extensively debated. For some international law commentators ``{[}t]he
   concept of state responsibility for international crimes is juridically
   feasible and may be analyzed in terms of a criminal organization model
   or a corporate crime model{''} (Jorgensen 2000: 280); to others,
   ``{[}t]he criminal state is juridically speaking a nonsense... The
   punishability of the state is both a legal and a practical
   impossibility.{''} (Drost 1959: 304). Although currently common legal
   understanding represents this notion as alien to the legal tradition,
   this term has a relevant place in the historical debates and development
   of international law. This paper discusses international law
   developments in contrast to criminological reflections relating to state
   crime, drawing attention to possible cross-references between these
   disciplines.},

Abstract = {Evaluating Turkey-Russia relations is a dilemma, as the two countries
   fluctuate between perceptions of mutual historical hostility and
   strategic partnership. An alternative perspective is needed to get
   beyond the impasse of this dilemma. The main purpose of this study is to
   explain the common aspects of the grand strategies of Turkey and Russia
   within the framework of the pattern and to evaluate the policies of both
   countries in Syria, Libya, and the South Caucasus where the interests of
   both intersect and occasional conflict. We propose that Turkey-Russia
   relations can best be defined around the concepts of `smart alignment'
   and flexible competition.' Their bilateral relations cannot be
   considered black or white in the abstract, but rather take place in the
   gray zone.' Alternative scenarios for the future of bilateral relations
   are presented in the conclusion.},

Volume = {166},
Number = {2},
Pages = {10-17},
Abstract = {While the `fear, honour and interest' trinity is immensely popular, it
   is also fallacious. Samuel Zilincik discusses how the trinity is not a
   neutral analytical tool but rather a rhetorical instrument to advocate
   foreign aggression. It conveys an incomplete picture of war causation by
   focusing on the aggressor's motivation while ignoring that of the
   defender. It also insufficiently explains motivations for hostile
   behaviour by omitting salient stimuli and the variance of emotional
   motives across cultures. Through its popularity, the trinity also
   detracts attention from truly insightful observations that Thucydides
   made in his work. Zilincik suggests that going beyond the trinity is
   essential to enhancing knowledge of strategic affairs.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the empirical literature on militant
   democracy and successor party bans by comparing post-1945 West Germany
   and Italy. These countries shared a right-authoritarian past but their
   tolerance of right-authoritarian parties differed. Looking for reasons
   behind the ban of the Sozialistische Reichspartei Deutschlands and the
   survival of the Movimento sociale italiano, this study tests five
   conditions: (1) ambiguity towards - if not open approval of - violence;
   (2) absence of effective alternatives to proscription; (3)
   securitization; (4) veto player agreement; (5) veto player incentives.
   We find that securitization is a necessary condition for proscription,
   whereas approval of violence is not. While neither the presence of
   effective alternatives nor veto player incentives relate to ban outcomes
   in a consistent pattern, veto player support remains crucial. Given the
   findings from this comparative study, we conclude that successor party
   bans should not belong to a separate category of militant democracy.},

Abstract = {We study how international status concerns among the public affect
   support for political leaders, arguing that because status competition
   is pervasive in social life and because international status competition
   entails high-profile displays of scientific or martial savvy, the public
   is likely to be attuned to the status implications of foreign policy
   crises. We test this argument in seven survey experiments across four
   issue areas. The results show that adverse outcomes in world affairs
   increase expectations of international status loss and, through that
   mechanism, reduce presidential approval. Analysis of open-ended survey
   responses reveals that the public views international status in much the
   same way that international relations scholars do: it is
   multidimensional, positional, and instrumentally useful. Taken together,
   our results suggest that the public's international status concerns have
   significant implications for leaders and offer new insight into how the
   public parses the implications of events abroad.},

Abstract = {Digital media affordances create interesting potential opportunities for
   educators to integrate these technologies into the classroom in an
   effort to achieve greater student success. While there are many reasons
   to suspect that using digital media in the political science classroom
   may yield positive effects, there are few experimental studies of these
   effects. In this study, I leverage a longitudinal experimental design to
   study the effectiveness of using Twitter in introductory American
   politics courses to increase political interest, news consumption, and
   student learning outcomes. The findings show that using Twitter in the
   classroom has no significant influence on political interest or news
   consumption when controlling for prior levels of these variables.
   However, there may be a small positive influence on student learning
   outcomes that should be further explored.},

Abstract = {Devolution in the UK has now been in place for over 20 years. A key
   support mechanism for the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales
   and Northern Ireland is the Public Account Committees (PACs). Aside from
   their formal role in ensuring financial regularity and probity, they aim
   to strengthen accountability at the regional level. This study examines
   the effectiveness of the PACs measured through the perception of key
   stakeholders (PAC members, witnesses, auditors and officials). Using Q
   methodology, it identifies four clusters of participants: Team Players,
   Peace Makers, Bureaucrats and Attention Seekers, and captures their
   perceptions of what makes the devolved PACs most effective.},

Abstract = {In recent years, great enthusiasm has been expressed about the benefits
   of the digital textbook, which is capturing more and more of the
   academic book market. However, questions remain about the extent to
   which e-textbooks actually improve educational outcomes, especially with
   respect to the impact for students in political science. Using a
   quasi-experimental design employed in introductory political science
   courses, this research begins to address these limitations by directly
   assessing the impact of the online text platform on several different
   educational outcomes. The results indicate that the digital format has a
   positive impact on both students' self-report of engagement with the
   textbook and on reading compliance levels, although a student's interest
   in politics was found to be an important mediating factor. Text format
   is not a significant predictor for most measures of academic
   performance, although assignment of the e-textbook is associated with
   substantially lower average course grades. Greater student involvement
   with supplemental resources provided by the digital platform, however,
   has a strong and positive impact on performance on all learning
   measures. The results therefore suggest that if students are properly
   encouraged or required to interact with the digital text platform, the
   benefits of using the e-textbook outweigh the potential drawbacks.},

Title = {Farmers and the Origin of the Welfare State: Evidence from 308 Roll Call
   Votes between 1882 and 1940☆},

Abstract = {Studies of early social policy development highlight the progressive
   role of farmers, especially in Scandinavian countries. I argue that this
   notion does not match with the role played by farmer's representatives
   or the party in parliament. Being ideologically committed to more
   market-oriented solutions, less exposed to labour market risks and
   fearing for their labour supply, Farmers as a social group and party, I
   argue, had strong incentives to resist welfare state expansion. This
   study moves beyond single events or a small selection of reforms used in
   previous studies, to ascertain preferences of farmers over all welfare
   reforms undertaken up to 1940. Using newly collected data on roll calls
   for 308 failed and successful legislative proposals in Norway between
   1882 and 1940, totalling 24,791 votes this approach allows for greater
   precision in measuring the preferences of classes and parties on welfare
   policy. I find that farmer MPs as a class and later as a party
   consistently downvote generous welfare compared to the worker parties.
   Conservatives and Farmers turn out to be equally antagonistic to welfare
   proposals compared to Labour. This pattern is not substantially
   transformed during the period of Worker-Farmer coalitions of the 1930s.
   Further, considering the backgrounds of Members of Parliament (MP),
   farmers' representatives systematically vote against generous welfare
   proposals, even voting and vocally protesting coverage extensions to the
   rural sector. It is therefore doubtful whether the origins of
   Scandinavian universalism prior to 1940 can be found in the role played
   by farmers.},

Abstract = {The British government's Prevent Duty puts an obligation on specified
   public sectors to ``keep people from being drawn into terrorism{''}. The
   policy has been a point of contention within the public discourse, but
   interview data shows that there is a grudging consent for Prevent
   policing amongst the civilians implementing it. This article explores
   how this consent is manufactured and what this tells us about the
   changing nature of counter-terrorism policing in civic life. Using
   Gramsci's concept of hegemony, this article will explain how Prevent is
   being transformed from a coercive statutory instrument into a common
   sense approach by the co-optation of civic norms. This enquiry is
   informed by the findings of interviews conducted with Prevent
   co-ordinators and employees of specified authorities in England. These
   interviews provide insights into how counter-terrorism monitoring is
   diffused within civic spaces and the nature of consent for this
   policing. Analysing these findings through a Gramscian lens explains how
   Prevent is normalised as a civic duty. It also helps chart a course for
   this hegemonic regime, which is moving beyond specific sectors towards a
   community of counter-terrorism citizens conducting surveillance as
   common sense practice.},

Abstract = {Increasingly salient in democratic politics are the divides among
   political parties regarding how they mobilize supports between ethnic
   majorities and minorities. Why, then, do some members of a minority
   group support political parties that seem antithetical to the interests
   of minority groups? We draw on group conflict theory to suggest that a
   partial explanation rests on perceived competition within minority
   groups. We test this theory by focusing on Republican Party support
   among Asian Americans in the United States. Based on two representative
   surveys and an original online survey experiment of Asian Americans, we
   demonstrate that perceived competition among racial minority groups has
   a significant effect on the partisanship of Asian American and pushes
   them toward the Republican Party. We also present observational evidence
   suggesting our theory applies to other minority groups. Our findings
   provide critical implications on how race affects politics in
   democracies with increasingly diversified ethnic minority groups.},

Abstract = {Why do some governments engage in genocide or politicide during civil
   war while others do not? I argue that leader tenure influences
   bargaining possibilities between the regime and rebels. Rebels face less
   uncertainty about a longer-tenured leader's willingness to commit to
   concessions to end the conflict with terms that better the rebels'
   position. This narrows the longer-tenured leader's ability to credibly
   offer the rebels concessions. Facing a constrained bargaining
   environment, longer-tenured leaders become more likely to turn to
   atrocity in an effort to fully defeat the opposition group and its
   supporters. Statistical analysis of all genocide and politicide in civil
   war since 1946 supports this claim. Evidence from Milosevic's atrocities
   in Kosovo help illustrate the mechanisms.},

Abstract = {During his four years in office, Congress made historic chat-lenges to
   President Donald Trump's authority as Commander in Chief, twice invoking
   the 1973 War Powers Resolution. The first resolution, passed in 2019,
   expressed disapproval of the U.S.' logistical and material support for
   Saudi Arabia's campaign against the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen. The
   second challenge occurred in 2020 after Trump authorized a drone strike
   that killed Iranian Major General Qassam Soleimani. In response,
   Congress passed a WPR that stipulated that any future military action
   against the regime would require express legislative authorization.
   Using a case study approach, this essay examines why Congress chose to
   employ the WPR as a policy tool after decades of dormancy. Ultimately, I
   argue that a confluence of factors compelled majorities in both chambers
   of Congress to use the War Powers Resolution to make a powerful rebuke
   of the administration's policy. Drawing on a wealth of existing
   literature about the factors that impede or compel Congressional
   activism in use-of-force debates, I find that in both cases, members of
   Congress faced strong moral, legal, and strategic incentives to act,
   with few attendant political risks. As such, while the passage of two
   wars powers resolutions represented an important milestone in
   interbranch relations, it likely does not presage a new era of
   Congressional assertiveness in war powers.},

Abstract = {How should political scientists navigate the ethical and methodological
   quandaries associated with analyzing leaked classified documents and
   other nonconsensually acquired sources? Massive unauthorized disclosures
   may excite qualitative scholars with policy revelations and quantitative
   researchers with big-data suitability, but they are fraught with
   dilemmas that the discipline has yet to resolve. This paper critiques
   underspecified research designs and opaque references in the
   proliferation of scholarship with leaked materials, as well as
   incomplete and inconsistent guidance from leading journals. It
   identifies provenance as the primary concept for improved standards and
   reviews other disciplines' approaches to this problem. It elaborates
   eight normative and evidentiary criteria for scholars by which to assess
   source legitimacy and four recommendations for balancing their
   trade-offs. Fundamentally, it contends that scholars need deeper
   reflection on source provenance and its consequences, more humility
   about whether to access new materials and what inferences to draw, and
   more transparency in citation and research strategies.},

Abstract = {Although the research surrounding PRR parties has increased over the
   years, health policies, an important part of the welfare system, have
   generally been neglected. Using an in-depth case-study approach, this
   article analyses the health policy consequences of PRR parties in
   Austrian and Italian subnational governments over time, thereby
   expanding the units of analysis while also looking at an understudied
   level of government. The findings indicate a propensity towards
   neoliberalism, combined with accents of welfare chauvinism in Austria
   and a strategy of shutting down the Freedom Party of Austria. In the
   case of Italy, both regional cases mark a desire for welfare chauvinism
   but an inability to restrict healthcare access directly. In all four
   cases (except Burgenland), the PRR parties are consistently chauvinistic
   (despite seeming to prefer welfare to liberal chauvinism, they typically
   implement the latter for health policies) and any factor of generosity
   comes from a social democratic coalition partner or not at all.},

Abstract = {Are campaigns epiphenomena? The dominant answer in the US literature
   seems to be Yes. Outcomes are driven by `fundamental' considerations in
   place before the campaign begins, such that dynamics within the campaign
   reflect the elimination of `accidental' considerations. Multi-country
   comparisons, where they exist, tend to be fragmentary. Where they are
   not fragmentary, they are taken from so high an altitude that critical
   interpretive details are lost. Also fragmentary, surprisingly, is
   documentation of the US case itself. This paper identifies two
   overlapping but distinct claims: about frontrunners and about
   incumbents. We also identify an insufficiently recognized fact, that the
   very idea of a `fundamental' is contested, and that this broadens the
   scope for potential within-campaign dynamics. We employ rolling
   cross-section survey data from the US, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and
   Canada.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how supermajority rules in a legislature affect
   electoral competition. We construct an extensive-form game wherein
   parties choose policy platforms in an election. Post election, the
   policy is determined based on a legislative voting rule. At symmetric
   equilibrium, supermajority rules induce divergence of policy platforms
   if and only if the parties are sufficiently attached to their preferred
   platform. Thus, supermajority rules may not always lead to moderate
   policies once electoral competition is considered.},

Abstract = {Most citizens of representative democracies do not take political
   decisions in their everyday lives. Although participation in periodic
   elections, political parties, or social movements varies, above all,
   according to socio-economic status, taking a political decision is, in
   general, a relatively extraordinary event for the vast majority of
   citizens. The everyday political experience of these citizens is rather
   structured by watching and listening to political elites. Unlike the
   tenor of democratic theory, this quotidian mode of passively following
   politics is ocular democracy's starting point. So far, the debate on
   ocular democracy has emphasized its shortcomings as a normative theory.
   Notwithstanding these shortcomings, this article illustrates the
   potential of ocular democracy as an analytical tool in the context of
   intra-party democracy. Podemos' intra-party procedures are analyzed by
   complementing an institutional perspective with ocular democracy, thus
   showing how a party leader inclined to appear particularly venturesome
   undermines ambitious forms of intra-party democracy.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a growing body of political science scholarship has
   shown how territorial expansion and Indigenous dispossession profoundly
   shaped American democratic ideas and institutions. However, scant
   attention has been paid to Indigenous thinkers and activists who have
   reshaped the colonial and imperial facets of democracy. I reconstruct
   the writings of the Oneida thinker and activist Laura Cornelius Kellogg
   (1880-1947). I contend that Kellogg offers a political theory of
   ``decolonial-democracy,{''} which challenged settler-imperial domination
   by bringing together a project of Indigenous self-determination with
   reimagined democratic narratives, values, and institutions. The first
   and second sections place Kellogg in pan-Indigenous debates within the
   Society of American Indians and among non-Indigenous Progressive
   reformers, in order to show how she brings together a pan-Indigenous and
   social-democratic critique of American democracy. The third section
   interprets her landmark 1920 pamphlet Our Democracy and the American
   Indian as a counter-narrative of the American founding read through the
   disavowed influence of the Haudenosaunee confederacy, a return to which
   she casts as a basis for democratic and Indigenous renewal. The final
   section outlines her vision of Indigenous self-government as ``Indian
   communism{''} in the form of her ``Lolomi Plan.{''} In sum, I trace a
   counter-politics envisioning a form of relational self-determination
   within a confederated, multinational political order, as well as the
   difficulty of bringing decolonization together with democracy in
   practice.},

Abstract = {European liberals have viewed themselves as the avatars of the rational
   individual as opposed to the mob or tyrant. Faced with the populist,
   democratic, and egalitarian character of US society, American liberals
   could not take this point of view for granted. For that reason, they
   turned to Freud, although with mixed success. I explore this turn in
   three consecutive moments: the New Deal, when liberals first understood
   America to be not only a class society, but a mass society; Richard
   Hofstadter's theory of paranoia, which he applied to the right-wing born
   with McCarthyism; and the New Left and feminist attempts to remake
   liberalism into a more democratic and multicultural creed. In all three
   cases, I argue that the liberal commitment to capitalist property
   relations and the market limited its ability to advance a more robust
   and democratic politics.</p>},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between the idea of popular
   sovereignty and the conditions for legal validity and argue that the
   latter imposes definitive limits to the former. Popular sovereignty has
   been defined as the condition when the will of the people is the
   ``supreme authority in the state{''}. Following this conception, there
   is no authority above the people and this is traditionally understood to
   mean that the authority of the people is above the constitution. Legal
   validity, though admittedly still debated, is here understood along
   Hart's ``rule of recognition{''} According to which the validity of
   norms ultimately depends on the social practices of public officials.
   Though presumably uncontroversial that democratic peoples are entitled
   to remake the constitution, the powers of the people with respect to the
   substance of the law are nevertheless limited with respect to decisions
   of legal validity. The most basic rules in a legal system are not found
   in the constitution as they are the rules deciding what is to count as a
   legal norm within that system. They are more fundamental than the
   constitution because they also define what norms is the constitution
   legally speaking.},

Title = {Voter turnout in direct democracy: A joint analysis of individual,
   referendum and community factors},

Abstract = {In the context of an ever growing importance and usage of referendums
   around the globe, this article provides a comprehensive approach to
   analyse the determinants of participation in direct democratic votes. In
   the absence of conclusive empirical evidence about which factors drive
   direct democratic participation, studies tend to adopt election-specific
   findings and assume the determinants of electoral turnout to equally
   apply for referendums. Yet, a strict empirical test of these numerous
   determinants in a referendum context is still missing. By examining
   aspects stemming from both election-specific and referendum-specific
   contexts, this article aims to first test the applicability of common
   electoral theories of turnout for direct democratic participation and
   second to analyse the relevance of each factor when simultaneously
   examined with other contextual and individual factors. This holistic
   approach represents reality as adequate as possible, that is, to
   consider various factors that may simultaneously influence the
   individual decision to vote. Next to individual variables, the analysis
   particularly focuses on two contextual levels, the community a person
   lives in and factors linked to a given referendum. The discussion and
   joint analysis of competing factors addresses the problem of
   underspecified turnout models, which commonly prevents a detailed
   assessment of the relative importance of the determinants of turnout.
   The study uses registered data from the canton of Geneva, Switzerland,
   which provides official information about individual participation
   across 43 referendums in 45 communities. We match this individual data
   with referendum-related factors, such as campaign intensity and
   importance of the issues at stake, and community-level variables, such
   as wealth and urbanization. The results of our multilevel,
   cross-classified models show significant context-related effects,
   stemming mainly from the referendum and less from the community level.
   Still, the main driver of direct democratic participation is individual
   determinants, in particular citizens' past participation record.},

Title = {Neither Left Behind nor Superstar: Ordinary Winners of Digitalization at
   the Ballot Box},

Abstract = {The nascent literature on the political consequences of technological
   change studies either left-behind voters or successful technology
   entrepreneurs ({''}superstars{''}). However, it neglects the large share
   of skilled workers who benefit from limited but steady economic
   improvements in the knowledge economy. This article examines how
   workplace digitalization affects political preferences among the entire
   active labor force by combining individual-level panel data from the
   United Kingdom with industry-level data on information and communication
   technology capital stocks between 1997 and 2017. We first demonstrate
   that digitalization was economically beneficial for workers with middle
   and high levels of education. We then show that growth in digitalization
   increased support for the Conservative Party, increased support for the
   incumbent party, and voter turnout among beneficiaries of economic
   change. Our results hold in an instrumental variable analysis and
   multiple robustness checks. While digitalization undoubtedly produces
   losers (along with some superstars), ordinary winners of digitalization
   are an important stabilizing force that is content with the political
   status quo.</p>},

Abstract = {Individuals vary in how intensely they care about political outcomes.
   Despite attention to intensity in studies of representation and public
   opinion, the study of elections has paid less attention to the strategic
   dynamics of intensity. I present a theory that brings intensity to
   electoral competition. I investigate the preelection actions of voters
   and the response of candidates through a game-theoretic model. Because
   intensity is unobserved and subject to misrepresentation, voters
   communicate intensity through costly political action. Candidates
   respond to voter actions by sometimes proposing policy opposed by a
   low-intensity majority. The theory suggests when and why citizens choose
   costly action and expression, describes why citizens might prefer
   candidates with negative traits such as a history of misconduct,
   indicates when majoritarian systems might implement nonmajoritarian
   policy, shows when costly political action is welfare enhancing, and
   might help scholars reason about how candidates learn about voter
   interests.},

Abstract = {This paper explores a major road to substantive representation in
   democracies, by clarifying whether demands of rich and poor citizens are
   taken up in the electoral platforms of political parties. Doing so
   constitutes a substantial broadening and deepening of our understanding
   of substantive representation - broadening the countries, issue-areas
   and years that form the empirical basis for judging whether democracies
   manifest unequal representation; and deepening the process of
   representation by clarifying a key pathway connecting societal demands
   to policy outcomes. The paper hypothesises that party systems in general
   will respond more strongly to wealthy than to poor segments of a polity.
   It also hypothesises that left parties will more faithfully represent
   poorer and less significantly represent richer citizens than do right
   parties. We find substantial support for these expectations in a new
   dataset that combines multi-country, multi-issue-area, multi-wave survey
   data with data on party platforms for 39 democracies.},

Abstract = {The article advances two related arguments with regard to term limit
   decisions in Sub-Saharan Africa. We should take a long-term perspective
   on term limit decisions and not describe and explain them as isolated
   events. Such a historical perspective reveals the remarkably stable
   patterns according to which some African countries have enforced
   effective term limits while others have established a tradition of
   circumventing them. Second, these stable term limit trajectories are
   shaped by the institutional legacies of different types of authoritarian
   regimes which had existed before 1990. Single-party authoritarian
   regimes have thus created a favourable institutional context for the
   enforcement of term limits, although through two different mechanisms.
   Personalist regimes, conversely, created an institutional legacy which
   made the continued circumvention of term limits likely. This argument is
   developed both theoretically and by looking at the three cases of
   Tanzania, Zambia and Cote d'Ivoire.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {13},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates that power-sharing supports transitions to
   democracy. However, the resulting quality of democracy remains
   understudied. Given the increasing global spread of power-sharing, this
   is a crucial oversight, as prominent critiques accuse it of a number of
   critical deficiencies. The present article advances this literature in
   two ways. First, it offers a comprehensive discussion of how
   power-sharing affects the quality of democracy, going beyond specific
   individual aspects of democracy. It argues that power-sharing advances
   some of these aspects while having drawbacks for others. Second, it
   offers the first systematic, large-N analysis of the frequently
   discussed consequences of power-sharing for the quality of democracy. It
   relies on a dataset measuring the quality of democracy in 70 countries
   worldwide, combining it with new fine-grained data for institutional
   power-sharing. The results indicate that power-sharing is a complex
   institutional model which privileges a particular set of democratic
   actors and processes, while deemphasizing others.},

Abstract = {Studies on the cohesion by legislators in roll call votes have reported
   an effect of being a member of the ruling coalition, the origin and
   relevance of the bill, the electoral cycle and other institutional
   design features. But the theory also links voting cohesion to the
   subject of the bill, an issue not sufficiently addressed on studies on
   party-level cohesion in Latin American presidential democracies. This
   article tests four hypotheses including the subject of the bill on the
   6468 roll call votes in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile between 2010
   and 2017 legislative years. Rightwing legislators are more cohesive in
   roll call votes on issues related to defense and citizen security.
   Contrary to expectations, leftwing legislators are not more cohesive on
   social issues or human rights. Ruling coalition legislators are less
   cohesive on budget votes. The subject of the bill seems more important
   for rightwing legislators than leftwing ones; although it is speculated
   that this might be due in Chile to the fact that the rightwing coalition
   is comprised by a smaller number of parties which shares more
   ideological homogeneity.},

Abstract = {This paper is positioned at the intersection of two literatures:
   partisan polarization and deliberative democracy. It analyzes results
   from a national field experiment in which more than 500 registered
   voters were brought together from around the country to deliberate in
   depth over a long weekend on five major issues facing the country. A
   pre-post control group was also asked the same questions. The
   deliberators showed large, depolarizing changes in their policy
   attitudes and large decreases in affective polarization. The paper
   develops the rationale for hypotheses explaining these decreases and
   contrasts them with a literature that would have expected the opposite.
   The paper briefly concludes with a discussion of how elements of this
   ``antidote{''} can be scaled.},

Abstract = {How do ethnic groups compete in a decentralized Indonesia? How do their
   political competitions to claim a new province lead to open conflict?
   The Indonesian government devised its massive territorial autonomy (TA)
   strategy-regional proliferation or pemekaran-as part of expansive
   decentralization reform in 1999. While scholarship is generally
   ambiguous regarding the relationship between regional proliferation and
   conflict, many districts still experience small-scale episodic conflict
   some of which may be fuelled by ethnic-group competition after
   pemekaran. This study aims to investigate ethnic groups' political
   competition during the initiation stage of non-successful new province
   campaigns. Using four cases-two new province aspirations, one
   no-province claim and a null case-I argue that ethnic groups' political
   competition can develop to the level of a localized small-scale episodic
   conflict. The evidence suggests that political competition among ethnic
   groups may temporarily escalate due issues of the location of the new
   province's capital location and the future bid for a new gubernatorial
   position. This study fills a scholarly gap in the discussion of ethnic
   groups' politics and conflict (e.g. Cederman, L.-E., Hug, S., Schadel,
   A., \& Wucherpfennig, J. {[}2015]. Territorial autonomy in the shadow of
   conflict: Too little, too late? American Political Science Review,
   109(2), 354-370. doi:10.1017/ S0003055415000118; Cunningham, K. G.
   {[}2014]. Inside the politics of self-determination. Oxford University
   Press). Furthermore, this study finds support for the effectiveness of a
   moratorium policy, such as buying-time tactics to reduce the conflict.},

Abstract = {Between 2016 and 2017, inflows along the central Mediterranean peaked,
   increasing pressures on the southern European border. Coordination with
   Libya to reduce departures has been possible thanks to the role played
   by Italy, backed by the Union. The diplomatic effort exhibited mainly
   through 2017 crafted a framework aimed at simultaneously ensuring
   Libya's interest in regaining full control of its sovereign prerogatives
   and addressing the EU's desire to reduce irregular inflows. This new
   framework is explored in this work through the lens of migration
   diplomacy with a double aim: to enrich the existing body of research by
   proposing a triangular analysis of migration diplomacy and to expand the
   literature on the external dimension of the Union's migration policy, by
   pointing out the political nature of migration relations and its
   critical aspects.},
