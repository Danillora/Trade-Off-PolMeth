Abstract = {Many countries have reduced refugee admissions in recent years, in part
   due to fears that refugees and asylum seekers increase crime rates and
   pose a national security risk. Existing research presents ambiguous
   expectations about the consequences of refugee resettlement on crime. We
   leverage a natural experiment in the United States, where an Executive
   Order by the president in January 2017 halted refugee resettlement. This
   policy change was sudden and significant-it resulted in the lowest
   number of refugees resettled on US soil since 1977 and a 66\% drop in
   resettlement from 2016 to 2017. In this article, we find that there is
   no discernible effect on county-level property or violent crime rates.},

Abstract = {Macro events like the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World
   War have triggered new departures in social policy. What about the
   COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant socio-economic crisis? This article
   analyses the social protection measures taken by governments in the
   global South in response to the crisis, the social protection concepts
   developed by international organisations, and the overall strategies of
   the organisations in view of future shocks. The finding is that while
   the measures taken by governments expectedly have just been stopgap
   measures of a transitory nature, international organisations are
   aspiring to future-oriented policies and present a range of concepts for
   the time after the crisis. However, these are old concepts from
   pre-COVID-19 times, and the main strategy is to expand rather than
   reform the old models, even though the international organisations
   themselves identify new forms of poverty and structural inequalities.
   Moreover, the organisations do not provide conclusive evidence of their
   strategy's viability; the strategy rather reflects a belief in social
   progress. All in all, the crisis has hardly been used as a window of
   opportunity for generating new ideas of social protection. Rather, the
   crisis has revealed the flimsy nature of widespread thinking about
   building social protection in the global South. Conceptually, the
   article draws on world society theory, conceiving of the pandemic as a
   global macro event.},

Abstract = {Partisanship structures mass politics by shaping the votes, policy
   views, and political perceptions of ordinary people. Even so,
   substantial shifts in partisanship can occur when elites signal clear
   differences on a political issue and attentive citizens update their
   views of party reputations. Mismatched partisans who strongly care about
   the issue respond by changing parties in a process of ``issue
   evolution{''} when writ large. Others simply update their views to match
   their party in a ``conflict extension{''} process. We build on these
   models by integrating the largely separate research strands of party
   issue ownership. Using sexual misconduct as a critical case study, we
   argue that partisan change can occur rapidly when party elites move
   strategically to take ownership of an issue, thereby clarifying
   differences between the parties. Using a quasi-experiment, a survey
   experiment, and data from dozens of national surveys, we find recent,
   rapid shifts in party reputations on \#MeToo, views of the issue, party
   votes, and broader party support.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is fundamentally affecting the world by
   challenging governments. Although most countries are still combating the
   virus, China, as the first plagued country, has basically contained the
   pandemic. This review article aims to analyze and explain how the
   Chinese government has achieved this task. By tracing the detailed
   timeline of the pandemic, it dissects the political meritocracy and
   policy integration of the Chinese government, which are the main reasons
   for its policy efficiency and effectiveness. Meritocracy requires the
   government and politicians to respect science, knowledge, evidence,
   rationality, and professionalism, particularly within the background of
   populism and anti-intellectualism. In a pandemic, the Chinese experience
   of political meritocracy and policy integration may balance conflicting
   public values better than liberal democratic nations. Global solidarity
   and cooperation during this pandemic can be better achieved if Chinese
   politics and policies are deeply understood.},

Abstract = {Political parties in Africa and other developing countries are known to
   forge clientelist rather than programmatic ties to voters. Yet this does
   not mean that parties reward strong legislator-voter ties. In this
   paper, I argue for the case of Nigeria that lawmakers seeking to advance
   their political careers are incentivized to direct public resources to
   party members and senior party elites rather than serve their
   constituents in general. I draw on interviews with 8th National Assembly
   (2015-2019) lawmakers as well as quantitative data on MP re-election,
   targeted bills and motions, and the use of constituency development
   funds to demonstrate the predominance of narrow clientelism in Nigeria.
   I also place the Nigerian case in comparative perspective to argue that
   the extent to which legislators devote attention to constituents is
   likely to exist on a continuum, with the causes and consequences of this
   variation requiring further attention from scholars.},

Abstract = {Social media users are not just potential consumers of political content
   they are also potential producers and distributors. In this paper, we
   test whether political predispositions or the popularity of posts best
   explains users' engagement with political content on Facebook. Using a
   large-scale survey deployed in Denmark, we utilize a 2 x 2 x 3 survey
   experiment that manipulates the partisan sponsor of a political message,
   the number of likes attributed to that message, and the nature of the
   comments attached to that post. Our findings indicate that individuals
   are most likely to like, comment, and share political content that
   aligns with their political predispositions, as the choice to like,
   share and comment political content on Facebook is largely unaffected by
   likes and comments from other users. Though we recognize the dangers of
   obstinacy in democratic discourse, we are somewhat assured by these
   findings, as it shows that those who engage with political content do
   not follow a blind herd mentality.},

Abstract = {In post-apartheid South Africa, one of the central analytical questions
   is to do with the continuity of protests, in particular student movement
   protests that are highly driven by social, economic and political
   conditions in the present. In a social and political context of student
   protests, student movement is considered a threat to the state and a
   target for state violence. In this paper, we assert that student
   movement in contemporary South Africa is a social and political space in
   which we can begin to engage with and understand issues of dispossession
   and repossession as re-emerging struggles in South Africa. We also
   assert that student protests should be understood as real or perceived
   emancipatory terrain of transformation within and beyond the university
   campus, but also as the engine that engages with the unfinished struggle
   for decolonisation and transformation in post-apartheid South Africa. We
   draw on and engage with decolonial thought as our analytical lens
   through which to unpack and understand student protests in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Although a growing body of research suggests that the constabularization
   of the military for domestic policing is counterproductive, this
   increasingly prevalent policy has nonetheless enjoyed widespread support
   in the developing world. This study advances our understanding of the
   consequences of militarization for perceptions of law enforcement:
   whether visual features shape perceptions of effectiveness, respect for
   civil liberties, proclivity for corruption and acceptance of
   militarization in one's own neighborhood. Based on a nationally
   representative, image-based, conjoint experiment conducted in Mexico,
   the authors find that military weapons and uniforms enhance perceptions
   of effectiveness and respect for civil liberties, and that the effect of
   military uniform becomes greater with increased military presence. The
   study also finds that gender shapes perceptions of civil liberties and
   corruption, but detects no effect for skin color. The findings suggest
   that a central feature of militarization linked to greater violence -
   military weapons - is paradoxically a key factor explaining favorable
   attitudes, and that women can play a crucial role in improving
   perceptions of law enforcement.},

Abstract = {Should refugees govern refugee camps? This paper argues that they
   should. It draws on normative political thought in consulting the
   all-subjected principle and an instrumental defense of democratic rule.
   The former holds that all those subjected to rule in a political unit
   should have a say in such rule. Through analyzing the conditions that
   pertain in refugee camps, the paper demonstrates that the all-subjected
   principle applies there, too. Refugee camps have developed as near
   distinct entities from their host states. They have formed their own
   economic, legal and even political systems within which refugees are
   subjected to political rule. The paper then demonstrates that democratic
   rule should be preferred over any other decision-making procedure. No
   amount of experts can replace the institutions that would lead to the
   accountability of decision-makers and to the incorporation of refugees
   as situated and epistemically diverse knowers of the problems they face
   and the solutions that would work best.},

Abstract = {The main focus of Bernard Stiegler's critique of automatic society is
   the threat that automatic systems pose to human creative work in
   undermining possibility by eliminating the available time that it takes
   human beings to think and work through problems posed by the relative
   independence of the material world. When humans work creatively, they do
   not automatically translate ideas into reality. Instead, the object
   constantly poses unexpected challenges that must be reflected upon and
   worked through. Surprisingly, even Marx ignored the temporal dimension
   of work involving the material world. Through the example of artistic
   work, this essay illustrates and begins sketching a solution to the
   threat that automatic society poses to creative work. Against Marx, it
   shows that artistic work is never a case of simply imprinting an idea on
   a passive material substratum but is always a struggle through which the
   idea changes in the process of its realization.},

Abstract = {The decline in youth participation in elections has been an ongoing
   concern in Australia, in spite of the requirement for compulsory
   turnout. In 2018, and in response to these concerns, the Australian
   parliament debated an electoral amendment that would lower the national
   voting age to 16 years. The Bill, however, did not succeed even though
   two opposition parties-the Australian Labor Party and the Australian
   Greens-supported the reform and the Morrison Government accepted the
   premise that youth electoral disengagement was a troubling phenomenon.
   Drawing on veto player theory, this article examines how the legislative
   dynamics intersected with partisan self-interest and party value
   priorities to undercut the case for lowering the voting age to 16. The
   Australian case highlights the ways in which latent ideological
   differences among parties can serve to divide them on the inclusiveness
   of franchise, and the democratic goals to be served by voting.},

Abstract = {Many jurists consider the knowledge on legal dogmatics to be scientific
   and refer to it as Legal Science. This is done without much reflection,
   as if the scientific character of legal dogmatics was a given or a
   truism of a sort. In turn, the concept of science is itself the main
   object of a discipline of philosophical knowledge: Philosophy of
   Science. In the present article, we intend to understand what science is
   according to one of the most traditional answers given to this question:
   the inductivist one. In sequence, we aim to reflect on whether, and to
   what extent, the inductivist answer, its characteristics and its limits
   are related to the Legal Science. To achieve that, we carried out
   theoretical and bibliographical research whose starting point was the
   basis from Philosophy of Science itself. Different sources were
   examined, systematized, and compared in order to identify the most
   consistent position. The article presents the following main results: an
   exposition of naive inductivism and its problems, of probabilistic
   inductivism and of the role of theory in observation; a synthesis of the
   main features of Legal Science; a critical reflection on how inductivism
   applies to Legal Science and the nature of the latter.},

Abstract = {China and Japan are haunted by the Second Sino-Japanese War that ended
   more than 70 years ago. The rise of nationalism in China fuelled by the

Abstract = {This investigation aims to determine in which cases the Colombian State
   must respond patrimonially for the violent acts perpetrated by third
   parties, due to the omission in its duty to protect demobilized persons,
   the peace processes in Colombia and competent are the requirements of
   origin and the scope of said responsibility.
   The central aspect, which is addressed, lies in identifying the
   constitutional and legal obligation of the duty of protection by the
   State on people demobilized from illegal armed groups from 2003 to date.
   From this perspective, in addition, determine if that fact can
   compromise the patrimonial responsibility of the State for these facts,
   reviewing what has been its jurisprudential evolution, the imputation
   titles used, the conditions of origin and its scope.
   The investigation was carried out with a fundamental qualitative
   approach in the documentary review, both of legal doctrine, as well as
   books, scientific journals, research theses, academic articles and the
   jurisprudence of the Council of State.
   From the conclusions reached, the failure of the service is highlighted
   as the imputation title that par excellence should be applied to cases
   of State patrimonial responsibility for the violent death of demobilized
   persons.},

Abstract = {Rousseau has not only been considered as one of the most important
   thinkers from the Enlightenment, but also, as a pioneer on Romanticism
   for his investigations on human subjectivity in which he addresses the
   relationship between affective and intellectual faculties. Affectivity
   and politics have been a fructiferous field of research in Rousseau
   studies, especially those related with self-love, love of self and pity.
   Departing from this field, this article aims to inquire into the
   affective roots of subjectivity and how they allow to elucidate social
   sanctions as affective/intellectual mechanisms. Finally, it proposes
   that autonomy is about appropriation and deliberate use of this
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This article elaborates relative deprivation theory to a societal level
   to argue that political unrest is rooted in the polarization of
   citizens' grievance judgments, rather than the mean level of societal
   grievance. Using data from twelve cross-national survey projects, it
   examines the relationship between citizen polarization and political
   protest in eighty-four democracies and semi-democracies from 1977 to
   2010. The study finds that countries with more polarized citizens are
   more likely to experience nonviolent protest. Protests are most likely
   in countries where average citizen grievances are low but citizens are
   polarized, which is consistent with the elaborated theoretical
   expectations of relative deprivation theory.},

Abstract = {The study examines the development of international terrorism and the
   problem of its definition. Consequently, the objective of the study was
   to generate a systemic view of international terrorism and to identify
   current trends in its development. A structural and functional analysis
   of international terrorism as a political phenomenon was used. Based on
   the analytical model provided, the development of international
   terrorism was divided into periods based on political and geographical
   zoning. Three consistent principles determine the key characteristics of
   international terrorism as a rational strategy of unconventional
   political struggle: the transition to asymmetrical actions, attacks on
   symbolic objects, and influencing public opinion as the main objective.
   This triality of characteristics linked to a model of the political
   process defines the existence of international terrorism as a phenomenon
   and provides a key to understanding its dynamics. It is concluded that
   there are four periods in the development of international terrorism,
   divided into two cycles with breaking points, ascending, and descending
   phases. The proposed periodization of the development of international
   terrorism is based on the identification of the centers as
   political-geographical areas, where contradictions are configured and
   the political struggle that is part of the logic of the terrorist
   strategy.},

Abstract = {There is a popular perception that politics is increasingly permeating
   the everyday lives of Americans. Ostensibly non-political objects and
   activities are becoming ``partisan,{''} and there is accordingly talk of
   a cultural divide between Latte-drinking, Volvo-driving Liberals and
   NASCAR-watching, truck-driving Conservatives. This study examines the
   extent to which this perception is accurate. We first find that survey
   respondents have no trouble assigning partisan leaning to non-political
   activities and objects. We then explore whether voters use such
   non-political objects as heuristics in candidate evaluations. We show
   that exposure to images of candidates featuring such objects can affect
   perceptions of candidates' partisanship, but that these cues only very
   rarely shift perceptions in the face of clear policy information. These
   findings have important implications for understanding the way that
   citizens evaluate politics in changing political and media environments.},

Abstract = {Extremists cooperate internationally to `influence and succeed' or
   `survive and thrive' {[}Moghadam, A. (2017). Nexus of Global Jihad:
   Understanding cooperation among terrorist actors. Columbia University
   Press (p. 21)]. Yet, the question of how such cooperation materializes
   and develops has been understudied, especially for right-wing extremism
   in the post-war era. Therefore, this paper studies a phase of heightened
   transnational activity of West German right-wing extremists between 1972
   and 1978. It zooms in on the Nationalsozialistische Kampfgruppe
   Grossdeutschland and the Gruppe Otte, which were spatially and
   temporally connected by the American neo-Nazi Gary Lauck, who led the
   Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei - Auslandsorganisation.
   To study and qualify the impact of transnational engagement on the West
   German extreme right, the paper introduces a new analytical framework
   that integrates the historical transnational approach with insights from
   terrorism studies. Pairing known case studies to previously unused
   primary source material, the paper argues that the transnational
   connections between the three groups transformed from indirect to direct
   cooperation, while evolving across ideological, logistical, and
   operational domains, and resulted in political violence. It concludes
   that the extremist cooperation marked the professionalization and
   multi-lateralization of the West German extreme right in the 1970s.},

Abstract = {Are past border changes responsible for today's civil wars? Departing
   from conventional, state-centric research designs, this article examines
   this question by focusing on ``aggregate{''} ethnic groups, which are
   defined independently of state borders. Introducing a new index of
   ``territorial fractionalization{''} that measures how fragmented such
   groups are across states, we postulate that higher fragmentation is
   linked to a greater risk of civil conflict. Furthermore, we expect that
   groups that experienced increases in fragmentation are particularly
   violence prone, as illustrated by postimperial revisionism and other
   cases of irredentism and secession. To test our arguments, we combine
   geocoded data on ethnic settlement areas with our own newly collected
   data on international borders since 1886, complemented by mediation
   analysis based on ethnonationalist claims. Covering ethnic groups around
   the world since 1946 through 2017, our findings are robust to the
   inclusion of control variables, fixed effects, and the use of
   alternative historical ethnicity data sets.},

Abstract = {Does the share of immigrants in a community influence whether people
   vote for anti-immigration parties? We conduct a systematic review of the
   causal inference literature studying this question. We collect estimates
   from 20 studies and develop a new Bayesian meta-analysis framework to
   account for both between-study heterogeneity in effect sizes and the
   possibility of reporting bias. Although meta-analysis methods that do
   not adjust for reporting bias suggest a moderate effect of local
   immigration, our Bayesian model finds that the effect of local
   immigration on far-right voting is on average negligible once we account
   for reporting bias. However, the analysis also reveals a large
   heterogeneity in effects across contexts, suggesting that local
   immigration may be important for anti-immigration vote shares in certain
   settings.},

Abstract = {Academics are often accused of being secluded in their ``ivory
   towers{''}, focused on research and teaching but uninterested in, or
   unable to engage with, the public debate. If this is actually the case,
   under what conditions and at what particular moment is this likely to
   change? Following on three relevant dimensions-the visibility of
   political scientists, their partisanship and their impact in the public
   sphere-and combining press analysis with original survey data, this
   article has two main aims: first, to assess Italian political
   scientists' (IPSs) social relevance in a period of huge political and
   institutional conflict such as the constitutional referendum held in
   December 2016; second, to explore the potential factors leading IPSs to
   be more or less present in the public debate. For the former, we focus
   on the public visibility of IPSs during the referendum campaign, as well
   as on the content of their public interventions, both concerning their
   neutral/partisan stance and their attitudes towards the constitutional
   reform. For the latter, we empirically test a few personal and
   institutional factors that are likely to influence individuals'
   participation in the referendum debate.},

Abstract = {Polarization may be the most consistent effect of populism, as it is
   integral to the logic of constructing populist subjects. This article
   distinguishes between constitutive, spatial and institutional dimensions
   of polarization, adopting a cross-regional comparative perspective on
   different subtypes of populism in Europe, Latin America and the US. It
   explains why populism typically arises in contexts of low political
   polarization (the US being a major, if partial, outlier), but has the
   effect of sharply increasing polarization by constructing an
   anti-establishment political frontier, politicizing new policy or issue
   dimensions, and contesting democracy's institutional and procedural
   norms. Populism places new issues on the political agenda and realigns
   partisan and electoral competition along new programmatic divides or
   political cleavages. Its polarizing effects, however, raise the stakes
   of political competition and intensify conflict over the control of key

Abstract = {The passage of marriage equality in Rhode Island offers insight into the
   role of organized groups and politicians in policymaking. Despite a
   Democratic legislature and popular support, marriage equality was
   initially defeated in 2011, in part due to concentrated opposition from
   the Catholic Church and the reluctance of Democratic officeholders to
   confront members of the same party on the issue. In the following
   primary elections, small interest groups in Rhode Island, with the help
   of national interest groups, helped raise the salience of marriage
   equality by campaigning against opponents, resulting in the release of a
   marriage equality bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee and its
   subsequent passage in a floor vote. One organized interest was
   responsible for blocking marriage equality in the legislature's most
   significant bottleneck and different organized interests were
   responsible for enabling passage. The passage of marriage equality in
   Rhode Island shows that interest groups can enable as well as obstruct
   majority opinion.},

Abstract = {The implementation of unprecedented crisis management policies in
   response to the spread of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of
   scholars interested in exploring the link between pandemic politics and
   political trust. However, while the disclosure of information about the
   pandemic constitutes an important aspect of crisis management policies,
   the effect of the level of information disclosure on political trust has
   not yet been investigated. As part of a larger nationally representative
   survey experiment on the role of transparency on political trust, we
   collected data from 618 respondents in the Republic of Ireland in May
   2020. The pre-registered study manipulated the level of the disclosure
   of government information about the status of the pandemic (high and low
   information conditions). We do not find any direct effects of
   information disclosure treatments on political trust. However, we find
   that the high information condition significantly increases political
   trust among individuals with higher levels of prior trust in government,
   while it leads to a backfiring effect among those with lower levels of
   prior trust. These findings are relevant for both public opinion and
   public policy researchers who are interested in the effect of openness
   on citizen attitudes.},

Abstract = {How might personal concerns for one's health, and public health more
   generally, affect candidate vote choice during the COVID-19 crisis? In
   this, study we leverage a national survey conducted in the United States
   during the earliest phase of the pandemic, and an original survey
   fielded in Florida as positive COVID-19 rates were rising, to assess how
   personal exposure to the coronavirus conditions candidate vote choice.
   Despite heightened partisan polarization, we find that one's health
   concerns depressed support for the sitting president, even among
   Republicans. Individuals who were very concerned about contracting
   COVID-19, who wore a mask to protect themselves from the coronavirus,
   and who were more concerned about the virus's impact on public health
   than the economy were less likely to support the reelection of Donald J.
   Trump. As with retrospective and prospective economic voting, the threat
   of the health pandemic has the potential to alter the calculus of
   candidate vote choice.},

Title = {Youthfulness and Rousseau's Anti-Pluralist Realism about Political
   Pluralism},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {3},
Pages = {607-619},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rousseau's attitude toward political pluralism is receiving renewed
   attention. Against the traditional portrayal of the utopian,
   anti-pluralist Rousseau, scholars today either explore how his theory of
   peoplehood supports an agonistic and pluralist vision of democracy or
   defend his realist willingness to accommodate the plurality of factions
   within a polity. Challenging both interpretations, I explore the
   oft-ignored relationship between legislation and what I call
   youthfulness in Rousseau's work. The youthfulness of a people is the
   subconscious and unsophisticated national bond among its members. It is
   an outcome of their spontaneous interactions rather than an artificial
   creation. Unlike other conditions of legislation, which only determine
   how legislation should be carried out, youthfulness is the essential
   precondition for successful legislation. It determines if legislation
   can be carried out and thus sets limit to the Legislator's creativity.
   This relationship between youthfulness and legislation reveals
   Rousseau's anti-pluralist realism. It not only confirms that inevitable
   political pluralism need not undermine the unity of a society, but also
   questions our capability of sustaining the peoplehood of a society whose
   members refuse to recognize one another as compatriots.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {464-483},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {The political reasons for why individuals perceive their group to be
   deprived are not well understood. This article proposes that individuals
   who perceive having linkages to political leaders are less likely to
   feel group deprivation. It is posited that such perception stems from
   politicians' efforts to attract support through either credit-claiming
   or clientelism. Results from a survey in Lebanon show that respondents
   expressing trust in political leaders as sources of information are less
   likely to feel group deprivation, while outcome-based measures are less
   reliable predictors. There is further evidence this effect stems from
   greater access to patronage, as Lebanese political parties generally use
   clientelism at the local level to attract support. The findings broadly
   suggest increasing trust in politicians may mitigate intergroup
   animosity on the part of in-group members.},

   parties and politicians},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years a common understanding of the core elements of populist
   communication has been achieved in academia. Yet, we know less about how
   the term populism is used by political parties themselves, despite
   widespread assumptions about the use of populism as a battle term to
   disqualify competitors. Based on a quantitative and qualitative content
   analysis of Twitter content from mainstream and populist actors in six
   western European countries, this study finds that populism is indeed
   used by mainstream parties in a pejorative way in order to label
   political competitors. Yet, not only populist but also mainstream
   competitors are labeled populist by the center parties linking a variety
   of different negative meanings to the term, which are often of a less
   demonizing nature not questioning the legitimacy of others. Populists in
   Italy and France refer to the term in a positive way, while Spanish and
   German populists rather reject the label.},

Abstract = {Empirical evidence points to democratic erosion as dominant pattern in
   Post-Cold War cases. The debate about democratic erosion so far remains
   fragmented due to the proliferation of labels, and the lack of
   conceptualization and a shared definition. This paper presents a concept
   of democratic erosion as a route of ``slow death{''} of democracy
   developing three definatory features: agency, opportunity and
   sequencing. Regarding the drivers of this change, the argument presented
   here is actor-centered, conceiving democratic erosion as a process
   shaped by the intentionality and systematic actions of an erosion agent.
   In view of the mechanism, the article introduces sequencing as specific
   logic of action that is able to explain the incremental dismantling.
   This logic of action is derived inductively from the Venezuelan case and
   illustrates the pattern of active and intentional change of rules
   realized in sequenced hollowing out of democratic structures, processes,
   norms, and principles. Five developed sequences serve as framework for
   the analysis of democratic erosion.},

Abstract = {The conventional view of Africa's political parties holds that they are
   organizationally weak, with little presence at the grass roots. Yet, few
   studies are based on systematically collected data about more than a
   handful of parties or countries at any given point. In this paper, we
   attempt to remedy this situation, by focusing on one crucial aspect of
   party organization - the local presence that enables political parties
   to engage with and mobilize voters during and between elections - and
   developing the first systematic, survey-based measure of the extent of
   this presence across 35 countries. We draw on a wide variety of data to
   demonstrate the validity and reliability of this new index, and in the
   process showcase its ability to be calculated at a number of different
   levels. Finally, we illustrate its utility by applying it to a key
   substantive question in the literature.},

Abstract = {Little is known about why candidates decide to make use of emotional
   messages when campaigning for a political office, and under which
   conditions this is more likely to happen. We focus on the use of fear
   and enthusiasm appeals and assume that these are a function of profile
   of candidates and the nature of the context in which the election takes
   place. We use a new large-scale comparative dataset which includes
   information about campaigning strategies for 636 candidates having
   competed in 133 presidential and parliamentary elections in 101
   countries between June 2016 and March 2020, based on judgments of 2000+
   domestic and international experts. Our results show that candidates
   benefitting from a comparative advantage (incumbents and frontrunners)
   tend to rely on enthusiasm appeals, more extreme candidates prefer fear
   to enthusiasm, and more competitive races tend to foster the use of fear
   appeals. These findings have important implications for electoral
   competition, communication theory, and political marketing. All data and
   materials are openly available for replication.},

Abstract = {Researchers on inequalities in representation debate about whether
   governments represent the preferences of the rich better than those of
   less affluent citizens. We argue that problems of high- and low-status
   citizens are treated differently already at the agenda-setting stage. If
   affluent and less affluent citizens have different priorities about
   which issues should be tackled by government, then these divergent group
   priorities explain why government favours high- over low-status
   citizens. Due to different levels of visibility, resources and social
   ties, governments pay more attention to what high-status citizens
   consider important in their legislative agenda and pay less attention to
   the issues of low-status citizens. We combined three types of data for
   our research design. First, we extracted the policy priorities (most
   important issues) for all status groups from Eurobarometer data between
   2002 and 2016 for 10 European countries and matched this information
   with data on policy outcomes from the Comparative Agendas Project. We
   then strengthen our results using a focused comparison of three single
   country studies over longer time series. We show that a priority gap
   exists and has representational consequences. Our analysis has important
   implications for the understanding of the unequal representation of
   status groups as it sheds light on an important, yet so far unexplored,
   aspect of the political process. Since the misrepresentation of
   political agendas occurs at the very beginning of the policy-making
   process, the consequences are potentially even more severe than for the
   unequal treatment of preferences.},

Abstract = {Measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic have put a sudden halt to
   street protests and other forms of citizen involvement in Europe. At the
   same time, the pandemic has increased the need for solidarity,
   motivating citizens to become involved on behalf of people at risk and
   the vulnerable more generally. This research note empirically examines
   the tension between the demobilisation and activation potential of the
   COVID-19 crisis. Drawing on original survey data from seven Western
   European countries, we examine the extent, forms, and drivers of
   citizens' engagement. Our findings show the remarkable persistence of
   pre-existing political and civic engagement patterns. Concurrently, we
   show that threat perceptions triggered by the multifaceted COVID-19
   crisis have mobilized Europeans in the early phase of the pandemic.
   Similarly, the role of extreme ideological orientations in explaining
   (regular) political engagement indicates that the current situation may
   create its specific mobilisation potentials.},

   conceptualizations upon which the theory of liberal dependency care
   rests. It then summarizes the book's chapters. The first five chapters
   (Part I) delineate its theoretical foundations, which include the
   two-level contract theory approach to distributive justice for
   caregiving arrangements. In Part II of the book, chapters six through
   nine, I formulate liberal proposals for justice-enhancing social change
   before identifying cross-cultural metrics of justice for the internal
   evaluation of caregiving arrangements.},

Abstract = {The ecological impacts of consumption are well acknowledged, and most
   people worldwide are likely to have encountered proofs for or
   information about it. Likewise, online and offline media seem to be full
   of information on the issue. Even so, large numbers of people are
   `non-political' consumers, inconsiderate of the ethical and ecological
   implications of what they buy and consume. Using representative survey
   data from Sweden collected in 2019, this paper shows that a major reason
   for non-political consumerism can be seen in the lack of interpersonal
   `recruitment' efforts; that is, deliberate attempts by some to influence
   another's consumption. Moreover, the analyses show that for a person
   having faced such attempts by others to influence their consumption is
   distinct from them discussing political consumption issues. With this,
   the paper also provides one of the first large-N studies confirming
   recent theoretical propositions of an extended definition of political
   consumerism: discussion, that is, discursive action, is a sub-form of
   political consumerism next to boycotting, buycotting, and lifestyle
   change. Interpersonal influence, in turn, is a key predictor of
   political consumerism. Altogether, the results suggest that spreading
   information may feed discursive actions. Yet, to get more people change
   their consumption choices and engage in political consumerism, what is
   needed is that people influence each other to do so.},

Abstract = {Since the mid 1990s, growing attention has been given in the scholarly
   debate and in the public sphere to forgiveness, restorative justice and
   reconciliation in peacebuilding. These concepts have been reflected upon
   and highlighted as core components of restoring right relationships and
   in sustainable peacebuilding: at first focusing mainly on individuals
   and relations between them and later as well on relations of communities
   and states in the public sphere. Attempts to better understand
   forgiveness and reconciliation in relation to peacebuilding have to
   address also the critical issue of how to safeguard and integrate
   processes of justice into peace processes. After first clarifying the
   distinction between retributive and restorative justice, this article
   considers core findings of Daniel Philpott, John Paul Lederach and
   Leonel Narvaez in their peacebuilding studies and considers selected,
   contemporary reconciliation and peace initiatives. The article argues
   that forgiveness, restorative justice and reconciliation processes
   should be further mainstreamed and integrated as part of any standard
   response to major conflicts and wars by national political bodies,
   religious communities and religious/secular NGOs, international
   organisations, agencies and institutions: in order to positively and
   sustainably resolve and transform conflicts, wars and violence between
   groups, and to build sustainable peace.},

Abstract = {Focusing on post-Cold War international interventions, this article
   traces the emergence of a malaise within the liberal universal project.
   While it is agreed that the liberal peace is in crisis, there is
   disagreement on the nature of the impasse. For mainstream IR scholars,
   there is a resistance by actors in the Global South to follow the policy
   dictates of powerful Western governments and the international
   organisations they dominate. While this is certainly the case, this
   article argues that the crisis of the liberal peace is also rooted in
   the erosion of liberal universal foundations. In addition to liberal
   norms being rejected by Southern actors, the liberal peace crisis
   reflects a deeper scepticism on the part of international policy elites
   regarding the ability of liberal market democracy to resolve a wide
   range of social, political and economic problems. In addition to being a
   crisis of legitimacy between the Global North and the Global South,
   there seems to exist an erosion of liberal universal foundations which
   is undermining the ability of international policy elites to act
   purposively in global affairs. This argument is drawn out with reference
   to post-liberal approaches to peacebuilding which foreground the radical
   potential of non-liberal forms of agency.},

Abstract = {This paper is articulated as the beginning of a conversation with
   Gourhand's essay ``On the Path to Oblivion: did the World Forget to
   Mourn?{''}. In a first methodological moment, it approaches the concept
   of delay, to be able to analyze in a second moment the conditions of
   possibility of a poetics of oblivion and truth following Gourhand's
   references to Heidegger and his concept of poetry and oblivion. In her
   essay, Gourhand exposes some ideas of Heidegger's ``poetics of
   dwelling{''} and how them are linked to an ontological consideration. In
   a third moment, it gives clues for the ethical and political
   interpretations of Heidegger's last works. This analysis concludes with
   a fundamental question for our time: what to do with those forgotten by
   progress and history?},

Abstract = {Scholars of the resource curse argue that reliance on primary
   commodities destabilizes governments: price fluctuations generate
   windfalls or periods of austerity that provoke or intensify civil
   conflict. Over 350 quantitative studies test this claim, but prominent
   results point in different directions, making it difficult to discern
   which results reliably hold across contexts. We conduct a meta-analysis
   of 46 natural experiments that use difference-in-difference designs to
   estimate the causal effect of commodity price changes on armed civil
   conflict. We show that commodity price changes, on average, do not
   change the likelihood of conflict. However, there are cross-cutting
   effects by commodity type. In line with theory, we find price increases
   for labor-intensive agricultural commodities reduce conflict, while
   increases in the price of oil, a capital-intensive commodity, provoke
   conflict. We also find that price increases for lootable artisanal
   minerals provoke conflict. Our meta-analysis consolidates existing
   evidence, but also highlights opportunities for future research.},

Abstract = {This paper exams how asocial symbolic minority-language policy
   contributes to the social processes of language shift from the
   perspective of highly threatened languages, such as Scottish Gaelic. In
   introducing the concept of language shift through Asocial
   Minority-Language Policy, we argue that symbolic minority-language
   policy is detrimental to threatened language minorities in that it is
   ideologically implicated in language shift when it neglects the societal
   circumstances of minority-language decline. The prioritisation of the
   symbolic aspect of language policy also hinders a value-for-money
   approach to official provision for the minority group. This paper calls
   for a materialist/functionalist approach to minority-language societal
   regeneration to counter the social irrelevance of symbolic policy. We
   suggest policy options for moving beyond the symbolic focus on the
   minority-language condition.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary party leaders have an electoral incentive to protect the
   informational value of their party's label by promoting unity, but
   recent research has shown that parties can also benefit electorally from
   appealing broadly through a wide distribution of candidate positions on
   political issues. This article suggests that party leaders with formal
   candidate nomination powers balance these incentives by nominating new
   candidates who are more congruent with the party when the distribution
   of issue positions among the senior candidates is wide, and, conversely,
   by nominating new candidates who are more divergent from the party when
   the senior candidate position distribution is narrow. These
   possibilities are tested with candidate survey data from six
   parliamentary democracies, and the results show that new party leader
   nominations are indeed conditional on the senior candidate distribution,
   but only on issues that are salient to the party's electoral brand.},

Abstract = {Labor unions have long been important political actors, mobilizing
   voters, shaping their members' attitudes, and influencing representation
   and economic inequality. However, little is known regarding unions'
   influence on political knowledge. In this paper, I argue that unions
   increase their members' political knowledge through two mechanisms:
   direct information provision and workplace discussion of politics. I use
   data from recent national election surveys and a matching technique,
   showing that union members, particularly those with less formal
   education, who face higher costs in seeking out political information,
   are significantly more politically knowledgeable than their non-union
   counterparts and better informed about where political parties and
   candidates stand on the issues. I conclude by discussing unions'
   capacity to reduce knowledge gaps and foster a more politically informed
   electorate.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does the EU contribute to the prevention of
   governance breakdown and violent conflict in areas of limited statehood
   and contested orders by fostering societal resilience? This study seeks
   answers to this question by examining the EU's effectiveness in
   fostering societal resilience in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey while they
   have coped with risks emerging from cross-border mobility, mass influx,
   and prolonged stays of the forcibly displaced due to the Syrian crisis
   since 2011. The study argues that the EU has been constrained in
   building societal resilience. The findings suggest that the EU's
   effectiveness is limited by context-specific social, political, and
   economic risks in host countries; divergence among policy actors' often
   contradictory preferences; and the impact of the EU's policies in
   outsourcing management of forced displacement. The study concludes that
   the EU needs to link the implementation of its short-term pragmatic
   programmes that primarily enable state resilience in crisis contexts
   with its long-term liberal vision for fostering high level societal
   resilience with democratic principles and institutions.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new and previously unchartered dataset on roll
   call votes for all 28 member states in the Council of the EU between
   2010 and 2019 and studies the effects of politicisation on governments'
   oppositional voting in the different policy areas. We contribute to the
   literature with two main findings. First, our study provides strong
   evidence for bottom-up politicisation, where Euroscepticism and the
   left-right positions of national political parties strongly affect
   governments' voting in the Council. Second, we provide new evidence for
   a form of differentiated politicisation where ideological standpoints of
   political parties in government and opposition have different effects on
   oppositional voting in the various policy areas.},

Abstract = {The protection of asylum seekers and refugees has become one of the most
   politically divisive issues in the European Union, yet there has been a
   lack of research on public preferences for asylum and refugee policies.
   This article analyzes which policies Europeans prefer and why. We
   advance a theoretical framework that explains how asylum and refugee
   policies that use limits and conditions enable individuals to resolve
   conflicting humanitarian and perceived national interest logics. Using
   an original conjoint experiment in eight countries, we demonstrate that
   Europeans prefer policies that provide refugee protection but also
   impose control through limits or conditions. In contrast to the divisive
   political debates between European Union member states, we find
   consistent public preferences across European countries.},

Abstract = {Being related to the concept of democracy, liberalism is nevertheless
   not identical with it; moreover, in its contemporary form, liberalism is
   rather opposed to democracy. It is unlikely that anyone would argue that
   neoliberalism and Reaganomics introduced by M. Thatcher and R. Reagan
   contained a democratic rather than authoritarian message, while the
   essence of Thatcherism was characterized by many analysts as
   authoritarian populism. The synthesis of authoritarianism and liberalism
   seems irrelevant due to the historical dominance of the discourse of
   political rather than economic liberalism. Throughout the twentieth
   century, liberalism developed as the main antithesis to authoritarianism
   and totalitarianism and therefore accentuated its fundamental
   disagreement with any form of collectivist ideology and
   communitarianism. During the acute ideological battles of the Cold War,
   liberalism was associated with democracy and opposed to authoritarian
   socialism. Influenced by the ideas of J. Rawls and J. Habermas,
   political liberalism was thought of as a synonym for democracy even from
   egalitarian and progressive positions in the context of actually
   existing liberal democracy. Speaking about the long-term relationship
   between economic liberalism and democracy and analyzing growing
   overregulation of political processes in the current eurocrisis, it is
   necessary to recall the concept of authoritarian liberalism, first
   proposed by H. Heller in 1932. Heller's concept of authoritarian
   liberalism emphasizes the connection between authoritarianism of ``the
   strong state{''} (C. Schmitt) and economic liberalism of market
   rationality. The paper substantiates that in critical and
   transformational periods the actualization of authoritarian liberalism
   corresponds to the fundamental tension between market capitalism and
   representative democracy.},

   measure modeled after the Squire Index as well as a measure derived from
   factor analytic decomposition. The internal validity of these measures
   is assessed in a case study of recent parliamentary reforms in
   Baden-Wurttemberg and the external validity is assessed via comparison
   to electoral turnover. We conclude with suggestions for future research
   and hope that our colleagues will both make use of these data to study
   the causes and consequences of legislative capacity in Germany and also
   be motivated to collect and disseminate similar data for new contexts.},

Abstract = {What makes corrupt investment locations still attractive to investing
   economies? This article examines whether states' tendency to ignore
   corruption in investment targets is due to their being accustomed to
   corruption at home, or is instead due to a perception that despite flaws
   institutions can be counted on to remain functional. We argue that
   economies where corruption is viewed permissively would still likely
   invest in states equally perceived as corrupt but not necessarily due to
   shared collective tolerance. Rather, a perception of institutional
   dependability motivates the selection of investment locations,
   regardless of how people in investing states view corruption. To test
   our conjecture, we analyzed bilateral foreign direct investment outflows
   for 96 countries between 2001 and 2012 using exponential random graph
   models alongside value-based typologies for corruption and institutional
   confidence. Our results suggest that, overall, it is trust in
   institutions and not necessarily trepidation about corruption that
   mediates the selection of investment locations.},

Abstract = {Italy's relationship with the rest of Europe began 2020 under a watchful
   eye. Although Giuseppe Conte's second government was more pro-European
   than his first, European institutions (and bond markets) wondered
   whether the coalition was stable enough to undertake meaningful fiscal
   consolidation and institutional reforms. When the coronavirus struck,
   the tenor of the relationship changed completely. First, Italy felt
   abandoned by the rest of Europe - and not without reason - then Conte
   battled hard to ensure the rest of Europe would show solidarity. Thanks
   to Franco-German leadership, the rest of Europe delivered an
   unprecedented agreement to provide funding to help recover from the
   pandemic and to enhance resilience. At that point, doubts about whether
   Conte's second government could deliver arose again. Divisions within
   the coalition deepened, and the year ended on a cliff hanger. This story
   has important implications for Italy, for Europe, and for how we
   understand the relationship between them.},

Abstract = {The Italian government's economic policy response to the Covid-19
   pandemic crisis has included large public programmes supporting
   households' incomes and firms' balance sheets, alongside a limited
   expansion of public health expenditures. The macroeconomic response has
   been in line with those of other European countries; Europe's new
   approach to fiscal policy has opened up new possibilities for addressing
   the crisis. However, beyond the pandemic emergency, the government's
   policy approach has lacked a longer-term perspective on economic
   reconstruction, environmental sustainability, welfare expansion and
   distributional outcomes. The fragility of Italian politics has
   contributed to this lack of vision and to a growing uncertainty over the
   country's economic future.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates a ``real-time{''} simulation where students
   role-play a United Nations Security Council negotiation over
   humanitarian intervention in Syria. This simulation is undertaken in a
   large introductory International Relations (IR) subject. The article
   argues that in order to achieve deep learning outcomes across the
   diverse, contemporary cohort of first-year university students, active
   learning approaches need to be employed that engage differing learning
   styles and preferences. Deep learning is assessed across the conceptual
   and metacognitive knowledge domains with two indicators: (1) students'
   understanding of IR concepts by applying them beyond the parameters of
   the Syria case and (2) students' critical reflection on their moral
   reasoning elicited by the task. We evaluate 820 students across six
   cohorts and 21 iterations of the simulation during 2016 and 2017 with a
   survey instrument and formal reflection assignment. The article finds
   that the simulation is highly effective at consistently engaging the
   majority of students' interest and motivation, while illustrating the
   acute and sometimes tragic tension between moral and political reasoning
   in IR. We found that disrupting student's cognitive structures regarding
   human rights and justice stimulated not only deeper conceptual
   understanding but also emotional reactions that were the catalyst for
   metacognitive reflection.},

Abstract = {The Mekong region is witnessing a regional order reconfiguration
   triggered by the China-led Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC). Little
   research is available regarding the history of this sub-regional
   grouping, particularly about its formation. Using sources from a
   recently opened archive in Bangkok, this article reappraises the origins
   and evolution of the initiative within the lens of regional group
   formation theory. Findings show that LMC is a revised version of
   Thailand's proposal for the formation of a dialogue on the management of
   the Mekong River that was initially dismissed by China. As China under
   Xi Jinping-era claimed great power status with a droll de regard over
   the near abroad, it has used the LMC to exercise exclusive leadership
   over the Mekong region. This can be seen in the preparation of
   institutional infrastructure for the construction of a China-Indochina
   Peninsula Economic Corridor (CICPEC) as part of China's wider Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI) strategy.},

Abstract = {In lights of the resurgence in South America of the Marxist version of
   dependency theory, especially of the theoretical developments by Ruy
   Mauro Marini and considering the criticisms that followed its
   reappearance, this present paper hopes to make a contribution in this
   last sense, to emphasize the limitations of Marxist Dependency Theory
   when presenting the specific determination of the political
   consciousness of the working class. Starting from what Marini says about
   the political course that led to the 1973 coup d'Etat in Chile, we will
   show how his generic conception of the working class. An ideological
   conception that emerges from the naturalization of the national
   character of the accumulation process, obliterates the place of ground
   rent as a fundamental determination of capital accumulation in South
   America, therefore limiting the potential of political action.},

Abstract = {This article shows Hannah Arendt's relationship with the Weimar Republic
   through her work. Although there are no explicit references to the
   Republic, the thesis of an implicit presence is maintained -a hidden
   relation-, which is shown in the implicit theming of relevant aspects of
   Arendt's analysis. In this sense, an analysis is offered first of all of
   the philosophical influences of the Weimar context, especially of her
   teacher Jaspers. Next, the problems that the Weimar Republic was
   dragging along are examined: the Jewish question and the decline of the
   Nation-State. Both problems lead to the lack of a solution to the rights
   of minorities. Finally, Arendt's ideas about the people's councils as a
   political system, present at the birth of the Republic, but also in
   other historical moments and in other political traditions, are
   presented. The article ends by pointing out Arendt's federalist
   approach, connected to the councils.},

Abstract = {The disruptive nature of social media has revealed within public
   administrations the need for a change towards more flexible and open
   structures. In fact, this was one of the arguments that led to agency
   processes in the Spanish public sector during the last decade.
   Therefore, one might expect that the adoption of social media in public
   agencies would have been less disruptive, with a clear orientation
   towards transparency, participation and collaboration. In that sense,
   this paper aims to study to what extent differences between public
   agencies and ministries can be identified in relation to the provision
   of public information in Twitter. For this purpose, we monitorized the
   activity of public agencies and the ministries. Our Twitter data is
   analyzed by using a user role taxonomy based on Twitter data. Results
   show a certain tendency of public agencies to be active participants in
   the dissemination of public information, and of the ministries to be
   passive objects of diffusion.},

Abstract = {This article examines the bilateral relationship between Australia and
   China, which has become problematic since 2015. The causes for the
   downturn in relations are examined and two key reasons are offered:
   Australia is caught in the middle of power contestation between the
   United States and China; and Australia's fear of its economic
   overdependence on China. This article deduces what a reset would look
   like and how this may eventuate.},

Title = {Measuring and explaining the complexity of left-right perceptions of
   political parties},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the dimensional complexity in voter perceptions of
   party left-right locations. Most of the theoretical and empirical
   research on electoral politics treats left-right party locations as
   based on a one-dimensional ideological spectrum. We measure variation in
   the complexity of voters' perceptions of left-right party locations and
   demonstrate that the dimensionality varies widely. First, we generate a
   measurement of the complexity of perceived left-right party placements
   and apply this to data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
   (CSES). This measure, based on the dimensional fits of scaled party
   placements, allows us to compare left-right complexity cross-nationally.
   We then examine several possible correlates of this cross-national
   variation, finding relationships with political polarization, party
   nationalization, and democratic experience. We conclude with a
   comparison of left-right complexity to the concept of issue
   dimensionality using data from the European Election Study (EES).},

Abstract = {Since 2011, Africa witnessed 7 different forms of popular uprisings
   leading to the overthrow of ruling heads of state. This includes the
   situations in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia in 2011, Burkina Faso in 2014,
   Zimbabwe in 2017 as well as the recent cases in Algeria and Sudan in
   2019. During these uprisings, the African Union (AU) is criticized for
   its lack of responsiveness to government crackdown, but quick action to
   condemn the military-supported revolution. Using the case of Sudan, this
   article examines the complexities of popular uprisings in Africa and
   AU's challenge in managing the situation. The paper argues that the AU
   faces the dilemma of protecting the rights of peaceful protesters in a
   sovereign state and ensuring long-term stability, including preventing
   the history of military adventurism on the continent. Yet, its role has
   often leaned disproportionately toward maintaining stability, which
   raises criticisms that it favors state regimes as opposed to its
   human-centric and democratic commitments. To enhance its credibility,
   the AU must adopt proactive roles to protect protesters against
   government crackdowns. Additionally, the AU needs to augment its
   existing African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG)
   with actionable policy guidance for protesters, governments, and
   security agencies during popular uprisings.},

Abstract = {This paper illuminates the interconnections between the Nigerian
   government's failure to satisfactorily address the ever-rising violence
   linked to herder-farmer conflicts and the emergence of vigilante
   security measures at the geo-regional level. It also examines the
   overall implications of vigilante security measures vis-a-vis security
   challenges in Nigeria. The paper finds that the predisposition to, and
   adoption of vigilante security strategies is indicative of the failure
   of formal security apparatuses to live up to their constitutional
   mandates. The paper recommends preventive and inclusive policing as well
   as strict adherence to the tenets of justice in line with the rule of
   law.},

Abstract = {Scholars have discovered remarkable inequalities in who gets represented
   in electoral democracies. Around the world, the preferences of the rich
   tend to be better represented than those of the less well-off. In this
   paper, we use the most comprehensive comparative dataset of unequal
   representation available to answer why the poor are underrepresented. By
   leveraging variation over time and across countries, we study which
   factors explain why representation is more unequal in some places than
   in others. We compile a number of covariates examined in previous
   studies and use machine learning to describe which mechanisms best
   explain the data. Globally, we find that economic conditions and good
   governance are most important in determining the extent of unequal
   representation, and we find little support for hypotheses related to
   political institutions, interest groups or political behaviour, such as
   turnout. These results provide the first broadly comparative
   explanations for unequal representation.},

Abstract = {By comparing and analysing four cross-national measures of democracy,
   this article provides novel information regarding the statistical
   properties, convergence, and interchangeability of some of the most
   frequently used measures of democracy. The author points out limitations
   related to the statistical properties of these measures and finds that
   even if measures of democracy are highly convergent, their
   interchangeability is weak. This means that the choice of the measure of
   democracy has considerable consequences for the conclusions of a given
   study. Especially so in studies covering the last few decades, because
   the author finds that in general the interchangeability of democracy
   measures has decreased since the 1980s. In choosing one measure over
   another, scholars should be aware of the limitations identified in this
   article. To overcome problems related to weak interchangeability, if a
   single measure cannot be credibly chosen on theoretical grounds, the
   author recommends users of the measures to validate their findings with
   multiple measures of democracy.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Deploying the theoretical framework of Italian Marxist thinker, Antonio
   Gramsci, this article argues that rather than a neo-colonial
   arrangement, the transfer of power from the British to locals in the
   Bechuanaland Protectorate (Botswana) could be conceptualized as a
   passive revolution. This passive revolution, which was triggered by
   demands for independence by radical nationalists, entailed the formation
   of a pro-British political party, the Botswana Democratic Party, and
   transferring power to it in a carefully managed decolonization process.
   The passive revolution aimed not just at preserving British economic
   interests in the protectorate but also at state formation for purposes
   of expanding the capitalist mode of production in the newly independent
   state. Thus, the transfer of power took place concurrently with the
   creation of a legitimate capitalist state that served the interests of
   both the British and the cattle-owning Botswana Democratic Party elite
   that assumed power at independence. Post-independence, the cattle
   bourgeois class at the apex of the Botswana Democratic Party embarked
   upon the construction of hegemony through the creation of an
   interventionist developmental state that addressed the narrow interests
   of other classes and groups constituting the post-independence
   historical bloc. Such hegemony has allowed the Botswana Democratic Party
   to retain power to the present day.},

Abstract = {Political elites tend to favor their home region when distributing
   resources. But what explains how political power is distributed across a
   country's regions to begin with? Explanations of cabinet formation focus
   on short-term strategic bargaining and some emphasize that ministries
   are allocated equitably to minimize conflict. Using new data on the
   cabinet members (1960-2010) of 16 former British and French African
   colonies, I find that some regions have been systematically much more
   represented than others. Combining novel historical and geospatial
   records, I show that this regional political inequality derives not from
   colonial-era development in general but from colonial-era education in
   particular. I argue that post-colonial ministers are partly a byproduct
   of civil service recruitment practices among European administrators
   that focused on levels of literacy. Regional political inequality is an
   understudied pathway through which colonial legacies impact distributive
   politics and unequal development in Africa today.

Abstract = {At first sight, the Brexit negotiations appear erratic. The UK and the
   EU invested two years in negotiating an agreement, which failed three
   times in the British parliament. How to explain this? This article
   argues that Brexit is a case of an overarching trend, and offers a
   rationalist, situation-structural approach to analysing politicised
   bargains. In this new European reality of a constraining dissensus,
   governments must ensure domestic support and international assertiveness
   in parallel. Politicised bargains play out as nested games, in which
   tied hands are not a strategy but rather a necessary given. Theresa May
   was forced to play such parallel and overlapping, nested games as she
   was pressurised by both the EU and Brexiteers. Negotiations unfolded in
   two phases, corresponding to two situation structures: the negotiation
   phase resembled a nested chicken game. The preliminary Withdrawal
   Agreement was a game-changer and the subsequent ratification phase,
   structured as a nested Rambo game, presented May with irreconcilable
   demands.},

Abstract = {This study investigates `Little Europe', the rural, mountainous Italian
   region of the quadrilingual Valcanale, bordering Austria and Slovenia.
   The combined analysis of cultural landscape, linguistic landscape (LL)
   and symbolic ethnicity provides a new concept to examine multilingual
   regions. In this once Austrian valley, where German was the official
   language before WWI, Italian now dominates over minority languages, as
   exemplified by official signs. However, elements of the area's cultural
   and linguistic landscape reveal unexpected linguistic practices and
   visible, locatable artefacts of the Valcanale's ethnolinguistic
   heritage, which we assume to play a key role in the preservation of
   symbolic ethnicity.},

Abstract = {Berlin and Strauss shared surprisingly compatible views about four
   matters of great importance. The first is the need for political
   philosophy, which Berlin traced to value pluralism and Strauss to the
   inherent incompleteness and contestability of our knowledge of politics,
   due to its comprehensive nature. Second, Berlin and Strauss each opposed
   social-scientific positivism: Berlin, because it contradicts human
   freedom and responsibility; Strauss, because it depends on an untenable
   and nihilistic distinction between facts and values. Third, both
   philosophers wished to place, in the ground currently occupied by
   positivist political science, the study of statecraft, embodied in such
   figures as Churchill and FDR. Finally, Berlin and Strauss agreed on what
   characterizes such statesmen: an intuitive, pretheoretical practical
   judgment of political particulars.},

Abstract = {This article examines the presence of geographically targeted spending
   in the allocation of infrastructure projects in Canada. Building on
   formal models of distributive politics, we expect government districts,
   core government districts and swing districts to be advantaged in terms
   of infrastructure projects. We also investigate whether characteristics
   of Members of Parliament (MPs), such as seniority or holding a cabinet
   position, influence the distribution of infrastructure projects.
   Empirically, we analyze the amount of funding allocated by
   Infrastructure Canada across non-urban federal electoral districts
   between 2006 and 2018. Our results indicate that non-urban governmental
   districts receive, on average, more money than opposition districts, and
   that this is even more the case for core government districts. In
   contrast, we found little evidence that cabinet ministers or senior MPs
   are able to attract more funding to their constituencies compared to
   other representatives.},

Abstract = {After a careful investigation of available archival documents of the
   Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. State Department, this
   paper questions the state sponsoring of the terrorist operations of the
   Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and the
   Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG). An investigation of
   the documents ascertains that state support for ASALA is identified by
   the CIA; however, knowledge about JCAG has remained in the dark due to
   its extreme clandestineness. In this respect, other than the support of
   local Armenian communities, this paper traces the fingerprints of the
   Soviet Union, Syria, Iran, and Libya behind the violent acts of ASALA
   despite their discreet and covert sponsoring. Furthermore, the tolerance
   shown by France and Switzerland towards the attacks of ASALA and JCAG
   gives the impression that the terrorist attacks conducted by Armenian
   terrorism attracted a certain level of sympathy among Western European
   governments, as long as their violent acts did not target non-Turkish
   victims.},

Abstract = {After Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO)'s triumph in the 2018
   presidential elections, high expectations emerged about his presidency,
   particularly in relation to the fight against poverty and the provision
   of social welfare in Mexico. In order to offer some initial results that
   would allow us evaluating his management, this research note analyzes
   the social policy of the self-defined ``Government of the Fourth
   Transformation' during its first year in office. The research note
   concludes that during 2019 the social policy in Mexico was focused on
   increasing resources to attend to marginalized spaces and vulnerable
   groups. However, those efforts may become unsuccessful in effectively
   combating poverty and overcoming the conceptual, strategic,
   institutional and operational shortcomings of the actual social policy
   in the country; whereas they may deepen its use as an instrument for
   political patronage.},

Abstract = {Democracy is under threat today and scholars agree that the main
   challenge is not sudden regime breakdown, but rather the gradual erosion
   of key institutions and norms because of growing public support to
   political forces with illiberal tendencies. In the case of Western
   Europe, the major threat comes from the populist radical right. Although
   it is true that the latter has been gaining votes in Western Europe,
   scholars have not analysed the extent to which a sizeable share of the
   electorate dislikes this party family. Nevertheless, recent studies
   reveal that it is important to consider both those who feel close to and
   those who reject political parties, i.e. positive and negative
   partisanship. To address this research gap, in this contribution we rely
   on original survey data for 10 Western European countries to examine
   negative partisanship towards the populist radical right. The empirical
   analysis reveals that a large section of the Western European electorate
   has an aversion to this party family and this finding should be seen as
   an important sign of democratic resilience. In fact, those who dislike
   the populist radical right are strong supporters of both democracy per
   se and the liberal democratic regime.},

Abstract = {The weak implementation of the House of Representatives', or Dewan
   Perwakilan Rakyat's (DPR), function indicates stagnation in Indonesia's
   democracy. This fact is due to the party oligarchy's stronghold in the
   Jokowi government, which ignores the nature of public representation
   that should be carried out. The oligarchy controls the government and
   DPR's performance in establishing political compromises for every
   legislative policy with the government to facilitate the affairs of
   party oligarchs, who are also the members of the Jokowi government
   coalition. In addition, they engage in cartel politics to secure their
   respective power and material interests. This article examines the roles
   of party oligarchs in influencing the implementation of political
   functions in the DPR. Ironically, the coalition formed by the party
   oligarchy has helped the Jokowi government and the DPR to secure
   government policies and the economic and political interests of the
   oligarchic group.},

Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Jack Walker's Mobilizing Interest Groups in America (1991) was
   groundbreaking both in terms of its theoretical and methodological
   contributions to political science and the unfortunate and challenging
   circumstances surrounding its publication. An enterprising group of
   co-authors and graduate students shared Walker's comprehensive study of
   Washington D.C. interest groups with the public to positive critical and
   scholarly reception. According to Google Scholar, as of January 2021 the
   book has been cited more than 1400 times since its original publication
   in 1991. However, the question of how current scholars use the text
   remains open. Through an analysis of recent research, this review
   demonstrates how contemporary interest group scholarship incorporates
   Mobilizing Interest Groups in America. Although Walker's work remains
   relevant across a range of subfields, most scholarly references are
   cursory or focus on methodological differences, leaving room for deeper
   engagement with Walker's theories and conclusions. His findings
   regarding the role of patrons and inside/outside lobbying strategies
   particularly merit reexamination given changes in lobbying context
   (e.g., online mobilization). This review covers authors' depth of
   engagement with Walker, the substantive focus of their citations, and
   areas for future research.},

Abstract = {What role does information concerning the beliefs of others play in the
   correction, or persistence, of misperceptions? Can social pressure
   affect whether someone will change their mind on a salient political
   issue? Building on the ``backfire effect{''} and informational context
   literatures, we theorize that informational social influence can affect
   one's willingness to accept new information. Specifically, when
   individuals receive partisan cues, their attitudes will be different
   compared to individuals without similar social influence. We test our
   theory and hypotheses using a unique experimental between-subjects
   design using a student sample (N = 839) as well as a nationally
   representative sample (N = 777). Using the salient debate over voter
   identification laws, we find some evidence for our theory. We conclude
   by considering the policy implications of our analysis and directions
   for future research.},

Abstract = {Prior research suggests that partisanship can influence how legislators
   learn from each other. However, same-party governments are also more
   likely to share similar issues, ideological preferences and constituency
   demands. Establishing a causal link between partisanship and policy
   learning is difficult. In collaboration with a non-profit organization,
   this study isolates the role of partisanship in a real policy learning
   context. As part of a campaign promoting a new policy among local
   representatives in the United States, the study randomized whether the
   initiative was endorsed by co-partisans, out-partisans or both parties.
   The results show that representatives are systematically more interested
   in the same policy when it is endorsed by co-partisans. Bipartisan
   initiatives also attract less interest than co-partisan policies, and no
   more interest than out-partisan policies, even in more competitive
   districts. Together, the results suggest that ideological considerations
   cannot fully explain partisan-based learning. The study contributes to
   scholarship on policy diffusion, legislative signaling and interest
   group access.},

Abstract = {As gatekeepers to elected office, party selectors are often held
   responsible for the political under-representation of social groups,
   including immigrant-origin citizens. This article investigates how the
   socio-demographic characteristics (immigrant background and gender) of
   heads of list affect the presence and success of immigrant-origin
   candidates. Heads of lists constitute a unique group, as they
   simultaneously act as selectors and role models for aspirants and
   voters. We rely on an original dataset based on the 2018 local elections
   in Flanders (Belgium) (N = 31,173 candidates on 1309 lists). To our
   knowledge, it is the first time such a big endeavour is undertaken. The
   results show that whereas having an immigrant-origin head of list has a
   positive effect on both the presence and success of other
   immigrant-origin candidates, having a female head of list does not. We
   find a spillover effect within one under-represented group, but not
   between under-represented groups.},

Abstract = {How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present
   evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration
   attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis
   predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees
   at the settlement level using reports from state media, an independent
   online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements
   through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee
   voting in a national referendum in 2016. The effect decreases sharply
   with distance. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the
   far-right opposition gained, while the governing right-wing party lost
   votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections. This
   suggests incumbents are punished by voters skeptical of immigration
   regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding
   of a competition among right-wing parties, as individuals in exposed
   settlements are more fearful of immigrants and support restrictive
   policies only if they identify as right-wing.},

Abstract = {Experimental researchers in political science frequently face the
   problem of inferring which of several treatment arms is most effective.
   They may also seek to estimate mean outcomes under that arm, construct
   confidence intervals, and test hypotheses. Ordinarily, multiarm trials
   conducted using static designs assign participants to each arm with
   fixed probabilities. However, a growing statistical literature suggests
   that adaptive experimental designs that dynamically allocate larger
   assignment probabilities to more promising treatments are better
   equipped to discover the best performing arm. Using simulations and
   empirical applications, we explore the conditions under which such
   designs hasten the discovery of superior treatments and improve the
   precision with which their effects are estimated. Recognizing that many
   scholars seek to assess performance relative to a control condition, we
   also develop and implement a novel adaptive algorithm that seeks to
   maximize the precision with which the largest treatment effect is
   estimated .},

Abstract = {Depression is the most common mental health disorder. It has
   consequences not only on individuals but also on social and political
   levels. We argue that depressive symptoms impair political participation
   by reducing the motivation and physical energy of sufferers. We test our
   hypotheses by conducting regression analyses of four nationally
   representative cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys that
   collectively span many democracies. Our results are threefold. First, we
   find that the severest depressive symptoms lower the probability of
   voting by 0.05-0.25 points, an effect that is exceeded only by education
   and age. Second, we show that depressive symptoms negatively affect
   political interest and internal efficacy, thereby confirming that they
   diminish political motivation. Third, we find that depressive symptoms
   most strongly affect physically demanding acts, thereby confirming that
   they reduce the physical energy required for participation. We conclude
   by urging scholars to take depressive symptoms seriously in the study of
   political behavior.},

Title = {Timing in Opposition Party Support under Minority Government},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {220-243},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Opposition parties under minority governments find themselves in a
   fundamental dilemma. They are competing with other parties, including
   the government, for electoral support while also having a common
   responsibility to make stable government work. This dilemma is
   especially pronounced for opposition parties signing support agreements
   with the government. While not formally in a coalition, they nonetheless
   publicly commit to supporting a government. They may thus be concerned
   about losing distinctiveness and have an interest in strategically
   timing cooperation with the minority government. The present paper tests
   whether this is the case using data on opposition party voting on
   committee proposals from 23 years of Swedish minority governments
   between 1991 and 2018. The findings indicate that support parties are
   less likely to support the government towards the beginning and end of
   the election cycle, that is, when public attention is intense - a
   pattern that is not observable for other opposition parties.},

Abstract = {This article argues that a state-centered theory of global justice
   exhibits an epistemic problem of perspective, and that this worry
   exhibits a gendered character. Within a liberal domestic theory of
   justice, the public/private distinction has been repeatedly shown to be
   bad for women because it creates a domain for injustice that becomes
   invisible to public policy and the law. This article argues that
   state-centered theories of global justice create an analogous space that
   is cut off from questions of global justice. The article therefore
   suggests that this way of framing questions of global justice is
   problematic, and is problematic for women in particular. Just as the
   public/private distinction in liberal domestic justice leaves cases of
   injustice outside the vision of the law, the hard distinction between
   the domestic (state) sphere and the international realm of justice
   leaves cases of injustice invisible to international law. For the
   question of global justice, the privileging of sovereignty and
   non-intervention compromises the ability of the theory to achieve its
   purported goal of universal justice.},

Abstract = {As numerous studies in the US and elsewhere document, voters often hold
   incumbents accountable for recent economic circumstances. However, our
   knowledge of the conditions that allow voters to do so remains
   incomplete. In particular, most findings about economic voting come from
   studies of modern economies (post World War II). Modern economies have a
   host of characteristics that seem to lend themselves to economic voting.
   Their governments play a large role in the economy and have the
   Keynesian toolset necessary to influence the economy. Their voters are
   educated and have access to detailed economic data from ubiquitous
   media. Are these and other modern conditions necessary for economic
   voting? Would voters still hold politicians accountable even under
   adverse conditions? Using economic measures now available back to the
   1790s, we study economic voting from the earliest days of the US
   Republic when none of these conditions were met. Voters, we find, appear
   to judge incumbent presidents on the economy all the way back to George
   Washington. Consistent with this pattern, we also find that the economy
   appears to shape presidents' decisions to run again throughout US
   history. These findings support recent comparative evidence that
   economic voting is pervasive across a variety of contexts.},

Abstract = {The twentieth-century theologian and public intellectual Reinhold
   Niebuhr frequently employed a formulation confounding to his readers,
   simultaneously appealing to the loftiest altruism as summed up in his
   identification of the ``law of love{''} and compelling attention to the
   grittiest realism as encapsulated in his recognition of a universal
   struggle for power. This sharp contrast was no careless error on
   Niebuhr's part, but rather an insistence on describing in the most
   sharply contrasting tones the paradoxical character of human nature. In
   his Christian Realist view fear and a consequent desire for power over
   others to protect oneself are inescapable components of human existence
   within history. The human need for community and refusal to be satisfied
   with anything less than devotion to the wellbeing of others unsullied by
   self-love are nevertheless also implanted in the human heart, which
   recognizes that reality extends beyond human history. Niebuhr demanded
   attention to both.},

   formal rules to address the problem of sexual misconduct in their

   have been constrained or enabled by parliamentary privilege in both

   privilege, we argue that the British House of Commons' new rules are
   better suited to address this issue relative to its Canadian
   counterpart. This outcome has differential consequences for women and

Abstract = {It is commonly believed that a norm of consensus-based election reform
   exists in New Zealand. However, this belief has yet to be tested with
   systematic study of changes to the democratic rules of the game. This
   article empirically analyzes the extent to which partisan and
   restrictive election rules have been proposed and enacted since passage
   of the Electoral Act 1956. Using a novel matrix of election lawmaking, a
   wealth of primary textual sources, and interviews with key actors, the
   data show clear evidence that election reforms are routinely partisan
   and have occasionally curtailed democratic participation. An analysis of
   election lawmaking by political party reveals that Labour is responsible
   for most partisan election reforms, whereas National has passed most
   demobilising enactments. These trends extend to proposed members' bills
   and across multiple governments. The findings highlight the need for
   scholars to take seriously the importance of a broader array of election
   reforms beyond the electoral system, including voter and registration
   administration, franchise rules, ballot initiatives, electoral
   governance, and campaign finance. It also underscores the need for
   systematic study of election reforms in a wider variety of countries.},

Abstract = {Advocacy organizations-such as political parties, political action
   committees, and interest groups-have the potential to shape public
   policy and opinion. But to realize that potential, they must mobilize
   participants, sympathy, and funding. This article explores whether
   advocacy organizations gain more support when they signal greater
   cohesion. A conjoint experiment tests the effects of member cohesion,
   along with other attributes including group size and use of violent
   tactics, on people's attraction to hypothetical organizations that were
   founded to elect candidates from their preferred political party (in
   this study, the Democratic Party). Results show that Americans who
   identify as Democrats are more likely to join, donate to, and generally
   feel positive toward cohesive organizations, but will embrace those with
   heterogeneous goals so long as members do not actively disagree with one
   another. These findings can inform the strategies of
   ``intersectional{''} advocacy organizations that assemble people of
   diverse and sometimes conflicting interests.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the institutions associated with government
   termination in parliamentary systems: no-confidence and confidence
   motions, and the early dissolution of the parliament. We consider
   constitutional texts for all European countries between 1800 and 2019
   and identify two broad trends: (1) the constitutionalisation of
   practices that have first emerged as the result of strategic
   interactions between the government and the parliament; (2) the tendency
   towards protecting both the executive and the parliament from mutual
   interference. While the first tendency has culminated with an almost
   universal constitutionalisation of the principle of parliamentarism in
   European constitutions, the second led to the protection of executives
   and the extension of effective legislative terms. We suggest that these
   constitutional developments are associated with the stabilisation of
   parliamentarism after World War II and conclude that although
   parliamentarism remains a flexible system, contemporary regimes do not
   function like their forebears did in the 19th century.},

Abstract = {The importance of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) is
   growing for the Nordic states. Despite the existence of a rotation
   principle for Nordic representation, in 2019 two Nordic states, Iceland
   and Denmark, exceptionally both had a seat in the HRC. This article
   seeks to evaluate that unique situation by taking stock of their
   respective experiences in the Council, their human rights priorities, as
   well as Nordic cooperation in general. The aim is to explore
   similarities and differences between the Nordics, and to inform
   policymakers about developments within the Council. During a time in
   which human rights are being challenged worldwide by autocratic states
   and developments such as COVID-19, it is essential to improve our
   understanding of what the Nordic countries, as principled supporters of
   human rights, can bring to the table.},

Abstract = {In the context of a stand-off between housing rights advocates and the
   South African government over the appropriate way to safeguard the right
   to health in the country's urban informal settlements during the early
   days of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article reflects on some of the
   strengths and weaknesses of the local understanding of human rights. It
   argues for a holistic understanding of interdependent rights that allows
   for a reconciliation of seemingly competing concerns, for renewed
   engagement with rights' positive and participatory dimensions, and for
   the cross-fertilisation of concepts and mechanisms associated with their
   separable jurisprudential development.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the spatial trajectory of COVID-19 infections in the
   Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) during the period defined as social
   isolation (the period of social confinement called ``red traffic
   light{''} took place in Quito from April 9 as of June 3, 2020). The main
   objective is to identify the main trends in the spread of contagion and
   correlate them with the dimensions of urban life. The research analyses
   the contagions in the functional urban area of Quito, that is, the
   consolidated urban nucleus and the conurbed rural parishes with which
   there is continuity in the provision of amanzanamiento. The research
   develops a vulnerability index based on demographic, socioeconomic and
   habitat dimensions, to correlate the most vulnerable parishes with the
   evolution of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, it is an exploratory study
   that, with empirical evidence made available by official organizations,
   shows the socio-spatial patterns of the pandemic and its correlation
   with the degrees of vulnerability in a specific place. Finally, based on
   the results obtained, a discussion is proposed for the formulation of
   policies that mitigate the social impact of COVID-19.},

Title = {The Role of Emerging Predictive IT Tools in Effective Migration
   Governance},

Abstract = {Predicting mass migration is one of the main challenges for policymakers
   and NGOs working with migrants worldwide. Recently there has been a
   considerable increase in the use of computational techniques to predict
   migration flows, and advances have allowed for application of improved
   algorithms in the field. However, given the rapid pace of technological
   development facilitating these new predictive tools and methods for
   migration, it is important to address the extent to which such
   instruments and techniques engage with and impact migration governance.
   This study provides an in-depth examination of selected existing
   predictive tools in the migration field and their impact on the
   governance of migratory flows. It focuses on a comparative qualitative
   examination of these tools' scope, as well as how these characteristics
   link to their respective underlying migration theory, research question,
   or objective. It overviews how several organisations have developed
   tools to predict short-or longer-term migration patterns, or to assess
   and estimate migration uncertainties. At the same time, it demonstrates
   how and why these instruments continue to face limitations that in turn
   affect migration management, especially as it relates to increasing EU
   institutional and stakeholder efforts to forecast or predict mixed
   migration. The main predictive migration tools in use today cover
   different scopes and uses, and as such are equally valid in shaping the
   requirements for a future, fully comprehensive predictive migration
   tool. This article provides clarity on the requirements and features for
   such a tool and draws conclusions as to the risks and opportunities any
   such tool could present for the future of EU migration governance.},

Abstract = {In democracies, majority-rule voting is an esteemed rule for collective
   decisions, but its hazards have recently become apparent after a series
   of controversial referendums and ascendant populist leaders. Here, we
   investigate people's judgments about when voting is appropriate for
   collective decisions across five countries with diverse cultures and
   political institutions (Denmark, Hungary, India, Russia, and USA).
   Participants read scenarios in which individuals with conflicting
   preferences need to make a collective decision. They judged whether the
   group should decide by voting, consensus, leadership, or chance. We
   experimentally manipulated whether the group contains a vulnerable
   minority - a smaller number of people with more at stake than the
   majority. In all five countries, participants generally preferred voting
   without a vulnerable minority, with relatively greater support for
   voting in more democratic countries. But, when the group included a
   vulnerable minority, participants in all countries reduced their support
   for voting and instead preferred consensus.},

   mechanism for public management of social risks and, consequently,
   proposes to improve it by increasing investment in human capital to
   prevent social risks. It is concluded that the orientation of the social
   protection system to countervailing measures in relation to certain
   groups of the population seeks to solve the problem of poverty by
   strengthening tax distributional processes, increasing the amount of
   social spending on total state spending, but if it fails to increase the
   effectiveness of social programmers, the main social problems will not
   be solved. It is established that the main direction of improvement of
   the public social risk management tax mechanism should be the
   minimization of the compensatory nature of the financial provision of
   the consequences of social risks and, the activation of the application
   of investment tools for the prevention of their occurrence.},

Abstract = {Religion played a prominent role in the 2020 presidential campaign.
   Donald Trump overtly courted white evangelical Protestants and
   Catholics, while Joe Biden emphasized his Catholicism far more than any
   Catholic candidate in American history. Did religion play as important a
   role in electoral behavior in 2020? If so, how and why did religion
   affect Americans' voting decisions? We take up those questions by
   analyzing the religious vote in 2020 and the reasons why particular
   religious and non-religious groups voted as they did. We find that the
   religious divisions in the 2020 electorate were quite deep, but they
   were mostly unchanged from those present in 2016. Moreover, some
   electoral differences between religious groups are based in factors such
   as racial resentment, support for limited government, and
   anti-immigration attitudes that are not typically associated with
   religion. However, a key explanation for religious voting in 2020 was an
   old standby: the abortion issue. The religion gap in American electoral
   politics represents an enduring divide. The only changes were at the
   margins-but where elections are close, margins matter.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {In recent years, public policymakers have increasingly turned to
   behavioural economics or social psychology to achieve favourable
   outcomes for citizens. Nudges appear in this context: instruments at the
   service of promoting public policies characterized by inducing the
   population to make more sustainable decisions, while maintaining freedom
   of choice at a minimum cost. But are these persuasive ways of promoting
   public policy supported? Developed from a representative survey, this
   research aims to find out the degree of receptivity of Spanish
   university students to the use of nudges as a strategy to actively
   encourage responsible social behaviour. The results confirmed their high
   level of acceptance towards such tools. Specifically, significant
   results were obtained related to the degree of receptivity to the use of
   nudges in sociodemographic variables such as sex, political affiliation
   or religious belief, or with behavior patterns associated with
   collectivism or greater trust in institutions. These data would make it
   advisable to increase the use of nudges to promote responsible social
   behaviour in the context of higher education in Spain.},

Abstract = {The Beijing Xiangshan Forum (BXF), earlier known as ``Xiangshan
   Forum{''} is emerging as an important element in China's diplomatic
   toolbox. At a time when Asian states, to varying degrees, are receptive
   to various Chinese initiatives, and Beijing considers itself better
   resourced to implement its own regional initiatives, the forum is
   expected to play a larger role in regional military diplomacy and
   security dialogue. The evolution of the Xiangshan Forum has been a
   measure of China's changing self-perception and expanding strategic role
   in the shifting regional security landscape. As a newly created security
   forum, the forum can and should coexist with existing regional
   institutions and complement other stakeholders' efforts to build an
   inclusive, robust, and resilient security architecture in the

   Washington resorts to a policy of ``containment and suppression,{''}
   competition will be the defining feature of the bilateral relationship
   for the foreseeable future and the focus of China-U.S. diplomacy should
   be on risk control, crisis stability, and getting around the Thucydides
   Trap. Even if growing strategic competition seems inescapable, there are
   plenty of shared interests and common concerns that warrant closer
   coordination between the two superpowers. The most pressing issue is how
   to restart the engine of cooperation under the Biden presidency after
   almost all the available avenues of coordination have been shut down by
   the Trump administration. Beijing and Washington may have calibrated
   their strategic objectives and developed new perceptions of each other
   as they find themselves in a new balance of power and profoundly changed
   circumstances, but some of the success stories of bilateral strategic
   collaboration over the past forty years since normalization still hold
   important lessons, and a world of growing uncertainty has rendered those
   lessons even more relevant for today's bilateral relationship.},

   Trump's aggressive tariffs on China, despite his largely rural electoral
   support base, provide a unique opportunity to analyze the relationship
   between international trade policy and domestic support. If
   trade-related considerations were ever decisive to American voters, the
   stark decrease in soy prices, a direct effect of Trump-initiated tariffs
   immediately preceding the 2018 midterm election, serves as a critical
   test for studying their effect. This article shows a robust inverse
   relationship between county-level soybean production and the change in
   Republican vote share between the 2016 and 2018 congressional elections.},

Abstract = {Populism is a key word for characterizing political conditions in East
   Central Europe. Indeed, leading politicians in all four states operate
   by using the juxtaposition of a corrupt elite and an honest people,
   while presenting themselves as the righteous representatives of the
   latter. Nevertheless, the situation in the Czech Republic differs
   significantly from that of Poland and Hungary. In the latter two
   countries, a cultural war between national conservatives and liberals
   has divided society beyond reconciliation and brought authoritarian
   populists to power. In the Czech Republic, the socio-economic lines of
   conflict continue to structure the party system and the dominant type of
   populism is that of the technocratic manager.},

Title = {Demographic Disparities Using Ranked-Choice Voting? Ranking Difficulty,
   Under-Voting, and the 2020 Democratic Primary},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-305},
Abstract = {Ranked choice voting (RCV) has become increasingly popular in recent
   years, as more jurisdictions in the US adopt the voting system for
   local, state, and federal elections. Though previous studies have found
   potential benefits of RCV, some evidence suggests ranking multiple
   candidates instead of choosing one most preferred candidate may be
   difficult, with potential demographic disparities linked to age, gender,
   or racial or ethnic identity. Further, these difficulties have been
   assumed to cause individuals to improperly fill out RCV ballots, such as
   ranking too many or not enough candidates. This study seeks to answer
   three interrelated questions: 1) Which demographic groups find it
   difficult to rank candidates in RCV elections? 2) Who is more likely to
   cast under-voted ballots (not ranking all candidates)? 3) Is there a
   relationship between finding RCV voting difficult and the likelihood of
   casting an under-voted ballot? Using unique national survey data of 2020
   Democratic primary candidate preferences, the results indicate most
   respondents find ranking candidates easy, but older, less interested,
   and more ideologically conservative individuals find it more difficult.
   In a hypothetical ranking of primary candidates, 12\% of respondents
   under-voted (did not rank all options). Despite their perceived
   increased difficulty, older individuals were less likely to under-vote
   their ballot. No other demographic groups consistently experienced
   systematic differences in ranking difficulty or under-voting across a
   series of model specifications. These findings support previous evidence
   of older voters having increased difficulty, but challenge research
   assuming difficulty leads to under-voting, and that racial and ethnic
   groups are disadvantaged by RCV.},

Pages = {8-25},
Abstract = {The article considers the urgent need to switch to a new model of
   socio-economic development, which should be based on a radically
   rethought understanding of progress in all its elements and
   manifestations. The authors show that in the post-covid world, it will
   increasingly acquire the character of ecosystem progress, not progress
   focused on ecology, but a set of processes and characteristics combined
   within every nation. The ecosystem penetrates all critical spheres of
   life of the state and the nation and generates a synergy effect. Here
   ecosystem is understood as a business ecosystem applying to states and
   societies. Its main feature is the synchronized change of all aspects of
   human life based on the continuous development, application, and
   multiplication of new technologies, leading to the exponential growth of
   all elements of society. The transition from the old type of progress to
   ecosystemic progress will take time and effort. Due to the results
   achieved in the process, it will constantly accelerate. Those countries
   which will timely harness the wave of ecosystemic progress and implement
   this approach earlier than others will benefit more and become the
   leaders of this competition. They will become models imitated by others
   and establish a new set of values for human civilization. It is vital
   that Russia becomes one of the first among these countries.},

Title = {ZOMBIE OF BIOPOWER: IS THE CONCEPT OUTDATED?},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Number = {4},
Pages = {43-62},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the discussion about what the concept of
   biopower, developed within the framework of the postmodern critical
   theory, means in the context of the modern world, both in general
   theoretical and empirical sense. According to the author's conclusion,
   although this concept remains significant for Political Science, it is
   largely outdated and could turn into a scientific zombie idea. Giorgio
   Agamben, one of the classics of Political Philosophy, who denied the
   danger of the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of the methodology of
   biopolitics, is case in point. Another evidence comes from the fact that
   researchers from different countries, including Russia, increasingly
   look for new approaches and tools of the biopolitical analysis, and try
   to saturate the concept with new ideas and data.
   This article proposes three ways how to make biopolitical research more
   relevant today. One way is to rethink the normative/moral foundations of
   biopower, to reject an implicitly negative assessment of the concept.
   Another way is to expand the historical framework, to pay greater
   attention to historical cases that allow us to trace different stages of
   the evolution of biopolitical patterns, to focus on the analysis of
   specific manifestations of biopower in concrete situations. The third
   way is to move towards the synthesis of critical biopolitics and
   evolutionary biopolitics, which draws data from the natural sciences.
   According to the author, these efforts together will make it possible to
   move from the unidirectional asymmetric link ``the political influences
   the biological{''} to a more complex scheme of mutual reflective
   influence of the political and the biological.},

Abstract = {Metaphorical language has often been used to represent, signify and
   imagine transformations in Law and in the world. Current research on the
   changing nature of Law has increasingly acknowledged the importance of
   images for the building and perfecting of conceptual language
   (DELMAS-MARTY, 2019; 2004; OST, 2002; 2007; MAKELLA, 2011). Based on
   this theoretical framework, this paper examines the implications of
   contemporary metaphors on Law. It discusses the social changes that defy
   law, with reference to two usual metaphors: the network and the cloud,
   before referring to the metaphors as representations of the
   transformations of Law itself.},

   economic policy analysis, revisits the analyses he conducted with Bruno
   Jobert on the neoliberal turn in French public policies to analyze the
   policies implemented since Emmanuel Macron came to power, and the
   apparent disruption induced by the pandemic. He also discusses Robert
   Boyer's latest proposals on the status of the ``anthropogenetic mode of
   development,{''} as well as the future of federalism in Europe.},

Abstract = {The atomic physicist, dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei
   Sakharov (1921-1989) was one of the most outstanding individuals of 20th
   century Russia. As one of the creators of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, he
   later campaigned for nuclear disarmament, peace and human rights. The
   Soviet regime defamed, criminalised and banished him to Gorki. During
   Perestroika, he became the face of the democratic movement. His
   intellectual brilliance and moral integrity were highly respected.
   Today, Sakharov has largely been suppressed from the collective memory
   in Russia. The Putin regime is fighting against the values, and the
   democratic and constitutional principles, for which Sakharov once
   unequivocally stood.},

Abstract = {Regional and Federal Studies' 30th anniversary offers an opportunity to
   take stock of the state of the discipline and of the journal. We make
   four claims. First, the multi-level nature of the political world has
   intensified in the last 30 years. Second, the approaches to studying
   this changing world have evolved through a quantitative and comparative
   turn. Regional and Federal Studies has embraced these developments
   whilst remaining faithful to its tradition of rich conceptual and
   case-study work. Third, the journal has contributed to the
   `territorialization' of mainstream political science as many fields of
   study have gradually recognized the limitations of national- or
   single-level analyses. Finally, the journal itself has diversified in
   terms of approaches, methods, geographical coverage, and gender balance
   of author profiles, although we recognize there is more to do. We view
   further comparative research on the Global South as a particularly
   important research avenue.},

Abstract = {Although recent studies show widening socio-economic divisions due to
   the COVID-19 pandemic, many such divisions were already identified as
   social cleavages. Scholars and observers tend to view the world in a
   dichotomous manner, overgeneralising their analyses along known
   cleavages. Therefore, the relevance of our work as scholars is at risk
   and we, the scholars of the contemporary world, are ???vulnerable??? to
   the temptation of ignoring the details, nuances, and complexities. The
   uneven impact of and recovery from the pandemic is not necessarily
   binary ??? for example, a refusal to follow the medical consensus (e.g.
   social distancing, vaccination) can be observed on both sides of many
   cleavages. Against such a background, this paper first characterises the
   pandemic as a medical, socio-economic, and information crisis. With the
   former two ???pillars??? resembling the known cleavages, the third
   pillar goes beyond the physical access to information and deals with the
   people???s perception of various risks. Such a behavioural angle to the
   vulnerability ??? labelled ???risk literacy??? ??? highlights the
   phenomenon of ???digital divide??? and shows a promising feature as an
   additional analytical tool. By familiarising ourselves with the
   people???s varying risk perceptions, we increase our own literacy
   against the risk of overgeneralisation.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {518-537},
Abstract = {This article examines the changing landscape of public service provision
   in the UK during austerity. Austerity is presented through the notions
   of retrenchment, decentralisation and shifts in governance. The analysis
   shows that retrenchment and decentralisation eroded the capacity of
   public institutions to protect the provision of vital public services.
   This is revealed through the reduced provision of non-statutory services
   and the reinforcement of inequalities in service provision. Shifts in
   governance have led to mixed outcomes in the quality of services. This
   article also addresses how austerity influenced many of the problems
   observed in service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vital public
   services in the UK faced the pandemic with a diminished resource base,
   heightened inequalities and significant fragmentation in service
   provision.},

Title = {Postal delivery disruptions and the fragility of voting by mail: Lessons
   from Maine},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since the onset in early 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United
   States, mail-in voting rates in states that have held elections have
   surged, presumably reflecting the fact that voting by mail is a
   relatively safe mode of ballot casting during a public health crisis.
   Matters of health notwithstanding, postal delivery disruptions can place
   mail-in ballots at risk of rejection on the grounds of lateness. With
   Maine as a case study, we show that, in the past four general elections,
   over 10\% of vote-by-mail ballots arrived at local elections offices
   either on Election Day itself or one day earlier. Moreover, of the
   vote-by-mail ballots most vulnerable to postal delivery disruptions, a
   greater share of them were cast by unaffiliated voters and Democrats
   than by Republicans. Our results highlight the fragility of voting by
   mail in light of concerns about the reliability of the United States
   Postal Service. While existing research shows that the opportunity to
   vote by mail is neutral with respect to partisanship, our results
   highlight an aspect of mail-in balloting that nonetheless has a partisan
   hue-the extent to which vote-by-mail ballots are vulnerable to mail
   delays.},

   electorate in Portugal and Spain},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {Since their transition to democracy in the 1970s, Spain and Portugal
   have been `immune' to the success of populist radical right (PRR)
   parties. This exceptional situation, however, came to an end: Chega's
   leader, Andre Ventura, was elected in the Portuguese parliament, while
   VOX has become the third most voted political party of Spain. Using new
   online survey data from the Spanish and Portuguese national elections in
   2019, we find that the Iberian PRR electorate is mostly in line with the
   characteristics of the PRR electorate in Western Europe when it comes to
   socio-demographics, political dissatisfaction, media diet, and the
   rejection of immigration and feminism. Interestingly, however, the
   support for Chega and VOX does not come from economic losers of
   globalization. Finally, both parties capitalize on country-specific
   issues -national unity in Spain and welfare in Portugal- but PRR parties
   might struggle to establish themselves within the party system of the
   two Iberian countries.},

Abstract = {International organizations (IOS) have repeatedly been challenged in
   their existence. In this essay, I review arguments about the causes of
   their decline and survival in existing research. While the majority of
   research has focused on structural pressures such as geopolitical
   crises, I argue that IOS can also be threatened by member-states
   reasserting their sovereignty, for example through budget cuts,
   non-compliance with core norms, obstruction of staff appointments and
   membership withdrawal. More systematic research is required to
   investigate when these challenges are more likely to lead to the demise
   of IOS and which factors make IOS survive these challenges.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the dynamics and strategies that stigmatized
   and marginalized groups use to overcome that status and turns to the
   Afro-American case and the Dalits to illustrate these strategies. The
   paper shows that the Character Work, that is, the work of identifying
   and responding to the identifications imposed, creates certain dilemmas
   for the groups involved in the context of ``Character Wars{''}. Those
   are a type of cultural conflict that take place between oppressors and
   oppressed and involves the identities of both. The approaching dilemma
   shows an emotional management used strategically to vindicate the status
   of the marginalized. The text concludes with a call to be concreted and
   to observe the dynamics of the groups with the intention of working on
   the construction of strategies and not the other way around, imposing
   essences on the particularities.},

Title = {Joan Tronto's Moral and Political Theory of Care},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {158-180},
Abstract = {In today's liberal democracies we face the deficit of care in various
   forms in specific areas of our social life. In the mainstream of social
   and political philosophical thinking, there are no concepts that would
   examine care as a moral, political, and social practice at the same
   time. Creating effective strategies and making changes that would be an
   adequate response to the deficit of care requires the identification and
   application of effective theoretical tools for the study, analysis, and
   understanding of this complex phenomenon. The article presents the
   current feminist ethics of care as a theory in the space of feminist
   thinking, that offers inspiring and useful conceptions in this context.
   The text focuses on the analysis of the moral and political theory of
   care, as elaborated by the American philosopher Joan Tronto (1993,
   2013), one of the leading representatives of the current feminist ethics
   of care. Author explained how Tronto's concept makes it possible to
   understand how the deficit of care conditions the crisis of care in
   their various forms, and how this deficit is linked to the deficit of
   democracy and the crisis of the trust in democratic institutions. The
   article examined how careful research of care and critical analysis of
   the power relations as a part of its context are a prerequisite for the
   democratization of care practice. It is concluded that the research
   practices enabling contextual and critical understanding of the
   particular care practice, could be a starting point for social change
   toward better care and more democratically caring society.},

Abstract = {The article presents an analysis of the different existing conceptions
   of interrogation and, at the same time, indicates Edu the ambiguity of
   approaches to the examination of witnesses Maria according to the type
   of crime, the body conducting the investigation and the tactics used.
   The study explores the effect of individual differences on the cognitive
   processes of witnesses in a simulated interrogation. The authors
   conducted a survey using the Rettaesuv Eysenck Personality Inventory
   (EPI) method. The groups of witnesses ddienta DrHumt are divided not by
   the types of temperament per se but according to the hiiloomr set of
   temperamental characteristics (introversion and extraversion;
   neuroticism) and controlling the sincerity of the interviewees during
   the test, which significantly improves the reliability of the
   conclusions (Eysenck Personality Inventory). Finally, the study
   experimentally demonstrates that the speed of the mental reactions of
   the witnesses is not uniform and varies according to their temperamental
   characteristics. This gives reason to affirm the need to adapt to
   different groups of witnesses before and during their interrogation,
   giving an account of the peculiarities of their perception and
   processing of information},

   framework in which political movements developed in Canada, engendering
   debates and controversies which continue to this day. When a new moment
   of trade politics emerged with Donald Trump's challenge to NAFTA, some
   veterans from those earlier anti-free trade battles were unable to see
   the new, white nationalist terrain upon which Trump was operating. This
   article - organized principally around the author's own engagement with
   the anti-free trade movements of the 1980s - suggests that this
   inability to see clearly the new context of anti-free trade politics was
   rooted in the incomplete and contradictory left-nationalist theory which
   underpinned most anti-free trade politics of that earlier era. The
   article suggests that while there are national questions in Canada - in
   particular those associated with Indigenous peoples and with Quebec -
   the attempt to articulate a parallel ``national question{''} in Canada
   as a whole has proven to be impossible.},

Abstract = {Despite the introduction of social restrictions designed to stem the
   spread of COVID-19, many Indonesians have continued to attend places of
   worship. This poses a major public health threat, as congregational
   prayer involves large numbers of worshippers gathering under conditions
   known to enable the spread of the virus. Using a nationally
   representative survey, we evaluated the efficacy of messages delivered
   from different authorities in encouraging Indonesians to worship at
   home. We find no consistent evidence that public health messages change
   Indonesians' attitudes toward communal prayer or their willingness to
   forgo communal prayer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly,
   however, looking at well-defined subpopulations - non-Muslims and
   supporters of the president - we find suggestive evidence that messages
   were effective in increasing the likelihood of individuals to indicate a
   willingness to forgo communal prayer in the forthcoming week. Our
   results suggest that public health officials should eschew blanket
   messaging strategies in favor of more targeted approaches.},

Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {Settler-colonialism is founded in environmental racism, and
   environmental justice is foundational to all forms of decolonialization.
   Native American groups located in the Gulf Coast Region of the United
   States are particularly vulnerable to environmental justice issues such
   as climate change and oil spills due to their geographic location and
   reliance on the coastal region for economic and social resources. This
   study used the framework of historical oppression, resilience, and
   transcendence (FHORT) to explore the historic and contemporary forms of
   environmental injustice experienced by a Native American tribe in the
   Gulf Coast region of the United States. This critical ethnography
   analyzed a series of individual, family, and focus group semi-structured
   qualitative interviews with a total of 208 participants. Following the
   critical ethnographic method, data were interpreted through
   reconstructive analysis using NVivo. Findings of this study reveal the
   continuing impact of the BP oil spill and tfifficulty accessing
   resources following the spill, complicated by the tribe's lack of
   federal recognition. Additional themes include the continuing impact of
   coastal erosion, historical and contemporary land loss, geographic
   marginalization, and concerns about a loss of tribal identity when
   tribal members are forced to relocate. Lack of federal tribal
   recognition has exacerbated all of these issues for this tribe. This
   study supports national findings that Native American groups experience
   extensive historic and contemporary environmental injustices and
   contextualizes these findings for a Native American tribe in the Gulf
   Coast region of the United States. Recognizing Native American
   sovereignty is key to addressing the environmental justice issues
   described.},

Abstract = {This article aims to investigate the potentialities and difficulties of
   the theories of desistance from crime to analyze narratives of prison
   experiences of those who inhabit or inhabited the Evangelical
   Pentecostal Religious Device (DREP, by its acronym in Spanish) in
   prisons of the province of Santa Fe (Argentina). Throughout a
   qualitative methodology based on in-depth interviews and participant
   observations with prisoners living in the so-called
   ``church-pavilions{''}, and people in charge of prison ministries
   outside the prison, we recognized the emergence of narratives based on
   multiple prosperities (sanitary, economic and penal) both inside and
   outside the prison. In these narratives, a proposal for personal
   transformation and identity changes emerges. That proposal is examined
   in the light of the theories of crime desistance, to analyze the
   subjective passages of the ``offender{''} to the ``desistent{''}.
   Therefore, the various approaches of these theories are questioned, by
   means of the dynamics and the effects that DREP assumes both in prisons
   and in post-confinement experiences. The investigation provides new
   explanatory elements to a phenomenon in full expansion throughout Latin
   America.},

Abstract = {According to the burgeoning voter mobilization field experiments
   literature, impersonal contact has little-to-no effect. A conversation
   with a computer is, by definition, an impersonal interaction. However,
   chatbots are form of communication wherein a computer imitates
   conversations by interacting using natural language. Human-to-chatbot
   interactions are often perceived as similar to human-to-human
   interactions. How ubiquitous are chatbots? Just ask Siri, Cortana,
   Bixby, or Alexa, or ask for help on any e-commerce website (these are
   each chatbots). A simple voter mobilization treatment reminding users of
   a political chatbot (Resistbot) to vote and providing information about
   polling locations and hours increased turnout by 1.8 percentage points
   in a 2019 election. The results replicate previously unpublished field
   experiments by Resistbot in 2018 that found smaller but statistically
   significant increases in turnout.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to measure the expropriating and
   destructive character that colonialism has had and still has on the
   reality of indigenous peoples, and how colonialism continues to cast its
   shadows of destruction globally in times of ecological annihilation. We
   consider the indigenous-commons as the nucleus from which to understand
   the proposal of transformation and community resistance of indigenous
   peoples; the place that gives foundation and meaning to their political
   practice of rights. We have moved towards a political critique of the
   concept of Rights of Nature, in a double sense: as a critique of what it
   is not, of its misrepresentation by the State; as an alternative
   proposal to understand the centrality that the ecology of living beings
   has in indigenous worldviews. Finally, we conclude with what we consider
   the main fractures in the protection of indigenous rights, gaps that
   ultimately rest on the need to annul and destroy the indigenous
   understanding of life (s) due to the critical potential that they imply
   for the new colonial reason.},

Title = {Chile 2020: Pandemic and Constitutional Plebiscite},
Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-290},
Abstract = {There are two milestones that marked Chilean politics during 2020: the
   COVID-19 pandemic, and the constitutional plebiscite. While the former
   was an absolutely unexpected phenomenon that forced an important turn in
   the country's political agenda, the result of latter was foreseeable yet
   surprising. In fact, the plebiscite was likely to end in a triumph of
   the option in favour of constitutional change, but the forcefulness of
   the result was surprising. In this article we look at both milestones in
   detail. On the one hand, we examine how the government in particular,
   and the political system in general, reacted to the emergence and
   development of the pandemic. On the other hand, based on a
   representative face-to-face survey of the population - which was carried
   out just after the plebiscite - we empirically show that the
   ``Reject{''} vote is largely explained by the factors used in
   comparative studies to predict support for populist radical right (PRR)
   forces, while the ``Approve{''} vote is characterized by high
   heterogeneity in ideological and sociological terms. In summary, the

   of what would be necessary for the integral protection of human rights
   defenders: effectiveness of due process of law and differentiated
   protection to women defenders. It is a bibliographical-documentary and
   jurisprudential research that begins with the conceptualization of the
   defenders and includes its action as defender, follows with presentation
   of the assassination of the leader and submission of the case to the
   Inter-American System. Finally, such standards are critically related to
   the protection visualized in this case and the urgency of being
   immediately implemented for the protection of brazilian defenders.},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {How do newly enfranchised groups achieve representation of shared
   interests? I theorize that while suffrage expansion has the potential to
   sway electoral tides in favor of the newly enfranchised, such effects
   are conditional on the strength of a social movement that seeks to
   represent the group. A social movement defines the group's shared
   interests and creates a mobilized pool of voters who can take electoral
   action to foster common goals. In testing this argument, I use evidence
   from the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in the United States. I
   employ a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the
   heterogeneity in the proportion of women across counties to estimate
   preferences of women voters and show that these preferences vary with
   the strength of the suffrage movement. These findings highlight that de
   jure inclusion of a previously disenfranchised group may not be
   sufficient to secure de facto representation of the group's shared
   interests.},

Abstract = {Research on sensitive topics uses a variety of methods to combat
   response bias on in-person surveys. Increasingly, researchers allow
   respondents to self-administer responses using electronic devices as an
   alternative to more complicated experimental approaches. Using an
   experiment embedded in a survey in the rural Philippines, we test the
   effects of several such methods on response rates and falsification. We
   asked respondents a sensitive question about reporting insurgents to the
   police alongside a nonsensitive question about school completion. We
   randomly assigned respondents to answer these questions either verbally,
   through a ``forced choice{''} experiment, or through self-enumeration.
   We find that self-enumeration significantly reduced nonresponse compared
   to direct questioning, but find little evidence of differential rates of
   falsification. Forced choice yielded highly unlikely estimates, which we
   attribute to nonstrategic falsification. These results suggest that
   self-administered surveys can be effective for measuring sensitive
   topics on surveys when response rates are a priority.},

Abstract = {Japan eventually joined the 2050 net carbon neutrality club soon after
   the Suga administration emerged. What are the primary drivers of Japan's
   decision and why this timing? This article argues that the interactions
   of domestic and international factors can explain this policy change in
   the context of global competition over energy transition and
   technological breakthroughs to mitigate climate change. Japanese Prime
   Minister Yoshihide Suga's move was almost an established policy line
   brewed during the predecessor government.},

Abstract = {Terrorism is ubiquitous. Most states around the world have experienced
   some form of terrorism. Terrorism has undermined the profile of Nigeria
   and has generated a tense and fragile political system. This paper
   underscores that the prevalence of grievance and the lack of an
   innovative economic base in Nigeria are amongst the key factors that
   stimulate terrorism in the state. In Nigeria, terrorist activities have
   become endemic. A cursory look on these activities has proven that
   social media has become a source for propagating terrorism. This has
   generated multifarious security challenges as well. This paper is aimed
   at analyzing terrorism and social media. It further proceeds to examine
   the main thrust of the paper submitting that social media is a viable
   tool for terrorists. From this standpoint, the paper explores a case
   study analysis to further explain and evaluate the symbiotic
   relationship between social media and terrorism in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Coming to terms with the communist dictatorship is one of contemporary
   history's central themes. In the Czech Republic, the thesis that the
   communist regime in Czechoslovakia was based not only on repression and
   violence, but also on the convictions and consent of various population
   segments led to a heated debate. At the centre of the controversy was
   Michal Pullmann with his book ``The End of the Experiment{''}. In
   retrospect, it can be seen that the controversy advanced contemporary
   history as an academic discipline: today, it is probing the character of
   the communist system with new questions and methods. And the general
   public is no longer so easily agitated. The image of a dictatorship that
   relied not only on tanks but on the population's consent is not a
   trivialization of oppression, but an even grimmer finding.},

   Project of a Renewal of Socialism Based on Social Freedom},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-50},
Abstract = {The article addresses Axel Honneth's project of renewing the idea of
   socialism based on the concept of social freedom. At first, it
   emphasises the historical and philosophical singularity of this project
   within the tradition of critical theory, and then the political
   potentials represented by the concept of social freedom, especially
   concerning the openness to several forms of social conflict and the
   possibility of democratising intimacy. The article argues, however, that
   Honneth's proposal to conceive a socialist society as an organic whole
   undermines rather than enhances the attempt to revitalise socialism as
   democracy. Aimed at the functions of social integration, the organistic
   conception of society seeks harmony between the different social spheres
   (personal relations, economic structures, and political public sphere),
   which entails the risk of neglecting the intrinsic link between politics
   and conflict.},

Title = {THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM IN THE CHRISTIAN AXIOLOGY OF
   REPUBLICANISM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {132-147},
Abstract = {The article examines, through an analysis of classical and modern
   political philosophy, the cultural and religious basis of the ideas
   underlying republicanism. The central question here is whether a
   republic could be considered a universal model of government, requiring
   only a well-structured constitutional law which regulates political
   process in a proper way, or it has a greater dependency on cultural
   background and values generated by religious heritage. The paper
   analyzes the essential content of the ideological and theoretical
   foundations of the republic, comparing them with the Christian religious
   and cultural tradition. At the same time, various approaches to
   understanding both the goal-setting of the republic as a whole and its
   constituent institutions are considered. The main task, in this regard,
   is to study the place and role of ideas and values in the formation of
   state institutions, tracing the influence of religious and cultural
   factors on the formation of public consensus on the configuration of the
   structure of state power; in the end, the task is to consider what the
   role of Christianity is in the formation of the modern ideological and
   theoretical foundations of republicanism, particularly in its key
   ideologeme of freedom. The author concludes that such a republic will be
   impossible without society being aware of its subjectivity, with the
   existence of common interests that may prevail over private ones and the
   need for individuals to sacrifice their own goods in the name of a
   common cause that is determined by society's holistic values. All of
   these ideas comprise themes of Christianity, possibly making it the true
   source of the modern republican model. A striking example of this is the
   central theme of republicanism: freedom, which is traditionally equal in
   classical works with ``non-slavery{''}. However, the negative concept
   (that is, the perception of freedom as ``non-slavery{''}) is too vague
   and does not give any understanding of the essence of what freedom is as
   an independent category. Without purpose, meaning, and ideological
   essence, freedom as ``non-slavery{''} is slave ownership. To overcome
   this contradiction, it is necessary to go beyond the negative concept of
   freedom and the slave/owner dichotomy. Without Christianity, the western
   form of the republican idea of human rights lacks the philosophical
   basis for the axiology of freedom. The systematic destruction of
   Christian religious cultural heritage can lead to the deprivation of the
   idea-theoretical basis of republic, which than can cause
   dysfunctionality of its key institutions.},

Abstract = {In February 2021, Brittany Higgins set in motion a wave of protest in
   Australia concerning women's experience of Parliament as a workplace.
   The way her claim of rape in a Minister's office was treated made it
   clear the Parliament of Australia was lagging behind reforms taking
   place elsewhere. In the wake of the 2017 \#MeToo movement, women have
   been emboldened to reveal their experience of Parliament as an unsafe
   workplace. The problems are widespread due to the unique structure and
   nature of parliamentary employment coupled with partisan dynamics. This
   article examines steps taken by other Parliaments, including those in
   Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, to deal with issues of
   bullying and sexual harassment and the pitfalls encountered. It ends
   with some recommendations flowing from lessons learned.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {275-285},
Abstract = {Throughout its 40-year history, the Vlaams Belang (VB, Flemish Interest)
   has established itself as an important player within the Belgian party
   system, albeit with significant electoral fluctuations. In 2019, it
   became the second largest party in Flanders. The party developed and
   maintained a mass-party organisation by investing significantly in local
   party branches and in a rigid vertically articulated structure. It
   relies heavily on social media, particularly Facebook, to communicate to
   supporters beyond the more limited group of party members. Using both
   modern and traditional tools, VB representatives aim to create
   communities of supporters bonded to the party, facilitating
   dissemination of the party's messages. Despite this investment in a
   grassroots organisation, the VB's decision-making remains highly
   centralised. Social media and local branches allow informal
   consideration of members' views, but the party has not created
   significant mechanisms for internal democracy. While it is often claimed
   that political parties have moved away from the ``mass-party{''} model,
   this article demonstrates that the VB still maintains characteristics of
   the mass party, albeit with a modern twist. New social media tools
   facilitate attempts to foster communities and disseminate party messages
   among a wider group of supporters, both formal members and more informal
   sympathisers.},

Abstract = {Objective: The article is devoted to determining the legal nature of Big
   Data technology. Some aspects of the problematic in the field of using
   Big Data technology in public tax activities are investigated. The
   theoretical and legal approaches to the regulation of Big Data
   technology in domestic and international law are analyzed. Methods: The
   authors used a combination of methods: theoretical, general scientific
   methods and empirical methods. Results: The development of the
   conceptual and terminological apparatus and the harmonization of
   domestic and international legislation is indicated as one of the
   possible directions for the formation of legislation. Conclusion and
   recommendations: Active implementation of the activities of tax
   authorities in the digital economy requires the adoption of adequate
   legal decisions. The thesis that legislation must be formed considering
   the legal and commercial nature of Big Data technology is considered.
   The use of Big Data technology must be accompanied by legal and ethical
   standards.},

Title = {INCENDIARY KITES AND BALLOONS: ANTI-COLONIAL RESISTANCE IN PALESTINE'S
   GREAT MARCH OF RETURN},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {663-680},
Abstract = {This paper examines the Palestinian use of incendiary kites and balloons
   that emerged during Gaza's Great March of Return. Kites and balloons are
   rarely thought of as unstoppable weapons in contemporary theatres of war
   and resistance. Yet, for an extended period the Israeli military was
   unable to halt these aerial explosives from burning large quantities of
   agricultural fields and natural forests surrounding the Gaza Strip. The
   article critiques the security literature that discusses this new method
   of Palestinian resistance as another instance of terrorism. Instead, by
   drawing on Palestinian and Fanonian theorisations of violence in
   anti-colonial movements, I attempt to make the kites and balloons
   legible as a form of indigenous resistance to settler colonialism that
   can be an internally mobilising tool for Palestinians. The paper argues
   that the low-tech aerial explosives were mobilised as a response to
   high-tech militarism and long-standing settler colonial processes still
   shaping dynamics on the ground. These innovative forms of resistance
   momentarily broke the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip and in burning
   trees planted to cover destroyed Palestinian villages open up questions
   surrounding the struggle over land in Israel/Palestine. The paper
   concludes by delineating how despite some immediate breakthroughs, it
   remains questionable whether these militant kites and balloons are
   long-term politically viable techniques of resistance.},

Abstract = {In the last decades scholarly literature has pointed out Francesco
   Sansovino's cultural relevance as editor, typograph, printer, translator
   in mid-Sixteenth century Venice. His multifaceted contribution has been
   interpreted as part of that complex process of vulgarization, or
   popularisation, of scientific knowledge which characterises the Venetian
   editorial market in the Giolito Age. However critics have undervalued
   the role played by Sansovino as political author and, confining his
   production to the sphere of polygraphy or polymathy, most scholars have
   ignored the extraordinary success he enjoyed in the political debate
   between the 16th and the 17th centuries. In the article the author
   focuses on Sansovino's European reception and furnishes the reader with
   some evidence about the widespread circulation of his political
   masterpieces.},

Abstract = {In notable ways, analysis of the Black Power Movement (BPM) by political
   scientists has been woefully neglected in comparison to analyses
   proffered by historians, sociologists, and Black Studies scholars. This
   comparative neglect is partly owed to political science's reticence to
   meaningfully engage the ideological locus of the BPM, black nationalism,
   through rigorous theoretical or methodological analysis. In this review,
   I highlight some of the major contributions of political scientists to
   the analysis of the BPM while exploring some of the challenges and
   opportunities for further study and examination of this singular period
   in US and international politics.},

   Semester},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {63-73},
Abstract = {This article discusses the impact that the reforms of the European
   Union's economic governance since 2011 have had on the European
   Commission's role as a policy entrepreneur. Particular attention is paid
   to mechanisms that are applied by the Commission to extend its scope
   beyond its given formal competences to shape national reform agendas.
   The research interest is based on the assumption that the Commission is
   a `competence-maximising rational actor' (Pollack, 1997), whose primary
   organisational goals are to expand the scope of Community competence and
   increase the Commission's own standing within the policy process.
   Accordingly, this research contributes to the scholarly debate by
   identifying mechanisms applied by the Commission under the European
   Semester to shape European and national reform agendas in areas of
   sovereign policymaking competences of the member states.},

   Health and Safety Regulations},

Abstract = {Mill's harm principle and the financial externalities of risky behavior
   are routinely invoked to justify health and safety regulation. However,
   this approach fares poorly when subjected to theoretical scrutiny.
   First, it is false: individuals engaging in risky behavior do not harm
   others. Second, even if risky behavior were harmful to others, the
   argument from harmful externalities does not imply safety-enhancing
   policy interventions, at least not without additional appeals to
   paternalism. Third, focusing on the economic impacts of accidents
   invites perverse victim-blaming attitudes toward accident victims that
   undermine democratic values and justice. To improve our moral
   understanding of health and safety regulation, I sketch a theory of
   public policy justification grounded in the controversies which attract
   our attention to paternalistic polices in the first place. On this
   account, justificatory arguments are plausible if they identify goods
   that individuals genuinely affirm on their own terms, are sensitive to
   causal responsibility and imbalances between restraint and protection,
   and comparatively engage with possible policy alternatives. Illustrating
   the shortcomings of one dominant approach to public policy justification
   and reorienting us toward the controversies that policy justifications
   need to confront reflect two ways that political theory can help enhance
   justice in public policy design and articulation.},

Abstract = {During the time he led the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition
   Government, David Cameron used, in a highly selective and contestable
   manner, the kind of Thatcherite language with regard to deficit
   reduction which those on the right of the Conservative Party could
   relate to, and he did so in the interests of party unity. This argument
   is framed within the context of the limits of modernisation under
   Cameron's leadership, and it emphasises the role which rhetoric can play
   in politics. The primary source is a selection of Cameron's speeches as
   Coalition Prime Minister, particularly those geared towards audiences in
   his own party.},

Abstract = {Existing research suggests that peace is more stable after military
   victories than it is after peace agreements. This article challenges
   this conventional wisdom. By applying survival analysis, we demonstrate
   that peace agreements exhibit just as strong of a relationship to
   enduring peace as military victories do. Moreover, we investigate the
   assumptions that underpin the aforementioned claim. These assumptions
   link peace survival to the type of civil war termination and refer to
   intervening variables. Using time-series data for 48 civil wars that
   ended between 1990 and 2009, the empirical analysis finds support for
   only two underpinning assumptions in favour of victories.},

Abstract = {Whilst the triggers of the peasant-pastoralist conflicts in the Sahel
   region have been explained through factors such as climate change,
   environmental scarcity, population pressures, urbanisation, political
   ecology, and the failure of traditional negotiation mechanisms, less
   scholarly attention has been given to the narratives that draw on
   history to categorise the Fulani as a potentially dangerous
   ethnoreligious group and how such narratives make peaceful coexistence
   nearly impossible. This article draws on the theoretical framework of
   ``suspect community{''} originally coined by Paddy Hillyard to
   demonstrate how the social construction of the Fulani ethnic group by
   the media and political actors in Nigeria as foreigners, uncivilised
   savages, terrorists, rapists, and armed bandits with a hidden agenda to
   Islamise non-Christian Nigerians has led to the failure of
   well-intentioned policy initiatives to minimise conflicts between
   peasants and pastoralists. The article contends that such narratives do
   not dissolve longstanding peasant-pastoralist confrontations but instead
   alienate and marginalise the Fulani through punitive security measures
   thereby preventing the possibility of peaceful politics. The article
   thus argues that peaceful coexistence requires the rejection of
   demonising discourses which, in turn, will mean the mutual acceptance of
   policies aimed at stemming the skirmishes between peasants and
   pastoralists.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that framing climate change as a national security
   issue can shape opinion about climate change. This research is less
   clear about what exactly constitutes a ``national security frame{''} and
   what aspects of this frame are most persuasive. We use a survey
   experiment to compare the relative effects of three types of national
   security frames we identify. Results show that a frame centered on
   energy dependence had the strongest effect and was the most consistent
   across partisanship. Surprisingly, the effects ran in the opposite
   direction for Democrats and Republicans on both outcomes-negative for
   Democrats and positive for Republicans. We also show that the energy
   dependence frame moderated the influence of respondents' affect toward
   political candidates and parties on their climate change attitudes. The
   results suggest that the energy dependence frame can shape public
   opinion, but that it must be tailored to particular audiences to avoid
   backfire effects.},

Abstract = {Using an interpretive-textual method, this study seeks to analyse the
   major characteristics of Abdullah Ocalan's narrative of history in terms
   of the relationship between history and nationalism. Ocalan has been the
   undisputed leader of the PKK since the founding of the organization in
   1978. As the leader who has shaped the policies of the PKK, Ocalan's
   narrative of history has functioned as a cognitive map for the
   organization. Accordingly, this study argues that Ocalan's narrative of
   history reflects a strong primordialist tendency. Furthermore, it is
   argued that history has been a significant component of Ocalan's
   political thought.},

Abstract = {The growing call for public participation in counter-terrorism in
   Britain is reflected by the number of recent campaigns directed towards
   different sectors of the population and, increasingly, towards
   ``ordinary{''} citizens. However, there has been a lack of research
   examining how counter-radicalisation campaigns seek to target the whole
   population and have an impact on everyday subjectivities and actions.
   Drawing on studies on governmentality, this article examines the
   promotion of the ``CT citizen{''} as a distinctive political agent and
   social identity embedded in the participation of mass surveillance and
   the normalisation of preemptive security logics. Based on a critical
   discourse analysis of the most recent official counter-terrorism and
   counter-radicalisation websites and e-learning materials (Let's Talk
   About It, Educate Against Hate, Action Counters Terrorism, and the
   Prevent duty), I show how citizens are being inscribed as
   counter-terrorism officials through discourses of responsibility, care,
   awareness, empowerment, and action. This article explores the role of
   British counter-terrorism in the production of new models of citizenship
   based on a generalised culture of suspicion and in the participation in
   security duties previously reserved to the authorities. The discussion
   highlights ultimately that the securitisation of everyday life and the
   inscription of individuals in ``national security{''} results in the
   depoliticisation of both the civil society and political violence.},

Abstract = {The article examines the effect of the personal characteristics of
   ministers on their party and coalition partners' pledge fulfilment.
   Partisanship and additional party-related experience is expected to help
   party pledge fulfilment. Previous field-related experience should
   additionally open up the space for alternative principals. However, in
   combination of both variables, the partisan motivation shall be the
   leading mechanism for the behaviour of the minister - and the
   field-related experience can help partisan ministers to follow party
   mandate better. The joint dataset of objectively testable pledges in the
   Czech Republic (2007-2015) supplemented by the information of government
   ministers is used for the test of hypotheses. The article shows that not
   only holding the portfolio but also the particular features of
   ministers, especially those related to the party-related experience,
   influence their ability to fulfil party promised policy.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {For more than a decade, the states bordering the Eastern Mediterranean
   Sea have been in disagreement over the delineation of their maritime
   boundaries. The disagreements concern various parts of the region and
   create enormous political tension over energy-related activities. Ever
   since Egypt and the Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus (GASC)
   signed the very first delimitation agreement of the region, without
   securing Turkey's involvement, Turkey has issued many official
   statements and carried out energy-related activities in the region.
   Based on the principle that maritime delimitation should be carried out
   to reach an equitable solution by taking all the relevant circumstances
   into account, Turkey has developed a comprehensive legal approach as to
   the maritime delimitation in the Eastern Mediterranean and even
   submitted a map to the UN to demonstrate Turkey's claimed continental
   shelf and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) areas. The details of this
   comprehensive approach should be examined, to identify both the claims
   of Turkey over the maritime borders and the related legal arguments.},

Title = {Is the EU human rights legal framework able to cope with discriminatory
   AI?},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The challenges introduced by AI for the EU anti-discrimination legal
   framework have been a widely discussed topic among the doctrine. In the
   light of the 20th anniversary of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,
   the Commission released a regulatory proposal to tackle AI. This paper
   seeks to determine whether the proposal successfully addresses the
   existent pitfalls of the EU framework. First, this paper explores the
   functioning of AI systems that employ machine learning techniques and
   determines how discrimination takes place. Second, the article examines
   intellectual property rights as one of the main barriers for
   accountability and redressal of violations committed by an AI system.
   Third, the state of the discussion concerning the pitfalls of the
   existent EU approach towards non-discrimination is addressed. The
   available academic literature suggests that discriminatory outputs
   produced by an AI will amount to indirect discrimination in most
   scenarios. In this sense, cases of indirect proxy discrimination will
   likely pass the proportionality test, therefore justifying the
   discriminatory output. The last section of this article studies the
   Commission's regulatory proposal. Although the document seems to
   effectively tackle discrimination caused by biased training data sets,
   this paper concludes that intellectual property rights and proxy
   discrimination still constitute significant barriers for the enforcement
   of anti-discrimination law.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that female legislators are more prone to
   collaborate than their male counterparts. Though collaboration may be
   more or less evident in particular situations, we seek to more clearly
   establish the mechanism behind women's collaborative activity using the
   framework of marginalization. In this paper, we use cosponsorship data
   from 74 state legislative chambers from 2011-2014 to analyze
   collaborative patterns and mobilizing institutions. We find female
   legislators are more collaborative than men, and that their
   collaborative advantage strengthens in chambers where women are
   systematically excluded from leadership positions. The advantage also
   extends to bipartisan collaboration, but only in less polarized settings
   with women's caucuses. Furthermore, our findings imply that as women are
   integrated into leadership collaboration will actually decline,
   especially within their own party. We believe these results are
   important for understanding both the roots of collaborative behavior
   among female legislators and consequences of chambers that marginalize
   women from leadership positions.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze, in the first instance, Tocqueville's
   concept of ``equality of conditions{''} by showing that this concept can
   be divided into three distinct equalities in his work: equality of
   consideration, equality of opportunity, and equality in political
   rights. By analyzing the case of American and French societies, we
   conceptualize equality of consideration as a matrix and ``imaginary{''}
   equality of modern democratic societies, which conditions the other two
   equalities. Then, we show how Tocqueville's concept of ``equality of
   conditions{''} is in fact a real ``social imaginary{''} that institutes
   and builds the democratic societies of our time.},

Abstract = {When citizens approach political decision-making tasks, they carry with
   them differing values and preferences, yielding heterogeneity in their
   assessments. This study explores one source of variation, the negativity
   bias, a response tendency in which individuals characteristically react
   more strongly to highly-salient negative information than to comparable
   positive information. In political science, most prior research on the
   negativity bias has been of two forms, either treating the bias as a
   universal, or seeking to identify correlates of individual-level
   variation. We advance a third track, one in which the individual-level
   negativity bias is viewed as a source of heterogeneity in the outcome of
   judgmental processes. If individual-level variation, labeled here as
   dispositional negativity, manifests itself in political decision-making,
   then variation in dispositional negativity may prompt otherwise similar
   citizens exposed to identical information to produce disparate
   responses. To explore this, we present a conceptual framework that
   clarifies the potential role of dispositional negativity in political
   judgment. Expectations arising from this framework are tested with data
   from vignette experiments included on two surveys: one with a national
   sample of Costa Ricans, and a second with respondents from three U.S.
   states.},

Abstract = {Soon after their formation in the 1960s, second-wave feminist interest
   groups adopted a broadly liberal agenda and sought like-minded allies
   among unions. Shared ideology was inadequate to explain the ultimately
   successful formation of their coalition. Two of the largest labor
   allies, the AFL-CIO and National Education Association, worked together
   with feminist interest groups because of their leadership's perceived
   interests of their union members, changing in a shifting political
   environment. Though committed to feminist policy success, each group
   maintained its distinctive perspective, and only in hindsight does the
   coalition appear to be the culmination of ideological consistency.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {We study the elasticity of turnout on the size of the monetary fines
   that governments impose on those who fail to vote. We leverage a
   discontinuity in the size of monetary fines in Peru, where voters in
   districts above an arbitrary cutoff in poverty rates face higher fines
   for not voting relative to voters who reside in districts below the
   cutoff. Using individual-level data on millions of voters for every
   regional and national election between 2010 and 2016, we find that
   turnout increases slightly in districts with higher fines-an effect of
   roughly one percent. This modest effect is similar across socioeconomic
   groups and elections. Our results highlight a challenge that governments
   face in designing the sanctions in compulsory voting systems: how to
   increase turnout without disproportionally hurting the poor or raising
   turnout inequality.},

Abstract = {Scholars frequently dichotomize continuous measures of democracy by
   setting a regime cut-off. However, such cut-offs often lack theoretical
   or empirical justifications, making the resulting classifications
   difficult to interpret conceptually. We investigate this challenge
   involving three major continuous democracy measures: the Freedom House
   score (FH), the Polity score, and the Regime of the World (RoW) that is
   based on the V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (EDI). We develop a
   framework to empirically derive thresholds using categorical democracy
   measures as benchmarks. Our analyses find that the cut-offs that yield
   the highest consistency with the classifications of BMR, CGV, and GWF
   are 3.5 for FH, 5 for Polity and 0.39 for EDI/RoW. These levels are
   lower than the conventional cut-offs, implying less demanding democratic
   standards. Consequently, the conventional cut-offs (2.5 for FH, 6 for
   Polity and 0.5 for EDI/RoW) endeavour to reflect more stringent
   standards of democracy than what these dichotomous measures employ.},

Abstract = {The last decade has seen mounting evidence of intimidation in British
   public life involving threatening behaviour towards and the abuse of
   public figures, especially MPs and parliamentary candidates. The
   killings of two MPs (Jo Cox and Sir David Amess) have highlighted the
   seriousness of this development for the health of British democracy. The
   article examines the problem using the Committee on Standards in Public
   Life's 2017 report, Intimidation in Public Life. It explores the
   possible causes of the decline in civility in British public life, and
   examines possible remedies for addressing the problem. It argues that
   the decline of civility and the coarsening of political life reflect a
   multifaced problem and that, in addition to new measures, such as
   providing MPs with enhanced security and strengthening protections
   against online harms, wider long-term changes to our political culture
   are necessary to promote civility and tolerance and to foster values
   that reinforce liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {Following public debates on the topic of trust in Quebec, this article
   examines the alleged social capital differential between Quebec and the
   rest of Canada. The literature has found lower levels of generalized
   trust in Quebec, but explanations offered are diverse and conjectural,
   with historical, sociological and political factors all in contention.
   We test contextual and compositional influences, including cohort
   differences, language and linguistic ability, religion, ethnicity, and
   neighbourhood-level measures of diversity, using pooled cross-sectional
   data from the Canadian General Social Survey (2003, 2008 and 2013)
   linked with precise measures of neighbourhood-level ethnic and
   linguistic diversity drawn from the Canadian census. We identify those
   Quebecers who have low levels of trust and those who more closely
   resemble their counterparts in the rest of Canada. We find that
   individual linguistic ability and linguistic heterogeneity of the
   neighbourhood are important correlates of trust and that among
   francophone populations, social distrust is found most in unilingual
   homogenous communities.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, the formation of grand coalitions has grown
   in the European Union (EU), even in countries with no previous political
   experience with them. Alongside a significant rise in both new and
   radical parties, grand coalitions signal the increasing fragmentation of
   contemporary European politics. We, therefore, investigate the electoral
   performance of both mainstream and new parties entering and leaving
   grand coalitions. We find that mainstream parties do not appear to enter
   grand coalitions after negative election results. They are, however,
   punished in the following elections, albeit not as heavily as previous
   findings have shown. This post-grand coalition electoral penalty is true
   for both major and minor grand coalition members. These findings
   contribute to the literature on party competition and provide insights
   into the choices mainstream parties' have been making in response to
   recent and rapid changes in the electoral landscape of the EU.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the military behaviour of Russia from 1992 to 2010.
   The method used is a combination of the dyad analysis introduced by
   Stuart Bremer in 1992 and the analysis of unit-level variables, which is
   distinctive of foreign policy analysis. We empirically test a set of
   hypotheses about the determinants of Russia's military behaviour in the
   post-Cold War period by considering the impact of changes of
   international variables - relative power, the presence of military
   alliance pacts, the territorial salience of the dispute - and
   state-level variables - the degree of democracy/autocracy and regime
   vulnerability. A bivariate and a multivariate analysis are carried out
   to explain the separate and joint impacts of independent variables.},

Abstract = {This article argues that settler colonialism structures Indigenous
   rights in Brazil and shows how Indigenous peoples have also engaged
   Indigenous rights to interrupt settler colonialism. To this end, it
   turns to the 20(th) century (re-)emergence of officially extinct
   Indigenous peoples in Brazil's Northeast Region and the central role of
   the tore ritual in this process. While the tore reversed the settler
   colonial logic of Indigenous elimination and dispossession, the
   Indigenous (re-)emergences also operated within the possibilities of
   settler policy. Lingering in the tense gap between citizenship's limits
   and possibilities under settler colonialism, the article argues that the
   tore, by mobilizing bodies, land, culture, and memory, underscores the
   performative aspect of citizenship and the role of embodied practices in
   decolonization. Stressing the imbrication of the performative, the
   material, and the political, the paper offers a Brazilian perspective on
   debates on Indigenous refusal and the politics of recognition,
   challenging their simplistic dichotomization.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, ASEAN has continuously increased its
   level of integration into the global economy to enhance regional
   economic prosperity and stability. Given the conceptual fluidity of
   economic security in international relations, however, ASEAN's firm
   commitment to promoting positive synergies between economic and security
   interests warrants further attention. In this vein, this article
   examines the evolving nature of ASEAN's economic security with a focus
   on regional economic initiatives, including trade agreements and the
   ASEAN Economic Community. The article suggests that ASEAN can maximize
   its potential for economic security when it increases the credibility of
   its commitment to regional economic cooperation and integration. To do
   so, ASEAN should more effectively address the issues of weak
   institutional capabilities and domestic political conflicts over
   regional economic governance. It should also proactively respond to
   unexpected challenges from external factors, such as US-China rivalry
   and the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Over the past four decades, there has been a proliferation of interest
   in the causes, consequences, and dynamics of contestation over
   collective memories across a variety of fields. Unfortunately,
   collective memories-particularly those of traumatic experiences of
   violence such as wars and revolutions-have been largely absent from
   party politics research. Using data collected in an expert survey on the
   policy positions and ideological orientations of all relevant political
   parties, as well as an extensive survey of more than ten thousand voters
   in the six post-conflict countries of Southeast Europe, we demonstrate
   that collective memories of war are not only subjects of
   historiographical contestation but are also significant sources of
   ideological and policy differentiation among political parties, as well
   as one of the strongest determinants of voter choice. Our analysis shows
   that collective memories are politically contested and that party
   politics research would benefit from taking them seriously.},

Abstract = {In the United States, people are asked to vote on a myriad of
   candidates, offices, and ballot questions. The result is lengthy ballots
   that are time intensive and complicated to fill out. In this paper, we
   utilize a new analytical technique harnessing ballot scanner data from a
   statewide midterm election to estimate the effects of ballot complexity
   on voting errors. We find that increases in ballot length, increases in
   the number of local ballot questions, and increases in the number of
   candidates listed for single offices significantly increase the odds of
   encountering ballot marking and scanning errors. Our findings indicate
   that ballots' characteristics can help election administrators make
   Election Day planning and resource allocation decisions that decrease
   ballot errors and associated wait times to vote while increasing the
   reliability of election results and voter confidence in the electoral
   process.},

Abstract = {I investigate whether wealthy democratic states should liberalize
   economic migration and, if so, on what terms. Is it permissible for the
   state to restrict economic migration as a form of labor market
   protection? If so, under what conditions? If not, why not? I argue that
   even granting that states have a right to control their borders and to
   prioritize the interests of their inhabitants, there is good reason to
   liberalize permanent low-skilled migration, so long as this is paired
   with appropriate social policies.},

Abstract = {Voter participation in elections is important for representational
   reasons but also because it helps to support the legitimacy of the
   election outcome. In a recent paper, Schelker and Schneiter (2017) show
   with data from only one Swiss canton that a small policy intervention
   (return envelopes with prepaid postage) can lead to substantially
   increased voter turnout rates. We revisit this finding and extend the
   analysis to all cantons that allow municipalities to offer free return
   postage. We find that a credible estimate of the effect is somewhat
   smaller but still positive and significant. We also document that this
   effect is not constant but stronger for larger municipalities than for
   smaller municipalities. Our interviews point to a likely mechanism.
   These results show that return envelopes with prepaid postage are an
   effective policy to increase participation, but mostly for large
   municipalities.},

Abstract = {Theories of out-group hostility have long held that attitudes about
   marginalized groups are important predictors of policy support. These
   theories, however, have mostly examined the attitudes of white people
   and sexual orientation has rarely been a category of analysis. Thus, we
   know less about whether these theories are conditional on group position
   in racial and sexual hierarchies. This paper argues that processes of
   marginalization shape out-group hostility. Using comparative relational
   analysis, I examine support for pro-minority policies among white
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people, straight people of color and
   whites. I find that ethnocentrism is not a general predictor of
   out-group hostility among the members of marginalized groups.
   Alternatively, group-targeted homophobia, racism, and nativism predict
   opposition to pro-minority policies, but the members of marginalized
   groups have more egalitarian attitudes overall. These findings challenge
   long-held conventional wisdoms about prejudice, underscoring the
   importance of centering on marginalized groups in public opinion.},

Abstract = {This article explores the underdeveloped linkages between the South
   Korean government's mass killings of ``leftist{''} opponents during the
   civil war era (1948-1953) and kinship killings. Specifically, I examine
   the significance of ``taesal{''} - the proxy killing of suspected
   leftist rebels' family members. I argue that rather than being merely
   indiscriminate acts of state terror, these killings conformed to highly
   ritualistic patterns in which the family unit - in both symbol and
   reality - was targeted for destruction as an extension of rightist
   political consolidation. An investigation of this phenomenon, I argue,
   provides us with a window into seeing the ways in which the political
   ideology was biologized in the form of gendered and exterminatory
   violence directed at kindship relations.},

Abstract = {While debates about far-right populism often concentrate on Central and
   Eastern Europe, research on these parties predominantly focuses on
   Western countries. Addressing this remarkable gap, this article revisits
   the `protest voting' explanation for electoral support for the far
   right. Using European Social Survey data (2002-16) from 22 countries, we
   show that political dissatisfaction is a stronger explanatory factor
   when far-right parties are in opposition, but is a less important
   determinant of electoral support when they are in government. Previous
   findings based on Western Europe - which similarly showed that the
   anti-elite hypothesis is less relevant when far-right parties join
   government coalitions - travel well to post-communist European
   countries. In Hungary and Poland, we even find that far-right voters
   have become less distrustful of national political institutions than the
   rest of the electorate. Our conclusion implies that anti-elite populism
   is context-dependent and has limited use for understanding successes of
   leaders such as Wilders, Salvini and Orban.},

Abstract = {Until 1945, Western countries were the only ones to have introduced
   unemployment insurance programs. Since their adoption was extremely
   controversial, almost all Western nations introduced income support for
   the unemployed only in the wake of national emergencies such as war and
   economic depression. This article examines the determinants of program
   adoption in the Global South, which commenced after the Second World
   War. With the exception of military conflict, we find that the
   introduction of unemployment insurance was shaped by factors deviating
   from the driving forces of program adoption in the Western world. More
   specifically, we provide evidence that international factors such as
   war, the activities of the ILO and policy diffusion were more important
   than domestic factors.},

Abstract = {Departing from an epistemological investigation into the limitations of
   the conjoined Althusserian problematic of concrete analysis and aleatory
   materialism, this essay aims to circumscribe the original features and
   possible present contributions of Robert Linhart's Marxism, arguing
   that, thanks to an enriched ``philosophical conception of productive
   labor{''} preoccupied with a materialist understanding of the categories
   of finitude and normativity, Linhart's texts of the late 1970s and early
   1980s offer fresh insights into the question of how subjective
   experiences, singularly aleatory cases, and properly experimental setups
   should be articulated. The essay claims that Linhart's Marxism displays
   the characteristics of an original post-Althusserian enterprise whose
   ultimate relevance lies in its interest in the adequate extension,
   operationalization, and rectification of concepts involved in Marxian
   social research.},

Abstract = {The 1963 Peter Brook version of Sir William Golding's Lord of the Flies
   is a classic film that can be an instructive metaphor for International
   Studies and Political Science students to think about the concept of
   anarchy. This article explores a variety of International Relations
   theories by juxtaposing them with six separate themes developed by the
   film. After a short film synopsis and concept definition, the paper will
   address the following themes developed within the film: the absence of
   authority, the disruption of natural harmony, hegemonic power, rules and
   institutions, self-help and the security dilemma, and group competition.
   At the end of each theme, the author provides potential discussion
   questions on the film and the concept of anarchy.},

Abstract = {Are policy arguments more or less persuasive when they are made by
   female politicians? Using a diverse sample of American respondents, we
   conduct a survey experiment which randomly varies the gender associated
   with two co-partisan candidates across four policy debates. We find
   strong effects contingent on respondent partisanship and gender, most
   notably on the issue of access to birth control. On this issue,
   regardless of the candidate's stance, Democratic respondents,
   particularly Democratic men, are much more likely to agree with the
   female candidate. Conversely, Republican respondents, particularly
   Republican women, are much more likely to agree with the male candidate.
   We discuss the implications of our findings for the meaning of gender as
   a heuristic in a highly partisan environment.},

Abstract = {Kantian statists believe that the state is a conceptual prerequisite for
   the acquisition of property rights and, hence, of freedom itself. They
   argue that under statelessness, property rights are indeterminate,
   unilateral, and unassured and therefore remain merely provisional until
   a state is instituted. We are not morally bound by merely provisional
   rights, and hence there can be no justice (or injustice) without a
   state. This article makes two arguments. First, it argues that property
   rights need not be conceptually indeterminate under statelessness.
   Social conventions that fall short of a state can give determinacy in
   ways that Kantians have not adequately considered. Second, it argues
   that the problems of unilateralism and nonassurance are parasitical on
   the problem of indeterminacy. Therefore, overcoming indeterminacy
   overcomes the overall thesis. I argue, therefore, that the state is not
   conceptually necessary to our freedom, and we have no unconditional
   natural duty to institute and obey a state.},

Abstract = {This article argues that research on the gender gap needs to take
   account of differences in the nature and salience of women's and men's
   gender identities. We theorize that the effects of sex vary depending on
   gender identity. As a result, the differences among women and especially
   among men may well exceed the differences between women and men. Drawing
   on the literature on masculinity and femininity, we argue that gender
   identity conditions the extent to which white men experience societal
   transformations as threats to their masculinity and respond by acting to
   preserve their dominant status. Because femininity is less susceptible
   to threat, gender identity will have a smaller impact on women. We
   illustrate our argument by drawing on original survey data to describe
   how support for Trump varies depending on both sex and gender identity.},

Abstract = {Considerable work assesses research productivity in political science.
   Yet, the latter work has not explicated how research careers can differ
   across time and individuals and neither has it considered such careers
   in teaching institutions. This article presents an empirically validated
   typology for research career paths for political scientists who began
   their career in a teaching institution. The typology demonstrates that
   many scholars follow paths different from the most conventional
   expectations, and research ``success{''} by measures of publications and
   citations is associated with only some of those paths. Thus, existing
   research on aggregate publications and citations likely addresses only a
   subset of the career paths described here. Understanding research
   activities in our profession requires accounting for various career
   paths, their motivations, and their place in our research community.},

Abstract = {Does benefit competition affect voters' support for immigrants' social
   rights? While scholars in political economy expect that benefit
   competition lowers support among the poor, the evidence is limited. This
   seems to be largely due to the reliance on highly aggregated analyses
   and the neglect of the institutional context in which individuals form
   their preferences. This article argues that lower-income voters are more
   likely to reduce their support due to competition when benefit
   eligibility depends on income. Using individual-level panel data from
   the Netherlands and a novel way to measure benefit competition, the
   study shows that lower-middle-income voters become less supportive of
   immigrants' social rights when more social housing in their municipality
   is allocated to refugees. By contrast, competition does not reduce
   support among the rich or the very poor. The findings suggest that
   benefit competition can erode support for immigrants' social rights and
   influence electoral politics.},

Abstract = {A growing number of analyses presume that distinctive ``partisan
   types{''} exist in the American public's eyes in foreign policy, with
   implications for questions ranging from the ability of leaders to send
   credible signals by going against their party's type to the future of
   bipartisanship in foreign policy. We offer the first systematic
   exploration of partisan types in foreign affairs, exploring their
   microfoundations and scope conditions using two national survey
   experiments. We find that partisan types vary across foreign policy
   issues, but are generally weaker and less distinct in foreign affairs
   than in domestic politics. We also find that there is an impressive
   amount of congruence between the partisan stereotypes Americans hold and
   actual distributions of partisan preferences. Our findings have
   important implications for the study of public opinion,
   ``against-type{''} models, and the domestic politics of interstate
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Migration is often perceived as a challenge to the welfare state. To
   manage this challenge, advanced welfare states have established
   transgovernmental networks. This article examines how domestic factors
   condition the interaction of representatives of advanced welfare states
   when they cooperate on transnational welfare governance. Based on new
   survey data, it compares who interacts with whom in one of the oldest
   transgovernmental networks of the European Union (EU) - the network that
   deals with EU citizens' rights to cross-border welfare. First, the
   authors perform a welfare cluster analysis of EU-28 and test whether
   institutional similarity explains these interactions. Furthermore, they
   test whether the level and kind of migration explains interaction and
   examine the explanatory value of administrative capacity. To test what
   drives interactions, the study employs social network analysis and
   exponential random graph models. It finds that cooperation in networked
   welfare governance tends to be homophilous, and that political cleavages
   between sending and receiving member states are mirrored in network
   interactions. Domestic factors are key drivers when advanced welfare
   states interact.},

Abstract = {Partisanship is a powerful driver of economic perceptions. Yet we know
   less about whether other political divisions may lead to similar
   evaluative biases. in this paper, we explore how the salient divide
   between ``Remainers{''} and ``Leavers{''} in the UK in the aftermath of
   the Brexit referendum has given rise to biased economic perceptions. In
   line with the cognitive dissonance framework, we argue that salient
   non-partisan divisions can change economic perceptions by triggering
   processes of self- and in-group justification. Using both
   nationally-representative observational and experimental survey data, we
   demonstrate that the perceptions of the economy are shaped by the Brexit
   divide and that these biases are exacerbated when respondents are
   reminded of Brexit. These findings indicate that perceptual biases are
   not always rooted in partisanship, but can be triggered by other
   political divisions.},

Abstract = {This research note contributes to the emerging debate on the
   consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for democracy, autocracy and
   regime change. Following a review of the literature on the short-term
   impact of the pandemic on citizen freedoms, I conduct a preliminary test
   showing that COVID-19 has widened the freedom divide between democracy
   and autocracy. I propose a prudential interpretation of this new finding
   and of its implications for medium- to long-term regime change dynamics.
   In an age of advancing autocratization, regaining awareness that
   democracies and autocracies treat citizens differently could help
   marginalize antisystem political forces in democratic countries.
   However, increased levels of repression in regimes that are already
   authoritarian are no good news in terms of prospective democratization.
   Moreover, the management of the social and economic consequences of the
   pandemic is likely to represent a key driver of future regime change,
   duo to its impact on the legitimacy and stability of both democracies
   and autocracies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the interactions of interest groups and political
   institutions in three post-communist countries, at present EU-acceding
   states. Based on representative surveys of interest groups, it shows
   that interactions of interest groups with political institutions are
   more frequent than usually assumed. Nevertheless, they significantly
   vary across political institutions and types of groups. The direction of
   lobbying is somewhat different than in established democracies because
   of the predominance of the executive and weak legislative institutions.
   Group type differences demonstrate strong business dominance which might
   be even greater than in established democracies. Ordinal regression
   analyses confirm these results. However, the findings suggest that
   provision of political and technical information also accounts for
   interest groups' access, which sheds light on the important functions
   that these organizations perform even in unconsolidated democracies.},

Abstract = {Do elected officials update their policy positions in response to expert
   evidence? A large literature in political behavior demonstrates a range
   of biases that individuals may manifest in evaluating information.
   However, elected officials may be motivated to accurately incorporate
   information when it could affect the welfare of their constituents. I
   investigate these competing predictions through a national survey of
   local and state policy makers in which I present respondents with
   established expert findings concerning three subnational policy debates,
   debates that vary as to whether Republicans or Democrats are more likely
   to see the findings as confirmatory or challenging. Using both
   cross-subject and within-subject designs, I find policy makers update
   their beliefs and preferences in the direction of the evidence
   irrespective of the valence of the information. These findings have
   implications for the application of mass political behavior theories to
   politicians as well as the prospects for evidence-based policy making.},

Abstract = {On 1 November 1947, Harekrushna Mahtab, premier of Orissa,
   British/independent India's youngest province, wrote a letter to Prime
   Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This was in reply to the first of Nehru's
   famous letters to the provincial chiefs. In it, Nehru had expressed his
   wish to read similarly from them and Mahtab responded in kind. For the
   next 2 years, Mahtab wrote to Nehru, before leaving Orissa to become a
   union minister. These letters, present among the Mahtab Papers (NMML,
   New Delhi), provide an often-downplayed vantage of the province, to view
   the concerns of the nation contained in Nehru's letters. Where the
   latter were meant `to educate and exhort', the former comprised a return
   catalogue of official information, societal caution, and the Congress
   Party's particularities.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-136},

Abstract = {A growing concern among municipal officials across the United States is
   that their policymaking capacity is under attack by state legislatures
   who are increasingly likely to preempt those municipalities. However,
   determining the extent to which municipalities are preempted is
   challenging. We overcome this by surveying a large sample of municipal
   officials from across the United States. We find that officials from
   municipalities that are more ideologically distant from their state
   overall are more likely to report being preempted by their state
   government. Moreover, this pattern is driven by more liberal
   municipalities in both Republican and Democratic states reporting higher
   rates of preemption. Additionally, municipalities under unified state
   governments are more likely to report preemption, especially those under
   unified Republican control. These findings have important implications
   for the quality of representation in our federalist system and indicate
   that preemption is not just an issue between Republican states and
   liberal urban cities.},

Abstract = {Political parties in Western democracies with large immigrant
   populations have become increasingly interested in nominating
   immigrant-origin candidates. This paper investigates how contextual
   factors explain parties' effort of immigrant representation. I argue
   that nominations of immigrant-origin candidates are shaped by parties'
   strategic calculations weighing out potential vote gains among
   immigrant-origin voters compared to a potential native backlash. I
   contend that alien enfranchisement and liberal naturalization policies
   provide decisive incentives to nominate immigrant-origin candidates. In
   contrast, economic insecurity implies potential material threat
   perceptions generating a native backlash against immigrants, reducing
   the nomination of immigrant-origin candidates. Using a novel dataset on
   candidates in Switzerland, the analysis reveals that the political and
   economic contexts indeed determine the number of immigrant-origin
   candidates and their ballot position, particularly those of non-Western
   origin. These findings have significant implications for our
   understanding of strategic behaviors of political parties and the
   promotion of immigrant representation.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the effect of candidate visits in presidential
   elections has found that appearances by candidates appear to mobilize
   both supporters and opponents. Specifically, in the 2016 presidential
   election, donations to campaigns of the visiting presidential candidates
   increased, but-in the case of Republican nominee Donald Trump-so did
   donations to his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In this paper, we extend
   this research by assessing the effect of visits on campaign donations by
   presidential and vice presidential candidates in the 2020 election. We
   find evidence that visits by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris had strong
   mobilizing and counter-mobilizing effects, increasing donations to both
   campaigns. We find weak evidence that visits by Joe Biden increased
   contributions to his campaign, but we do not find evidence that his
   visits had a counter-mobilizing effect, and we find no evidence that
   visits by Mike Pence affected donations in either direction.},

   epistemology and methodology of the subject, but also an ontological
   element, for observation. With respect to historical political science,
   contemporary Chinese politics is considered to be the natural genetic
   extension of the Chinese civilization as well as a continuous and
   unified development process spanning over a period of 70 years ever
   since the People's Republic of China was founded. Historical political
   science, deemed to be a tailored research approach for the development
   of contemporary Chinese politics, essentially adds further value and

Abstract = {This essay has two purposes-first, to identify Adam Smith as intervening
   in the debate between Montesquieu and Hume regarding the nature, age,
   and robustness of English liberty. Whereas Montesquieu took English
   liberty to be old and fragile, Hume took it to be new and robust. Smith
   disagreed with both: it was older than Hume supposed, but not fragile in
   the way Montesquieu claimed. The reason for this was the importance of
   the common law in England's legal history. Seeing this enables the
   essay's second purpose: achieving a more thorough and nuanced
   understanding of Smith's account of liberty. This requires us to go
   beyond repeating Smith's famous claim that modern liberty was the result
   of the feudal barons trading away their wealth and power for inane
   status goods. As I demonstrate, this is only one part of a much wider
   story: of liberty requiring, and also being constituted by, the rise of
   the regular administration of justice, and ultimately the rule of law.
   Although Smith's history of the English courts and common law has been
   almost entirely neglected by scholars, it is indispensable to
   understanding both his reply to Montesquieu and Hume and his wider
   political theory of modern freedom.},

Abstract = {A recent thought-provoking attempt to make critique more realistic and
   at once to make realism more critical is so-called critical realism. Its
   aspiration is to combine realism and critique for the former to provide
   the latter with novel intellectual resources. The present article casts
   a few doubts on how this objective is being pursued. By examining Carl
   Schmitt's peculiar kind of institutional realism, the article argues
   that it jibes with critical realism, at least in the way critical
   realism is advocated by Dimitri D'Andrea. This is not meant to debase
   critical realism as a fruitful theoretical project, but to contribute to
   it by bringing to light some of the issues it must unravel before it
   gets off the ground.},

Title = {Behavioural Thatcherism and Nostalgia: tracing the everyday consequences
   of holding Thatcherite values},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {272-294},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the passing of time and the benefit of hindsight, there is, again,
   growing interest in Thatcherism-above all in its substantive and
   enduring legacy. But, to date at least, and largely due to data
   limitations, little of that work has focussed on tracing the behavioural
   consequences, at the individual level, of holding Thatcherite values.
   That oversight we seek both to identify more clearly and begin to
   address. Deploying new survey data, we use multiple linear regression
   and structural equation modelling to unpack the relationship between
   `attitudinal' and `behavioural' Thatcherism. In the process, we reveal
   the considerably greater behavioural consequences of holding
   neo-liberal, as distinct from neo-conservative, values whilst
   identifying the key mediating role played by social, political and
   economic nostalgia. We find that neo-liberal values are positively
   associated with behavioural Thatcherism, whilst neo-conservative values
   are negatively associated with behavioural Thatcherism. In exploring the
   implications, we also reveal some intriguing interaction effects between
   economic nostalgia and neo-conservative values in the centre-left vote
   for Brexit. In the conclusion, we reflect on the implications of these
   findings for our understanding of the legacy of Thatcherism and, indeed,
   for Brexit itself.},

Abstract = {This is a reconstruction of John H. Schaar's first introductory lecture
   for his course on American political thought taught often at University
   of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Santa Cruz.
   Schaar argues that America had two foundings: the communitarian
   experiment of the New England Puritans and that of the American
   Revolution and Constitution of 1789, which were rooted in liberal
   political theory. While the first founding has been forgotten, even
   reviled, the second founding led to corruption, violence, individualism,
   and privatism. Schaar calls for the restoration of participatory
   community while recognizing the formidable obstacles to accomplishing
   that.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the problem of wilful non-compliance with EU law
   and the threat it poses of (partial) disorderly disintegration within
   the EU's legal order. Taking the example of migration and asylum policy
   following on from the 2015 migration crisis, I posit differentiated
   integration (DI), which occurs through processes that are formally
   mediated and collective, and non-compliance, which is unmediated and
   unilateral, as alternative strategies for member states which are
   unwilling to accept further integrative steps. While DI does carry
   costs, including the risk of legal fragmentation, I argue that it is a
   valuable tool for pre-empting wilful non-compliance - a phenomenon which
   both exposes and compounds the normative limits of EU law and is,
   consequently, more corrosive of the EU's legal order. Thus, the article
   suggests that the EU ought to be more open to DI, especially when
   legislating in policy areas that are highly politicised.},

Abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has questioned the dominant international
   security strategies, and also highlighted the immense contradictions in
   our global way of life. From a human security perspective, this
   investigation analyses the pandemic as a risk and threat to social life
   on a global scale. The conceptual categories of human security and
   global risk are used to understand the inequalities, structural violence
   and vulnerabilities that accompany the health emergency and make it a
   total social crisis. Some of the main risk trends that the pandemic
   represents are quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. It is proposed
   that the global pandemic is leading to the suppression of the loopholes
   of security and certainty provided by modernity, whose contradictions
   have led us to suffer the most important planetary catastrophe in recent
   history. Likewise, the pandemic has shown that the strategies anchored
   to traditional security are not the most appropriate to face the
   consequences that the current health crisis will have. Therefore, to
   respond to these risks and threats, it is essential to develop new
   perspectives on security.},

Abstract = {In this article we examine every tweet congresspersons sent from the
   time the media broke the news of President Trump's fateful July 2019
   phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky up to a week after House
   Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. Our aim is to
   understand the type of rhetoric Members of Congress (MCs) engaged in
   with respect to what we call the Ukraine Whistleblower Scandal (UWS). It
   is evident from our analysis that Democrats were more likely to sound
   off on the UWS, which comports with the fact that it was a Republican
   President who got into trouble. Further, there are characteristics of
   MCs that make them more likely to frame and discuss the UWS in certain
   ways, like House Representatives holding law degrees or serving on one
   of the House committees investigating the UWS. Finally, in this age of
   hyper-polarized parties, party affiliation was consistently the most
   important factor shaping representatives' Twitter statements on the UWS.
   In historical perspective, the overriding importance of party
   affiliation is lamentable since the charges against President Trump were
   solemn and serious.},

Abstract = {Al-Shabaab employs diverse strategies to recruit and radicalize youth to
   the network. The Social Movement Theory is used to assess recruitment
   models for terrorist networks such as the Al-Shabaab. Five models are
   explored to understand the evolving recruitment trends for the
   Al-Shabaab network from 2007 to 2019: the net, funnel, infiltrator,
   intimidation, and for-profit motives. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork
   of selected 47 cases of individuals associated with the Al-Shabaab, the
   study recognizes the role of kinship networks, social relationships
   between the recruiter and the recruited, group dynamics, and recruitment
   spaces as crucial in Al-Shabaab recruitment. The study offers insights
   into the evolving recruitment strategies of terrorist organizations
   navigating counter-terrorism responses in the aftermath of terror
   attacks at the Westgate Mall and the Garissa University attacks in
   Kenya.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-464},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Deliberative systems theorists have not explained what a deliberative
   system is. There are two problems here for deliberative systems theory:
   an empirical problem of boundaries (how to delineate the content of a
   deliberative system) and a normative problem of evaluation (how to
   evaluate the deliberation within a deliberative system). We argue that
   an adequate response to these problems requires a clear ontology. The
   existing literature suggests two coherent but mutually exclusive
   ontologies. A functionalist ontology postulates self-sustaining
   deliberative systems with their own functional goals and logics
   independent of human intentionality. In contrast, an interpretive
   ontology conceives of deliberative systems as the products of the
   beliefs and actions of the actors in the relevant practices-deliberative
   systems derive from human intentionality. We conclude by showing how
   these conflicting ontologies lead to different empirical and normative
   agendas.},

Abstract = {The vice presidency is often viewed as constitutionally devoid of any
   importance or power. Most research on the vice presidency argues that it
   is only as the vice presidency moved into the executive branch and
   became more tied to the president that the office gained significance.
   Yet this significance has come at the cost of the vice presidency's
   agency. Vice presidents are more powerful now, but also more subordinate
   to the president. By drawing out the theory underlying the structure,
   duties, and powers of the vice presidency, I demonstrate that the
   Constitution positions the vice president to be an independent
   institutional actor with the capacity for autonomous action apart from
   the president and Congress. Furthermore, the vice president's potential
   for acting with agency remains salient despite subsequent constitutional
   amendments and changes in political practices. Indeed, I argue that the
   development of the modern vice presidency has created tensions at odds
   with the office's underlying constitutional structure and authority.

Abstract = {This article investigates whether public preferences for European
   solidarity are associated with vote choices in the 2019 European
   elections. After multiple crises, the politicisation of European Union
   affairs has increased, polarising voters and parties between those
   favouring the redistribution of risks across member states and those
   prioritising national responsibility in coping with the consequences of
   the crises. We expect pro-solidarity voters to be more prone to vote for
   green and radical-left parties and less prone to vote for conservative
   and radical-right parties. Testing these hypotheses in 10 European Union
   countries with original survey data, we find that green and radical-left
   parties profited from European solidarity voting only in some countries,
   while being pro-solidarity reduced the likelihood of voting for both
   moderate and radical-right parties in each sample country.},

Abstract = {When do political parties propose long-term investments? Electoral
   competitiveness should be a key variable explaining parties' investment
   priorities: parties can be less responsive to voters' short-term
   priorities and overcome time inconsistencies when they are more likely
   to win the next election. The article distinguishes the characteristics
   of three types of investments in education, environmental protection and
   technology and infrastructure, gathered from the Comparative Manifesto
   Project. It finds a linear positive relationship between parties'
   probability of entering office and the proportion of manifestoes
   allocated to statements about technology and infrastructure. In
   contrast, statements about education are highest at high levels of
   electoral competitiveness, as parties propose more education to attract
   voters, while statements about the environment are affected by parties'
   ideology on the left-right axis rather than by electoral
   competitiveness. Power-sharing institutions help parties to overcome
   time inconsistency problems, reducing the impact of electoral
   competition on investments.},

   Evidence from the Media Strategy of the Hungarian Jobbik Party},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {As they become more successful, populist radical right parties face a
   tension between keeping their nativist credentials and moderating their
   appeal to gain new voters. We argue that differentiating party messages
   to core supporters and the wider electorate allows parties to pursue
   both goals. We outline and empirically illustrate the previously
   underexplored phenomenon of selective messaging based on the
   communication strategy of the Hungarian Jobbik party throughout its
   lifespan (2006-19) in partisan outlets, press releases and Facebook.
   Using a dictionary approach, we map the co-evolution of populist and
   nativist mobilization under conditions of supply- and demand-side
   changes. Our results show the decline and transformation of Jobbik's
   nativist appeal, and an increasing reliance on populism. The trend is
   not uniform; Jobbik relies on nativism as a function of targeting party
   identifiers or the general electorate in specific media outlets. Our
   findings show the importance of mapping parties' programmatic appeal
   across platforms and over time.},

Abstract = {New forms of work intermediation - the gig economy - and the growing use
   of advanced digital technologies - the new knowledge economy - are
   changing the nature of work. The digitalization of work, however, is
   shaped by how countries respond to it. But how countries respond to
   digitalization, we argue, depends on how digitalization is perceived in
   the first place. Using text-as-data methods on a novel corpus of
   translated newspaper and policy documents from eight European countries
   as well as qualitative evidence from interviews and secondary sources,
   we show that there are clear country effects in how digitalization is
   framed and fought over. Drawing on discursive-institutionalist and
   coalitional approaches, we argue that institutional differences explain
   these discursive differences by structuring interpretative struggles in
   favor of the social coalitions that support them. Actors, however, can
   also challenge these institutions by using the discursive agency to
   change these underlying support coalitions.},

Abstract = {This article approaches ``good citizenship(s){''} in its historical
   connection with the status of ``worker.{''} It scrutinizes how and to
   what extent the perception of the ``good citizen{''} changed from the
   Great Depression to the foundations of the post-war welfare state. It
   compares unemployment policies in the United Kingdom and Italy from the
   1930s to the early 1950s, to grasp how these schemes reflected the
   shifting features of ``good citizenship(s).{''} The article emphasizes
   policy legacies that reshaped citizenship and the attached social rights
   after 1945. These continuities rest in the link between the full
   participation to the political community and ``work{''} as a
   distinguishing trait of the ``good citizen{''} deserving social
   benefits. Apparently diluted by the post-war ``Marshallian
   consensus,{''} these deep-seated understandings resurfaced with
   contemporary workfare systems. The connection between ``good
   citizenship{''} and ``work{''} lends itself to further transdisciplinary
   studies on the theoretical and political foundations of today's welfare
   systems.},

Title = {To take or not to take: is the freebie culture in Tamil Nadu elections a
   threat to Indian democracy?},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-237},
Abstract = {The fulcrum of democracy is the electoral process. If the integrity of
   the electoral process is compromised then the very notion of
   representation becomes vacuous. In states such as Tamil Nadu in Southern
   India, distribution of money and promise of freebies has reached
   alarming levels with elections being countermanded several times. In
   this scenario, the danger to the system of parliamentary democracy and
   the Indian republic cannot be gainsaid. Therefore, this article analyses
   whether the people of India, especially in states like Tamil Nadu, are
   really concerned about governance or do they cynically participate in
   the evisceration of democratic electoral and political process, which is
   the moot point. The answer is complex and nuanced. People are concerned
   about governance but vote strategically due to systemic malaise. Despite

Abstract = {Traditional political systems (TPS) are an important part of the
   political landscape in Africa. They govern subnational communities and
   differ from nation states, both in their institutional set-up as well as
   in their legitimacy. Yet, we have little comparative knowledge on these
   political systems and, in particular, whether they can be described as
   democratic. In this article, we analyse the democraticness of TPS based
   on a new expert survey. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we
   show that the more than 140 ethnic groups we analyse vary meaningfully
   in their democraticness. Measures of public preference input and of
   political process control contribute particularly to a latent measure of
   democraticness. Furthermore, we find some indication for regionally
   interdependent institutions, with slightly more democratic systems in
   Southern Africa and less democratic systems in West Africa. Yet, no such
   interdependence exists between the state and the group level. Finally,
   we find that more hierarchically organized political systems, kings, and
   chiefs, as well as those organized in segments, are on average less
   democratic, while the presence of elders is associated with higher
   levels of democraticness.},

Abstract = {Politicians frequently use political speech to foster hostility toward
   immigrants, a strategy that shapes political preferences and behavior
   and feeds the success of the populist right. Whether political speech
   can be used to foster tolerance of immigrants, however, remains
   unexplored. We identify three mechanisms by which political speech could
   increase tolerance: (1) stressing in-group conceptions that highlight
   commonalities with immigrants; (2) emphasizing inclusiveness as an
   in-group norm; and (3) providing information that counters
   anti-immigrant stereotypes. Using quotes from US politicians in two
   survey experiments, we find that pro-immigrant speech that stresses
   inclusive norms or counters negative stereotypes about immigrants leads
   to more tolerant attitudes (but not behavior) toward immigrants. These
   effects are small and detectable only in large samples.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political ills at the mass behavior level (e.g., outgroup
   aggression, conspiracy theories) are often attributed to increasing
   polarization and partisan tribalism. We theorize that many such problems
   are less the product of left-right orientations than an orthogonal
   ``anti-establishment{''} dimension of opinion dominated by conspiracy,
   populist, and Manichean orientations. Using two national surveys from
   2019 and 2020, we find that this dimension of opinion is correlated with
   several antisocial psychological traits, the acceptance of political
   violence, and time spent on extremist social media platforms. It is also
   related to support for populist candidates, such as Trump and Sanders,
   and beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories. While many
   inherently view politics as a conflict between left and right, others
   see it as a battle between ``the people{''} and a corrupt establishment.
   Our findings demonstrate an urgent need to expand the traditional
   conceptualization of mass opinion beyond familiar left-right identities
   and affective orientations.},

Abstract = {Andrew Gamble's The Conservative Nation, published in 1974, is
   interesting when read in the light of more recent events. Though the
   pre-Thatcher Conservative Party is often depicted as `unideological',
   Gamble reminds us that it was often a centre of intense intellectual
   ferment before 1975. Four men-Harold Macmillan, Rab Butler, Iain Macleod
   and Enoch Powell were particularly important to debates in the party. Of
   all these, Powell, seemed to cast the longest shadow in 1974, but he
   never had the influence that some hoped, or feared, that he would. The
   reasons why he failed illustrate his own idiosyncrasies, but also the
   difficulties of what Gamble labelled `the politics of support'. Seen in
   the light of Gamble's early work, Thatcherism can be seen as something
   that built on existing strata of conservatism and the changes brought by
   Thatcher were, in many ways, less dramatic than those that have
   transformed the party since 2016.},

Abstract = {Right-wing populists across Western democracies have markedly increased
   references to Christianity in recent years. While there is much debate
   about how and why they have done so, less attention has been paid to how
   Christian communities react to this development. The present study
   addresses this gap through a comparative analysis of Christian responses
   to right-wing populist politics in Germany, France and the US. It relies
   on quantitative studies, survey data and the qualitative analysis of 39
   in-depth interviews with right-wing populist leaders, mainstream party
   politicians and church officials. The findings of this analysis suggest
   a potential `religious vaccination effect' among Christian voters
   against right-wing populism but underline its connection to elite actor
   behaviour. Specifically, the availability of a `Christian alternative'
   in the party system, as well as religious leaders' willingness and
   ability to create a social taboo around the populist right seem
   critically to impact religious immunity to populism.},

Abstract = {Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, state leaders
   including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping have all
   made important statements on the fundamental economic system of
   socialism. Reviewing and analyzing the history of the formulations in
   important Chinese documents on the fundamental economic system, this
   paper highlights China's exploration of theoretical innovation as
   promoted by innovation in practice. The paper contends that in dealing
   with the relationships between planning and market and between
   government and market, and while defending the fundamental role played
   by the market in resource allocation, we should consistently stress the
   superiority of socialism and point to the active roles of the party and
   government, while emphasizing the attribute of ``socialist.{''} In
   discussing how to combine the socialist economic system with the market
   economy, the paper stresses the superiority of socialism as a
   fundamental system, and contends that public ownership must be retained
   as the mainstay of the economy, so that the general character of the
   market economy can be transformed and endowed with a socialist
   character. The paper also discusses how the market economy should be
   combined with the fundamental economic system of socialism from the
   perspective of political economy.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article explains variation in local aggregate support for the
   populist radical right in Portugal, a country long considered immune to
   the rise of this political force. Using local electoral results of the
   2021 presidential election, I find positive statistical associations
   between the radical right vote share and the share of social assistance
   benefit recipients, as well as with the size of the local Roma minority.
   I also show that the effect of the percentage of social assistance
   recipients is conditioned on a higher size of the local Roma minority.
   In contrast, factors such as unemployment, average income levels or the
   share of immigrants and their change over time do not explain variation
   in radical right vote shares. The research points to the presence of
   outgroups that can be construed as `outsiders' as a relevant factor
   explaining aggregate support for the radical right in contexts where the
   salience of immigration is low.},

Abstract = {Open regionalism is a dominant feature within the regional integration
   mechanism known as the Pacific Alliance. Its members seek to strengthen
   the economic ties between them and obtain favorable outcomes vis-a-vis
   the Asia Pacific region. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the
   private sector's significance within the Pacific Alliance, while
   highlighting the role each one has played in the other's success. To
   this end, the authors undertook an extensive literature review and
   conducted numerous interviews with representatives of the Colombian
   private sector to gather their estimations regarding the Pacific
   Alliance, its various stages of conception and implementation, and its
   real significance for the private sectors within and among members.
   Additionally, the focus was directed to the specific case of the sura
   Group, an international firm based in Colombia, to illustrate the
   objectives and benefits accruing to the private sector (and the sura
   Group itself) via this integration initiative.},

Abstract = {Bringing externals in the critical business processes and having them
   assume some or all of the responsibilities associated with the critical
   business functions comes with information security risks whose impact,
   if materialized, could be disastrous for business and therefore warrants
   a meticulous and holistic approach for managing those risks. Compounded
   with the engagement of externals in the development process, risks
   facing a development project require robust risk management by the
   outsourcing organization. The organization should be able influence the
   security behavior of those externals and induce them to comply with
   certain secure development principles and practices. Delving deep into
   those risks brought about by suppliers, this study aims at offering a
   methodology in addressing the risks associated with commissioning some
   or all components of a would-be-developed product to externals and shows
   how those risks can be mitigated by controlling the security behavior of
   suppliers through well-tailored contractual provisions.},

Abstract = {In July 2020, Russian voters gave strong support to a package of
   constitutional reforms that reconfigured the Russian political system
   and enshrined social guarantees and conservative identity values,
   consolidating the regime that has been built over a 20-year period. This
   was achieved through an alteration that `zeroed' presidential terms that
   commenced before the constitutional change, potentially allowing
   President Vladimir Putin to overcome term limits and continue in office
   beyond 2024. The article explains how such a far-reaching and important
   change was successfully endorsed by the Russian electorate. The analysis
   shows that the main explanation rests with variations in voting patterns
   across the regions, a pattern that has been evident in previous Russian
   elections and resulted in strong pro-Putin support. The article also
   evaluates questions raised about the legitimacy of the result, and its
   long-term significance for the Russian political system.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the possible benefits of complex system
   governance (CSG) as a foundation for enhancing cybersecurity in critical
   cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS are intrinsically linked to cyberspace
   and vulnerable to a wide range of risks stemming from physical and cyber
   threats. There remains a lack of robust frameworks for addressing the
   issue of cybersecurity for CPS at the metasystem level. In response, the
   authors suggest CSG as an organizing construct capable of providing a
   greater degree of cohesion and as a means to provide for design,
   execution, and evolution of `metasystemic' functions necessary to
   provide for communication, control, and coordination, and integration is
   critical to the cybersecurity of CPS. In this article, CSG is introduced
   as a potential construct for enhancing cybersecurity in CPS. A
   hypothetical case study application is then provided to illustrate the
   potential for this research. Finally, the authors offer conclusions and
   suggest future research.},

Abstract = {By replying to Kurt Weyland's (2020) comparative study of populism, we
   revisit optimistic perspectives on the health of American democracy in
   light of existing evidence. Relying on a set-theoretical approach,
   Weyland concludes that populists succeed in subverting democracy only
   when institutional weakness and conjunctural misfortune are observed
   jointly in a polity, thereby conferring on the United States immunity to
   democratic reversal. We challenge this conclusion on two grounds. First,
   we argue that the focus on institutional dynamics neglects the impact of
   the structural conditions in which institutions are embedded, such as
   inequality, racial cleavages, and changing political attitudes among the
   public. Second, we claim that endogeneity, coding errors, and the
   (mis)use of Boolean algebra raise questions about the accuracy of the
   analysis and its conclusions. Although we are skeptical of crisp-set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis as an adequate modeling choice, we
   replicate the original analysis and find that the paths toward
   democratic backsliding and continuity are both potentially compatible
   with the United States.},

Abstract = {The article examines the characteristics of the functioning of
   information security in the e-government system, a phenomenon that is
   only possible based on the development of the information security
   infrastructure. The authors analyze information security as a key
   element of the concept of e-government, as well as various
   interpretations and ways of explaining the concept of information
   security. The research team's approach to the definition of the concept
   of information security is formed from the deep understanding of this
   concept, in terms of general theoretical analysis. Topics, objects,
   functions, types, principles, forms, levels of provision and structural
   elements of information security are studied. It is concluded that the
   organization of modern computer security of the State is undoubtedly a
   complex, systemic and multilevel phenomenon, whose state, dynamics, and
   perspectives are directly influenced by many external and internal
   factors, the most important being the political situation. In the world
   the presence of possible external and internal threats; state and level
   of development of information and communication of the country and

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to show the way in which the educational
   policies implemented in Higher Secondary Education (EMS) in Mexico, led
   to the omission of the Federal High Schools for Cooperation (PREFECO for
   its acronym in Spanish) as a public subsystem. This omission had
   repercussions in the closure of schools and exacerbated the precarious
   working conditions of the teachers who work in that school subsystem.
   The paper analyzes the policies directed at the EMS during the 2008-2019
   period in order to identify the causes that originated the main changes
   in the subsystem. The case of the PREFECO's of the state of Morelos is
   contextualized and the labor conditions of their teachers. For the
   analysis of the official documents, some guidelines of the
   historical-descriptive method were retaken. To contextualize the
   conditions of the teachers, a questionnaire was applied and descriptive
   statistics were used for the analysis.},

Abstract = {Recent research argues that European integration has led to an
   ideological convergence of member state party systems, which is
   purported to have significant consequences for democratic
   representation. We argue that convergence of party positions is less
   problematic if congruence between governed and governing is maintained.
   We therefore turn to test whether integration has had an effect on
   congruence between the public and their governing elites. Using five
   measures of integration, two sources of public opinion data, and expert
   surveys on political parties, we find little evidence that integration
   into the European Union reduces congruence between the public and the
   national party system, government or legislature either ideologically or
   across five issue areas. These results should assuage concerns about
   integration's effect on domestic political representation.},

Abstract = {Isaiah Berlin makes two brief references to John Milton in the essay he
   strategically titled ``John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life.{''} The
   references establish a contrast between Milton and Mill by associating
   Milton with moral monism and Mill with its opposite, value pluralism.
   Yet a careful reading of Milton's Areopagitica, cited dismissively in
   the essay, reveals the inadequacy of Berlin's intellectual-historical
   account of the two concepts, which he presents as fully distinct and
   diametrically opposed. Although still heuristically valuable, Berlin's
   account warrants historiographic revision and refinement, as his
   treatments of both Milton and Mill make apparent.},

   Large-Scale Online Perspective-Taking Experiment},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {43},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Online perspective-taking experiments have demonstrated great potential
   in reducing prejudice towards disadvantaged groups such as refugees or
   Roma. These experiments trigger the psychological process of empathy and
   evoke feelings of compassion. Meanwhile, a growing literature argues
   that compassion towards the poor is an important predictor of support
   for social welfare. This paper bridges these two literatures and
   predicts that perspective-taking with the poor could increase support
   for welfare assistance. This hypothesis is tested in a pre-registered
   experiment conducted on a large and diverse online sample of US citizens
   (N = 3,431). Our results suggest that participants engaged with the
   perspective-taking exercise, wrote essays expressing strong emotions,
   but perspective-taking had no meaningful causal effect on general
   attitudes towards social welfare. We can confidently rule out effects
   exceeding 2 points on a 100-point scale. These results indicate that
   perspective-taking with a poor, deserving individual does not
   necessarily reduce stereotypes about the poor in general; nor does it
   change views towards redistributive policies.},

Abstract = {There is adequate research demonstrating that source cues (such as
   prominent politicians or interest groups) can move public support for
   some policies, however, most of the research on source cues in the
   United States tests the impact of national leaders or parties as cues.
   We argue that hypotheses about source cues should be tested in other
   settings, such as local politics. Local settings offer a test where
   source cues may not be so closely tied to partisan identity. We
   hypothesize that in contexts where the source is well-known, and the
   policy is relatively obscure, source cues can polarize public opinion
   substantially. However, on highly salient policies the impact of source
   cues may be much weaker. We report the results of three survey
   experiments testing the polarizing impact of a mayor as a source cue on
   city voters. We find strong source cue effects in each test. The often
   racially divisive nature and machine-versus-reform type polarization of
   urban politics provides a fertile context for testing the polarizing
   impact of source cues.},

Abstract = {The appointment of committee chairs to monitor the actions of ministers
   belonging to coalition partners has received considerably less attention
   than other mechanisms of policing the coalition agreement at executive
   or legislative level. We take a longitudinal perspective focusing on 11
   Belgian cabinets (1980-2018) to study the determinants of such
   appointments and whether there is a substitution effect between shadow
   chairs, junior ministers and coalition agreements. Our findings indicate
   that the probability of appointing a shadow committee chair is higher
   when the ideological distance between the minister's party and the
   coalition is larger. Other key findings are that ministers facing
   hostile junior ministers tend to be shadowed by committee chairs as
   well, while shadow chairs are also more frequent in minimum winning
   coalitions.},

   commemoration and state-sponsored nationalism in New Zealand. In the
   national museum's Gallipoli exhibition, commemoration shifts from its
   traditional emphasis upon military sacrifice for the nation.
   Film-related special effects technology promotes individual affective
   identification with suffering and loss, but also extolls the ingenious
   achievements and talents of both New Zealand soldiers historically, and
   Gallipoli's producers. National identity is aligned with state promotion
   of creative and technological innovation as central to economic growth.
   The national myth-making of Gallipoli locates a technologically
   sophisticated modern New Zealand in the historical experience of the
   War.},

Abstract = {The argument that democratic authority is superior to other forms of
   authority on the basis of its respect for the personal autonomy of
   citizens faces a fatal problem that I term the problem of negligible
   influence. No individual citizen can expect to exert any meaningful
   influence over political outcomes in a mass democracy. How can
   democracy, therefore, be said to respect autonomy where this autonomy is
   conceived of in terms of the ability to govern one's own life? This
   paper draws on free will compatibilism to overcome this problem. The
   problem of negligible influence is outlined, and it is shown how
   existing approaches within the literature fail to adequately respond to
   it. I then develop a view - democratic compatibilism - that responds to
   the problem in two stages. First, I show that personal autonomy does not
   in fact require that individual citizens have any causal control over
   political decision-making and, second, I show that the conditions which
   personal autonomy does require are more likely to be fulfilled under
   democratic authority than under alternative forms of political
   authority.},

Abstract = {Reactions to the divisive person and presidency of Donald Trump
   dominated voting decisions in the 2020 elections, which consequently set
   new records for electoral continuity, party loyalty, nationalization,
   polarization, and presidential influence on the down-ballot vote
   choices, to the point where local factors such as incumbency, candidate
   quality, and campaign spending barely registered in the congressional
   election results. Evaluations of Trump's leadership in the national
   crises besetting the United States in 2020 were assimilated almost
   entirely into existing attitudes toward the president, limiting the
   impact of these events. The Democrats achieved unified control of the
   government, but by the narrowest of margins, and the political
   configuration that had emerged from Trump's election in 2016 remained
   largely intact. Republicans' responses to Trump's seditious efforts to
   nullify Biden's victory promise to extend his influence through the 2022
   elections and beyond.},

   national samples, we show that perceptions of the religious group
   composition of the parties are often biased-evangelicals overestimate
   the presence of evangelicals within the Republican Party and the
   irreligious within the Democratic Party. The key finding is that
   individuals are far more likely to identify with the party in which they
   believe their group is well represented-a finding which clarifies the
   role of party image shifts in constructing partisanship, the limits of
   the culture war motif, and the importance of social perception in
   shaping beliefs about party representation.},

Abstract = {The ideological dimension of the bilateral Turkey-Egypt ties constitutes
   a particular focal point in terms of predicaments, which could be quite
   tricky to overcome. Yet, it seems that the geopolitical necessities
   tighten the noose for Turkey to feel obliged in fixing the strained
   relations with the Sisi administration. It is also evident that the
   first step towards a compromise is expected to be taken by Ankara.
   Within this context and providing a brief background, this piece aims to
   lay out specific policy contexts to discuss the possibility and limits
   of recalibration between Turkey and Egypt based on a 2016 visit to Cairo
   in which numerous interviews with the political and academic elite were
   conducted.},

Abstract = {Democratic citizens confront a range of problems framed as
   ``security{''} issues, in policy areas such as counterterrorism and
   migration control, which place substantial political pressure on
   democratic norms. We develop a normative theoretical framework for
   assessing whether and how policies that curtail democratic governance
   standards in the name of security can be justified as politically
   legitimate. To do so, we articulate a novel normative account of
   legitimacy, which integrates insights from both democratic and realist
   traditions of thought to illuminate the complementary contributions of
   democratic and security standards to political legitimacy. We further
   elaborate a framework for applying this theoretical account to political
   practice in the form of a policy-focused ``security test{''} for
   legitimacy in democratic states. Finally, we explore how this test may
   be deployed to help resolve policy dilemmas in democratic practice, by
   examining its application to a case study of national policy on
   irregular boat arrivals in Australia and Canada. Through this analysis,
   we contribute to the development of both richer theoretical
   understandings of the complex modern value of political legitimacy, and
   clearer action-guiding principles for balancing competing demands of
   legitimacy within securitized democratic policy regimes.},

Abstract = {Contact tracing applications have been deployed at a fast pace around
   the world to stop the spread of COVID-19 and may be key to containing
   future pandemics. This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell
   phone contact tracing using a survey experiment. We build upon a theory
   in evolutionary psychology-disease avoidance-to predict how media
   coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment
   measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item
   that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in
   support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates
   such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the
   rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps.
   And third, while a majority of respondents approve of the reliance on
   cell phone contact tracing, concerns for rights and freedoms remain a
   salient preoccupation.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges facing current generations is the
   environmental and climate crisis. Democracies, so far, have not
   distinguished themselves by their capacity to bring about appropriate
   political responses to these challenges. This is partly explicable in
   terms of a lack of state capacity in a globalized context. Yet we also
   argue that election-centered democracies suffer from several flaws that
   make them inapt to deal with this challenge properly: youth is not
   appropriately represented; parliaments suffer from a lack of diversity;
   elected representatives' time-horizon is too narrow; anti-regulation
   lobbies have too much influence. Considering this, we argue for
   rejuvenating our democratic systems by introducing a randomly selected
   legislative chamber, which would be permanently integrated to our
   political systems and would play a deliberative and scrutinizing role.
   We have identified four eco-political arguments in favor of such reform.
   The generational rebalancing argument, which we examine first, has some
   plausibility but is not the strongest. The other three arguments - its
   eco-epistemic promises; its wider time horizon; and the independence of
   its members from short-term corporate interests - however, appear to us
   to be much more convincing.},

Abstract = {We must, Isaiah Berlin argues, make tragic tradeoffs as we navigate the
   clash of incommensurable and irreconcilable values and ends of
   modernity. To deny this is to succumb to a politics of immaturity, and
   to the totalitarian temptation. The twentieth century taught that to
   resist final-solution fantasies, we must resist the allure, if not
   reject the value, of positive liberty, the liberty of self-mastery and
   self-rule. Two decades in, has the twenty-first century taught a
   different lesson? Have we learned that negative liberty, liberty from
   rule, with its antipaternalistic ethic of ultra-individualism, harbors
   its own politics of immaturity, and a demagogic temptation? I argue that
   this is the more frequent, if less fatal, threat to human dignity and
   decency today, and that we therefore ought to rebalance the scales in
   the tragic tradeoff of positive for negative liberty.},

Abstract = {I chart paths for navigating the contemporary political moment via the
   work of the working-class barrio poet Edward Vidaurre. The take-away
   from his work is a form of confrontational poetic activism or what I
   call the politics of the cholo strut. Vidaurre creates a counterculture
   via poetry to resist white-racist-capitalist propaganda and ideology.
   The cholo strut is not a criminal act but flags defiant subjectivity and
   points to an emancipatory politics that enacts militancy and yearning
   for utopia. Via the politics of the cholo strut, I seek to explode the
   limits of mainstream political science research on Chicanx politics in
   terms of whose voices are included and what counts as legitimate
   knowledge. Vidaurre's work, I argue, opens new vectors for radical
   political reflection via code-switching and bridging while also staring
   into the abyss via the poetry of poverty.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the relationship between the access of political parties to
   direct public funding and electoral support for
   anti-political-establishment (e.g. populist, extremist) parties (APEp),
   this article tries to fill an important gap in the literature. Whereas
   previous contributions, mostly focused on the United States or
   established democracies in Western Europe, have presented contradictory
   findings, our study of 19 new democracies in East Central Europe clearly
   shows that the absence of state subsidies for political parties boosts
   support for those with an anti-political-establishment character. More
   importantly, and taking into account the minimum legal payout threshold
   that grants parties access to public subsidies, our results show that
   the more restrictive the regulations and the greater the difficulties
   faced by parties in obtaining state help, the higher the support for
   APEp. Our findings have obvious implications for the development of
   post-Communist party systems and the future of legislative (party
   funding) reform in the region.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long noted the key role racial attitudes can
   play in electoral politics. However, the 2016 election of Donald Trump
   raises questions about prevailing theories of racial attitudes and their
   political effects. While existing research focuses on `cultural' or
   `modern' forms of racial prejudice, this article argues that a sizeable
   portion of White Americans, disturbingly, dehumanize Black people: that
   is, they view Black people as less than fully human. Unsurprisingly,
   given the blatant racism of Donald Trump's campaign, this study also
   demonstrates that dehumanizing attitudes toward Black people are more
   strongly associated with support for Trump than with support for other
   candidates in the 2016 Republican primary. The authors also find
   evidence that dehumanizing attitudes toward Black people bolstered
   Donald Trump's vote share among Whites in the 2016 presidential
   election. Finally, dehumanizing attitudes are negatively associated with
   Whites' evaluations of Barack Obama, even after holding standard
   measures of racial prejudice constant. These findings suggest that a
   fundamental form of racism - dehumanizing attitudes toward Black people
   - can powerfully shape candidate evaluations and voting decisions in the
   twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {Support for the U.S. Supreme Court does not appear to be polarized on
   ideological or partisan lines. However, the form of polarization for
   which the mass political behavior field has amassed substantial support
   is affective in nature. We reconsider the hypothesis that polarization
   does not bear on Court support by examining the role of affective
   polarization. Using three sources of nationally representative survey
   data, we consistently find a negative relationship between affective
   polarization and both diffuse and specific support for the Court.
   Moreover, neither general nor Court-specific political sophistication
   mitigates the negative effect of affective polarization; rather,
   sophistication exacerbates affective polarization's influence on
   support. Finally, panel data show that affective polarization precedes
   negative evaluations of the judiciary, though there is no support for
   the converse relationship. Evaluations of the Court are not free from
   the forces of polarization but are influenced by diverging
   extra-judicial emotional orientations toward in- and out-groups.},

Abstract = {When Andrew Gamble's Between Europe and America was published in 2003,
   the Conservative Party was in deep trouble-a victim, he claimed, of its
   own success under Margaret Thatcher in destroying `the post-war
   compromise' that had kept the United Kingdom together, allowed it to
   participate, albeit reluctantly, in European integration, and helped it
   cope with imperial and economic decline. Yet, getting on for two decades
   later, the party appears to have regained the hegemony that then looked
   lost. Moreover, by leading the country out of the EU, the Tories seem
   finally to have made the choice between the two relationships and the
   two models of political economy that, according to Gamble, they had long
   attempted, however uneasily, to reconcile. When we look more closely,
   however, at trade, at foreign and defence policy, and at the Johnson
   government's economic policies, it looks as if the Conservatives-for all
   that the majority of their MPs can be classified as Brexiteers, as
   Atlanticists, as neoliberals, and therefore as Thatcherites-continue to
   hope (not necessarily irrationally) that they can have their cake and
   eat it too.},

   However, less is said about the individuals who populate these

   oversight, since how autocrats recruit reflects upon their institutional
   capacities and adaptation to changing circumstances. Specifically,
   recruitment is challenging when regimes lack robust ruling parties to
   cultivate partisan loyalists and during periods of multiparty elections
   when candidates must provide a higher degree of self-financing. This
   article examines these dynamics across the lifespan of Cameroon's
   authoritarian regime and introduces an original biographical data set of
   over 900 legislators between 1973 and 2019. The data show there is an
   increased proportion of businesspeople in the legislature, but also a
   possible emerging preference for former civil servants. The article
   argues that civil service recruitment pipelines substitute for the
   monitoring functions a party might serve, while simultaneously preparing
   candidates for the unique financing needs of elections.},

   assujetisement. in the works of Louis Althusser and Judith Butler. More
   specifically, the ambivalent character acquired by both power and the
   subject will be addressed, since the social norm is not only that which
   oppresses the individual from the outside and limits their freedom, but
   also that which enables their agency. The subject is formed in
   subjection due to the passionate bond of dependency that the child
   establishes with those on whom he depends. This foundational
   subordination can also be read as a primary violence, since the
   individual emerges against himself to finally persist in himself. Since
   the subject is not produced unilaterally but iteratively, it is this
   performative capacity for assuming power that gives him the possibility
   of subverting the norm that gives him origin and continuity.},

Abstract = {The premise that constituents hold representatives accountable for their
   legislative decisions undergirds political theories of democracy and
   legal theories of statutory interpretation. But studies of this at the
   individual level are rare, examine only a handful of issues, and arrive
   at mixed results. We provide an extensive assessment of issue
   accountability at the individual level. We trace the congressional
   roll-call votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-18), and link
   them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and
   their evaluation of their representative. Correlational, instrumental
   variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold
   representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a
   constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can
   improve net approval by 35 percentage points. Congressional districts,
   however, are heterogeneous. Consequently, the effect of issue agreement
   on vote is much smaller at the district level, resolving an apparent
   discrepancy between micro and macro studies.},

Abstract = {Prior research has shown that citizens demand more public spending for
   government services but are unwilling to support tax increases to cover
   the increased costs. Yet the basis for this observed inconsistency in
   fiscal preferences remains unclear. Some scholars propose that the
   desire ``something for nothing{''} could be the result of citizens
   lacking knowledge about taxation, public spending, and the inherent
   trade-offs between the two sides of the ledger, while others suggest
   that citizens sincerely want the benefits without paying the costs. This
   article contributes to the literature by studying citizens' fiscal
   priorities under the condition of near-complete information about the
   U.S. federal budget. We used an online budget simulation-based on the
   actual U.S. federal budget-to provide respondents with information about
   the structure of the federal budget and gather data on their preferred
   changes in the budget. Further, we conducted a population-based survey
   and found that respondents express preferences that are more nuanced-and
   more coherent-than previously suggested.},

Abstract = {President Donald Trump entered the 2020 campaign with liabilities that
   made his reelection bid daunting. Despite an enthusiastic support base,
   Trump was soundly defeated in both the popular vote and the Electoral
   College. Trump's perceived mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic and
   uprisings over racial inequality prevented him from altering the
   trajectory of the campaign that had been set in his first election. A
   unified Democratic Party rallied behind former Vice President Joseph
   Biden as the candidate most likely to defeat Trump and restore normalcy.
   Although Republicans fared reasonably well in subpresidential races, the
   verdict of voters resulted in the rare removal of an incumbent party
   after just 4 years in the White House.},

Abstract = {Vast research on immigration lumps together native citizens' attitudes
   toward two different groups: the immigrant stock of non-naturalized
   resident aliens, and the immigrant flow, that is, the future arrival of
   foreigners seeking to enter and live in the country. Does popular
   opposition to immigration distinguish between the two, and if so, how?
   This article analyzes theoretically the reasons the stock and flow might
   induce different views among natives, and presents experimental evidence
   from the United States showing that natives are systematically more
   accepting of the former. The analysis indicates that this `stock
   premium' partly stems from a sense of moral obligation toward people
   residing in the country. Replicating two widely cited experiments, the
   study shows that the stock-flow distinction has important implications
   for the interpretation of earlier findings on immigration attitudes, and
   for understanding voter preferences regarding policies designed to
   curtail immigration.},

Abstract = {The interaction between kleptocracy, strategic corruption, and defence
   policymaking has not yet been sufficiently explored in the existing
   literature. Malaysia's turn towards China amidst the 1MDB scandal,
   despite Chinese claims to Malaysian waters and naval intrusions,
   provides an opportunity to study such a phenomenon. By examining the
   pressures exerted by the US and the strategic corruption pull by China
   upon Prime Minister Najib Razak's kleptocratic interests, this analysis
   highlighted the kleptocrat's strategies to change Malaysia's pro-Western
   defence policy. Through extensive interviews and secondary data, this
   study analyses the manipulation of Public Service Bargains as a critical
   variable influencing the kleptocrat's defence policymaking. It concludes
   that Najib's strategies transformed the established trustee-type of
   bargain in Malaysia's defence decision-making process to a kleptocratic
   type, enabling a closer relationship with China. This analysis
   contributes to the debate on kleptocracy's impact on smaller powers'
   defence relationships amidst the global expansion of China's strategic
   influence.},

Title = {Boxholm tea party: Taxation and voter turnout in a mature democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The link between taxation and representation is generally considered
   foundational to the emergence of democratic governance. Nevertheless,
   the empirical relationship between taxation and the extent to which
   citizens actually exert representation by turning out to vote remains
   virtually unexplored. Using a panel of all Swedish municipalities from
   1979 to 2018, I find that hikes in local tax rates are linked to
   increased municipal voter turnout. Accounting for a wide range of
   confounders, including turnout in concurrent parliamentary- and county
   elections, these results indicate an important untapped explanation for
   changes in turnout, while offering a rare explicit test of the
   taxation-representation argument drawn from a mature democracy.},

Abstract = {The emergence of anti-immigration parties in mature democracies has
   triggered various reactions. These reactions, including stigmatization
   of these parties and prosecution of their members for hate speech, may
   have unintended consequences. What are the effects of these responses on
   the electoral support for these parties? Using an experimental approach,
   we confront a sample representative of the Dutch electorate with one of
   six versions of a manipulated news video about a new anti-immigration
   party. We find that stigmatization of the party reduces the propensity
   to vote for that party, and even more so if it is mentioned that a
   prominent member is prosecuted for hate speech than if not. Either way,
   the effect is moderated by anti-immigrant attitude and mediated by the
   party's perceived legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, governments across Europe
   have attempted to prevent the spread of the disease by limiting the
   movement of their citizens. In this article, we analyse whether the
   level of compliance with social distancing measures is associated with
   political, economic, and demographic factors. In particular, our
   interests lie in two areas. First, as lockdowns have dragged on, many
   countries see some political resistance, often, though not always, from
   populist movements: are localities that support populist movements more
   likely to ignore social distancing measures? Secondly, economic
   security: do localities with higher levels of income and wealth have
   higher levels of social distancing? We combine anonymised movement data
   from people's mobile phones drawn from the Google Community Mobility
   surveys with subnational economic and demographic data to answer these
   questions. It is found that across Europe, social distancing patterns
   correlate strongly with populist attitudes and economic security.

Abstract = {Both policymakers and scholars disagree about the effects and
   suitability of citizenship education standalone courses. Extant evidence
   about their effects is mixed and inconclusive. This article exploits the
   discontinuities generated by changes in Spanish education policies to
   identify the long-term effects of civic education on multiple outputs
   usually set as the policy goals of these courses: political engagement,
   institutional support and political values. In 2007, a new standalone
   citizenship education subject was introduced in the Spanish school
   curricula. This subject was then progressively removed from the
   curricula until its disappearance in 2017. These changes gave rise to
   exogenous variation in exposure to civic education between young
   individuals born in different years. In this article these policy
   changes are exploited to identify the effects of citizenship education
   through a regression discontinuity design that draws on a 12-wave panel
   survey. The results point to the emergence of a generation of critical -
   yet passive - citizens as a result of the implementation of a standalone
   citizenship education subject in Spanish schools. Supplemental data for

Abstract = {As African countries battled the Covid-19 crisis in 2020, one of the
   questions that were raised was whether the state was taking a central
   stage in the affairs of society, especially solutions to major problems.
   The question was triggered by the fact that there has been a decline in
   the capacity, role and prestige of the state in Africa for decades. Yet
   it seems that the responses to Covid-19, following the WHO guidelines,
   have placed the state at the centre, without dislocating other
   stakeholders like the private sector and the civil society. This paper
   uses the evidence from a select number of African countries of different
   sizes in various regions of the continent to provide an empirical
   perspective on the role of the state in Covid-19 responses in 2020 to
   answer the question of whether Covid-19 has occasioned a return of the
   state, thus reversing the neoliberal designs in favour of a lean and
   mean state in Africa.},

Title = {The Gender Backlash in the Vote for Brexit},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {347-371},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite a relationship between gender and support for populist causes in
   cross-national research, including in the 2016 US Presidential election,
   the role of gender has been missing in analysis of support for Brexit,
   most likely because women and men showed no average aggregate-level
   differences in voting Leave or Remain. This misses an important
   explanation for Britain's vote to leave the European Union. We
   demonstrate how gender-based resentment motivated Leave votes in the EU
   referendum through perceptions of discrimination against men, among men.
   Using novel survey measures, we demonstrate (i) the distinct nature of
   perceptions of discrimination towards men in comparison with
   discrimination towards women; (ii) the sociological sources of
   perceptions that men are discriminated against; and (iii) the role of
   these perceptions in Brexit support. Our findings reveal that the Brexit
   referendum provided an opportunity to express broader social grievances
   than have, to date, been identified as relevant. The paper therefore
   offers a novel contribution to understanding the cultural backlash
   behind Britain's vote to leave the EU, and by so doing, insight into the
   potential for gender-based backlash effects in elections where gender
   isn't significantly primed, unlike the 2016 US presidential election
   where gender was a major political focus.},

Abstract = {Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote that ``Man is born free, but is everywhere
   in chains.{''} Whereas the former claim of the quote is contestable and
   gendered, the latter part is empirically true from slavery to economic
   exploitation and widespread oppression that occurs to this day.
   Nevertheless, history shows that rarely will people take up weapons and
   rebel against the powerful. We have found that students often do not
   understand why this should be the case, given the rights that all people
   deserve. We use the Peasant Game exercise in class to shine a light on
   why most people, most of the time, endure repression and choose not to
   rebel. The game is played in turns with some students as lords, who
   decide how ``food{''} will be apportioned, and other students as
   peasants, who produce the food. We discuss how power differentials occur
   and the difference they make. Students who play the game come away with
   a better understanding of why many people decide not to fight back
   against oppression-even if it is the right thing to do.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the hermeneutics of Liberation Theology in
   Polynesian thought. It is identified, as theological thought, from
   European authors who have studied Polynesian exegetes in their mother
   tongue. It is concluded that it is not related to that original of the
   Liberation Theology of Latin American origin, because its origin,
   interpretation and instrument as a word of God, is different, in spite
   of sharing the same denomination as biblical hemeneutics. However, it is
   a theology aimed at the peoples oppressed by European colonization.},

   Brazil and its consequences. It is a panoramic look at the Brazilian
   military dictatorship centered on two fundamental issues: the

Abstract = {Cyber warfare is a timely and relevant issue and one of the most
   controversial in international humanitarian law (IHL). The aim of IHL is
   to set rules and limits in terms of means and methods of warfare. In
   this context, a key question arises: Has digital warfare rules or
   limits, and if so, how are these applicable? Traditional principles,
   developed over a long period, are facing a new dimension of challenges
   due to the rise of cyber warfare. This paper argues that to overcome
   this new issue, it is critical that new humanity-oriented approaches is
   developed with regard to cyber warfare. The challenge is to establish a
   legal regime for cyber-attacks, successfully addressing human rights
   norms and standards. While clarifying this from a legal perspective, the
   authors can redesign the sensitive equilibrium between humanity and
   military necessity, weighing the humanitarian aims of IHL and the
   protection of civilians-in combination with international human rights
   law and other relevant legal regimes-in a different manner than before.},

Abstract = {Heterogeneous States are built on the difficult balance between unity
   (in the identification of the sovereign) and diversity (due to the
   existence of structural minorities), which interferes with the
   (democratic) majority rule in decision-making processes. This question
   is here analysed from the perspective of liberal democracy, which
   protects pluralism but also formal equality among citizens, thus
   hindering the consideration of their substantial features and the
   recognition of minorities. This work defends the protection of
   minorities although with the limit imposed by pluralism (the possibility
   of other minorities), in order to avoid that liberal democracy becomes
   one based on identity. From this theoretical framework, this article
   studies the Spanish case (its constitutional recognition of diversity
   and its consequent adaptation of the majority rule). It argues that
   although the Constitution declares the heterogeneous character of the
   State, it does not solve the contradictions implied in it.},

Abstract = {From a transnational methodology, within Comparative Literature studies,
   we will analyze the works The Trial by Franz Kafka and A Rosa do Povo by
   Carlos Drummond de Andrade, aiming to approach Marxist aesthetics.
   Literature is understood as a critical-realistic awareness of class
   struggles and of the historical subjects who experience them. The
   people's process that underlies the interpretation of this article runs
   through the experiences of characters in conflict with the capitalist
   system.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to place some debates that have marked
   the configuration of Latin American Marxism as a heterodox theoretical
   translation with certain guidelines that make it unique. In this sense,
   it is proposed to contribute to an open debate on the ways of conceiving
   the practice and theory of Marxism at a continental level. The document
   is also presented as an introduction to problematic nodes that have
   helped to build this current, pointing out the main lines of research
   around the continental Marxism, the limits thar the Eurocentric lecture
   hade made and proposing translation practices as an alternative to
   dogmatisms. Finally, some importants points of debate are shown that
   have divide the ways of interpreting Latin American Marxism.},

Abstract = {Autocrats use repression to deter opposition. Are they successful in the
   long run? The author argues that state repression can have long-lasting
   alienating effects on citizens' political attitudes and coercive effects
   on their political behavior. The article evaluates this proposition by
   studying the long-term effects of state terror during China's Cultural
   Revolution. It shows that individuals who grew up in localities that
   were exposed to more state-sponsored violence in the late 1960s are less
   trusting of national political leaders and more critical of the
   country's political system today. These anti-regime attitudes are more
   likely to be passed down to the younger generation if family members
   discuss politics frequently than if they do not. Yet while state
   repression has created anti-regime attitudes, it has decreased citizens'
   contentious behavior. These findings highlight the dilemma that
   authoritarian rulers face when they seek to consolidate their rule
   through repression.},

Abstract = {In the late 2010s, the future of work gathered attention from the most
   influential actors in global social governance. The International Labour
   Organization (ILO), since 2015 and in the context of its Future of Work
   Initiative, aimed to position itself in the discussion by putting this
   issue at the centre of their activities for its centenary (2019). The
   normative and conceptual approach developed by the ILO in this
   initiative was named the `human-centred agenda', aimed to align
   technological change with decent work and social justice. Although
   preliminary scholarly works have seen these efforts as a humanistic and
   pro-worker `countermovement', a deeper analysis of the ideas and
   interests involved in the Future of Work Initiative reveals a different,
   more complex picture. This article studies the creation of the
   human-centred agenda led by the ILO secretariat and the Global
   Commission on the Future of Work, and how it was further negotiated and
   modified by the social partners in the making of the Centenary
   Declaration in 2019. In particular, it shows how business at the ILO and
   right-wing populist governments, in tandem, reoriented the human-centred
   agenda towards a pro-employer perspective, thus framing social and
   labour policy as a tool for adapting the workforce to technological
   change. It concludes with some reflections about the consequences of
   these developments for the ILO's position in global governance.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate how the political geography of local
   power and national-subnational alignment influences the distribution of
   conflict between election contests. We ask how consistently local
   intermediaries, such as members of parliament (MPs), can sustain their
   own support and that of their successful national candidate. The best
   measure for the ability of local elites to generate and keep support is
   candidate vote margins. These election results recast elites and areas
   as core, swing or costly regime investments, which in turn influences
   the streams of patronage and authority between election cycles. Based on
   the political geographies that result from subnational election data for
   13 African countries, we find that in core areas where support for the
   leader is high, there is limited violence by state forces; state
   violence is significantly higher in areas costly to the national leader;
   and violence by non-state armed actors (e.g. militias) is most likely to
   occur in swing areas where the winning margin of the last legislative
   election is narrow for the local candidate. It is in these swing regions
   that competing political elites engage in violence to replace poorly
   performing local intermediaries.},

Abstract = {When legislators switch parties between elections this may be viewed as
   undemocratic since, bypassing voters, they are changing the outcomes of
   elections. Do electoral institutions affect the likelihood of party
   switching? I argue that legislators are less likely to switch in
   candidate-centered electoral systems where, because of personal voting,
   parties cannot insulate defectors from voter retribution. When they
   switch though, legislators do so early in the term to exploit voters'
   short retrospective time horizon. These expectations are tested using a
   quasi experimental research design that estimates the effect of the 2008
   Romanian electoral reform on party switching. In 2008 Romania changed
   its electoral system from a closed-list PR to a candidate-centered
   electoral system, where all candidates compete in single-member
   districts. Both hypotheses are supported by empirics. This helps weed
   out competing explanations which now have to account for both the
   decrease in and the different timing of party switching.},

Abstract = {Across the globe, women are increasingly more visible as leaders and
   activists in radical-right parties and movements. Does women's
   visibility in radical-right politics, both institutionalized and
   non-institutionalized, affect public acceptance of radical-right
   agendas? The present paper proposes a `radical-right gender
   mainstreaming model', arguing that women in radical-right politics are
   perceived by the general public through a prism of feminine gender
   stereotypes, which counteract radical-right parties' and movements'
   masculine stereotypes, thus `softening' their image and making them more
   acceptable to the general public. Across four experimental studies
   conducted in the Israeli context, we find strong evidence that women's
   visibility as radical-right parliamentary representatives (Studies 1a
   and 1b) and as radical-right political activists (Studies 2a and 2b)
   increases acceptance of and support for these parties' and movements'
   agenda, particularly among women. We further demonstrate that these
   effects are mediated by the attribution of feminine stereotypes (warmth)
   to women versus men political actors. Implications of these findings are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {2017 marked the 45th anniversary of Title IX of the Education Amendments
   of 1972, a sex non-discrimination policy which remade American education
   and athletics. Has Title IX fulfilled its promise to end discriminatory
   and disparate treatment of women in educational institutions? This
   article places policy in conversation with scholarly debate over how to
   best tackle persistent sex and gender inequalities, illustrating that
   the athletic policy sphere both addresses and reproduces sexist
   practices. It examines the under-appreciated complexity of sex equity
   politics and suggests the need to question how well public policy
   addresses inequalities. It argues that we are losing ground in the
   struggle to end gendered oppression - despite all that it may appear we
   have gained - because of Title IX's divergent implementation strategy
   which integrates women and men in classrooms and segregates them in
   sports. Rather than vitiating sex discrimination, implementation
   generated a series of policy ironies, authorizing, rather than
   challenging the notion that women and men are inherently
   ``different.{''} In order to continue addressing the ways in which
   gendered oppression asserts itself - in sex discrimination, in
   discrimination against trans{*} people, in gendered harassment and
   \#metoo - we must bring a critical perspective to bear on current equity
   policy practices.},

Title = {The Politics of Europeanisation Patterns of German Work and Family Life
   Reconciliation Policy},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-248},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {With the dramatic changes in the extent to which women and men
   contribute to unpaid domestic work and paid employment, work and family
   life reconciliation (WFLR) has become one of the most pressing policy
   and political subjects across Europe but especially at the European
   Union (EU) (Drew, Eileen. 1998. ``Re-Conceptualising Families.{''} In
   Women, Work and the Family in Europe, edited by E. Drew, R. Emerek, and
   E. Mahon, 11-27. London: Routledge). From the 1980s onwards, the EU has
   prepared numerous strategies, formulated a range of goals and targets,
   drafted legislation and introduced various initiatives and roadmaps
   regarding the reconciliation of work and family life. However, with
   decision making around social policy, including WFLR policies, remaining
   under the domain of national competence of member and candidate states;
   the impact of all this attention at EU level on these issues has had
   varied impact on domestic policy. Therefore, there remains considerable
   variation between countries in transferring and implementing EU
   standards, mostly stemming from the existence of national domestic
   actors with differing views on Europeanising the domestic WFLR model.
   This article thus endeavours to examine the Europeanisation patterns of
   WFLR policies of a founding member country, Germany, over the last
   decade, with a particular emphasis on intervening domestic actors.
   Relying on an extensive review of the related literature and policy
   documents, together with personal interviews with EU representatives and
   German policy makers, this article asserts that adaptational pressure
   coming from the EU did not result in policy change in Germany. Differing
   gender ideologies of political actors and their contributions to the
   process have had a considerable influence on shaping policy outcomes. In
   particular, due to a relatively conservative outlook within the German
   government, the actions undertaken towards Europeanising the German WFLR
   model remain incomplete and contradictory. This adds to the view that
   Europeanisation is a two-fold process, which comprises both the push
   from the EU and the pull by the domestic actors.},

Abstract = {Populist parties foment discontent with the establishment. Previous
   studies explored whether sentiments of discontent and protest can
   predict populist voting. In this paper, we argue that past electoral
   protest in a community, rather than merely a sense of discontent, is a
   good predictor of new populist lists and their electoral support. We
   explore this connection using blank voting, a measure that allows a
   systematic and unbiased evaluation of protest at the municipal level. We
   first test our theory on the Italian Five Star Movement (M5S).
   Controlling for economic and demographic variables, we demonstrate that
   in municipalities with high blank vote in previous elections, the
   probability of new M5S lists and M5S vote share were higher. Testing the
   generalizability of our theory using cross-national populism data, we
   show that past protest in the form of blank/null voting is a strong
   predictor of the level of populist rhetoric in a political system.},

Abstract = {Sexism and feminism are often seen as opposing belief systems on a
   single dimension in American politics. Gender scholars, however, have
   noticed that these forces are not equal and opposite. The 2016 election
   represents a critical case for examining how gender-related attitudes
   and identities push and pull voters. Hillary Clinton was the first
   female presidential nominee of a major party and a self-proclaimed
   feminist facing an opponent considered by many to be hostile to women.
   As such, many observers predicted a substantial increase in the gender
   gap. However, the gap did not widen much compared to previous races, and
   nearly half of women chose Trump. Why? We argue that sexism - as
   commonly measured - mixes attitudes about women in general with those
   about feminists in particular. When feminism becomes salient, as in
   2016, attitudes about this subgroup become more relevant to the vote.
   Relying on three studies - a 2016 survey on SSI, the 2018 CCES, and the
   2016 ANES, we assess the role of anti-feminist attitudes and feminist
   identity across gender, race, and party. We find that sexism directed
   against feminists powerfully dampened support for Clinton across
   genders. However, feminist identity was much less common in the
   electorate, and had little effect on men's votes. Thus, although
   countervailing, these two forces are not equivalent. In 2016, the
   benefit of appealing to feminists was overwhelmed by the cost of
   activating voters who intensely dislike the group. These results reveal
   a consequential imbalance in the power of sexism and feminism in U.S.

Abstract = {In this essay, we aim at framing the `negative emotion' of indifference,
   starting from its diachronic declination, which seems to beneficiate
   from a form of justification from the moral point of view (1). In order
   to prevent indifference as an outcome - together with its intrinsic
   motivational strength -, we introduce a methodological account to frame
   the struggle of motivation internal to the single agent, by classifying
   different forms of `reasons to act' (2). We will develop a two-move
   strategy. Firstly, we deploy what we could call a positive emotion - the
   sense of solidarity diachronically understood - against that negative
   one, in order to show that indifference is not the sole possible
   destination for the humankind (3). Secondly, to integrate and strengthen
   the motivational role of that positive emotion, we will rehabilitate a
   moral approach aimed at setting up a unique normative linkage among
   generations, by reshaping the interplay between `wide' and `narrow
   obligations' presented by Kant (4). The ultimate goal is to contrast the
   moral strength which is offered by indifference as negative emotion by
   articulating a motivational path devoted at legitimizing the diachronic
   moral commitment and duties of justice among generations.},

Abstract = {Learning-by-doing presents an opportunity for political science
   departments to instruct undergraduate students in social science
   research methods. Conducting these trainings as short-term, high impact
   programs have the potential to make research and research methods
   accessible and appealing to students. Building these opportunities
   around major political events transforms these opportunities for
   learning further still, such as heightening student interest in research
   methods. Rooted in these considerations, we designed and implemented the
   Qualitative Methods and the 2017 Presidential Inauguration Research
   Program. The program was a condensed qualitative research methods
   training experience that incorporated field work, conducted in spring
   2017. This article offers lessons for innovating on undergraduate

Abstract = {The ceasefire that ended the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War paused the
   fighting but also precipitated major challenges to human rights and
   humanitarian issues. Nagorno-Karabakh's status remained unresolved, even
   as Azerbaijan gained control of large parts of the region. Since then,
   Azerbaijan's impunity and ethnic animus against Armenians has created
   fears of ethnic cleansing. Azerbaijan's 2022-2023 blockade of
   Nagorno-Karabakh in particular which has deprived the Armenian
   population of food and medicine, directly contravenes its obligations
   under the ceasefire. The European Union is striving to negotiate a
   settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan but has faced criticism for
   not substantively addressing these human rights and humanitarian issues.
   Despite having the political and legal tools, the EU's lack of
   engagement on these concerns threatens regional stability and undermines
   its credibility as an ethical international actor. If a mass atrocity
   occurs while the EU actively seeks a settlement but fails to intervene,
   it would bear responsibility for the outcome.},

Abstract = {The 2019 regional elections in Spain were held in a context of political
   instability and polarization in the country and just 28 days after the
   national elections. Taking advantage of this unprecedented
   quasi-simultaneous electoral setting, this article analyzes
   vote-switching between regional and national elections, both at the
   aggregate and individual levels. Specifically, it explores whether the
   2019 regional elections match the expectations of the second-order
   election model. The results show that quasi-simultaneity between
   regional and national elections did not entail a higher level of
   election congruence. In addition, while most of the predictions of the
   second-order election model regarding aggregate election results hold
   for the 2019 regional elections, our findings suggest that dual voting
   at the individual level does not respond to the logic of the
   second-order election model but rather to regional political
   considerations.},

   Violence in the American West},

Abstract = {Despite the extensive literature probing individual motivations for
   committing political violence, little existing academic research
   directly examines the role of local governments in encouraging political
   violence. I use a federalism perspective to consider how subnational
   governments can decrease the perceived costs of high-risk political
   violence against the state. This paper introduces three novel datasets
   to substantiate my theories: political violence against Bureau of Land
   Management employees, land transfer legislation in state legislatures,
   and a roster of constitutionalist sheriffs. As emblems of the
   contentious relationship between rural land users and the federal
   government, employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) routinely
   deal with threats, harassment, and physical violence from civilians who
   are incensed by restrictions on the use of federal land. Counties with
   constitutionalist sheriffs are 50\% more likely to have violence against
   BLM employees than other counties, even when controlling for other
   factors. Additionally, levels of political violence are higher in years
   following the passage of land transfer legislation in the state
   legislature. Elected officials' legislative activity, campaign promises,
   and law enforcement decisions all may promote political violence against
   federal employees. Incorporating federalism into the study of political
   violence uncovers how the actions of elected officials at the state and
   county levels can lower the perceived costs of violence against the
   national government.},

Abstract = {Previous studies of right-wing populist (RWP) parties primarily
   investigate how domestic factors as well as external forces, such as
   immigration, incite the emergence and electoral success of RWP parties.
   Studies examining the link between migration and far-right support have
   found mixed empirical results, using various measures of immigration. In
   this article, we construct our own measures of immigration that
   highlight the economic and cultural dimensions of migrant-sending states
   in relation to migrant-receiving states. Our empirical analysis of 15
   Western European countries uses these measures to examine whether the
   economic and cultural characteristics of migrant-sending states can
   enhance RWP success in wealthy, advanced democracies. We find some
   evidence that relatively large economic and cultural differences between
   natives and immigrants are conducive to RWP support in Western European
   countries. But the findings suggest that future research should identify
   and examine other factors that strengthen or undermine the extent to
   which RWP parties can make electoral gains by focusing on immigration.},

Abstract = {Constitutional monarchies have proved to be resilient, and some have
   made substantive political interventions even though their positions are
   mostly hereditary, without granted constitutional channels to do so.
   This article examines how constitutional monarchs can influence
   political affairs and what impact royal intervention can have on
   politics. I argue that constitutional monarchs affect politics
   indirectly by influencing the preferences of the public who have de jure
   power to influence political leaders. The analyses herein show that
   constitutional monarchs do not indiscriminately intervene in politics,
   but their decisions to intervene reflect the public's preferences.
   First, constitutional monarchs with little public approval become
   self-restraining and do not attempt to assert their political
   preferences. Second, they are more likely to intervene in politics when
   the public is less satisfied about the incumbent government. These
   findings are illustrated with historical narratives regarding the
   political involvement of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in the
   2000s.},

Abstract = {The ``global nuclear order{''} is commonly understood as an evolving set
   of institutions, norms, and practices governing the development and use
   of nuclear technology worldwide. The pursuit of nuclear order is often
   portrayed as a ``pragmatic{''} or ``practical{''} compromise between
   unconstrained nuclear anarchy, on the one hand, and prompt steps toward
   nuclear disarmament, on the other. In this article, I use the tools of
   ideology critique to conceptualize the discourse and practices of
   nuclear order as a political ideology that has entrenched extant power
   structures and constrained the space for political action. While the
   ideology is formally wedded to the pursuit of the ``sublime object{''}
   of a world without nuclear weapons, its underlying assumptions imply
   that the grand vision of abolition can never be realized in practice. To
   overcome the status quo, agents of change must subvert the ideology and
   re-politicize the nonproliferation and disarmament regime.},

Abstract = {Neoliberalism relies on a libertarian conception of both the individual
   and liberty. It is grounded in a conservative understanding of the
   extra-social source of political order and a tendency to situate
   individuals in concrete groups. Crucially, it views public restrictions
   on individual liberty - issuing from a collective, homogeneous person
   ('the people') - as inherently despotic. Neoliberalism thus excludes the
   concept of `the people' from its ideological corpus and prioritizes
   individual personal interests.
   In this article, I argue that individual liberty does not prevent the
   political tyranny of the individual and is in fact compatible with the
   concept of the people. As I show, neoliberal populism retains `the
   people' as a core concept while cloaking its members in the neoliberal
   conception of the individual, while liberalism understands the people as
   a collection of individuals who associate their personal well-being with
   that of others, pursued under freely willed public laws.},

Title = {Does political ideology affect a government's credit rating? The
   evidence on parties' socio-cultural positions in European countries},

Abstract = {Does the political ideology of governments influence credit ratings?
   Previous studies report that the economic left-right dimension has an
   impact on credit ratings. However, recent literature shows that there
   are no significant differences between right-wing and left-wing
   debt-related policies. In addition, current political developments, such
   as the rise of populist movements, indicate that the economic left-right
   dimension may not be sufficient to describe how political ideology
   affects governments' actions and thereby credit ratings. Therefore, this
   paper suggests that the socio-cultural dimension of political ideology
   or the GAL-TAN (Green-Alternative-Liberal vs.
   Traditionalist-Authoritarian-Nationalist) also impacts a country's
   rating. In particular, the study proposes that TAN-leaning governments
   are perceived as a risk factor for debt repayment because they are less
   likely to adhere to rule of law and are reluctant to cooperate with
   international organizations and other domestic political parties. They
   also prefer protectionist policies for cultural reasons. Using data from
   the Chapel Hill Expert Survey for 24 European countries between 1999 and
   2019, the results show that governments with TAN-leaning major parties
   are associated with lower sovereign credit ratings. This study
   contributes toward a closer understanding of what role day-to-day
   politics and governments' political ideology have for the assignment of
   credit ratings.},

Abstract = {This article answers the question of why certain European mainstream
   parties have changed their policy positions on the GAL-TAN
   (Green/Alternative/Libertarian vs.
   Traditional/Authoritarian/Nationalist) dimension in recent years. I
   argue that these changes can be explained through the electoral success
   of new right-wing populist parties and the ideological proximity of
   conservative mainstream parties towards these parties. These arguments
   were tested with econometric models of mainstream parties' policy
   positions in 11 Western European democracies between 2002 and 2019. The
   results indicate that mainstream parties chase the other ``populist
   zeitgeist{''} by changing their policy positions on the GAL-TAN
   dimension in response to the electoral success of right-wing populist
   parties. Mainstream parties respond to this threat by closing the
   distance to these parties on the GAL-TAN dimension. However, this
   responsiveness is largely constrained to conservative mainstream
   parties. The findings have important implications for understanding
   mainstream party responsiveness towards rivalling right-wing populist
   parties.},

Abstract = {Economic growth requires confidence in the state's ability to enforce
   secure exchange. But when states selectively enforce rule of law,
   political considerations can moderate the trust that buyers have in
   sellers. I argue that political connections produce moral hazard in
   exchange because they introduce biases in expectations of judicial
   enforcement. Buyers avoid trade with politically connected sellers, and,
   in this context of unequal enforcement, formal contracts
   disproportionately protect politically connected buyers. To examine
   these features of connections and contracts, I created a sales business
   in Senegal and randomized whether employees signaled political
   connections and/or offered formal contracts during transactions. The
   results show that political connections decreased buyers' willingness to
   exchange. Formal contracts increased exchange, though primarily for
   connected buyers. These findings show that asymmetric political
   connections can impede daily trade and intensify economic inequalities
   in developing contexts, while simultaneously demonstrating the limits of
   state institutions for mitigating politically driven moral hazard.},

Abstract = {Despite patterns of secularisation across Europe, religion continues to
   exert influence. Besides theological belief, religion is deeply
   integrated into daily life as a social institution and marker of who
   belongs in a community and who does not. Linear mixed effects analysis
   of the 2016 European Social Survey (ESS) demonstrates that secular
   individuals and those in minority religious groups have weaker national
   identity than individuals in the country's historically majority
   religion. The effect of affiliation with the majority religion on
   national identity also holds for secular individuals who grew up in the
   majority religion. Overall influence of religious importance is waning,
   except among Muslims, which suggests that religion's socio-political
   power lies in its social identities more than devout practice in the
   contemporary European context. The findings of this study further
   advance understandings of the ways that religion reinforces or
   conditions national identity in so-called `secularizing societies'.},

Abstract = {The assumption that increasing diversity and economic hardship boost
   support for the far right is widespread, yet extant research comes up
   with contradictory findings. This article investigates the link between
   context and the far right by investigating the impact of immigration and
   unemployment on voting for Marine Le Pen in the first round of the 2017
   French Presidential election. We match a large individual-level survey
   with contextual variables constructed from the census describing voters'
   residential environments. Unlike previous studies, we measure
   immigration and unemployment at the neighborhood level and the broader
   level of the department. Using a multilevel model, we find that voters
   in neighborhoods with high levels of immigration are less likely to vote
   for the far right. However, in departments, increased immigration and
   unemployment correlate with greater support for Le Pen. These findings
   suggest that contact theory and ethnic threat operate differently
   according to spatial scale.},

Abstract = {Within the field of peace and conflict studies, data-production on peace
   agreements has rapidly increased. One complicated task for scholars and
   practitioners alike is understanding the relationships between peace
   agreements and the relationships between agreements and processes. For
   example, discerning when an agreement establishes continuity with
   previous agreements and, thus, belongs to the same peace process or when
   an agreement signals the start of a new peace process is not
   straightforward. In this study, I highlight what appears to be a fuzzy
   boundary for categorizing some disciplinary core concepts which, in
   turn, can cause our data to be unreliable. As a point of comparison, I
   investigate how two major peace agreement datasets - UCDP Peace
   Agreement Dataset and PA-X Peace Agreement Dataset - associate peace
   agreements with peace processes and find differences and ambiguities
   with respect to how they are coded in both databases. As a result of
   such inconsistencies, analyses drawn from these data can have different
   outputs and lead to misunderstandings about peace processes. Here, I
   demonstrate the disciplinary need for clearer principles to effectively
   associate peace agreements with peace processes and then argue for
   developing a disciplinary standard for the criteria used to
   operationalize peace processes. Crucially, a standard method for
   aggregating agreements into processes will facilitate consistent data
   production across databases.},

Abstract = {Does liberal democracy require a strict separation between state and
   religion? In Anglophone liberal political theory, the separationist
   model of the First Amendment of the US Constitution has provided the
   basic template for the rightful relationship between state and religion.
   Yet this model is ill-suited to the evaluation of the secular
   achievements of most states, including India. This article sets out a
   new framework, minimal secularism, as a transnational framework of
   normative comparison. Minimal secularism does not single out religion as
   special, and it appeals to abstract liberal democratic ideals such as
   equal inclusion and personal liberty. Actual debates about secularism in
   India are shown to revolve around these ideals. The study of recent
   Indian controversies-about the Uniform Civil Code, the status of
   Muslims, and the rise of BJP nationalism-also sheds light on some blind
   spots of Western secularism and the conception of sovereignty and
   religion it relies on.},

Abstract = {How do autocrats build support? This study argues that autocrats create
   and maintain participatory technologies-elite-mass communication
   strategies that promote two-way interaction between citizens and
   leaders-to foster support. Participatory technologies provide citizens
   with the opportunity to have a limited voice in otherwise closed
   political systems. I test this theory through a series of two
   nationally-representative survey experiments in Russia. Results suggest
   that awareness of participatory technologies increases approval of
   President Putin and improves perceptions that there are opportunities
   for voice in politics. This finding departs from previous research that
   suggests public opinion is influenced primarily by participation.
   Furthermore, I demonstrate that these effects can be directly attributed
   to the communicative format of these strategies, not to issue resolution
   or leadership effects. Finally, I demonstrate that effects are dependent
   upon individuals' political sophistication and political priors,
   contributing to political polarization and opening up the potential for
   backlash against the regime.},

Abstract = {The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is guaranteed by Article 39 of
   the Ukrainian Constitution. However, there is no stand-alone law or case
   law that defines, regulates and supports the process of organizing and
   conducting peaceful assemblies. This is largely due to the fact that
   until the 2014 Maidan Revolution (Euromaidan), Ukraine's history was one
   of autocratic rule. This article argues that given this historical
   context, secondary legislation is needed to safeguard this freedom and
   entrench it into Ukrainian legal culture. The idea of the right to
   peaceful assembly is sacrosanct. This article analyses the key elements
   needed to transform this idea into an ideal law. For example, any such
   legislation should follow the spirit of the European Convention of Human
   Rights (ECHR), especially in the area of limitations of the personal
   freedom. Ukraine has moved forward on a broad reform agenda including
   reforms of the judiciary in order to create an independent and competent
   court system. It is widely recognized that such a system is needed to
   fight widespread corruption. The article argues that now is the time to
   enact a law on peaceful assembly in order to elevate Ukraine's legal
   system to EU and international standards.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine which factors robustly influence
   cabinet duration in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). In this respect
   the article investigates the role political institutions (including vote
   of no-confidence procedures), parliamentary and cabinet attributes, and
   various contextual factors have on cabinet stability. By using a type of
   sensitivity analysis (i.e. Extreme Bounds Analysis) on a panel of about
   180 cabinets in CEE, it is possible to examine which factors
   consistently predict the probability of government survival. It is found
   that only a few factors are robust to alternative model specifications,
   namely: government type, fragmentation in parliament, the level of
   unemployment, and restrictive no-confidence votes procedures which make
   it more difficult for the opposition to bring down a government. Thus,
   the results indicate that cabinet duration in CEE is not primarily
   affected by sui generis factors to the region, but by factors of more
   general relevance.},

Abstract = {Organized interests routinely seek direct contacts with, or access to,
   members of Congress to advance their policy goals. While studies often
   explore the tactics interests use to obtain access, few examine
   interests' strategic considerations in choosing which members to target.
   Furthermore, the few empirical studies that examine organized interests'
   targeting strategies yield inconclusive results concerning the types of
   members interests target. This article presents a conjoint experiment
   with federal lobbyists and policy advocates-a novel experimental sample
   in political science-to evaluate which types of members organized
   interests target when trying to advance a proposal in an empirical
   framework that addresses some of the inferential challenges faced by
   prior studies. The results indicate that organized interests target
   members who are undecided on or are weak supporters of the proposal of
   interest and who possess institutional roles providing them with
   influence over the proposal at its current stage of the legislative
   process.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {In urban sub-Saharan Africa, leaders should appeal to voters of diverse
   ethnic backgrounds for electoral success. Yet, the political salience of
   ethnic inequality demands their attention to ethnicity issues in
   campaign messaging. This study examines the impacts on voter preference
   of appeals to ethnic equality by using a conjoint experiment conducted
   in Nairobi, Kenya. Appeals to ethnic equality were varied randomly as
   follows: (1) no appeal to ethnic equality, (2) appeals to equal
   opportunities for all ethnic groups (pan-ethnic appeal), and (3) appeals
   to opportunities for ethnic minorities (pro-minority appeal). The study
   found a substantial increase in support for politicians making appeals
   to ethnic equality, while pan-ethnic appeals increased voter support for
   candidates more than pro-minority appeals. Pan-ethnic appeals were more
   effective than pro-minority appeals because they bolster support from
   co-ethnic voters who are also from the candidate?s party, while not
   alienating non-co-ethnic voters or voters affiliated with other parties.},

Title = {Carolingians at the Doorstep? The Maturing Limited-Access Order of Early
   Medieval Europe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},

Abstract = {North et al. (2009) argue that accounting for different development
   outcomes requires understanding how different societies manage violence.
   Almost all societies have been limited-access orders where elites
   constrain violence to preserve their rents. Alternatively, in
   open-access orders, violence is constrained by a government
   characterized by widespread political participation. Open-access
   societies were the first cases of sustained economic development; almost
   all of them have been Western European or offshoots. Understanding why
   is important. North et al. elaborate on three necessary conditions for
   achieving open access: (1) rule of law for elites, (2) support for
   perpetually-lived organizations, and (3) centralization and
   consolidation of violence. These constitute the ``doorstep{''} to an
   open-access order. I argue that significant progress towards this
   doorstep was affected by the Carolingians of the early medieval era. I
   emphasize their large-scale distributions of confiscated/conquered lands
   to vassals, cultivation of bonds with the Church, and regularization of
   assemblies. The Carolingians introduced governance innovations that
   impersonalized relationships between elites and encouraged their
   enforcement under the rule of law.},

Abstract = {In countries transitioning from military to democratic rule,
   authoritarian legacies often continue to influence politics. Whereas
   previous research has focused on the institutional causes of such
   deficiencies, there is a lack of studies examining the role ex-military
   leaders who re-emerge as civilian presidents have in sustaining
   authoritarian tendencies. In this article, we begin to fill this lacuna
   by investigating the question: how and under which conditions do
   ex-military leaders' political identity constructions affect their
   tendency to place themselves above politics (i.e. expressing the
   attitude and behaviour of being superior to democratic rules)? The
   literature on neo-patrimonialism and post-civil war politics points to
   the importance of the political identities of ex-militaries, and we
   propose a theory that highlights the role identity construction plays in
   shaping elites' decision-making processes. Based on a comparison of two
   Nigerian presidents, Olusegun Obasanjo and Muhammadu Buhari, we find
   that ex-generals' tendency to engage in politics from above is largely a
   function of to what extent they have diversified their political
   identities beyond their role as ``militaries{''}. In this process, the
   degree of democratic consolidation also seems to play a role;
   ex-militaries operating in newly established democracies appear to have
   more opportunities to place themselves above politics.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long investigated connections between types of knowledge
   use and types of policy subsystem. Yet, most of them focus on the
   learning function of expert information. The legitimizing function of
   knowledge-when expertise serves as a substitute for decision (Boswell in
   J Eur Public Policy 15(4):471-488, 2008)-has attracted less attention.
   An empirically validated explanation of this function is still missing.
   This article tests existing hypotheses regarding which features of the
   subsystem are conducive to the legitimizing function. The demonstration
   rests upon a case study: France's Ministry of Agriculture's
   commissioning of INRA to carry out a systematic literature review on
   pain in farm animals. Two types of factors are involved in the
   legitimizing function of knowledge: environmental mechanisms (an
   adversarial policy subsystem, concentration of policy authority) and
   relational mechanisms (coalitions displaying epistemic uncertainty and
   exerting pressures on the source of policy authority, a policy broker
   mitigating the conflict between the two coalitions).},

Abstract = {When do scandals hurt candidates? In this study, we employ a candidate
   conjoint experiment to understand the conditions under which candidates
   are most penalized for scandals. Survey respondents evaluate candidates
   in election scenarios that vary candidate partisanship, the presence and
   type of negative news about the candidate, and the amount of other
   information available to voters about the candidates, such as issue
   positions and demographics. Averaging across respondents and the
   distribution of candidate attributes, the results show scandal decreases
   the probability of voting for a candidate, but the size of this negative
   effect varies by context. The negative effects of scandal on voting
   decisions are mitigated by the amount of other information available to
   voters. Our findings also reveal that it is not always the case that
   voters are blind to the moral failings of scandal-plagued candidates in
   the presence of other information; voters may continue to rate
   scandal-plagued candidates negatively in terms of morality but prefer
   these candidates in terms of partisanship and shared political views.},

Abstract = {This article presents the findings of an explanatory study into the
   perceptions of Dutch Muslims in The Hague concerning pre-emptive
   counter-extremism and de-radicalisation policies. Based on 15 in-depth
   interviews with established Muslim community figures and a theoretical
   survey of 102 respondents from 8 mosques, it was found that pre-emptive
   interventions were perceived unfavourably due to their inherent
   misconceptualization of the Muslim lived experience. Respondents
   perceived wide-ranging negative labelling, viewing policies as not just
   ineffectual but also detrimental in a climate of persistent
   Islamophobia. In reality, these Dutch Muslims were faced with tackling
   the challenges of radicalisation based on their existing levels of
   social and cultural capital. Securitisation forces some Dutch Muslims
   into further retreat at a time of existing issues of social exclusion
   and political polarisation. This research highlights the need for
   greater sensitivity to Muslim community norms and values in developing
   policy in this area.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the problems related to the implementation of the
   legal impact on modern Russia and the role of the principles of law as
   the underlying idea behind that impact. This research aims to structure
   visions of the main characteristics and classifications of the
   principles of law in the context of their formalization. The authors use
   the method of technical analysis of regulations, which is important to
   meet the requirements of legal engineering. As a result of the work
   carried out, the authors suggest that, on the one hand, it is important
   to aim at the standardization of the principles of law as accurately and
   accurately as possible in legislation. On the other hand, they assume
   that principles that are already assured in legislation but have not yet
   been recognized by the scientific community must also obtain an
   assessment and justified characteristics in the doctrine. They conclude
   that, from a technical-legal point of view, a principle of law that is
   not scientifically recognized does not disappear from the legal
   framework if it is institutionalized as such in effective legislation.
   On the contrary, essentially new principles enshrined in legislation
   should not be ignored by legal science.},

Abstract = {The article aims to discuss the organization of municipal campaigns, the
   selection of candidates and dialogue between directories to define
   strategies. We analyzed the uses of the media, the expansion of the
   parties' physical structure, and the number of people involved in paid
   and voluntary activities in the electoral period. We selected the PCdoB
   and PSDB campaigns in 2016 from Santos. We examined financial dynamics
   and conducted interviews with party leaders. The data were discussed in
   order to obtain the vision of the leaders. We concluded that campaigns
   mix modern and traditional practices, that technical support is
   essential, but that financial support is limited, and that volunteers
   are essential to carry out certain campaign activities, also to finance
   them.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of terrorism on voting behavior in the
   United States. We rely on an exhaustive list of terror attacks over the
   period 1970-2016 and exploit the inherent randomness of the success or
   failure of terror attacks to identify the political impacts of
   terrorism. We first confirm that the success of terror attacks is
   plausibly random by showing that it is orthogonal to potential
   confounders. We then show that on average successful attacks have no
   effect on presidential and non-presidential elections. As a benchmark,
   we also rely on a more naive identification strategy using all the
   counties not targeted by terrorists as a comparison group. We show that
   using this naive identification strategy leads to strikingly different
   results overestimating the effect of terror attacks on voting behavior.
   Overall, our results indicate that terrorism has less of an influence on
   voters than is usually thought.},

Abstract = {The European Semester (Semester) was implemented a decade ago. Ample
   research has addressed the Semester's development, including some major
   changes in processes and content (Verdun \& Zeitlin, 2018). The Covid-19
   crisis seems to mark the next stage in the evolution of the Semester. It
   connects the Semester with the wider Recovery and Resilience Facility
   (RRF) and links its country-specific recommendations to conditional
   financial support. Thus, the next stage of the Semester suggests a
   stronger and more deliberate interlinkage of different EU tools that
   jointly guide national socioeconomic policies. It should support both
   national public investment and reforms while focusing on meeting the EU
   priority of moving towards a climate-neutral, digitalized, and resilient
   Europe (De la Porte \& Dagnis Jensen, 2021). This article addresses the
   question of what room the new-style Semester gives to the involvement of
   national-level actors, such as national parliaments. Therefore, it
   expands existing analytical frameworks in order to assess the RRF in
   connection to the Semester, focusing on the degree of obligation,
   enforcement, and centralisation. Jointly, this outlines the room the RRF
   gives to the participation of national actors in the Semester. The
   article concludes that although the national parliaments are not
   mentioned in the Regulation establishing the RRF, they could claim a
   role both in developing national plans for accessing financial support
   as well as in amending and approving reforms.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},
Pages = {354-366},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Common political economy models point to rationalist motives for
   engaging in conflict but say little about how income shocks translate
   into collective violence in some cases but not in others. Grievance
   models, in contrast, focus on structural origins of shared frustration
   but offer less insight into when the deprived decide to challenge the
   status quo. Addressing these lacunae, we develop a theoretical model of
   civil conflict that predicts income loss to trigger violent mobilization
   primarily when the shock can be linked to preexisting collective
   grievances. The conditional argument is supported by results of a
   comprehensive global statistical analysis of conflict involvement among
   ethnic groups. Consistent with theory, we find that this relationship is
   most powerful among recently downgraded groups, especially in the
   context of agricultural dependence and low local level of development,
   whereas political downgrading in the absence of adverse economic changes
   exerts less influence on ethnic conflict risk.},

Abstract = {Beginning in December 2019 and still ongoing, the world's science,
   culture, and politics began to produce previously unimaginable daily
   quantities of data to understand the nature of covid-19 and its effects
   on our lives. These collective efforts represent a change in the quality
   and quantity of what it is being produced and published. This allows us
   to observe the covid-19 shock based on a variety of clinical, social,
   and economic data published with unthinkable speed. The objective of
   this article is to understand the relationship between information and
   political science in the current context, describe the agendas generated
   by the covid-19 crisis, and discuss how professional demands promise to
   accelerate new forms of collaboration in political science, the
   collaboration with other disciplines, as well as the inequalities that
   this change generates.},

Abstract = {This article concerns itself with why and how activists persevere and
   manage to reproduce themselves as activists in contexts where they
   experience what is described as routine ``failure{''}, taking Lebanon's

   out when Lebanon's civil society was dominated by members of the
   country's cosmopolitan professional middle class, I emphasise the
   affective dimensions of activism, the role that personal desires,
   emotions and anxieties play in enabling activists to persist in the most
   stagnant of conjunctures but that also, at the same time, keep them from
   advancing their agendas.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This article examines how protesters produce new tactics by focusing
   specifically on Hirak Al-Rif, a protest movement which took place in
   Morocco in 2016-2017. Drawing on several sources (e.g. semi-structured
   interviews, non-participant observations, live-streamed Facebook videos,
   and digital traces), the article shows how new tactics can derive from
   routine activities and, by focusing on the role of newcomers, suggests
   to go beyond a strictly top-down model of mobilisations. Newcomers
   relied on everyday routines at the neighbourhood level and amplified the
   dynamic of protests in a way that went beyond the initial expectations
   of core activists. Tactical innovations can thus be fostered through
   pressures and reappropriations enacted ``from below{''}, which bind core
   activists to the wider base of the movement through moral obligations.
   Biographical experiences, prior bonds, and the individuals' positions in
   the mobilisation networks also prove to be relevant matters in the
   plural and contingent making of tactical innovations.},

Abstract = {When do well-intended regulatory regimes have unintended consequences?
   We examine one obstacle to successful regulation, ``regulatory
   leakage,{''} in the context of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention (ABC).
   Leakage occurs when regulated behavior decreases for actors under a
   regime's jurisdiction, but increases among those outside of it. We
   analyze a formal model that demonstrates how the ABC may simultaneously
   reduce bribery among firms from member countries, while increasing
   bribery by firms from non-ABC member countries. We also show how the ABC
   may lead firms from ABC member countries to shift to bribery through
   intermediaries. New empirical evidence of MNC activity in Vietnam shows
   evidence of both regulatory leakage and bribery through intermediaries.},

Abstract = {Reversing course from a long tradition of studying racial antipathy, I
   argue that racial sympathy, defined as white distress over black
   misfortune, shapes public opinion among a nontrivial subset of white
   Americans. Using an original measure-the racial sympathy index-I find
   that sympathy motivates support for policies perceived to benefit, as
   well as opposition to policies perceived to harm, African Americans.
   Racial sympathy is distinct from a more general sympathy, as it does not
   shape opinion related to other groups. The concept is foremost a racial
   attitude; as evidence of this, I find that sympathy is activated when a
   policy draws attention to its black beneficiaries. In probing this
   effect, I find that even exposure to negative stereotypes of blacks does
   not extinguish the influence of sympathy. The consistent results across
   multiple national studies suggest that racial sympathy represents a
   distinct dimension of American racial attitudes.},

   belonging in a Swiss border municipality},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},
Number = {136},
Pages = {55-81},
Abstract = {Can living near a national border have an effect on the politicization
   of individuals? To answer this question, this article challenges the
   results put forward by some European Border Studies scholars granting
   the border a major role in the construction of political behavior. Based
   on a fieldwork carried in a border commune in the canton of Geneva, it
   shows how the effects of the border context vary according to
   residential trajectories and the role individuals play in local
   struggles. It suggests that the border provides a medium for
   politicisation and concludes that the border is not a spatial
   determinant but one of the ``localized mediations{''} contributing to
   the construction of political attitudes and practices.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the issue of public security in Mexico during the
   first half of the Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador administration. The main
   elements of the strategy in this area of the government of the so-called
   ``Cuarta Transformacion{''} (4T) and its results are explained here. The
   state of organized crime in the country during this period is also
   described. Finally, areas of opportunity and potential action are
   identified for the remaining three years of the administration's term.
   Although some advances in public security have to be acknowledged, I
   nonetheless conclude that the overall results are unsatisfactory.},

Title = {Constructions of Whiteness in French Expatriation in Abu Dhabi: from
   distinctive progressivism to conservative differentialism},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},
Number = {136},
Pages = {83-102},
Abstract = {This article explores how the claim of progressivism serves racialized
   distinction. Taking the case of the constitution of the French
   ``expatriate{''} group in Abu Dhabi, the article examines how these
   progressive discourses combine with seemingly competing conservative
   registers, close to the types of discourses and worldviews described by
   analysts of the far right. In particular, it shows how the experience of
   migration allows for the coexistence of these two discourses, without
   confusing them. In the first section, the article analyzes how the
   expatriate experience fosters modes of racialized distinction played out
   on the terrain of political progressivism: this distinctive investment
   of progressivism, far from being limited to the question of gender and
   sexuality, aggregates different political objects and more generally
   constructs the cultural capacity for democracy as a symbolic boundary
   between social groups. In a second section, the article shows that the
   context of Abu Dhabi favors a mode of distinction that mobilizes
   discursive registers traditionally associated with conservatism, such as
   order and the preservation of national identity from miscegenation. In
   the third part, the article questions the articulation of these two
   seemingly competing registers in the transnational theater shaped by
   migration.},

Abstract = {Whether in their standoff with the Bureau of Land Management or their
   takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Cliven, Ammon, and
   Ryan Bundy frequently pledge fidelity to and express reverence for the
   Constitution. This article examines the Bundys' constitutional
   philosophy as an example of ``radical constitutional
   libertarianism{''}-an ideology that simultaneously seeks the
   displacement of the basic procedural norms of the political order and
   speaks in the name of the most traditional substantive values of that
   order. More specifically, I attempt to excavate the Bundys' views on
   each of three core ideational pillars (sovereignty, property, liberty)
   and to sketch how they interact to produce a composite vision in sharp
   contrast to established understandings of American constitutionalism. In
   so doing, I illustrate how the Bundys translate the Constitution for-and
   apply the Constitution to the daily lives of-ordinary citizens to shape
   the boundary conditions of contemporary American political culture.},

Abstract = {This article considers the ideational and political contexts in which
   Project 5-100, the Russian excellence in higher education initiative
   emerged, as well as the specificities of its organisational and
   behavioural model. While Project 5-100 has been studied in the academic
   literature as regards its efficiency and how it affected the performance
   and inner workings of the participating universities, the question of
   how the project came about and the characteristic traits of its internal
   set-up still remain largely overlooked. The study focuses on the
   involvement of local and international players, arguing that their
   successful and organic cooperation influenced both the architecture and
   the implementation of the project. This paper contributes to the
   literature on policy networks by showing that transnational actors do
   not necessarily undermine or challenge state power and can on the
   contrary help governments implement systemic change. Inspired by the
   international experience of establishing world-class universities,
   Project 5-100 was conceived and lobbied by a small but influential group
   of visionaries pushing for change who - acting in a concerted and
   purposive manner - acquired a novel and powerful capacity to use
   international expertise for the development of a key national project,
   capable of deeply transforming the country's higher educational system.},

Abstract = {From a documentary-based methodology, the article examines the existing
   aspects of the state policy of transformation of the space that forms
   potentialities in the context of intensification of regional
   development. The framework for the formation of an institutional
   environment to ensure the space for the formation of potential,
   includes: legislative basis; institutional and legal support for regions
   to gain importance in the global market. In addition, the existing
   shortcomings of the State policy of transformation of the space that
   forms potentialities in the context of intensification of regional
   development are highlighted, which are characterized by: imperfection of
   the legislative basis of regional development; unstable relations
   between different levels of government; disregard for threats and risks
   in the formation of priority tasks and regional development goals; the
   practice of not having to implement strategic plans and regional
   development tasks, etc. It is concluded that the existing state policy
   on the subject that can influence regional development requires
   improvements, these improvements will further help to increase the
   efficiency of management decisions and bring to their full completion
   the reforms initiated in the direction of political and administrative
   decentralization in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Action against disinformation has become more important than ever in the
   context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is due to the synchronous global
   scale of the problem and its potentially deadlier consequences as the
   public seeks out guidance regarding what they might do to lower the risk
   of infection. This article investigates the impact of the Covid-19
   crisis on the regulation of social media platforms as it is mediated by
   the legacy of previous responses to disinformation. It shows that the
   Covid-19 crisis has catalyzed the shift to co-regulatory approaches that
   imposed reporting obligations on platforms at the European level. It
   also raises concerns about the implementation of the new European
   regulatory package that will largely depend on the initiatives of
   individual Member States such as Italy, where the low level of societal
   resilience to disinformation increases the incentives for political
   leaders to ignore the problem of disinformation.},

Abstract = {Unione Femminile (1901-1905) was one of the most important women's
   political magazines of the early twentieth century. It was created to
   give visibility to the Italian and international women's movements and,
   in particular, to the activities promoted since 1899 by the association
   of the same name. Offering its female readers insights into the status
   of women in different countries and accurate and useful reports on the
   initiatives of the women's movement around the world, the magazine set
   out to show its readers what was happening beyond national borders and
   offer ideas for social and political work which could be undertaken in
   Italy. Through the examination of the most important foreign magazines
   and lively correspondence with women from different countries, the
   members of the Unione Femminile editorial staff disseminated news about
   progress in female associations, women's professional achievements,
   education for women and women's campaigns for universal suffrage. The
   examination of this precious documentary heritage allows us, therefore,
   to shed new light on this period of history, and on the richness and
   plurality of the international networks created by women.},

Abstract = {Informal institutions govern property rights and disputes when formal
   systems are weak. Effective informal institutions should help people
   reach and maintain bargains, minimizing violence. Can outside
   organizations engineer persistent institutional change? Will this
   strengthen property rights and investment? We experimentally evaluate a
   United Nations and civil society mass education campaign to promote
   alternative dispute resolution practices and norms in rural Liberia,
   where violent land disputes are common. Prior work showed a drop in
   violence and unresolved disputes within one year. We return after three
   years to test for sustained impacts and mechanisms. Treated communities
   report large, persistent drops in violent disputes and a slight shift
   toward nonviolent norms. Treated residents also report larger farms,
   although overall effects on property rights and investment are mixed.
   Politically connected residents report more secure property rights,
   while those with fewer connections feel less secure. Sustained
   institutional engineering is feasible, but politics shapes
   distributional outcomes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is first, to trace the development of the
   Icelandic legislation on names; second to analyze the nationalism behind
   the legislation and third to contextualize this debate in a wider
   discourse within political philosophy about the relationship between
   culture and freedom. The purpose of the first legislation on names in
   1913 was to secure standardization, but in 1925 a new legislation was
   passed with the explicit aim to defend Icelandic names, Icelandic
   surnames, and the Icelandic language. The rationale behind the
   legislation was infused with nationalism which emphasized cultural
   continuity and the importance of unspoiled culture and language for
   national independence. The most important criticism of the law concerned
   its infringement on individual freedom and later that the conservation
   of the Icelandic language and Icelandic names generally were separate
   aims. When names and surnames are cut off from the preservation of the
   language and nationality, their conservation as separate cultural
   heritage becomes an option. The Icelandic discourse is related to
   philosophical discourses that emphasize authentic and unique national
   cultures, which the state can or should support. These ideas are tied to
   freedom in various ways, like the importance of belonging to a culture
   or that different cultures are prerequisites of freedom and different
   ways of life. Critical voices are related to ideas about individual
   autonomy, which emphasize individual choice and state neutrality on
   cultural issues. It is difficult to resolve the tension between these
   two traditions since the question is about opposing values.},

Abstract = {In July 2021, the Kremlin published an essay ``On the Historical Unity
   of Russians and Ukrainians{''}. Its authorship is attributed to Vladimir
   Putin. This lends the text special weight. In terms of historiography,
   it builds on the Great Russian and Soviet interpretation of the history
   of Russia and Ukraine. Politically, it provides insights into Putin's
   thinking: a jumble of Soviet patriotism, imperial and Russian
   ethno-nationalism, and revisionist thinking. For Putin, Ukraine is an
   ``anti -Russia{''}, behind which lies a Western conspiracy. Ethnic
   Russians in Ukraine are said to be threatened by a ``violent
   assimilation{''} comparable to the ``use of weapons of mass
   destruction{''}. The essay provides documentation for the thesis that
   Russia's state leadership has yet to accept Ukrainians as a separate
   nation with an independent state. Putin's threats should be taken
   seriously.},

Abstract = {The birth of a person is one of the unforgettable events in the life of
   each family, full of vivid emotions. From this moment on, parents assume
   new roles, containing moral and legal obligations in relation to the
   newborn. In this case, it is not important if the child's parents are
   legal or really married. Based on the analysis of the current family
   legislation of the Russian Federation and the theoretical provisions
   devoted to the legal regulation of the establishment of the origin of
   children, the article examines the mechanism of the emergence of
   parental legal relations, as well as a set of problems associated with
   their evaluation, interpretation, and application. The problems of legal
   regulation in the field of determining the origin of children, the
   prospects for the development of legislation in this area of
   relationships, are identified. The general methodological basis was
   formed by the scientific method, which allowed to consider the problems
   of the development of family legislation in the legal regulation to
   establish the origin of children in the Russian Federation. The article
   presents the opinions of the authors and analyses the theoretical
   research of scientists in this area},

   the practice of the European Court of Human Rights ECTHR. The theme of
   the study is the social relations that arise in the exercise of the
   right to freedom of movement and personal integrity in the COVID-19
   pandemic. Research methods are the dialectical method, the method of
   system analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, modeling, comparison,
   generalization, and formalization. As a result of the study, the
   problems of the realization of the right to freedom of movement and
   personal inviolability in COVID-19 were analyzed through the prism of
   ECtHR decisions. The international experience of regulating the right to
   circular under quarantine conditions was clarified and suggested ways to
   solve this problem to protect human dignity.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify possible ways to protect the rights
   of people who have lost their jobs due to the spread of Ed COVID-19, and
   thus to analyze the effectiveness of international experience. The
   information in this article is obtained by three Maria methods: direct
   observation, comparison, and analysis of the content of the documents.
   However, at the beginning of the pandemic, the regulation of guarantees
   and social protection of the rights ReCuestatvof dismissed people was
   not enough. In the future, job seekers must learn the skills of lddeitu
   DrHumter the most popular professions and specialties: in the field of
   healthcare, loiomc in the field of digital technology and
   transportation. In turn, government programs should promote the
   reconversion of the most vulnerable groups in the labor market through
   free courses and online learning programs, and assistance in the
   employment of people with disabilities. It is concluded that, during the
   pandemic, most countries modified their labor regulations and provided
   labor subsidies to preserve jobs. However, during recovery after the
   pandemic, governments in all countries must change their approach.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {58-75},
Abstract = {The paper addresses the rise of civilisations through economic
   complexes. Four economic bases to an urban-industrial civilisation are
   discussed: market society, industrialism, capitalism and socialism. The
   assumptions of `classic liberalism' are shown to have affinities with
   `classic Marxism': secularism, rationalism, humanism and freedom. Both
   schools of thought envisaged the Enlightenment as a movement leading to
   a universal civilisation. Theories of `industrial society' are
   postulated as creating a modern civilisation which takes a global form.
   In this context, the economic basis of a universal civilisation is
   confronted by alternative forms of capitalism. Liberal and socialist
   forms of industrial and post-industrial societies claim to be separate
   forms of civilisation. The paper maintains that conflicts between
   different `varieties of capitalism' do not constitute `clashes between
   civilisations' but represent divergent geo-political interests. It is
   contended that the state socialist societies presented a different
   civilisational type of industrial society.},

Volume = {97},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {In contrast to the representatives of other directions in International
   Relations Science, constructivists have long distanced themselves from
   the notion of power, but in the 2000s and 2010s, due to the increasing
   interest in conceptualizing this phenomenon, the first attempts of the
   constructivist interpretation of the concept of power started to emerge.
   Such interpretations received their fullest expression in the concept of
   Protean power, developed by a group of researchers under the informal
   leadership of Peter Katzenstein.
   The article analyzes the main features of the Protean power, as well as
   the emerging practices. The author shows that this type of power is less
   associated with specific actors and their intentions than other types of
   power, since it is aimed at overcoming uncertainty under the conditions
   when it is impossible to calculate risks. This formulation of the
   question allows one to reconsider the role of the creativity principle
   in international interactions and provide it with a higher ontological
   status.
   According to the author's conclusion, the concept of Protean power
   continues the line of revising the ontological foundations of the
   studies of world politics, which has emerged within constructivism in
   the last decade. Similarly to some other constructivist concepts, this
   concept implies a holistic interpretation of the phenomenon of power in
   international relations and reflects the desire to move away from the
   classical (Newtonian) worldview. Although today it provides many reasons
   for criticism and, perhaps, needs further elaboration and
   reinterpretation, its contribution to the scientific discussion of the
   ontology of power in international interactions is beyond doubt. Protean
   power is paving the way that allows bypassing the neo-positivist
   consensus that has so far set the tone in the International Relations
   Science.},

Abstract = {Contrary to stylized accounts of policy making in democracies, it is
   routine for presidents, governors, and other chief executives to issue
   directives such as decrees and executive orders to make law on their
   own. This article evaluates what political scientists have learned about
   presidential unilateral power. In our view, while a quarter century of
   scholarship on the topic has yielded a variety of theoretical
   predictions, the empirical record offers conflicting and perhaps
   unreliable evidence to substantiate and adjudicate between them. We
   review the dominant theoretical perspectives, which focus largely on
   constraints related to the separation of powers and political
   accountability. We then evaluate the evidence supporting these arguments
   and conclude with recommendations for conceptual, theoretical, and
   empirical advancement.},

Abstract = {This article explores factors that affect the strength of beliefs in
   COVID-19 conspiracy theories drawing on data collected in an online
   survey of undergraduate and graduate students from Romanian
   universities. The results indicate that students with lower
   socio-economic status, lower levels of news consumption in the wake of
   the COVID-19 crisis, who rely primarily on information from television
   and discussions to their peers, as well as those with lower levels of
   education/analytical skills are more susceptible to endorsing conspiracy
   theories regarding the origin and the nature of COVID-19. Education,
   analytical skills, and exposure to high quality media information appear
   to equip students with the necessary tools to critically assess
   COVID-19-related conspiracies. Given the link between conspiracy belief
   and health behaviors in the context of the pandemic, these results point
   to the importance of analytical skills and media regulation for curbing
   misinformation in societal contexts of heightened uncertainty,
   confusion, and existential threat.},

   and liberals closer together. The distinguishing feature of the Russian
   liberalism is its late, or ``catch up{''}, development. In the 19th
   century, liberalism no longer needed a religious approval; the appeal to
   the Holy Scriptures looked archaic. Another Russian distinguishing
   feature - divergence of secular and spiritual traditions - is also very
   important. After the emergence of the dualistic monarchy in Russia
   (1906-1917), religious topics were no longer a taboo, but Christian
   liberalism as an influential trend failed to develop. The attempts of
   combining liberal and Christian ideas in the pre-revolutionary Russian
   politics faced a number of problems. The results in practice were modest
   either due to the lack of the electoral demand, or due to the blocking
   of specific initiatives at the state and church levels. The promotion of
   liberal values contradicted Orthodox tenets, and the target electoral
   group - the lower clergy - heavily depended on the episcopate. In the
   post-Soviet Russia, in contrast to the countries in Central Europe,
   Christian politics, including its liberal version, did not revive. At
   the end of the day, all such projects have remained marginal. The
   episcopate focuses on cooperation with the authorities, and there is
   little support for liberal ideas among the faithful. The future might
   see a gradual strengthening of liberal tendencies within the church, but
   at the same time, the Russian version of Christian democracy remains
   extremely unlikely.},

Abstract = {Recent research asserts that coalitions of party leaders, interest
   groups, and activists will cooperate to support the nomination of
   mutually acceptable candidates in primary elections. In this article, I
   utilize an original data set containing FEC contributions and
   expenditures data for 1648 candidates who ran in open seat primary
   elections for the US House from 2006 to 2016 to measure the extent and
   effects of coordination among interest groups and party organizations. I
   find that Democratic-aligned interest groups and party leaders
   coordinate more often and with a more positive substantive effect than
   their Republican counterparts. Moreover, I provide evidence that, with
   the advent of super PACs in the second half of the 2010 primary cycle, a
   small number of interest groups can act as a latent threat to broader
   coalitions that unite behind a candidate using independent expenditures
   to outspend the broader coalitions. This increased resource parity has
   tangible representational consequences.},

Pages = {44-61},
Abstract = {The gradual rapprochement between peoples, cultures, beliefs involve
   numerous conflicts with indigenous peoples on ethnic or religious
   grounds. These conflicts tend to turn into articulation of radical
   positions and extremist activities. The aim of this study was to analyze
   the current state of terrorist acts and identify the determinants of
   terrorism on racial and religious grounds in Western Europe. The
   statistical method, comparison, graphic analysis, analysis of the Global
   Index of Terrorism; The European Union reports on the situation and
   trends of terrorism, as well as the research on terrorism-related issues
   for 2011-2021, were used as empirical research methods. It is determined
   that the UK, France, Germany, Greece, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Sweden
   are subject to the highest risk of terrorist acts. It was proved that
   the determinants of terrorism are localized in relation to key issues
   related to the state of the economic sphere, social development, as well
   as the spiritual and cultural sphere. Emphasis is placed on the need to
   overcome the problems associated with terrorist activities by
   formulating a policy of national means of resolving ethnic and racial
   issues and active international cooperation. Further research will
   identify key determinants of terrorism in Eastern Europe.},

   Narcissism and Right-Populist Party Support},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {248-259},
Abstract = {Even though previous research connected personality traits and support
   for radical-right populist parties (RRP), the question of which
   mechanisms connect these concepts is still underexplored. In particular,
   we focus on narcissistic rivalry, a maladaptive path of grandiose
   narcissism. Drawing on the affective intelligence framework and the
   narcissistic admiration and rivalry concept, we propose that the effect
   of rival narcissism on vote choice for the German Alternative fur
   Deutschland is mediated by reactionary political orientations and
   activated by anger. Drawing on 2017 data from the mixed-mode
   representative GESIS panel (N = 2,552 \& 1,901), we employ moderated
   mediation analyses. We show that reactionary political orientations
   mediate the relationship between narcissistic rivalry and RRP support.
   However, high levels of generalised anger are needed to activate the
   relationship between personality, reactionary values, and RRP support,
   whereas the mediating role of anti-immigrant sentiment is not affected
   by anger. Our study emphasises the role of anger in RRP support, thus
   showing that anger might explain why only some people with a specific
   predisposition support RRPs. The study also stresses the complexity of
   the relationship between personality, value orientations, and political
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {The Colombian National Army has the premise of supporting the civil
   authority in the exercise of government as part of its military
   operations. Therefore, it is imminent to highlight the support duties to
   the defense of the civil authority (ADAC) as a military action inherent
   to the constitutional mission imposed. In this sense, the territorial
   authorities must make use of this legitimate tool granted by the
   Constitution and the laws at all levels for the maintenance of public
   order. Such tool has been coordinated and synchronized in a unity of
   effort to achieve a common goal, which, in this case, is the containment
   of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of military forces is not exclusive to
   the state of war or internal disturbance; accordingly, it is a
   multiplier of capacities in any state of emergency legitimately decreed
   by the Executive, such is the case of the current situation in which the
   role of the military forces contributes significantly to the social
   discipline that is required in the midst of the measures of sanitary
   distancing.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the 2017 UK General Election from the perspective
   of the campaign and results in Wales, a nation which had the most
   interesting election campaign of all the different nations. The election
   saw a stark contrast between the way the two principal UK-wide parties
   fought their campaigns and how the campaign impacted on results. Drawing
   on data from a post-election survey conducted in June 2017, we consider
   factors that shape voter choice, which affected the outcome of the
   election in Wales. We argue that the election internalised and reflected
   a new pattern of party politics that is likely to stimulate differential
   election outcomes across the UK; this requires a different approach to
   understanding election campaigns, one that differentiates between the
   nations and how every political party operates in each territory. This
   will help distinguish different political and electoral fault lines, as
   well as constructing a more granular analysis of the campaign's impact
   on electoral outcomes. We conclude first that, to better and more
   comprehensively explain UK-wide elections, there is a need to provide
   distinctive national and regional analyses, and secondly, it is mistaken
   to assume that the same electoral patterns will always exist in Wales as
   in England.},

Title = {Mitigating Pro-Poor Housing Failures: Access Theory and the Politics of
   Urban Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {439-450},
Abstract = {Looking at evolving urban governance and planning practices in the city
   of Lahore, Pakistan, the article aims to understand-from an Evolutionary
   Governance Theory perspective-to what extent these practices steer paths
   and modes of service provision and housing for low-income residents.
   With a focus on the endurance and transformations of urban governance
   practices and institutions, we first explore the influence of the
   changing development discourse and the impact it has had on the
   (re)configuration of urban governance and housing policies in Lahore.
   Second, drawing on extensive fieldwork and empirical data collected
   between 2012 and 2016, we highlight three vignettes depicting the
   development of different housing options for low-income residents in
   Lahore, i.e., a government-steered subsidised housing scheme, a
   privately developed `pro-poor' settlement in the peri-urban fringe of
   the city, and residential colonies already-or in the process of
   being-regularised. By analysing the relationship between governance
   frameworks, the establishment of the three types of settlements and how
   residents manage to access housing and services there, we demonstrate
   how purposive deregulation in governance and policy generates a
   disconnect between urban normative frameworks (i.e., urban planning
   tools and pro-poor housing policies) and residents' needs and everyday
   practices. We argue that this highly political process is not
   exclusively path-dependent but has also allowed the creation of liminal
   spaces based on agency and collective action strategies of low-income
   residents.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to reveal the experience in the legal
   regulation of international collaboration in the police and further
   define opportunities to use this experience in Ukraine. The need to
   study the successful experience of administrative and legal regulation
   of international police cooperation, is emphasized in order to determine
   the possibility of using this experience proactively, and developing
   ways to improve the quality of administrative and legal regulation of
   international police cooperation in Ukraine. Materials and methods based
   on the analysis of documentary sources were used. It is concluded that
   the main advantages of administrative and legal regulation of
   international police cooperation in the investigated countries, should
   be taken into account to improve the mechanism of administrative and
   legal regulation of international cooperation in the National Police of
   Ukraine, with respect to implementing better and more effective
   provisions of its activities, which includes: introduction of special
   international training programs, retraining, advanced training
   (internship) of police personnel for the creation of an institute for
   international cooperation in various spheres of its activity.},

Title = {CIVILIZATION AS A PROCESS: MULTIPLIED SUBJECTS OF POSTMODERNITY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {5},
Pages = {39-55},
Abstract = {The article is devoted several aspects emerging in the current transit
   of civilization - the genesis, the problems, and the prospects regarding
   the development of trans-border innovative enterprises (anthropo-social
   structures - ASS). Attention is drawn to their growth in number,
   multiplication, diversity, high adaptability, other specific qualities,
   and competitive advantages. Civilization is a dynamic concept, a social
   analogue of evolution, and these ambitious enterprises are subjects of
   historical competition. Globalization, which expands space for
   operations and range of communications, is accompanied by the
   individuation of a significant number of ambitious persons
   (manterprisers) vs. mass society and inclusive atomization. Crises of
   modern political structures and the spread of social, technical, and
   anthropological complexities, as well as the creation of innovative
   virtual ``cloud structures{''} etc, disrupt the existing balance of
   power and distort the modern world order. Forecast technics, based on a
   transdisciplinary approach, global dimensions, and a long-term
   perspective, are elaborated to predict the future, yet they are not very
   effective. Methodology for complex systems/operations analysis replaces
   long-term calculations with nonlinear dynamics, global generalizations
   with fractality evaluations, and disciplinary approach with attention to
   breakthrough situations. Deep education is a fusion of core motivation
   (mission) with the purposes of action (vision), knowledge with
   exploration, and personal growth. Socially motivated enterprises form
   ASS-ensembles, which tend to generate a universal Postmodern
   infrastructure upon the pillars of Modernity. The article also presents
   typology of social evolution strategies and provides historical examples
   of their implementation, which vary significantly, depending on the
   intentions of the main actor of a strategy. New forms of conflict and
   political alliances emerge. The fight for the future is an asymmetrical
   co-evolution of entities with interests that are not quite matching yet
   not quite opposites. In times of crises, competition escalates: someone
   wins, someone loses, someone goes to the dustbin of history. The search
   for evolutionary strategy, methods of cognition and technologies of
   action effective in the hybrid environment of civilizational transit, is
   on the agenda.},

Abstract = {As part of this study, the goal is set to assess the impact of sanctions
   imposed by the United States and the European Union on the economy and
   financial sector of Russia, to identify the effectiveness of the initial
   goals of these countries. To achieve the goal, the legal acts concerning
   the imposed sanctions of the USA and the European Union against Russia
   were first analyzed, a chronology of events was described, and sanctions
   were classified. Further, based on the data of the World Bank and the
   Federal State Statistics Service of the Russian Federation, the results
   of the sanction pressure on the Russian economy and financial sector
   were estimated. Then the results of this study were compared with the
   results obtained by other scholars. The paper concluded that the
   sanctions of the United States and the European Union did have an impact
   on the economy and financial sector of Russia, but this influence was
   not as significant as the leaders of these countries expected. In
   addition, the impact of the sanctions is gradually decreasing despite
   the introduction of new sanctions on various pretexts.},

Title = {Grounding urban governance on housing affordability: a conceptual
   framework for policy analysis. Insights from Vienna},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {848-869},
Abstract = {Growing and attractive cities, such as Vienna, globally face housing
   crises. Urban land rent (inflated by the huge housing demand in
   attractive areas and the consequent housing shortage) is transferred to
   housing prices and results in increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible
   cities. Housing affordability is a critical factor for enjoying the use
   value of housing and the broader set of values associated with cities.
   To assure urban agglomerations' inclusiveness and spatial justice, urban
   governance should be ``grounded{''} on affordability by redistributing
   land rent and keeping housing prices hooked on income levels. However,
   the relation between urban land rent and housing affordability is rarely
   connected in Housing studies. Furthermore, it is often neglected by
   urban governors, generally competing to increase housing prices and
   attract investments. This article contributes to fill this
   policy/research gap and offers new conceptual avenues for the analysis
   of urban housing affordability governance. A theoretical basis and a
   coherent analytical framework for policy analysis are empirically
   applied in a case study of the city of Vienna, focusing on affordable
   rental housing. Based on peculiarities-of history, political stability,
   and a solid welfare system-the Viennese case offers relevant insights
   for disentangling the complex network of policies and institutions that
   ground urban growth on affordability.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the annual issues of the weekly magazine L'Alleanza,
   which was founded in Pavia by Carmela Baricelli, a teacher from Cremona,
   whose aim was to use the magazine to promote a gender alliance among
   women, beyond different political parties. Thanks to her resourcefulness
   and self-initiative, the magazine lasted longer than other similar
   publications of the time, achieving a good national circulation, as it
   officially put itself forward as a ``liaison body{''} for the various
   pro-suffrage committees. As this research points out, L'Alleanza was not
   only an important forum on which women could discuss the emerging
   emancipationist issues of the time, but also a training and
   self-education tool for its readers who, in many cases, wrote articles,
   short news items and stories, at the same time learning rules and
   procedures for participating in congresses and assemblies. The pages of
   the journal reveal how an entire generation of women dealt with the
   broad spectrum of themes associated with the ``Feminist issue{''}: not
   only the leading figures of the time (Maria Montessori, Teresa Labriola,
   Emilia Mariani and others), but also those less well known, about whom
   we have very little biographical information, but who nevertheless made
   a fundamental contribution to the debate generated in the journal.},

Abstract = {This comparative case analysis focuses on the approaches of the Czech
   and Slovak governments to Russian disinformation activities, with
   particular attention to the securitization of the threat. The paper
   argues that the extent of energy relations with Russia plays an
   important role in the securitization of the threat posed by the said
   state. It employs a rational model of policy-making to better understand
   the rationale for the decisions of the actors leading to the different
   approaches taken by the governments of the examined states. The analysis
   shows that while the Czech approach seems to be driven mostly by
   security interests, in Slovakia, the economic goals are of primary
   importance, with the primary factor being the importance of energy
   relations with Russia. The Czech approach is considered as an
   appropriate one in this paper, as it allows for more objective threat
   assessment and consequently better preparedness and resilience, whereas
   a rather pragmatic approach of Slovakia leads to increasing
   vulnerability of disinformation activities.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {3},
Pages = {57-76},
Abstract = {The article suggests that the contemporary mode of interactions between
   leading global and regional actors is not transitional, but sustainable,
   thus constituting the world order for the near future. Providing a
   theoretical context, the article claims that over the last thirty years
   neoliberal and neorealist schools of thought have prevailingly focused
   on verifying their pre-established explanatory models with post-Cold War
   examples, rather than studying these realities as such. This article is
   based on the assumption that tremendous developments have occurred in
   this period. The new set of global and regional actors can be taken for
   the new, multipolar hardware of the global system; its software is
   shaped by new structural realities, within which actors operate. These
   are conceptualized as the mismatch between material globalization and
   the decline of ideational universalism: the latter determines conflict
   while the former limits escalation. The article outlines the mode of
   competition within these structural realities, i.e., indirect coercion.
   This mode makes neoliberal institutional world order unfeasible;
   however, within this mode it also becomes virtually impossible to strike
   a balance of power as is so central to the neorealist theory. Within the
   terms of the game theory, interactions between leading actors fit
   neither win/win nor win/lose scenarios. The article conceptualizes great
   power interactions as lose/not-lose competition and not-lose/not-lose
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {While there is an increasing body of research on the individual
   predispositions affecting conspiracy beliefs, little research has to
   date analysed potential effects on the context level. In this research
   note, we develop the argument that socialization and communication
   factors on the context level may directly affect aggregate levels of
   generic conspiracy beliefs. Second, we analyse whether these context
   level factors also interact with specific characteristics of the
   conspiracy theory - in our case, the actors involved in the CT. Running
   survey experiments in Germany, Poland, and Jordan (total N = 4,113), we
   find evidence for aggregate level differences between countries and for
   interactions between country-specific heuristics and characteristics of
   the CT. These findings are in line with expectations based on context
   level socialization and communication mechanisms. In closing, we discuss
   remaining limitations and outline promising avenues for future research.},

Title = {RETHINKING DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIAL SCIENCES: ON THE THRESHOLD OF AN
   ETHICAL TURN},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {2},
Pages = {25-45},
Abstract = {The shift to a new technological paradigm, alongside deep changes in
   mass perceptions and in cultural norms in societies confronting
   challenges to their security, is triggering radical social and political
   transformations. Researchers in the social sciences face a difficult
   dilemma: to use terms and categories that belong to a social time that
   is over, or to try and turn this page over to assess the ontological
   meanings of the transformations we are experiencing at a pace and in a
   space that are beyond our current vision. This latter choice would imply
   rethinking the meanings of development, politics of development, and
   political development, along with further categories used to describe
   social change such as nationalism, divided societies, or identity
   politics (to name but a few). The author proposes reconsidering
   development when seen as a primarily economic benchmark and instead to
   regard related policies as applicable to any society regardless of its
   economic and political standing. Political agency is considered to be
   the key to understanding political development and its dimensions. The
   state as a complex system of institutionalized social relations and
   political networks is at the heart of these changes: in times of crisis,
   the need to reevaluate its agency as a key crisis regulator becomes an
   important challenge both for political science and for policymakers.
   Trust, responsibility, and social solidarity are key values defining the
   feedback between society and the state: the author asserts their
   relevance in promoting a consistent development policy at the community
   level. Identity is a key resource for promoting development and for
   advancing these values both in elite and in mass social groups. The
   research draws upon a variety of sources related to the study of
   development politics in political research, including those produced by
   issue-related research groups and reproduced in survey data bases, and
   on the reflection of these topics in political discourse. ``The New
   Zealand Project{''} is taken as an example of recourse to identity as a
   resource for development: the formation of a consistent development
   policy agenda is centered here on an inclusive national identity and on
   social issues important for a society sharing egalitarian visions and
   seeking to overcome deep social cleavages. The study of identity in a
   development context and the importance of value-based policy choices
   calls for an ethical turn in the social sciences and for a paradigm
   shift towards responsible development in policymaking.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to determine the essence and legal
   implementation in Russia of principles such as: independence of the
   judiciary, relative truth, contradictory nature, legal certainty of
   judicial acts and discretion. In the countries of the Roman-Germanic
   legal order, it is no coincidence that legal principles are of great
   scientific and applied importance. The presence of a certain system of
   procedural principles makes it possible to assess the existence of
   justice in the country, the stability of a judicial decision and the
   fairness of judicial acts. Thus, the principles of the law directly
   affect the level of legality in each state. Currently, some procedural
   principles give rise to a discussion in Russian doctrine about their
   essence and content. The topic is presented from the point of view of
   general scientific methods (systems analysis, structural and functional,
   historical), the method of theoretical analysis, specific scientific
   methods (comparative jurisprudence, technical and legal analysis,
   concretization, interpretation). The theoretical basis was cognitive
   theory. It is concluded that the principle of the independence of the
   judiciary is not fully operational in the Russian Federation.},

   dataset identifies the main elements of the legislative procedure (e.g.,
   dates, types of procedure, directory codes and subcodes, actors, voting
   results, amendments, legal basis, etc.) and the changes introduced at
   each step of the legislative process from the text proposed by the
   European Commission to the final version published in the Official
   Journal of the European Union. This information has been gathered using
   text mining techniques. The dataset is relevant for a broad range of
   research questions regarding the EU decision-making process in JHA
   related to the balance of powers between European institutional actors
   and their capacity to influence the legislative outputs.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {The right to vote is one of the fundamental rights of citizens in
   democratic countries. In the United States of America, however, this
   action is preceded by the obligation to register. Election registrations
   are still seen as a limiting element of electoral law. This work aims to
   find out how the process of registration changed in the past. Another
   crucial question is what influenced the number of registered citizens
   and voter participation in the presidential elections in 2016. The first
   part deals with federal electoral registration reforms and looks at the
   current situation. The second part consists of research in which the
   relationship determination is utilized by the Pearson correlation
   coefficient. In addition to the comparison, the text chose to analyse
   the Wisconsin case. The work concludes that the ratio of registered age
   to eligible voters has not increased, although the demographic curve
   continues to rise. In the case of factors that may affect the number of
   the registered, the direct relationship has not been established. On the
   contrary, a direct correlation has been shown in the case of the same
   factors with the turnout in the presidential election year.},

Abstract = {As an editorial, this short essay aimed to reflect on the present and
   future of artificial intelligence, in the context of the pandemic of the
   new coronavirus. It is based on the hypothesis that observes in
   artificial intelligence a factor of the first order that has accelerated
   the technological s processes, which in turn drive continuous
   improvements in all fields of human action. However, despite its many
   benefits, it is concluded, on the one hand, that this form of non-human
   intelligence will increasingly play an important role in all cultural,
   labour, military and recreational human relations and; on the other
   hand, that modern and civilized nations therefore have a moral duty to
   create l eyes that establish mechanisms of regulation and balance
   between artificial intelligence and human condition, as a condition of
   possibility so that its widespread use does not become a distinction in
   the style of what was planted at the time by some sci-fi narratives, in
   film and literature.},

Pages = {155-162},
Abstract = {This article analyses the interactions between the members of the Polish
   parliament with the European commissioners in the context of the
   European Semester, the annual cycle of economic coordination. The
   Commission drafts crucial documents in this process which assess the
   implementation of the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs): the
   Annual (Sustainable) Growth Survey and the Country Reports. The goal of
   this article is to assess how the Commission is held to account by a
   national parliament and how this affects the level of implementation of
   CSRs. The findings suggest that the Commission is accountable to this
   national parliament, even if the form of accountability taken is rather
   innovative and its policy impact limited, at both the EU (the CSRs tend
   to be immune to Members of {[}national] Parliament's contestation) and
   the national level, as the implementation of CSRs seems to be
   independent of the level of their scrutiny.},

Abstract = {The article examines the problem of determining the essence of the
   concept of ``crime detection{''} in Russian law. For this purpose, the
   method of literature review was used and during the study the authors
   analyzed the normative legal acts of the Russian Federation, such as:
   the constitution of the Russian Federation, the Criminal Code of the
   Federation, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Law ``on
   Operational Search Activity{''}, the Federal Law ``on police forces{''},
   interdepartmental and departmental normative legal acts of the Ministry
   of Internal Affairs of Russia, among others, to determine the precise
   moment of detection of the crime phenomenon. Moreover, the article
   proposes to clarify the definition of the term ``crime detection{''}. It
   is concluded that it is advisable to distinguish the concepts of ``crime
   detection{''} and other related concepts in practice and theory to avoid
   confusion.},

Abstract = {An energetic scholarly debate discusses possible reforms of
   representative democracy. Some support participatory forms of democracy,
   others a more elite-driven or technocratic democracy. This study
   contributes to the growing literature on the subject by emphasizing
   political sophistication as a theoretically relevant predictor of
   attitudes to democracy: different models of democracy make different
   demands regarding the political sophistication of citizens. The analysis
   includes two dimensions and three measures of sophistication: personal
   sophistication measured as political knowledge and internal efficacy,
   and impersonal sophistication measured as assessment of others'
   political competence. Using the 2011 Finnish National Election Study, we
   find that perceptions of the sophistication of others have a substantial
   impact on preferences for political decision-making, and that
   politically sophisticated people support representative democracy. The
   analysis shows that perceptions of others' political competence, which
   has been largely neglected by previous research, is a both theoretically
   and empirically relevant predictor of preferences for political
   decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the current situation of research methodology
   training for international relations (IR) graduate students in China.
   Since the country's opening up, research methods training in IR has
   gradually advanced in universities. We administered a survey to
   postgraduate IR students in China about their training in research
   methodologies. The results reveal that IR methodology training in China
   is still not satisfactory at most schools and varies across
   universities. Although most of the students did not know much about
   quantitative research methods, they are beginning to demand more
   training in this area. This is reflected in both the curriculum design
   at universities and our survey results. Thus, improvements in teaching
   IR research methods at Chinese universities are needed, especially
   improvements that focus on quantitative methods and formal modeling.},

Abstract = {Students and instructors alike have lamented the nature of methods
   instruction in political science curricula. Existing research has
   presented a number of innovative approaches to engage students in this
   important learning enterprise, from blogging and simulations to data
   visualization and the use of clickers. This article builds upon this
   literature by arguing that the policy memo is particularly suited for
   introducing basic methodological concepts to upper-division
   undergraduate students. To facilitate its use for this purpose in
   addition to its utility as a knowledge assessment tool, I offer a policy
   memo template based on over ten years of experience as a strategist and
   analyst in the U.S. military. The article also includes a detailed
   description of the basic methodological concepts that can be developed
   through each section of the template. Specifically, the policy memo can
   be used to introduce students to concepts like identifying a critical
   research question, defining and measuring variables, conducting a
   literature review, developing hypotheses, using data to assess
   hypotheses, evaluating the authoritativeness of sources, and devising
   the theoretical implications of one's research. I present some
   preliminary results that support the policy memo's inclusion as a tool
   of methods instruction, but the pedagogical literature - which argues
   for integrative, experiential, relevant, and short assignments -
   provides the strongest rationale for its use.},

Abstract = {While voter turnout is often seen as one definitive aspect of civic
   engagement, this paper argues that there are more nuanced ways to
   reflect on the impact of service-learning experiences on students'
   environmental awareness and environmentally responsible behavior
   changes. Using course evaluation qualitative comments in environmental
   politics-themed courses that have used service-learning as a pedagogical
   tool for the past 8 years, this paper argues that environmental
   awareness and its subsequent application in activism reflect civic
   engagement through changes in environmental behavior. Service-learning
   enables students to make connections between the course material and
   real-world environmental issues, showing them how various communities
   are attempting to solve certain environmental problems. The focus on
   problem-solving skills in this particular domain enables students to see
   themselves as agents of change, though the long-term effects of these
   changes are difficult to ascertain. The Hawai'i context is particularly
   important due to the plethora of environmental problems we face, and the
   additional fact that we live both in somewhat of a closed and
   geographically isolated system as well as being susceptible to a variety
   of outside systemic influences and forces. If we are not enabling the
   next generation of environmental problem solvers through higher
   education, our ``sea of islands{''} as aptly termed by scholar Epeli
   Hau'ofa, has a lot to lose.},

Abstract = {Scholarship indicates that women and gender are underrepresented in
   Political Science textbooks, particularly those in American Politics. We
   complement those analyses by focusing on the ``companion readers{''}
   often paired with textbooks. Readers give students a glimpse at ``real
   political science,{''} showing how the field is studied and what
   political scientists value. Do the readers convey that ``women also know
   stuff,{''} women are political actors, and gender is a relevant
   construct? The answer to each of these three questions is a resounding
   no. Analyzing women and gender representation in readers for three
   introductory sub-fields (American, Comparative, and Global Politics), we
   find a strong preference toward scholarship by men. Our results indicate
   only a small proportion of women authors and an even lower percentage of
   articles that focus on women. Moreover, the readers have not changed
   over time resulting in readers that are still ``pale, male, and
   stale.{''} Because readers offer a snapshot of the field, and may be
   adopted passively in an introductory course, we argue that the absence
   of women harms students and political science itself.},

Abstract = {American politics has entered, what Michael Tesler calls, a ``most
   racial period,{''} causing racial attitudes to be increasingly salient.
   This shift provides an opportunity to examine the consequences to white
   Americans' political behavior when their racial attitudes are easily
   activated. In this paper, we examine the influence of racial attitudes
   on (1) white Americans' presidential vote choice and (2) how racial
   attitudes, in this period, may undercut the influence of partisanship on
   vote choice. We use data from the American National Election Studies
   Time Series Survey conducted from 2004 to 2020 to explore these
   questions. First, we find that anti-Black attitudes increasingly predict
   white vote choice. Next, we find that during this period, racially
   resentful, white Democrats became less likely to vote for the Democrat.
   This was not the same for white Republicans who, regardless of their
   racial attitudes, did not shift to the Democratic party. Finally, we
   find that white Republicans appear to hunker down and become
   significantly less likely to split their vote as they express more
   anti-Black attitudes. White Democrats become significantly more likely
   to jump ship as they endorse more anti-Black attitudes, revealing that
   racial attitudes were influential enough to overcome party loyalties
   during this period.},

Abstract = {Winners and losers of elections have different stakes in protecting
   democratic institutions. We provide new evidence for the effects of
   partisanship and economic performance on support for checks and balances
   and acceptance of their infringement. Using survey data from 26 European
   countries, we show that voters who feel close to a political party that
   lost the elections support checks and balances significantly more than
   other citizens. We also find that higher satisfaction with the economy
   is associated with lower support for checks and balances. Our experiment
   in Ukraine shows that supporters and opponents of the governing party
   have divergent evaluations of a reform potentially infringing on the
   independence of the judiciary. Those in opposition find such reforms
   less acceptable and justified. Again, we find that improved economic
   performance leads to higher acceptance of judicial reform. Our results
   confirm that citizens' support for checks and balances is contingent and
   volatile.},

Abstract = {The dichotomy of civic vs. ethnic nationalism has long been applied
   spatially to explain differences between `Western' and `Eastern'
   manifestations of nationalism. Though frequently criticised on
   empirical, methodological, and normative grounds, this dualism continues
   to find widespread use in nationalism studies. Through a genealogical
   study of the dichotomy's emergence and evolution from Hans Kohn to John
   Plamenatz and Ernest Gellner, the article traces its strong ties to
   discourses and policies of `Western' superiority, and to
   demi-orientalising constructions of `Eastern Europe' as the inferior
   other of the `civilized West'.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-395},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As attempts to combat partisan gerrymandering transition from proposals
   to the Supreme Court to state-based districting commissions, it is time
   to ask two questions. First, how well did commissions in the 2010 round
   of redistricting perform as neutral decision makers? We answer that
   question with applications to each of the three independent commissions
   (AZ, CA, and WA) and four other commission forms (IA, NJ, NY, and VA) in
   place for post-2010. We take as the neutrality criterion the idea that a
   commission would produce a district plan that comports with a partisan
   outcome that could be expected from a set of approximately 10,000
   computer generated plans adhering to minimalist constraints of
   contiguity, compactness, and equal populations. Our results indicate
   three of seven commissions produced suspect results that redounded to
   the benefit of one party or the other: pro- Democrat in Arizona;
   pro-Republican in New Jersey and Virginia.},

Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2021},
Number = {15},
Month = {DEC-APR},
Abstract = {Mark Fisher's thought is fully inscribed in a present marked by the
   crisis of the future and the return of the past in different forms: the
   ``memorial obsession{''}; the rise of remakes and retro in the cultural
   sphere; and the cancellation of utopian time in a context in which the
   neoliberal narrative has lost all credibility but there seems to be no
   conceivable alternative. In these coordinates, in Fisher's diagnosis of
   the states of malaise (nostalgia, depression, depressive hedonia, etc.)
   and their possible channels, underlies the political intention of
   orienting current democratic demands in an emancipatory sense in order
   to redeem a past that, curiously, never ended up being produced and that
   has reached us in traces of carmine through popular culture. This
   unknown desire for the ``new{''} would be expressed subterraneously
   through the remnants of what Fisher calls ``popular modernism{''}. So,
   in a present whose utopian imagination seems blocked by a hypertrophy of
   the past, what relationship can be established with tradition? How can
   the ghost of ``the new{''} relate to the past without being imprisoned
   by its inheritance?},

Abstract = {This article presents some results of the research ``The Tequeno Path.
   Identification and integration of Venezuelan migrants in Bogota through
   consumption spaces{''}. The study sought to understand the social
   production of consumption spaces related to Venezuelan migrants in
   Bogota. In this article, in particular, the relationship between
   consumption and the construction of networks is presented, approaching
   the way in which through the sending of remittances from Colombia to
   Venezuela, as well as through Facebook groups and the exchange of food
   products, Venezuelan migrants strengthen migratory networks that help
   them face the process of integration into urban life. As for
   methodology, the research shows the application of netnographic
   observation, surveys, and virtual discussion groups.},

Abstract = {Threatened reactions to news about the approach of a racial
   majority-minority society have profoundly influenced Americans'
   political attitudes and electoral choices. Existing research casts these
   reactions as responses to changing demographic context. We argue instead
   that they are driven in large part by the dominant majority-minority
   narrative framing of most public discussion about rising racial
   diversity. This narrative assumes the long-run persistence of a
   white-nonwhite binary in which the growing number of Americans with both
   white and non-white parents are classified exclusively as non-white,
   irrespective of how they identify themselves. Alternative narratives
   that take stock of trends toward mixed-race marriage and multiracial
   identification also reflect demographic fundamentals projected by the
   Census Bureau and more realistically depict the country's twenty-first
   century racial landscape. Using three survey experiments, we examine
   public reactions to alternative narratives about rising diversity. The
   standard majority-minority narrative evokes far more threat among whites
   than any other narrative. Alternative accounts that highlight
   multiracialism elicit decidedly positive reactions regardless of whether
   they foretell the persistence of a more diverse white majority.
   Non-white groups respond favorably to all narratives about rising
   diversity, irrespective of whether they include the conventional
   majority-minority framing.},

Abstract = {Debates around the effectiveness of high-profile Twitter account
   suspensions and similar bans on abusive users across social media
   platforms abound. Yet we know little about the effectiveness of warning
   a user about the possibility of suspending their account as opposed to
   outright suspensions in reducing hate speech. With a pre-registered
   experiment, we provide causal evidence that a warning message can reduce
   the use of hateful language on Twitter, at least in the short term. We
   design our messages based on the literature on deterrence, and test
   versions that emphasize the legitimacy of the sender, the credibility of
   the message, and the costliness of being suspended. We find that the act
   of warning a user of the potential consequences of their behavior can
   significantly reduce their hateful language for one week. We also find
   that warning messages that aim to appear legitimate in the eyes of the
   target user seem to be the most effective. In light of these findings,
   we consider the policy implications of platforms adopting a more
   aggressive approach to warning users that their accounts may be
   suspended as a tool for reducing hateful speech online.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, the political environment in the Mexican
   state of Chihuahua has radically changed. The factors that have
   influenced this change include the economic integration and regional
   markets that have been fostered between Mexico and the United States; an
   increasing presence of organized crime; and civil society and private
   corporations that have responded in a way resembling the electoral
   realignment conditions that seem to have been consolidated with the last
   election. This article reviews these factors.},

Abstract = {This article explores the unintended consequences associated with the
   protection of civilians (PoC) mandate in United Nations peacekeeping.
   Drawing primarily on two case studies - the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo (MONUSCO) and South Sudan (UNMISS) - we advance three lines of
   argument. First, the gravitational pull of PoC can distract missions
   from other, often interdependent, priorities. Second, the implementation
   of PoC can distort intended impacts. Third, these distractions and
   distortions can combine to produce dilemmas for mission architects,
   leadership and implementers. We conclude by identifying how these
   quandaries can ultimately make civilian protection, sustainable peace,
   and mission exits more elusive.},

Abstract = {Political responsiveness is highly unequal along class lines, which has
   triggered a lively debate about potential causes of this political
   inequality. What has remained largely unexplored in this debate are the
   structural economic conditions under which policymakers operate. In this
   contribution, we hypothesize that budgetary pressures affect both the
   level and the equality of political responsiveness. Using a dataset
   containing public opinion data on around 450 fiscal policy proposals in
   Germany between 1980 and 2016, we investigate whether policymakers are
   more responsive on issues with budgetary consequences under conditions
   of low fiscal pressure than under conditions of high fiscal pressure. We
   find that responsiveness indeed varies systematically with the degree of
   fiscal pressure and that policymakers are less responsive on fiscal
   issues when fiscal pressure is high. This holds for both left-wing and
   right-wing governments. In contrast, we do not find strong effects of
   fiscal pressure on political inequality: responsiveness is not more
   equal in fiscally more permissive times. However, since different types
   of policy proposals are adopted in times of high fiscal stress, unequal
   responsiveness has different policy implications in times of high and
   low fiscal pressure.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why Japan has been at the periphery of the
   international humanitarian system, at least for the past two decades.
   Based on a review of the main features of the country's historical
   involvement in humanitarian crisis response, I suggest two main reasons:
   1) the difficulty for Japan to adapt to the kind of institutions created
   after the end of the Cold War, mainly by Western actors, and 2) Japan's
   preference for an integral approach to crisis management, using multiple
   international cooperation means, which falls outside of the present
   humanitarian diplomacy paradigm. As this paradigm comes into question,
   Japan can influence the emerging humanitarian system, particularly
   through the promotion of crisis management ownership and long-term
   commitment backed by multiple financial means.},

Abstract = {We discuss the proposal of Chandran Kukathas engaged in one of the goals
   of liberal theories: the protection of freedom of conscience. Kukathas
   proposes the metaphor of a liberal archipelago where different
   communities are sovereign in enforcing their worldview on their
   territory. We share Kukathas's intention to strongly protect freedom of
   conscience, but we think that Kukathas's theory fails to adequately
   protect it. In Kukathas's view, freedom of conscience is protected
   through freedom of association and the related freedom to exit an
   association. But freedom of exit, intended only as a right not to be
   coerced when one wants to leave, is insufficient. It must be sustained
   by the provision of capabilities to leave that one can exercise, as well
   as by capabilities to evaluate her condition. We discuss, then, a more
   promising proposal of an egalitarian libertarian archipelago proposed by
   Michael Otsuka. After explaining why this system isn't sufficiently
   stable, we conclude that the constitutional egalitarian liberal state is
   a better candidate.},

Title = {Do Transitions from Liberation Movements to Political Parties Guarantee
   Good Governance? The Case of ZANU-PF and the ANC},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the transition of liberation
   movements into political parties and whether that guarantees good
   governance or not. Since the end of the Second World War and the Cold
   War, the number of democratic states has increased on all continents.
   African states began to explore democratic governance from independence
   and the end of apartheid. Furthermore, the liberation struggle fought by
   many African movements led to independence and `decolonisation'. The
   emergence of these liberation movements was to emancipate and liberate
   their respective states so that the rule of oppressive imperialists such
   as the British could come to an end. The transition of the former
   colonial states ensured that the movements which fought the liberation
   struggle turned into political parties. The study uses the cases of the
   Zimbabwe African National-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) in Zimbabwe and the
   African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa to interrogate the
   transition into political parties and examine if good governance has
   been achieved because of that. The study has found that the implications
   of former liberation movements turning into political parties have not

Abstract = {National security crises often generate a `rally-around-the-flag'
   effect, especially under nationalist administrations, but the salience
   of a security crisis varies within a country. Does exposure to a crisis
   intensify rallying by fomenting nationalism, inciting hawkishness, and
   distracting from quotidian economic concerns? Or does exposure deepen
   dissatisfaction with the incumbent, thereby reducing a rallying effect?
   We argue the latter using evidence from a difficult test in India. A
   major pre-election terrorist attack boosted the nationwide popularity of
   the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the nationalist ruling party. Yet we
   find that proximity to the victims' funeral processions, which served as
   patriotic rallies, substantially reduced BJP support where the party was
   incumbent. The size and breadth of our observed effects indicate that
   the social commemoration of the attack, rather than direct personal
   connections to its victims, fuelled anti-incumbent sentiment. Mobilizing
   collective anger after a crisis may dampen rather than augment a
   rally-around-the-flag effect.},

Abstract = {In many democratic systems, there is a tradition of interactions between
   political parties and interest organizations. However, for the CEE
   region, the factors driving such contacts remain partially undiscovered.
   Therefore, taking the organized interests' perspective, we examine what
   factors influence the frequency of contacts with political parties, what
   types of parties are most attractive to groups and what kind of interest
   groups' resources facilitates such contacts. The study relies on data
   from a large-scale survey of organized interests, bringing in a
   comparative perspective of the four selected countries: Czech Republic,
   Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. The results show that nearly half of
   interest groups in the region do not form any lobby routines with
   political parties, which is similar to the results of recent research in
   long-established democracies. However, regarding the other half, we see
   different patterns of contact depending on the country. The article
   finds strong support for the importance of the dominant party status for
   interest groups, but not necessarily for the number of seats that party
   holds in the parliament. Against the background of a fairly balanced
   picture of the Czech Republic and Slovenia, our results indicate
   extremely different attitudes of interest groups toward political
   parties in Hungary and Poland, countries willingly juxtaposed with each
   other in recent years. The results for Poland clearly show that the
   stronger the party's position and the greater the number of its seats in
   parliament, the greater the interest of the groups in contact. On the
   contrary, in Hungary groups rather declare contacts with opposition
   parties and those with a small and medium number of seats in parliament.
   Regarding the importance of resources, we found that among the three
   types of analyzed resources-financial horizon, different types of
   expertise and participation in umbrella organizations-only the last two
   are relevant.},

Abstract = {Nimbyism is widely thought to arise from an inherent tradeoff between
   localism and efficiency in government: because many development projects
   have spatially concentrated costs and diffuse benefits, local residents
   naturally oppose proposed projects. But why cannot project developers
   (with large potential profits) compensate local residents? We argue that
   local regulatory institutions effectively require developers to expend
   resources that cannot be used to compensate residents. Not being
   compensated for local costs, residents therefore oppose development.
   Using a formal model, we show that when these transaction costs are
   high, voters consistently oppose development regardless of compensation
   from developers. But when transaction costs are low, developers provide
   compensation to residents and local support for development increases.
   We conclude that nimbyism arises from a bargaining problem between
   developers and local residents, not the relationship between local
   decision-making and the spatial structure of costs and benefits. We
   suggest policy reforms implied by this theory.},

Abstract = {This research note examines voter preferences in Swiss-EU relations. We
   identify large shares of cross-pressured voters, i.e., citizens who
   support the bilateral treaties but wish to either control immigration
   into Switzerland or oppose a liberalization of social protection
   measures on the job market. Voters experiencing a trade-off between
   immigration control and international cooperation are mainly located on
   the Right. Their share decreased between 2015 and 2019, whereas the
   share of neutral voters sharply increased. Moreover, negotiations about
   an Institutional Framework Agreement between Switzerland and the EU have
   given rise to a new trade-off - namely between social protection and
   international cooperation - with cross-pressured voters mainly
   concentrated on the Left. This tension has generated a high share of
   undecided voters. When pressured to decide on these trade-offs,
   cross-pressured and neutral voters opt for the bilateral treaties over
   immigration control, whereas they prefer social protection over the new
   agreement. Partisanship is a strong predictor of these choices.},

Abstract = {Party identification is a well-documented force in political behaviour.
   However, the vast majority of work on partisanship considers only its
   positive side, rather than recognizing that partisan identities may also
   have a negative component. Recent work has shown that negative
   partisanship has important effects, such as reinforcing partisan
   leanings, directing strategic behaviour and increasing the rate of
   straight-ticket voting. This study takes a step back to explore the
   sources of such orientations, rather than the effects. Specifically, it
   considers whether the electoral system context contributes to the
   presence of negative affective orientations towards parties. Using data
   from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we examine the
   influence of factors related to electoral system features and consider
   whether their influence is moderated by voter sophistication. Data
   reveal significant variation in the rate of negative partisanship across
   countries, and that these differences are related to the electoral
   system context in which voters are making decisions. We also find some
   evidence that these effects are moderated by sophistication. This work
   adds to our understanding of the role of affect in political behaviour,
   as well as the impact that country-level institutional factors can have
   upon the relationship between voters and parties.},

Abstract = {The character and state of a financial system are important contributing
   factors to the performance, stability and security of any economy,
   something which has been repeatedly demonstrated during times of
   financial crisis. While assessments of earlier financial crises tended
   to focus on shortcomings in the governance of financial sectors, not
   least when crises occurred in the developing world, many have noted
   issues with the moral character of the industry, and the attendant
   processes of securitisation and financialisation, in the wake of the
   transatlantic financial crisis of 2007-2008. Against these recent
   criticisms, Islamic finance was pitched as a more ethical, stable and
   secure alternative. Although the ideas that inform the development of
   Islamic finance might hold the promise of a more ethical alternative to
   conventional finance, the industry itself has not been immune to
   processes of financialisation and securitisation, which have arguably
   undermined the market's initial promise.},

Abstract = {Is cruelty a problem for politics? For Hannah Arendt, the answer was no.
   On her view, a compassionate response towards persons suffering cruelty
   is best avoided because compassion can only become political by
   transforming incommunicable individual pain into abstract suffering. At
   crucial moments in her argument in On Revolution, she cites the great
   Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky as an ally. However, I argue that
   Arendt misrepresents Dostoyevsky. Through a critical examination of his
   mature novels, I show how suffering is communicable and compassion is
   political for Dostoyevsky. By attending to this theme in his writings, I
   argue that Dostoyevsky sheds light on the problem of cruelty in a way
   that Arendt's framework cannot. This suggests that he is more at home
   with theorists like Judith Shklar who ``put cruelty first{''} than with
   Arendt, although in favoring compassion I argue that he departs from
   Shklar's liberalism of fear and offers a more constructive, hopeful
   political vision.},

Title = {Does Power ``Spread{''}? Foucault on the Generalization of Power},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-574},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This essay critically analyzes a common metaphor in political theory,
   which figures the growth of power as a process of ``spreading{''} or
   ``diffusion.{''} It argues that narratives that cast the generalization
   of power as a movement of ``spreading{''} often fail to furnish the
   specific type of historical evidence that they imply, such that these
   narratives are frequently received as richly suggestive yet ultimately
   unjustified. This essay develops an alternative way of conceptualizing
   the generalization of power, one that rests on rigorous yet speculative
   evidence of the sort that political theorists are best positioned to
   find: not proof of literal extension or application of existing powers
   to new domains, but accidental convergences, isomorphisms, and ideal
   combinations among disparate practices that introduce large powers into
   the world. To do this, the essay revisits Foucault's narrative of the
   generalization of disciplinary power in modern Western societies, which
   is perhaps the clearest source for the familiarity of the figure of
   ``spread{''} in contemporary political theory. It shows that Foucault's
   incessant use of the ``spread{''} metaphor naturally invites the
   dismissive reading that Discipline and Punish received in many quarters,
   for it implies a historical process that Foucault cannot justify. Yet I
   argue that in a brief self-criticism, Foucault provides the rudiments
   for a conception of power's generalization far more useful and
   compelling than the metaphoric of ``spread.{''} I suggest that this
   alternative, if developed, is not just the proper frame for interpreting
   Foucault's narrative, but a promising practical resource for
   contemporary theorists of general powers.},

Abstract = {Conventional scholarly wisdom has held that the popularity/approval of
   political leaders is determined by a governments' ability to provide
   peace, prosperity, and security to its citizens. However, for coalition
   governments in multiparty parliamentary democracies, popularity may also
   be shaped by legislative and structural divisions among ruling parties.
   Lower legislative cohesion may decrease the coalition's political
   feasibility while structural divisions indicate that policy preferences
   in the government are diverse, and the government is more constrained to
   act on potentially divisive issues. These two factors are tested in the
   context of recent Israeli political history where prime ministers have
   been historically dependent on coalition governments. Focusing on the
   consequences of coalition governments characteristics in Israel between
   2006 and 2015, this study shows how coalition behavior and structure
   impact the prime minister's popularity.},

Abstract = {The article argues that the theory of plebiscitary leader democracy
   (PLD), originally developed by Max Weber, is in its somewhat rejuvenated
   version a helpful framework in interpreting longer-term and more recent
   empirical trends in contemporary democracies, such as the growing
   personalization of politics, the emergence of populist leaders, rising
   levels of polarization, and the growing importance of social media.
   However, to realize the potential of the theory, it should be detached
   from Jeffrey Green's most original, yet insufficiently realistic
   elaboration of plebiscitary democracy that he made a decade ago. The
   article argues that instead of a passive and unifiable entity, the
   citizenry should be thought of as reactive and deeply divided, a setting
   which can be characterized by the metaphor of the infamous Byzantine
   chariot races rather than that of the theater, implicit in Green's
   theory. Plebiscitary democracy should be thought of as representational,
   where popular control is manifested as the veto power of the popular
   voice. Additionally, despite its realist minimalism, the theory we
   propose may still have some critical potential, because it adopts the
   refurbished ideal of competition. The article closes by identifying
   further avenues of theoretization leading towards a more elaborate view
   of PLD.},

Abstract = {Current interpretations making sense of China's policy rationale for
   pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) often highlight explanations
   rooted in the logic of economic statecraft. This article proposes a
   different perspective by looking at the BRI as part of China's
   longstanding agenda to construct and present a positive and distinct
   major power image for itself. This perspective is consistent with the
   assumptions of Social Identity Theory (SIT), where groups pursue
   positive identity through the sociocognitive processes of categorization
   and self-enhancement. By identifying referential and predication
   discursive strategies as reflected in official texts, this article finds
   representations of both categorization and self-enhancement at work
   through China's Silk Road Spirit discourse of the BRI. Through this
   discourse, China seeks to cultivate a positive and distinct identity for
   itself by distinguishing its in-group and out-group and by forwarding
   positive values in terms of how international relations ought to be
   conducted.},

Abstract = {The two-hundredth anniversary of the publication of Hegel's Philosophy
   of Right allows us to provide an array of exciting interpretations of
   his work. In one interpretation, exemplified by the reactions of Johann
   Friedrich Herbart (discussed here by Frederick Beiser) and of Karl Marx
   (discussed here by Jacob Roundtree), Hegel's holism is a product of a
   romantic or mystical metaphysics that prioritizes the invisible reality
   of the Idea over visible realities. In another interpretation (advanced
   here by Roundtree himself and by Darren Nah, Alan Patten, and Paul
   Rosenberg), Hegel's holism is instrumental to preserving individual
   freedoms or interests by embedding them in a larger cultural or
   institutional context. A third interpretation, not necessarily
   incompatible with the second (and exemplified here by contributions from
   Frederick Neuhouser, Angelica Nuzzo, and Terry Pinkard), treats the
   Hegelian whole as rational intrinsically, not merely because it is
   instrumental to other ends.},

   differences in state economic conditions influenced when governors began
   easing. Governors of states with larger recent declines in COVID-19
   deaths per capita and improving trends in new confirmed cases and test
   positivity were quicker to ease. However, politics played as powerful a
   role as epidemiological conditions, driven primarily by governors' party
   affiliation. Republican governors made the policy U-turn from imposing
   social distancing measures toward easing those measures a week earlier
   than Democratic governors, all else equal. Most troubling of all, we
   find that states with larger Black populations eased their social
   distancing policies more quickly, despite Black Americans' higher
   exposure to infection from SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent death from
   COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Empirical studies show that many governments gear the provision of goods
   and services towards their ethnic peers. This article investigates
   governments' strategies to provide ethnic favors in Africa. Recent
   studies of ethnic favoritism find that presidents' ethnic peers and home
   regions enjoy advantages, yet cannot disentangle whether goods are
   provided to entire regions or co-ethnic individuals. This article argues
   that local ethnic demography determines whether governments provide
   non-excludable public goods or more narrowly targeted handouts. Where
   government co-ethnics are in the majority, public goods benefit all
   locals regardless of their ethnic identity. Outside of these
   strongholds, incumbents pursue discriminatory strategies and only their
   co-ethnics gain from favoritism. Using fine-grained geographic data on
   ethnic demographics, the study finds support for the argument's
   implications in the local incidence of infant mortality. These findings
   have important implications for theories of distributive politics and
   conflict in multi-ethnic societies.},

Abstract = {Religious conflicts have increased interfaith suspicion between
   Christians and Muslims in Nigeria with each group being determined to
   outshine the other in the propagation of its religious beliefs. In fact,
   even Islamic sect Boko Haram was formed on the belief in the superiority
   of Islam as a monotheistic religion and with a divine mandate to purge
   Islam of Western influences. This paper examines the complex issues
   surrounding the advent of the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria. It argues that
   religious conflict in Nigeria results from the propagation of
   radicalized exegeses and the use of religious sentiments for gain
   political advantage. Government's failure to act decisively also
   accounts for religious conflict in Nigeria and the Boko Haram in
   particular.},

Abstract = {Social norms play an important role in our understanding of why people
   vote, yet very little is known about the relative importance of
   descriptive and injunctive norms for voter turnout or how normative
   influence is affected by the political and social relationship between
   citizens. Using political discussion network data from the British
   Election Study, this article examines the joint effect of descriptive
   and injunctive norms on turnout. It demonstrates that citizens follow
   the example of those closest to them (descriptive norms), especially
   their partner, but they also respond to social approval of voting from
   political discussants regardless of the nature of their relationship.},

Abstract = {The Internet Archive curated a 90-terabyte sub-collection of captures
   from the US government's public website domain ('.gov'). Such archives
   provide largely untapped resources for measuring attributes, behaviors
   and outcomes relevant to political science research. This study
   leverages this archive to measure a novel dimension of federal
   legislators' religiosity: their proportional use of religious rhetoric
   on official congressional websites (2006-2012). This scalable,
   time-variant measure improves upon more costly, time-invariant
   conventional approaches to measuring legislator attributes. The authors
   demonstrate the validity of this method for measuring legislators'
   public-facing religiosity and discuss the contributions and limitations
   of using archived Internet data for scientific analysis. This research
   makes three applied methodological contributions: (1) it develops a new
   measure for legislator religiosity, (2) it models an improved, more
   comprehensive approach to analyzing congressional communications and (3)
   it demonstrates the unprecedented potential that archived Internet data
   offer to researchers seeking to develop meaningful, cost-effective
   approaches to analyzing political phenomena.},

Abstract = {Republican support for the 1982 Voting Rights Act (VRA) extension is a
   puzzle for scholars of racial policy coalitions. The extension contained
   provisions that were manifestly antithetical to core principles of the
   ``color-blind{''} policy alliance said to dominate the GOP. Recent
   scholarship has explained this puzzling decision by arguing that
   conservatives were confident that the VRA's most objectionable
   provisions could be undone by the federal bureaucracy and judiciary,
   while absolving Republicans of the blame of being against voting rights.
   This article suggests that the picture is more complicated. Applying the
   concept of ``critical junctures{''} to the 1982 VRA extension, the
   article highlights the importance of actors' contingent decisions and
   reveals a wider range of choices available to political entrepreneurs
   than has been conventionally understood. Highlighting differing views
   within the Reagan administration, this article also identifies a wider
   range of reasons why Republicans supported the act's extension,
   including career ambition, party-building, policy agenda advancement,
   and genuine commitment, rather than simply a defensive stance as implied
   by recent histories.},

Abstract = {From the democratic peace to the authoritarian peace to the
   conflict-prone behavior of democratizing states, empirical evidence
   shows that regime types influence the decision to go to war. The only
   way distinct regimes can behave differently in similar circumstances is
   if they have different tastes for settlements. Moreover, dyadic
   negotiation is dependent on the regime types of both participants. Here
   we offer a dyadic theory of conflict where states bargain over a good
   with different attributes: a club good element and an element of private
   goods like rents. We show that dyad type has important effects on the
   potential for conflict. Empirically, we show our new predictions about
   the dependence of conflict on dyad type-namely, the presence of private
   goods in an international crisis increases the likelihood of violence
   when both sides are autocratic but decreases it when one side is
   sufficiently democratic.</p>},

   main causes of the ongoing `populist Zeitgeist'. My main arguments are:
   (1) while populism is related to (real and perceived) `crises', these
   so-called `crises' are often catalysts rather than prime causes of the
   rise of populism; (2) populism is essentially an illiberal democratic
   response to undemocratic liberalism; and (3) populism can only be
   overcome by more rather than less liberal democracy. I illustrate my
   arguments on the basis of the recent rise of populism in Europe, but
   believe they also largely hold true beyond that specific regional and
   temporal context.},

Abstract = {In this paper I analyse two possible translations from hermeneutic
   philosophy into the field of political theory. Mainly, Gianni Vattimo's
   conception of ``weak thought{''} is presented, a nihilistic and
   postmodern version of the hermeneutic tradition. Against it, Charles
   Taylor's proposal to manage multicultural is put forward -also informed
   by hermeneutic principles, although within a peculiar form of moral
   realism. Through a critical comparison between both works, I intend to
   hold that Taylor's variant overcomes some of the contradictions and
   defects that Vattimo's model exhibits. More generally, the position that
   I seek to defend is that a Hermeneutics that holds a relevant function
   for the concept of `truth' is better suited to sustain a productive
   political model.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A prevalent assumption in the economic voting literature is that voters'
   retrospective evaluations are based on very recent outcomes only, that
   is, they are myopic. I test this assumption by drawing on a population
   based survey experiment from Turkey. Turkey presents a good opportunity
   to explore voters' time horizons for economic voting: the long tenure of
   the same single-party government entailed periods of both good and poor
   performance, and its overall record to date has been better than its
   immediate predecessors. I find that voters can provide divergent
   assessments of incumbent's performance in managing the economy over
   different time periods that are in line with the country's macroeconomic
   trajectory. Moreover, voters' evaluations of the incumbent's performance
   during its entire tenure have a stronger effect on economic vote than
   their shorter term evaluations, defying voter myopia. I provide evidence
   that long-term outcomes might weigh heavier in voters' considerations
   than commonly assumed.},

Abstract = {The audit study design offers researchers a powerful tool to measure
   discrimination. Yet ethical concerns surround the use of this design. In
   this article, we introduce a cost-benefit framework that researchers
   should consider when conducting audit studies. One key insight of this
   framework is that when researchers evaluate audit studies due to ethical
   concerns, they must also evaluate the relative benefits of studying
   discrimination through other means. Building on this framework, we
   provide a set of practical recommendations that researchers can adopt to
   (1) minimize costs (i.e. ethical harm) and (2) maximize benefits (i.e.
   quality of their research). We hope that our suggestions contribute to
   the ongoing, important discussion about ethical issues involving audit
   studies and generate better work on discrimination.},

Abstract = {This article argues that economic crises are incompatible with the
   realisation of non-domination in capitalist societies. The ineradicable
   risk that an economic crisis will occur undermines the robust security
   of the conditions of non-domination for all citizens, not only those who
   are harmed by a crisis. I begin by demonstrating that the unemployment
   caused by economic crises violates the egalitarian dimensions of freedom
   as non-domination. The lack of employment constitutes an exclusion from
   the social bases of self-respect, and from a practice of mutual social
   contribution crucial to the intersubjective affirmation of one's status.
   While this argument shows that republicans must be concerned about
   economic crises, I suggest a more powerful argument can be grounded in
   the republican requirement that freedom must be robust. The systemic
   risk of economic crisis constitutes a threat to the conditions of free
   citizenship that cannot be nullified using policy mechanisms. As a
   result, republicans appear to be faced with the choice of revising their
   commitments or rejecting the possibility that republican freedom can be
   robustly secured in capitalist societies.},

Abstract = {Many have argued that deliberative democracy has, at best, an
   uncomfortable relationship with activism. It might be thought that
   deliberative democracy faces an inescapable dilemma: either restrict
   activist conduct in ways that might exacerbate real-world injustices, or
   restrict its normative claims to the realm of ideal theory, making it
   largely irrelevant to the real world. The idea of a deliberative system,
   however, may seem capable of handling this dilemma. By focusing on the
   quality of deliberation at the macro-level, deliberative systems theory
   (DST) does not require that activists must rely exclusively, or even
   primarily on deliberation. Additionally, DST suggests a kind of
   deliberative criteria according to which activist conduct can be
   assessed in the here and now. In this article, I assess the extent to
   which DST really is able to avoid this dilemma. I do not think it is
   impossible for DST to do so; however, I argue that it can avoid the
   dilemma by presupposing a broadly optimistic picture of the world. If we
   reject this picture, the relevance of DST and deliberative democratic
   theory in general for activists will be severely limited.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Hannah Arendt's thought can offer significant
   insights on political judgement for realism in political theory. We
   identify a realist position which emphasises the need to account for how
   humans judge politically, contra moralist tendencies to limit its
   exercise to rational standards, but which fails to provide a sufficient
   conception of its structure and potential. Limited appeals to political
   judgement render the realist defence of the political elusive and
   compromise the endeavour to offer a meaningful alternative to the
   moralist tendency to displace politics. The potential and limitations of
   realist discussions on judgement are made visible in relation to
   proto-realists Judith Shklar and Isaiah Berlin. In seeking to enrich the
   realist conception of the political, the article introduces the
   displacement critique found in the neglected Arendtian `realism'. It
   also provides the foundations for a distinctly realist account of
   political judgement which, we argue, requires elaboration along two
   dimensions: the social coding of political judgement and the political
   capacities that help judgement build a suitable political sphere.},

Abstract = {Following the current debate on the existence of a third wave of
   autocratization, this article focuses on one of the most prominent
   features of democratic recession and deepening autocratization which is
   scrapping presidential terms. I argue that it is important to consider
   formal institutions while studying the decision to scrap term limits,
   and not only the outcome. Based on a 289 presidential/semi presidential
   sample, starting from the third wave till 2020, the findings, using
   logistic regression models, indicate that the higher the institutional
   constraints are, the less likely the president is to attempt scrapping
   term limits. Moreover, the president decides to extend more than to
   abolish or avoid term limits when there are higher institutional
   constraints. Furthermore, this article argues that regional
   partners/presidents who attempt to change term limits motivate other
   presidents to do the same. The results show that precedent regional and
   sub-regional attempts positively affect the president's decision to
   attempt to change term limits. Moreover, security challenges in the
   region are used as a pretext for staying longer in office, for it is
   argued that if the president leaves his/her rule, the country will face
   a breakdown and the whole region will be affected.},

Abstract = {New Right theories have had a major impact on British politics since the
   emergence of Thatcherism and the end of the so-called `years of
   consensus' in the mid-1970s. In radically rejecting the conventions of
   postwar politics in terms of the management of both economic and social
   policies, the ideas of the New Right initially came to significantly
   shape the policies of the Thatcher government (1979-90), and indeed have
   continued to wield influence over other administrations in subsequent
   years. However, to what degree this influence has been retained as we
   enter the third decade of the twenty-first century is a matter of
   conjecture, specifically in the wake of Conservative Party
   `modernzation', as well as the advent of major crises such as the 2007/8
   economic crash and the Covid-19 pandemic. Within this context, this
   article seeks to assess and analyse the ongoing legacy of the New Right
   and its impact on British Conservatism over this sustained historical
   period.},

Abstract = {Does physical surveillance hinder or foster antiregime resistance? A
   common view holds that surveillance prevents resistance by providing
   regimes with high-quality intelligence on dissident networks and by
   instilling fear in citizens. We contrast this view using formerly
   classified data from Communist Poland. We find that communities exposed
   to secret police officers were more likely to organize protests but also
   engaged in less sabotage. To ensure that the relationship is causal, we
   use an instrumental variable strategy, which exploits the exogenous
   assignment of Catholic ``spy priests{''} to local communities. To trace
   the underlying mechanisms, we draw on qualitative interviews and
   archival sources. We document that Poland's comprehensive use of
   surveillance created widespread anger as well as an incentive for
   citizens to reveal their true loyalties, thus facilitating antiregime
   collective action. Once on the streets, protesters refrained from
   sabotage to signal their political motivation to bystanders and
   authorities alike.},

Abstract = {In light of the unexpectedly high turnout in the 2019 European
   Parliament election, we explore how major transnational policy issues
   mobilize voters in European electoral contests. Based on the analysis of
   two data sets, the Eurobarometer post-election survey and the RECONNECT
   panel survey, we make three important observations. First, European
   citizens show a higher tendency to participate in European Parliament
   elections when they attribute greater importance to the issues `climate
   change and environment', `economy and growth', and `immigration'.
   Second, having a more extreme opinion on the issue of `European
   integration' increases people's likelihood to vote in European
   elections. Third, the mobilizing effect of personal issue importance is
   enhanced by the systemic salience that the respective policy issue has
   during the election campaign. These findings show the relevance of issue
   mobilization in European Parliament elections as well as its
   context-dependent nature.},

Abstract = {This article deals with a question foregrounded by historian Willem van
   Schendel in his seminal 2002 article `Geographies of Knowing,
   Geographies of Ignorance': how do arms, arms flows, and associated
   regulatory practices reshape the geometries of authority and power in
   borderlands? The rich transdisciplinary literature on borderlands has
   fruitfully deployed van Schendel's insights to re-spatialise areas and
   states but has devoted scant attention to such question. Drawing from
   `new materialist' scholarship in IR and the concept of scale in
   political geography, the paper argues that fluid and fractionally
   coherent combinations of weapons as technical objects that come from
   somewhere, rationalities, and techniques of arms control reproduce
   multiple scales of territorial authority and struggles over scaled modes
   of governing violence in borderlands. Such struggles of scales and about
   scale constantly reconfigure the territorial arenas of authority on
   violence at the edge of the state. Based on fieldwork in Ta'ang areas of
   northern Shan State, Myanmar, the article develops an empirical analysis
   of encounters between explosive devices/landmines and the subjects and
   spaces they target. Delving into the processes and practices of `making'
   and controlling the landmine', 1 find that different socio-political
   orders confront themselves through rationalities, techniques, and
   practices of humanitarian arms control via which they navigate/jump
   across scales, forge new ones, or mobilise multi-scalar alliances.
   Different types of `dead' and `alive' landmines nonetheless defy these
   attempts at resealing territorial authority over violence by acting in
   unforeseen manners at the scale of their own ecologies of violence.},

Abstract = {Are Eurosceptic parties more likely to run negative, uncivil and
   emotional campaigns, as it is often intuitively argued? And with what
   consequences? In this article, we shed light on the effectiveness of
   these campaign strategies for Eurosceptic parties during the 2019
   European elections. We argue that `harsher' campaigns are `in character'
   for Eurosceptic parties, and are as such more likely to be electorally
   successful for them. We use data from the 2019 European Parliament
   Elections Expert Survey, covering 191 unique parties, and show that,
   indeed, Eurosceptic parties are more likely to campaign in a harsh way,
   and more likely than Europhile parties to benefit electorally from it.

Abstract = {Attempting to reconcile the diverse immigration policy demands of the
   `old' working class and the `new' middle class, social democratic
   parties struggle to take a clear position on immigration policy.
   Adopting more restrictive policies is a possible way forward, but this
   is likely to lead to electorally costly intra-party conflict. This
   article illuminates the conditions under which social democratic parties
   can unite behind more restrictive immigration policies and promote them
   consistently. Employing a most-similar systems design, it presents a
   comparative case study of the Austrian and Danish social democrats, from
   the 2015 `refugee crisis' to 2020. The article argues that low levels of
   territorial decentralisation enabled the Danish social democrats to
   promote a restrictive stance on immigration top-down, while the Austrian
   social democrats' federal party structure exacerbated internal
   disagreements between urban and rural leaders. These findings highlight
   the importance of internal party characteristics in explaining how
   parties respond to strategic trade-offs. Supplemental data for this

Abstract = {This paper focuses on how immigrant activists interact with the host
   state in socio-political spheres where they exercise their citizenship.
   Located in Taiwan's New Southbound Policy (NSP), this paper adopts the
   concept of `act of citizenship' to analyse Vietnamese activists'
   interactions with the NSP. This paper finds that the NSP appropriated
   immigrant women's motherhood and family relationships in order to boost
   tourism and facilitate Southeast Asian language acquisition in the short
   term and to enhance Taiwan's relationship with Southeast Asia in the
   long run. In response, immigrant activists utilised the NSP to build
   their own capacity and to realise their acts of empowerment, compassion
   and contestation in the family and public domains. They not only
   improved individuals' wellbeing but also made the Taiwanese state
   accountable for gender bias and inequality. These findings offer a much
   needed gender perspective into immigrant activists' dialectical
   relationship with the migration state of Taiwan.},

Title = {Rethinking Women's Interests: An Inductive and Intersectional Approach
   to Defining Women's Policy Priorities},

Abstract = {Much of the vast literature on the substantive representation of women
   takes as its point of departure important a priori assumptions about the
   nature of women as a group. Calling for a rethink of many of those
   assumptions, a recent body of work recommends an inductive approach to
   defining women's interests. In line with this view, this article draws
   on a recently constructed dataset that codes nearly a million Americans'
   policy priorities over the past 75 years to explore what constitutes
   women's interests and whether gender differences in priorities cut
   across partisan and racial divisions. The results suggest there are
   consistent gender gaps across a large number of policy categories, with
   women showing particular concern for policy areas traditionally
   associated with issues of `women's interests'. While in many policy
   areas women were more likely to share policy priorities with other women
   than with their male counterparts of the same race or partisan
   background, the results also document considerable heterogeneity among
   women in various policy areas, which has major policy implications for
   the representation of women's interests.},

Abstract = {Architecture and utopia have long been allies-not least in the history
   of imagining and building the new Soviet socialist city, an obsessive
   idea and project from before the 1917 revolution to the early 1930s.
   This essay explores these efforts as a determination to obliterate the
   poisonous cities of old and transcend the suffering cities of the
   present-as practiced utopia against the dystopia of the status quo.
   ``Utopia{''} here is defined, drawing on Ernst Bloch, as perception,
   orientation, and critical method: the human impulse to ``venture
   beyond{''} the ``darkness of the lived moment{''} to discover the
   emerging ``not-yet.{''} This essay examines Russian Marxist responses
   (including among workers) to the ``hell{''} as well as the dynamism of
   the capitalist city, and examines, through the concept of ``utopia,{''}
   visionary architectural projects and arguments, including Vladimir
   Tatlin's monumental tower for the Third International (1919-20),
   ``disurbanist{''} and ``green city{''} plans in the 1920s and early
   1930s, Georgy Krutikov's flying ``City of the Future{''} in 1928, the
   work of Moisei Ginzburg, and Boris Iofan's ``Palace of Soviets{''} in
   the early 1930s.},

Abstract = {Allocating resources is a central function of government, and the
   distributive politics literature provides considerable evidence of
   leaders around the world directing resources to co-partisan voters and
   officials. In the United States, studies of `presidential particularism'
   have recently demonstrated strategic targeting by the federal executive
   branch. This letter extends the inquiry to states using an unusually
   rich case in which all governors simultaneously faced decisions about
   allocating a constrained resource - tax advantaged status for economic
   development - from an exogenously generated list of geographic
   possibilities. This study tests whether governors rewarded their
   supporters' and allies' areas alongside two alternatives: (1) spreading
   the wealth by geographic subunits and (2) policy need. It finds no
   evidence of gubernatorial particularism. Instead, Republicans and
   Democratic governors prioritized allocating opportunity zones
   geographically and made efforts to designate at least one in each
   county. They were also responsive to policy need.},

Abstract = {Tensions concerning environmental governance have increased in Brazil
   since the far-right came to power in 2016. We offer insight into this
   process by analysing the first two years of Jair Bolsonaro's
   (2019-ongoing) environmental policies-namely, how Brazil's environmental
   protection arrangements are being dismantled. We find that the Bolsonaro
   administration centralises environmental governance in Brazil through
   complementary authoritarian and populist means. First in restricting
   participatory decision-making spaces such as the National Environmental
   Council (Conama) and the National Council of the Legal Amazon (CNAL),
   and, second, by attacking indigenous and traditional peoples, NGOs,
   scientists, and other environmental defenders. To illustrate the
   authoritarian dimension of Bolsonaro's environmental governance, we
   carry out a political-institutional analysis of contemporary Brazilian
   environmental politics and then exemplify the ways and extent to which
   attacks against environmental defenders is a constituent part of
   Bolsonaro's environmental populism. We hold that such attacks are not
   merely rhetorical but a political tactic to legitimise Bolsonaro's
   authoritarian environmental governance in the promotion of `total
   extractivism' while maintaining a populist appeal.},

Abstract = {Jihadist groups are often analysed either by looking at their global
   rhetoric, or by focusing on local grievances. Despite the distinctions
   made between the global and the local issues, these groups often belong
   to a complex ``glocal jihad,{''} meaning that the borders between local,
   national, regional, transnational, and global layers, are partially
   blurred due in large part to the symbolic dimensions and imaginaries
   shared within the broader jihadist landscape. Rethinking and clarifying
   the notion of ``glocal jihad{''} and applying it to Al-Qaeda in the
   Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) reveals the complex interconnections that exist
   between the different layers and the ambiguous spatial reality of the
   group. The glocal jihad is understood as a dialectical process and as a
   sequence of events and actions occurring in intertwined layers. By
   analysing the ``glocal realities,{''} this article will attempt to craft
   a critical understanding of the group.},

Abstract = {The main task of authoritarian elections is to guarantee the survival of
   the regime. Achieving this goal, authoritarian rulers rely on
   authoritarian electoral mobilization that is employed by political
   machines, targeted mostly on poor and dependent voters. At the same
   time, since electoral autocracies permit opposition parties, those
   voters, who avoid mobilization, are able to make a choice between the
   government and the opposition. If they are dissatisfied by their
   personal or social conditions, they are liable to engage in `performance
   voting' and give their support to the opposition. In this article, we
   examine how the two logics of `mobilized voting' and `performance
   voting' relate to each other. The study is based on a large-N analysis
   of local level variations in the electoral support of Russia's three
   systemic opposition parties in 2016 Duma elections, and a unique dataset
   comprised of electoral and social-economic data, from local (municipal)
   units.},

Abstract = {The Chilcot report set out in detail its finding that the Blair
   Government had been prone to groupthink in its decision-making processes
   when leading Britain into the Iraq War. Subsequent British prime
   ministers have been in no hurry to change their style of governing in
   ways that might broaden decision-making circles and introduce the
   `challenge' that Chilcot said had been lacking. This article draws on
   the literature on the psychology of group decision-making to examine the
   extent to which groupthink remains embedded in the processes of cabinet
   government in the UK. The article argues that the strongest driver of
   groupthink is the psychological disposition towards conflict of
   individual prime ministers. Drawing on interviews with ministers, civil
   servants and special advisers we suggest that the political authority of
   the prime minister interacts with their psychological predisposition
   towards debate to encourage groupthink, polythink or a more positive
   style of `vigilant' decision-making.},

Abstract = {This article offers a new analytical framework to engage more
   effectively with the unit vs. system levels of analysis divide in
   International Relations (IR) by introducing Strategic Diplomacy. The
   systemic focus of structural theories obfuscates the crucial role of
   unit-level factors that contribute to policy outcomes, and studying
   actors and issues in isolation is equally unhelpful. By contrast,
   Strategic Diplomacy starts from a level-playing field and examines how
   actors and issues are embedded in a systemic context. The framework
   generates analytical leverage by both disaggregating the complexity of
   systems and highlighting that problem representation is entirely
   dependent on the boundaries of the system within which the problem is
   embedded. Yet, the boundaries that define a collective action problem
   are not drawn by the system alone; they are a conscious and strategic
   choice of those who analyse and make foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Legislatures are meant to represent the populace but are also racialized
   institutions capable of perpetuating structural disadvantages against
   vulnerable populations. It is necessary to periodically test if
   vulnerable populations are provided with equal access to legislative
   services. In this manuscript I test for potential ethnic discrimination
   against Hispanics in US state legislatures. A problem with prior studies
   is that Hispanicity signals both an ethnic outgroup and non-citizen
   stat. I overcome this challenge by comparing migrant Hispanics with
   migrant whites. I find that Hispanics and whites receive similar
   constituency service, as measured by reply rate and reply content, but I
   find that legislators are less likely to acquire information about
   Hispanic constituents. I advance the existing Hispanic literature by
   providing a clean comparison between Hispanics and whites with similar
   nativity backgrounds. I advance the study of discrimination by
   showcasing best practices for future studies of discrimination.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of China's outward foreign direct
   investment (FDI) on buying its state image abroad. We argue that regime
   survival has motivated China to use FDI to improve its state image and
   induce the world to accept China as a ``good{''} country without
   democracy. Our analysis shows that while world public opinion becomes
   more favorable to China when its FDI share increases, even democratic
   countries remain less favorable toward this growing power. However, when
   China's FDI share crosses a higher threshold, democratic countries'
   unfavorable view toward China is compromised and the significant
   difference in favorability between democratic and nondemocratic
   countries is diminishing. China's FDI share has no significant effect on
   improving its state image in the Asia Pacific region, in
   particular--probably due to the memory of past wars with China and
   China's aggressive geopolitical strategy that focuses more on hard power
   competition. Our empirical results are robust in terms of their
   consistency with the governments' UN voting similarity with China.},

Title = {China's evolving humanitarian diplomacy: Evidence from China's

Abstract = {Engaging in disaster relief and, more recently, post-disaster
   reconstruction in developing countries with critical geoeconomic and
   geopolitical interests has become an increasingly regular and
   institutionalized component of China's evolving humanitarian diplomacy
   over the past decade. Drawn upon novel evidence from China's growing
   disaster-related humanitarian assistance to Nepal and unprecedented
   engagement in Nepal's long-term post-earthquake rebuild since 2015, this
   article explores the dynamics behind China's transforming humanitarian
   diplomacy. The findings of this article suggest that: 1) geopolitical
   and geoeconomic interests, represented by the Belt-and-Road Initiative,
   serve as a critical driver for the development of China's bilateral
   partnership with other countries in the disaster sector; 2) long-term
   cooperation with underdeveloped countries like Nepal provides China,
   both government and non-state actors (NSAs), with an effective channel
   to engage with the international humanitarian community and to
   internalize humanitarian norms; 3) although humanitarian missions remain
   contingent and instrumental in China's international relations, they are
   laying the foundations for a specialized humanitarian policy area with
   more relevant normative assets, more professional actors, and more
   sophisticated institutions; 4) NSAs, represented by private foundations
   and civil NGOs, have played active roles in the state-dominant
   cooperation in disaster management. This article also suggests that
   intensified geopolitical confrontations, such as military clashes
   between India and China along their disputed borders over the past year,
   would lead to a high degree of politicization of humanitarian missions
   and partnerships counter-conducive to humanitarian goals.},

Abstract = {The UK is now a multi-level polity with asymmetrical minimum ages of
   enfranchisement. The franchise was first extended to 16- and
   17-year-olds in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The Scottish
   and Welsh governments now permit 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in
   elections to their devolved parliaments and local councils. The Northern
   Ireland Executive and the devolved authorities in England do not,
   however, have the power to change the voting age, and across all four
   nations of the UK, the age of franchise remains 18 for elections to the
   Westminster Parliament. The previous extension of the age of franchise,
   from 21 to 18 in 1969, attracted little controversy or political
   partisanship. But while there has been considerable political consensus
   regarding voting age reform in Scotland and Wales, debate over
   `Votes-at-16' for Westminster elections has witnessed growing
   party-based partisanship. This article draws upon elite interviews with
   politicians across the political spectrum elected to Westminster and the
   devolved institutions on their attitudes to voting age reform, conducted
   as part of a 2-year Leverhulme Trust `Lowering the Voting Age in the UK'
   project. The article argues that the multi-level party politics of the
   `Votes-at-16' debate has consolidated rival party opinions on voting age
   reform at Westminster but not beyond.},

Abstract = {In settings where war, forced migration, and humanitarian crisis have
   attracted international attention, research participants' prior
   experiences with journalists, advocacy groups, state security, and
   humanitarian organizations influence scholarly work. Building on
   long-term fieldwork in Iraq and Lebanon, this article argues that
   individuals' and communities' previous and ongoing interactions with
   these actors affect the content, quality, and validity of data gathered
   as well as shaping possibilities for ethical academic research. Drawing
   on observational and interview-based research with humanitarian service
   providers, journalists, and displaced persons, this article argues that
   the cross-sector use of ``methodological cognates{''} such as surveys
   and structured interviews shapes data validity and reliability via four
   mechanisms: regurgitation, redirection, reluctant participation, and
   resistance. I contend that these features of the research process should
   centrally inform academics' research designs, project siting, case
   selection, and data analysis.},

Abstract = {Current scholarship analyzes how gender influences the character-based
   traits and belief-based traits that women candidates are attributed. Yet
   little is known about the effect of the intersection of candidate sex
   and ethnicity on stereotyping. Thus, I explore whether candidate
   stereotyping functions similarly for Latina candidates as it does for
   white women. I also test if the race or ethnicity of the voter plays any
   role in how Latina women candidates are stereotyped. Given that we know
   that race/ethnicity matter for voters, particularly voters of color, I
   assess what occurs when candidate sex is also included. With the use of
   original survey data and through the use of difference of means tests I
   analyze how a Latina candidate compares with three other candidate types
   on feminine, masculine, and belief-based traits. I also compare how
   stereotyping varies based on the race and ethnicity of the voter. On the
   one hand my results are mixed regarding how Latina candidates are
   stereotyped, while on the other I do find that Latina/o respondents
   assess Latina candidates in a more favorable manner relative to white
   respondents.},

Abstract = {Polling place consolidation makes administering voting easier but
   scholars question the effect on turnout. Vote centers (which consolidate
   polling locations) are theoretically less expensive to administer and
   convenient for many voters, but less is known about the impacts on
   specific racial communities or across election cycles. Using Texas'
   registered voters' list from the Secretary of State's Voting Division,
   this paper uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to calculate
   estimated driving distances from each registered voter's residence to a
   vote center location. The results show that the displacement of
   traditional precinct-level voting and the increase in distance between
   polling locations takes a greater toll on voter turnout for voters in
   midterm (but not presidential) elections and rural counties with more
   Latino voters. The implications demonstrate that vote centers can boost
   turnout in some elections but that the location of vote centers
   significantly effects turnout among ethnic minorities.},

Abstract = {Brexit is about more than the UK exiting the EU. For the Conservative
   Party, it is about reacting to the challenge from the radical right,
   both in terms of the electoral threat from UKIP and a long-term internal
   struggle between moderate Conservatives and the more radical Eurosceptic
   faction within the party. We ask to what extent Brexit could also be
   considered as the mobilisation of specific welfare chauvinist discourses
   and practices. Through a combination of Qualitative Content Analysis
   (QCA) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of key speeches and
   documents from the official Leave campaign, we demonstrate that, rather
   than merely reinforcing deservingness along ethno-national lines, Brexit
   invokes social citizenship to delegitimize EU institutions. The
   referendum result catalyses a longer-term redrawing of the boundaries of
   social citizenship, and the ideas of membership that grants access to
   services and benefits. Brexit is discursively framed to mobilise people
   to consent to this redrawing of boundaries.},

Abstract = {Accountability for serious human rights violations and atrocity crimes
   has established itself at the top of the international community's legal
   agenda, not least to serve justice to the victims of the crimes. Efforts
   to refer the atrocities in Syria to the permanent International Criminal
   Court have been in vain, highlighting the need for third states
   exercising extra-territorial jurisdiction. Sweden has answered the call
   to investigate the crimes, and the strong position afforded to victims
   of crime in the Swedish criminal justice system suggests that it is
   well-suited to provide them the justice they are entitled to. This
   article draws on the experiences gained in the seven trials to date in
   which victims have participated, to assess the extent to which
   international legal obligations towards the victims are implemented and
   were accessible to the victims. Through analysis of legal documents and
   interviews, the author demonstrates that, while the Swedish system has
   been fulfilling a wide range of international legal obligations towards
   victims of crime, the remoteness in time and place, the large number of
   victims involved and other specifics of the investigations and trials,
   challenge several central aspects of the Swedish system, such as the
   right to information, support and reparation.},

Abstract = {In expressing his appreciation for the work of David Ruccio's blog,
   Occasional Links \& Commentary, Richard Wolff discusses the common
   experiences of faculty members working from heterodox economics theories
   in the U.S. university system following the turn to neoclassical
   economics. After the marginalization and eventual removal of the notable
   heterodox economics department at the University of Notre Dame, Ruccio
   turned to blogging as a way of translating academically formulated
   concepts into and for general discussion with a wider readership that
   includes activists, social critics, academics, journalists, and a new
   generation of leftist politicians. This work of ``popularization,{''}
   rather than nonscientific, has constituted an important contribution to
   long-overdue social change.},

Abstract = {In this study, using the descriptive-analytical method, we discuss the
   main factors in the formation of the Yemen crisis, as well as the
   attitudes of the two Arab states and of the two neighboring countries,
   Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in the Yemen crisis. It is
   concluded that this crisis stems not only from the role of local actors,
   but also from the role of regional and global actors, who played a
   decisive role in shaping and exacerbating the Yemen crisis. Regional
   players in the post-2015 crisis include the United Arab Emirates and
   Saudi Arabia, which showed contradictory behavior. Saudi Arabia's
   targets in its attack on Yemen have a greater military and security
   dimension. The political and economic objectives of the United Arab
   Emirates, which is Riyadh's most important ally in this war, have been
   at a different level from those of Saudi Arabia. This can be seen in Abu
   Dubai Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed's aspirations to expand his
   country's influence, to become a major player in the region.},

Abstract = {Loyalty is a permanent concern to dictators. It is unclear, however,
   whether loyalty to a dictator assures the ruling group's cohesiveness.
   This study shows that authoritarian political elites under promotion
   pressure, while remaining loyal to their superior, also compete within
   factions to outrival their peers. Exploiting data on Chinese provincial
   leaders and local media reports on corruption investigations and
   industrial accidents (2000-2014), we find that Chinese elites promote
   negative news related to their co-faction peers as frequently as - or,
   depending on the measure, even more often than - they promote similar
   news regarding members of other factions. We also find that negative
   reports indeed reduce the promotion probability of reported cadres,
   while increasing that of reporting ones.},

Abstract = {In the era of the Islamic Revolution and later the traditional networks
   and connections available in Iran that were generally religious, such
   as: mosques, tekyehs (place of Shia mourning for Imam Hussein),
   religious boards and seminaries, along with also religious values and
   norms in society a particular form of social capital was created. The
   main objective of the study is to analyze the formation and increase of
   social capital in the Islamic Republic of Iran. To achieve this
   objective, descriptive and documentary data collection methods are used.
   The collected materials are then categorized and used using the tab
   technique to obtain considered results. Based on the results obtained,
   it can be concluded that the existing traditional networks in Iran that
   continued to the farthest reaches of Iran, religious norms are mentioned
   as effective factors in the creation and increase of social capital and
   a factor of confidence-building between social and religious leaders.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that racial attitudes, by forming through
   early socialization processes, are causally prior to most things
   political, including whites' party identifications. Yet a broad
   literature demonstrates that partisanship can shape mass attitudes. The
   author argues that this influence extends even to presumptively
   fundamental predispositions like racial attitudes. The study applies
   cross-lagged models to panel data from the 1990s and 2000s to
   demonstrate that whites align their racial attitudes with their party
   loyalties. The results demonstrate that partisanship has a more
   pronounced influence in the latter time period, which is consistent with
   a view that changes in the political context can make partisanship a
   more likely causal force on other attitudes. Racial concerns not only
   provide a foundation for political conflict: my results reveal that
   political processes can increase or decrease racial animus.},

Abstract = {Although an object of increasing interest, researching illegal
   activities generates a range of methodological challenges for political
   scientists. Rather than an exhaustive discussion, this article provides
   a simple framework that structures these challenges. It highlights that
   illegality is an insufficient guide to method development and needs to
   be supplemented by an analysis of three dimensions in addition to
   legality: enforcement, normalization, and ethics. The article explains
   that beyond providing insight into the feasibility and challenges of
   different methodologies, examining these dimensions also directly points
   researchers to key political science questions about illegal activities.},

Title = {The effects of US-China competing strategies in Asia-Pacific on India
   and Pakistan rivalry in the South Asian region},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {888-906},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article primarily focuses on how the increasing US-China competing
   strategies in Asia-Pacific affect the policies of South Asian rivals
   India and Pakistan when, on the one hand, the US as part of its offshore
   balancing grand strategy has been increasing its strategic partnership
   with India through the transfer of emerging technologies in terms of
   military modernization process, and on the other hand, China and
   Pakistan have improved their geo-economic and geostrategic partnership
   as part of the Chinese grand strategy via the Belt and Road Initiative
   while enabling Pakistan to produce effective countermeasures against its
   potential adversary. The article presumes that, in doing so, such
   competing strategies frame a quadrangle setting comprising of US and
   India to deter and contain China on the one hand and China and Pakistan
   to produce countermeasures and try to create a balance to potentially
   prevent the risk of conflict in South Asia out of such competing
   strategies at the quadrangle order conceived here. However, in fact,
   neither the US nor rising China would desire such a possibility of
   conflict otherwise unintendedly occurring from the intense US-China
   competing strategies while affecting the policies of the South Asian
   rivals. The article concludes that the shaping of this quadrangle
   framework may bring both opportunities and challenges for the South
   Asian rivals. It also concludes that the more intense the competition
   between the US and China becomes, the more intense its implications
   could be on the South Asian rivals, while the reduced tension between
   China and the US, although unlikely, would have reduced pressure on
   India and Pakistan relations as well.},

Abstract = {Studies of a small number of countries have revealed that both
   democratic and non-democratic subnational governments can exist within a
   single country. However, these works have neither demonstrated how
   common subnational regime variation is nor explained why some countries
   are more prone to it. This article does both. We show that subnational
   regime variation exists in all world regions, in both unitary and
   federal states, and in both the present and past, using Varieties of
   Democracy global data from 1900 to 2018. The article also demonstrates
   theoretically and empirically how social heterogeneity and factors
   undermining a national government's ability to extend control throughout
   a country promote this variation. Specifically, subnational regime
   variation is more common in countries that are ethnically diverse,
   rugged, and populous.},

Abstract = {The traditional functions of public administration have increasingly
   expanded to include the implementation of social purposes and the
   achievement of substantial equality.
   In this paper the notion of ``result administration{''}, in its
   polysemic meaning, is used on the hand, precisely, to identify its
   contents; on the other hand, to question the paradigm of necessity of
   ``public{''} administration as the best way to achieve social ends.
   With respect to this last point, there are many aspects that allow, in
   order to achieve the desired result, to develope that forms of
   public-private cooperation in the exercise of the administrative
   function, such as those determined by the generalization of co
   programming and co-planning of services of general interest (betwen
   public administrations and the third sector entities), are at the basis
   of the possible affirmation of new administration paradigms.},

Abstract = {Based on the premise that the roles of men and women are distinct in the
   economy, and, at the same time, that they are reinforced by political
   decisions and by social structure, the objective of this work is to
   investigate what was the role of female participation in the Bangladeshi
   garment industry for the country's successful economic performance
   between 1980s and 2020. Relying on a heterodox analytical perspective
   and using a case study, I demonstrate that there has been no significant
   technological progress, productive diversification nor economic
   development in Bangladesh at the pace of the country's GDP growth rates.
   In addition, the increased demand for female labor in the garment
   industry, a key sector of the economy, has not removed women from the
   condition of dependence or subordination to men, since gender
   inequalities persist in the country's labor market.},

Abstract = {A persistent question in the study of American political history has
   been the capacity of one-party government in the American South to
   represent its voting citizens. In this article, we use county-level
   returns from prohibition referendums to create measures of citizen
   preferences for prohibition at the legislative district level for both
   the South and the non-South. We then examine the relationship between
   these preferences and roll call votes on alcohol-related issues in the
   US House and on votes to ratify the Eighteenth Amendment in state
   legislatures. We find strong relationships between preferences and roll
   call voting in both the North and South and find no consistent evidence
   that responsiveness is higher or lower in the South than the North. This
   indicates that, on at least one salient issue, a competitive party
   system was not a precondition for legislative representation in the
   one-party South.},

Abstract = {Through the dialectical method the objective of the article was to
   analyze the process of the elaboration of modern laws, considering their
   structure and main problems. There is a major structure and problems
   inherent in the modern law-making process described in the article. The
   structure of law-making comprises four parts: 1. Cognitive-analytical
   part; 2. Theoretical foundations of the legal norms and acts they
   dictate; 3. Validation of legal act or norm; 4. Monitoring of relevant
   rules and legal acts. The main legislative task is to draft legal norms
   that stimulate the active development of all parts of the State and
   society through a deep perception of all related processes, including
   those involving standard-setting. It is concluded that the main factor
   affecting the quality of legislation is the lack of a uniform
   legislative basis for the issuance of legal acts. There seems to be a
   real need to develop a uniform legislative act on the law-making
   process. The Code containing general and specific parts of each law must
   be developed.},

Abstract = {In modern conditions of development of public relations complication of
   activity of law enforcement agencies is observed. This is due to new
   challenges in the law enforcement system, including the fight against
   high levels of the organization and the criminal professionalism of
   corrupt individuals. Because of this, it is challenging for operational
   units to identify specificfacts of illegal actions with the help of
   operational and investigative measures. At the same time, the fight
   against crime by establishing high quantitative indicators of disclosure
   remains one of the principles of law enforcement in Ukraine, including
   sometimes deviating from those means established by law. Therefore, the
   problem of provoking bribery is relevant for scholars of the legislator
   and law enforcement. The object of the study is criminal liability for
   provoking bribery. The research methodology consists of such methods as
   the dialectical method, analytical method, historical method, method of
   analysis of legal documents, articles, and monographs, method of
   generalization, comparison, synthesis, and modeling method. The authors
   identified the features of such liability to clarify the problematic
   issues of qualification of provoking bribery, and to distinguish the
   distinctive features of prosecution from other types of crimes.},

Title = {Ethiopia: Tomo-Indigenous Conflict Resolution Mechanism of the
   Benc Community},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {36},
Pages = {83-94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Tomo indigenous conflict resolution approach is practiced by the Bent
   ethnic group and their neighboring communities within the southwestern
   fringe of Ethiopia. As an indigenous apparatus, the Tomo approach
   exhibits spirituality through blessing and cursing which are directed
   against the accused based on complying or contravening the very
   indigenous dispute management rules and regulations. The objective of
   this study was exploring the custom through which the studied community
   deals with conflict by using the indigenous Tomo approach. In pursuit of
   this objective, the researcher utilized a qualitative approach,
   particularly phenomenology. In terms of data collection tools, the
   researcher used key-informant interview with selected Bent ritual
   leaders, non-participant observation on Tomo adjudication sessions and
   critical document analysis. Built up on such data sources, the findings
   of the study discovered five inferences. First, regardless of the fact
   that Tomo is an indigenous approach owed by Bent communities, none of
   the Bent neighboring communities make use of it. Secondly, the majority
   of cases seen by Tomo institution are issues that deify credible
   eyewitness and are cumbersome for verification and/or falsification
   within the mainstream court system. Thirdly, unlike the habitual Tomo
   practice within the Bent community, contemporary Tomo exhibits two
   conflicting formality and informality characteristics. Due to its
   semi-formal nature, contemporary Tomo ritual leaders notify charges
   against the presumed wrongdoer by sending an invitation letter for the
   accused to attend the charges against him/her, comparable with formal
   courts. Contrary to this formality, contemporary Tomo is also
   characterized by informality due to the fact that verdicts given against
   the perpetrator are passed through ritual cursing just like the habitual
   Tomo. Furthermore, identical with the habitual Tomo practice, cursing
   within contemporary Tomo goes the presumed wrongdoer including his/her
   family up to some future generations along with those who feast and bury
   the presumed wrongdoer. Overall, contemporary Tomo has terrifying
   delinquency deterring outcome along with the accustomed indigenous
   conflict resolution mechanism features.},

Title = {Celebrities, Advertising Endorsement, and Political Marketing in Spain:
   The Popular Party's April 2019 Election Campaign},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {One of political marketing's theoretical tenets is the translation of
   commercial advertising techniques to politics. This paper focuses on
   celebrity endorsement as a commercial technique which is translated into
   political campaigning. Celebrity endorsement relates directly to
   celebrity politics, that is, the result of celebrity culture getting in
   touch with politics, as a way of revitalizing the offering of parties
   and candidates. In this context, our study analyzes the representation
   and use of celebrity politicians in Spain by the conservative Popular
   Party (PP) during the April 2019 national election. In order to shed
   light on the way celebrities were used in the PP's social media
   campaign, we content-analyze 1,117 Twitter messages taken from the
   party's profile, as well as conservative presidential candidate Pablo
   Casado's profile. Analytical variables include frequency of mentions,
   the strategic axis (rational/emotional) with which celebrities were
   depicted, the features which were highlighted, and the type of
   endorsement performed by the celebrities. Message topics and functions
   were also added to the analysis. Results indicate a weak and flawed
   strategic use of celebrities, who were scarcely mentioned, and depicted
   in a non-innovative, traditional fashion. Supplemental data for this
   article is available online at

Abstract = {We use a natural experiment to study how the announcement of the UK
   COVID-19 lockdown affected citizens' attitudes towards the pandemic and
   the government's response to it. On the day of the lockdown
   announcement, YouGov ran a survey that captured responses before and
   after the announcement. Comparison of these responses suggests that the
   lockdown announcement made people more supportive of the government's
   response to the crisis but also (perhaps surprisingly) more concerned
   about the pandemic. Analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects suggests
   that the announcement narrowed gaps in perceptions of the crisis,
   increasing support for the government's response especially among those
   who had been least supportive and increasing concern about the pandemic
   especially among those who had been least concerned. Overall, the
   findings highlight a tension inherent in governing during times of
   crisis: actions that increase people's confidence in government and
   induce compliance with government directives may also tend to increase
   anxiety among the population.},

Abstract = {States use elements of their culture to promote their influence in
   countries of strategic importance to them. Despite a growing body of
   literature on soft power, there is a shortage of literature on Iran's
   influence in its neighbourhood. How is Iran viewed in Pakistan? This
   article is based on in-depth interviews and an online survey with
   informed participants in Pakistan. Our findings demonstrate that while
   many participants view Tehran's policies negatively, the majority see
   Iran in a favourable light. This article found that Iran's multi-pronged
   strategy connects with pre-existing trends and pressure points in
   Pakistan at different levels. As a majority-Shi'a country, Iran has
   become a point of reference for the Shi'a community in Pakistan. Its
   anti-American rhetoric corresponds with an anti-US current in Pakistan,
   and Tehran's invocation of Persian culture and poetry resonates with a
   nostalgic view of Persian culture amongst Pakistan's educated elite.},

Abstract = {Scholars continue to wrestle with determining the extent and ways in
   which religiosity - and particularly more strict religious views and
   practices - provides fertile ground for the emergence and growth of
   terrorism. Using large samples of Muslim respondents from across the
   Indonesian archipelago, we find that: (1) higher levels of orthodox
   religiosity are associated with more negative attitudes to non-Muslims,
   and (2) higher levels of orthodox religiosity are associated with lower
   support for terrorist groups. We propose that this finding is consistent
   with the type of orthodox religiosity of Indonesian santri - that is,
   observant Muslims - which is usually characterised by collective
   religious practices, affiliation with religious mass organisations and
   religious education. In the Indonesian context, orthodox religiosity
   might provide vehicles but not motives of terrorist mobilisation, and -
   although it can foster negative views of out-groups - it can actually
   constitute a barrier to broader support for terrorism.},

Abstract = {The architecture of fiscal federalism in the United States represents an
   obstacle for prompt and comprehensive policy responses to economic
   crises, especially by subnational levels of government. As both a public
   health and economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has put unique fiscal
   pressures on subnational governments. This article reviews the
   pandemic's fiscal effects on these governments, as well as the federal
   government's response. By comparing the response to the COVID-19 crisis
   during the Trump administration with the response to the Great Recession
   during the Obama administration, we show that while the speed and
   magnitude of federal aid was unprecedented in 2020, it was nevertheless
   conditional in nature and beset by familiar political and institutional
   obstacles. Despite major fiscal pressures, state revenues rebounded
   earlier than expected, in part due to the relaxation of public health
   measures and the collection of taxes from online transactions; yet,
   state resources remained strained throughout the year, especially in
   states reliant on the hospitality and the oil sectors. And while local
   property taxes were buoyed by a surging housing market, cities and
   counties were confronted with declining revenue from other sources and
   intense emergency spending needs. Thus, despite unprecedented levels of
   federal support for state and local governments, the legacies of ``fend
   for yourself{''} federalism live on.},

Abstract = {This article considers the ways in which partisanship structured public
   attitudes about the United States' multiple governments as each tried to
   mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the spring and summer of 2020.
   The evidence shows that Democrats and Republicans both made distinctions
   among their local, state, and federal governments, assigning them
   different functional responsibilities. Yet, members of the two parties
   did not agree on that division of intergovernmental responsibility.
   Rather, across a variety of issues, polarized partisan identities
   structured beliefs about the operation and efficacy of the American
   federal system's ability to contend with the spread of coronavirus.
   Moreover, these beliefs did not stem from prior ideological commitments
   or the different composition of Democratic or Republican communities.
   Instead, party leaders proved especially capable of shifting public
   attitudes on questions of federal versus state authority through their
   shifting rhetoric and strategic framing.},

Abstract = {Presidents often make references to their predecessors in their oral
   remarks-a rhetorical tool that can advance support for their policies,
   define their presidency, and achieve political gains. And yet, despite
   the frequency that this rhetorical tool is used and its possible impact,
   references to former presidents have so far defied a systematic
   empirical research. To fill in this void in the literature, we examine
   the frequency of references to presidents, the identity of referenced
   presidents, and the policy context of each reference in all oral
   references made by presidents Reagan through Trump. We demonstrate that
   mentioning former presidents is a political tool that presidents use
   routinely in their public speeches. We find that presidents use this
   tool strategically-controlling the timing and identity of references and
   in connection to their policy appeals.},

Abstract = {Aspiring dominant-party regimes often institute major institutional and
   political reforms at the national level to ensure they retain control.
   However, subnational politics is an important, under-studied, component
   of regime consolidation. This study uses mayoral races in Hungary and
   Poland from 2006 to 2018 to examine two factors that may inhibit
   dominant-party regime consolidation in local politics: the use of
   two-round, i.e. runoff, electoral systems and strategic coordination
   among opposition parties. While we find little evidence that strategic
   coordination can lead to widespread opposition success in single-round
   systems, we do find that increasing the number of candidates decreases
   the likelihood of the nationally dominant party winning in the first
   round while not affecting the second round. As such, two-round mayoral
   elections may be an important buffer to dominant-party regime
   consolidation and may provide a training ground for the future
   opposition.},

Abstract = {Brexit has caused a chasmic divide in the UK. Voters and Parliament are
   divided, as are the UK's major political parties. Such divisions may not
   be so surprising, however, given that Brexit crosses traditional party
   lines. Preferences to leave or remain do not fit neatly onto the
   traditional Left/Right dimension. Instead, the idea that European
   integration constitutes a new dimension in party competition has been
   gaining ground. This article creates a typology of Brexit `clusters'
   through a discourse analysis of Conservative and Labour MPs, building an
   intricate picture of the archetypal positions of parliamentarians during
   the cacophonous Brexit period. Six clusters of MPs are found, crossing
   party lines and indicating that a Europe-related dimension is taking
   hold in British politics. Proposals for future research using the
   typology are also put forward.},

Abstract = {Not all pieces of legislation introduced for consideration are equally
   likely to be successful. The characteristics of legislation's cosponsors
   can influence bill passage rates. Despite facing marginalization in
   legislative bodies and more electoral vulnerability, women are effective
   lawmakers. We argue that one way by which women overcome marginalization
   and gendered expectations of performance is bill success from
   legislation cosponsored with other women. Testing this expectation on
   bills (140,000+) introduced in U.S. state legislatures in forty states
   in 2015, we find increased bill success from women's cosponsorship with
   each other and women from the other party. Using variation in the share
   of women in legislative chambers and in legislative leadership, we find
   evidence to suggest that women's success emerges both from
   marginalization and gendered opportunities.},

Abstract = {The Principality of Hutt River was founded in 1970. Led by a committed
   and eccentric family, the Principality was Australia's most famous
   micronation. Micronations assert their claims to sovereignty in myriad
   ways. In this article, we explore what it means to be a micronation by
   contrasting this phenomenon with Indigenous peoples and communities who
   also assert a right to sovereignty. As we explain, Indigenous nations
   are not micronations because they possess a historical claim to
   legitimacy. We also explore Australia's approach to micronations.
   Australia has a disproportionately high representation of micronations
   relative to its population. We consider three reasons why this may be
   the case.},

Abstract = {An emerging body of literature seeks to understand the determinants of
   roll-call participation in the early U.S. House of Representatives. A
   multitude of factors-electoral, institutional, and partisan-exerted
   significant influence over members' participation decisions during the
   time we analyze. We analyze roll-call abstention rates from the 16th to
   66th Congress (1819 to 1921) to determine whether electorally at-risk
   members differed in their attentiveness to their congressional
   responsibilities than members who faced less or no risk. By examining a
   century of congresses, we compare both the post-Civil War era
   immediately prior to adoption of the Australian ballot as well as the
   pre-Civil War congresses to identify those factors that affected
   members' decision to participate on roll-call votes. The time series
   encompasses important electoral and institutional reforms, including the
   emergence of strong party caucuses and the enhanced agenda setting
   prerogatives of the majority party. Our results show that members
   responded to changes in the political environment, including to
   electoral concerns, and this effect is present prior to the Civil War.
   We also find that during the era of the strong Speaker, majority party
   members significantly increased their roll-call participation rates.},

   in need of invitation onto Indigenous lands and that, as colonial
   denizens, non-Indigenous Canadians take up an ethos that encourages them
   to re-evaluate their lives and relations with Indigenous peoples,
   Indigenous lands and the settler state. Such re-evaluations would
   encourage settlers to question the sovereignty of the state and their
   daily relations, as well as encourage them to place responsibilities to
   others above inwardly focused rights. I contend that identifying and
   acting upon such an ethos can provide a way through which non-Indigenous
   peoples can appropriately and seriously meet Indigenous peoples' calls
   for change.},

Abstract = {Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of
   disinformation and conspiracy narratives that feed on the people's
   distrust of institutions. We investigate perceptions and beliefs related
   to COVID-19 in Romania during the lockdown and the state of alert (April
   and July 2020) using survey data. Building on measures tested in
   previous research, we identify the public's vulnerability to conspiracy
   narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. We
   test whether individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western
   attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives
   compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those
   believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with
   public health recommendations. We find an indirect relationship between
   distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines.
   Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to
   stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and
   knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn are associated with reduced
   compliance with official guidelines. This suggests that openness to
   anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. The findings
   highlight potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic,
   especially in the young democracies of Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {A large literature shows that citizens care about the procedural
   fairness of rules and institutions. This body of work suggests that
   citizen evaluations of institutional changes should be constrained by
   fairness considerations, even if they would personally benefit from the
   reforms. We test this expectation using two panel studies to examine
   whether citizens become more accepting of proposals rated as unfair (in
   wave one) after we experimentally manipulate (in wave two) whether the
   proposals aid their party's electoral prospects. Using this approach, we
   are able to establish what citizens see to be fair or unfair separate
   from their evaluation of a given rule change. We find that supporters of
   both parties are consistently more favorable toward reforms their fellow
   partisans and, crucially, they themselves, claim reduce electoral
   fairness when framed as advancing their partisan interests. The results
   provide important insights into how citizens evaluate electoral
   processes, procedural fairness, and, hence, the acceptable limits of
   institutional change.},

Abstract = {The place left to citizens in modern democracies is still an ongoing
   debate. Do they participate and how in France is the topic of this
   article. Some scholars point out the declining level of turnout and
   consider that representative democracy is under pressure. Other argue
   that citizens participate differently through protest. In this article,
   we investigate how participation has evolved since the 1980's and
   demonstrate the major impact of generational replacement in these
   matters We demonstrate how the participation repertoire evolve between
   citizens born before World War 2, Baby-Boomers and Post-Baby-Boomers and
   how these transformations interact with social inequalities,
   particularly among the recent cohorts.},

Abstract = {Will experience with direct democracy influence men's and women's
   political beliefs differently? Despite the closed gender gap in voter
   turnout, women remain less interested in politics and participate less
   frequently in non-voting activities than men. Scholars find women's
   lower sense of internal political efficacy as the origins of these
   gender gaps. In this paper, I examine whether the experience of direct
   participation in political decision-making alters women's feelings of
   internal political efficacy differently from it does men's. Building on
   the insights from the literature on the gendered psychological traits, I
   theorize that voting in referendums will promote men's internal
   political efficacy but not women's, because of women's greater
   susceptibility to the psychological costs of participation in
   referendums. Using an original panel survey conducted shortly before and
   after the 2018 abortion referendum in Ireland, I demonstrate the
   presence of the gendered effect in voting in referendums: While men
   reported increased internal political efficacy after voting in the
   referendum, women did not experience any meaningful change, even though
   the issue magnified women's psychological engagement with the vote. My
   findings suggest that differences in psychological dispositions between
   men and women create gendered reactions to citizen experience in the
   political arena.},

Abstract = {European institutionalisation of public health policy has never been
   more topical than in the COVID-19 era. One European agency has come to
   the fore: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
   Historically, the ECDC's mandate has expanded only gradually and the
   management of transboundary health crises has remained ultimately in the
   hands of Member States. The unprecedented severity of COVID-19 has led
   the European Commission to propose an extension of the ECDC's mandate.
   This study assesses the expansion of the formal and informal mandates of
   the ECDC over 15 years to contextualise the catalytic impact of
   COVID-19. It is found that while institutional change occurs in the
   aftermath of a transboundary health crisis, it builds on a long-term
   process of gradual institutionalisation that is accelerated by the
   crisis acting as a catalyst but not fully determined by it.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a theoretical framework to analyze conditional
   cash transfer programs, as the result of a process of social policy
   innovation in Brazil. The analysis reveals a traceable process of
   innovation behind the creation of two of these programs, Bolsa Familia
   and Bolsa Verde. By focusing on the main drivers in the emergence of
   Brazilian cash transfer programs, the article analyzes the innovations
   in their evolution and shows that these programs are part of sequential
   policy learning. By exploring the drivers, actors, and phases of social
   policy innovation in Brazil, the article contributes to the literature
   on cash transfer programs by theorizing on how these social assistance
   programs innovate, endure, and expand over time. Furthermore, Brazil's
   trajectory of social assistance development dissected in this article
   reveals Bolsa Familia and Bolsa Verde as outcomes of institutional
   dynamics that attempted to foster social investment and to reduce risks
   of poverty. In terms of specific contributions, the article identifies
   and delves into the configuration of multilevel network supporting cash
   transfer programs and the sequential phases of the development of these
   programs in Brazil that reveal a policy learning mechanism.},

Abstract = {This article is the first expressly to focus on membership ballots as an
   instrument in the selection of parliamentary candidates in Finland, a
   polity in which the nomination process is inclusive and decentralised. A
   Finnish case study is of comparative interest for three main reasons:
   (i) Finland is one of the few European countries in which candidate
   selection is regulated by the state; (ii) challenging much of the
   literature, the combination of democratised selection procedures and an
   intraparty preference voting system has not incentivised individualistic
   parliamentary behaviour and reduced legislative party unity; (iii)
   contrary to the trend towards the democratisation of nominations
   elsewhere, membership ballots, from being routinised and internalised in
   the four larger historic parties, have become the exception rather than
   the rule in Finland today. Accordingly, this paper assesses the changing
   trajectory of membership ballots and asks what does their
   de-institutionalisation indicate about the {[}changing] dynamics of
   intraparty participatory democracy?},

Abstract = {Based on real option theory and transaction cost theory, we hypothesize
   that a high level of governing party fractionalization in the host
   country's government fosters FDI because high governing party
   fractionalization is associated with low economic policy uncertainty. By
   using the data of governing party fractionalization in 135 host
   countries and greenfield FDI projects from China from 2003 to 2015, the
   findings of the study confirm the positive effect of governing party
   fractionalization on FDI. Moreover, the results of our studies confirm
   that the positive effect of governing party fractionalization on FDI is
   weakened for investing firms with experience in host countries and with
   central government ownership, for FDI projects conducted in natural
   resource industries, and in host countries with high GDP growth and low
   capital abundance. We further confirm that economic policy uncertainty
   is a mechanism through which governing party fractionalization
   influences FDI.},
