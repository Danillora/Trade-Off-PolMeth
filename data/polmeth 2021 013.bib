Abstract = {Do citizens welcome the involvement of independent experts in politics?
   Theoretical and empirical work so far provides conflicting answers to
   this question. On the one hand, citizens may demand expert involvement
   in political decision-making processes in order to ensure efficient and
   effective governance solutions. On the other hand, citizens can be
   distrustful of experts and reject the unaccountable and non-transparent
   nature of expert-based governance. This note investigates citizen
   preferences for the involvement of experts in different stages of
   political processes and across `hard' and `easy' political issues.
   Results show that, in the absence of explicit output information,
   respondents prefer independent experts over national elected
   representatives in the policy design and implementation stages, across
   political issues. For the crucial stage of decision making, respondents
   show no difference in their evaluation of processes that delegate
   decisions to experts or to elected representatives, with the exception
   of environmental policy, where expert decision making is preferred.
   These findings are relevant for ongoing discussions on how to
   incorporate independent experts in political decision making in a way
   that citizens find legitimate and on how to address increased citizen
   dissatisfaction with the representative democratic functions performed
   by political parties, governments and politicians.},

Abstract = {The essay analyses the politicisation of the concept of women through
   the re-signification of domestic space. The text analyses in particular
   the thought of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, examining especially Women and
   Economics (1898) and The Home: its Work and Influence (1903). In the
   first part, the American context and some of the earlier reflections on
   the home are reconstructed. Then it is noted how Gilman links the
   oppression of women to the restraint on the evolution of society.
   Finally, it is highlighted how the politicisation of the house goes hand
   in hand with its exposure to experts and efficiency criteria, in order
   to show how Gilman's proposal contains both potentials and risks.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {209-225},

Abstract = {This article analyzes individuals' preferences for a consensus or a
   majoritarian type of democracy. We theorize that variation in these
   preferences is a function of both institutional learning (long term) and
   individuals' position as a political minority or majority (short term).
   First, as a result of institutional learning, we expect that individuals
   living in democracies characterized by coalition governments will favor
   consensus democracy. Conversely, those living in countries characterized
   by single-party executives will favor majoritarian democracy. Second, we
   expect that individuals' position as an electoral minority or majority
   will affect these beliefs. Those who vote for small parties will favor a
   consensus democracy, while those who vote for large parties will support
   a majoritarian system. However, whether institutional learning or
   individuals' position as a political minority or majority prevail in
   influencing these preferences about the ideal model of democracy will be
   a function of the democratic trajectory of each country. We test these
   arguments drawing on data from the European Social Survey.},

Abstract = {Leo Strauss, in Philosophy and Law (1935), offers Platonic theocracy as
   a more just and stable political alternative to both liberalism and
   authoritarianism. Rather than merely a scholastic investigation of
   medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, I read the book as a
   programmatic endorsement of a morally perfectionist political order: a
   divinely legitimated and rationally justified ``true{''} or
   ``beautiful{''} state. Since human beings require political community to
   suppress their evil inclinations and promote their disposition toward
   the good, Strauss criticizes liberalism for contending that government
   should remain neutral regarding good and evil and modern
   authoritarianism for effectively committing idolatry by politically
   instrumentalizing theology. I demonstrate that Strauss's long-neglected
   book is particularly relevant for our own ``postsecular age,{''} an age
   when adherents of religious orthodoxy increasingly demand concessions
   from liberal democracies and resurgent state authoritarianism frequently
   cloaks itself in religious trappings.},

Abstract = {Two mechanisms of costly signaling are known in international relations:
   sinking costs and tying hands. I show that there exist four mechanisms
   of costly signaling that are equally general. I develop the new
   mechanisms of installment costs and reducible costs and contrast them
   with sunk costs and tied-hands costs. I then conduct experiments to test
   the four signaling mechanisms. I find that each mechanism can improve
   credibility when the costs are high, but reducible costs can improve
   credibility even when the costs are low.},

   Policy Responsiveness in the French Parliament},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in personal representation and policy
   responsiveness in the European literature. The current scholarship
   mainly focuses on strong legislatures. This article aims to contribute
   to the discussion about policy responsiveness by investigating the least
   likely case, France. It asks whether French MPs engage in policy
   responsiveness, and if they do, how responsiveness interacts with party
   agenda and electoral vulnerability. Drawing on written parliamentary
   questions asked by French MPs from 1997 to 2007 (N = 1172), the article
   shows that MPs' behaviour is strongly affected by their district
   features. Moreover, the article shows that party agenda conditions the
   impact of district features. MPs are more likely to engage in policy
   responsiveness when the issue is also essential for the party. In other
   words, policy responsiveness is not independent of the party agenda. The
   article thus contributes to a better understanding of the
   personalisation of political representation and its relationship with
   political parties.},

Abstract = {Although research on interest group influence has had a revival in
   recent decades, little is known about interest group influence on
   political parties. This study considers how parties' goals can affect
   interest groups' ability to influence these actors. Interest groups are
   expected to be more likely to influence parties that are ideologically
   approximate to the interest groups as well as parties that are more
   willing to make policy compromises; the access that interest groups have
   to parties mediates these effects. Results from the empirical analysis
   of 5000 party-interest group observations from Denmark, France, Germany,
   the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom support these
   expectations. In addition to contributing to the literature on parties
   and interest groups, the findings shed light on party position taking
   and when the link between citizens and parties is likely to be affected
   by interest groups. Supplemental data for this article can be accessed

Abstract = {The effects of news coverage on political attitudes in election
   campaigns have been widely studied in academic research. In particular,
   a fertile branch of the literature investigated the impact of news media
   negativity on turnout. To date, however, findings are mixed, precluding
   to state a clear relationship. This paper aims to shed a light on this
   topic by testing whether negative coverage may affect voters' turnout
   and to what extent. It approaches this research question by accounting
   for two different dimensions, controlling whether the interplay of media
   negativity (press and TV coverage) with the type of election (first- vs.
   second-order elections) has an impact on citizens' propensity to
   turnout. We test our hypotheses by taking Italy as a case study because
   it offers a combination of systemic and media characteristics that
   allows addressing properly the topic. We rely on four datasets covering
   the 2018 Italian general elections and the 2019 European Parliament
   Elections in Italy, respectively, with opinion data (2018 ITANES survey
   and 2019 ITANES-University of Milan survey) and two datasets measuring
   media negativity by means of a human content analysis carried out on
   media coverage during the 7 weeks before the election days (2018 and
   2019 ITEM data). Our findings show that individual exposure to negative
   coverage leads to an increase in turnout mainly to the detriment of
   indecision. This pattern holds both in first- and second-order
   elections.},

Abstract = {Since the advent of democracy in South Africa in 1994, a new generation
   of `Born Frees' have been able to vote. With a worldwide decrease in
   formal political engagement and a rise in alternative forms of political
   participation among the youth, this qualitative study investigates
   political engagement among youth from the Pretoria area. Six focus
   groups were conducted from 2014 to 2018. The results indicate that
   post-apartheid youth are not a monolithic group. Some youth were
   enthusiastic and regarded voting as a rite of passage to adulthood.
   Voting was, furthermore, perceived as a valued right, an obligation due
   to those who struggled against apartheid, and a way to influence
   society. However, some black participants voiced apathy and/or
   disillusionment with the current (older) political leadership and
   parties. Not voting was perceived as a conscious act of political
   opposition. Conclusions are drawn about the implications for the South
   African democracy.},

Abstract = {Democratic theory argues that individuals should have their policy
   preferences equally represented in politics. Research on opinion
   congruence has often found, however, that political parties' views are
   more likely to align with those of higher-income and higher educated
   citizens. We argue that this conclusion does not account for
   heterogeneity among parties. Based on an integrated dataset containing
   the positions of over 1,700 Belgian citizens and 11 Belgian parties on
   over 120 policy statements, we examine how opinion congruence inequality
   between privileged and underprivileged people varies between parties. We
   find that left-wing parties align more with underprivileged citizens
   than they do with privileged citizens on economic issues, while the
   opposite holds for right-wing parties. On cultural issues, however, both
   left- and right-wing parties better represent the preferences of
   privileged people. The exception is the radical right party Vlaams
   Belang, which on the cultural dimensions better represents the views of
   underprivileged voters.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic worsened Italy's fiscal outlook by increasing
   public debt. If interest rates were to rise, it would become more likely
   that Italy experiences a financial crisis and requires a European
   bailout. How does making EU funds conditional on austerity and
   structural reforms affect Italians' support for the euro? Based on a
   novel survey experiment, this article shows that a majority of voters
   chooses to remain in the euro if a bailout does not involve
   conditionality, but the pro-euro majority turns into a relative majority
   for `Italexit' if the bailout is contingent on austerity policies.
   Blaming different actors for the fiscal crisis has little effect on
   support. These results suggest that conditionality may turn Italian
   voters against the euro.},

Abstract = {The analysis of armed opposition groups is heavily tainted by gross
   categorizations and labeling. Using vague terms that reduce the
   objectives of such groups to a uniform binary of secessionist or
   reformist defies their ideational complexity, undermining the effort to
   gain a nuanced and in-depth understanding of their actual motives. A
   closer look into the Ogaden National Liberation Front in Ethiopia
   reveals the type of complexity we might expect to find in armed
   opposition groups' objectives, and thus the problem with superficially
   labeling them to make for easy comparative analyses.},

Title = {Broad-appeal agendas: Issue diversity and the centre-right's electoral
   success},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Extant research has focused on the consequences of positional issue
   shifts that parties associate with their campaigns. Less attention has
   been paid to the consequences of the breadth of these issue agendas,
   which we demonstrate is a fruitful avenue for future research. Our
   analysis compares the effects of ``appealing broadly{''} when employed
   by mainstream-left and mainstream-right parties and argues that
   centre-right parties can gain votes by employing this strategy. In
   contrast, we show that this ``broad appeal{''} strategy is not
   successful for the mainstream-left in advanced parliamentary
   democracies. Additional analysis suggests that when controlling for
   issue diversity, position or salience shifts are not significant
   predictors of electoral support for centre-right parties. These findings
   contribute to the literature on party competition, issue competition and
   ownership, and the advantaged position of contemporary centre-right
   parties.},

Abstract = {Drawing on my field research experiences in Rwanda, Bosnia, and
   Cambodia, I present a personal narrative that creates a vivid picture of
   field research in challenging environments and contemplates what
   research ethics look like in post-genocide societies. Working in
   violent, traumatized, or oppressive conditions reveals the fragility of
   traditional political science methods when confronted with the realities
   of human suffering. Part of the intrinsic value of field interviews is
   the unique interactive experience between researcher and respondents,
   which can never be fully replicated. Addressing the controversies about
   research methods, I argue that the Data Access and Research Transparency
   (DA-RT) versions of protection, replicability, and transparency
   undermine the integrity of field research and can threaten the security
   of researchers and respondents. This article also reflects on the
   personal experience of working in three post-genocide societies,
   including the effects of trauma and empathy. Despite the difficult
   subject matter and personal challenges, I continue to champion field
   research for the unmatched understanding it offers researchers. This
   reflection encourages a broader discussion about the value of human
   interaction in the research process, even if those interactions do not
   fit neatly into a methodological template.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom posits that patronage jobs are distributed to
   supporters in exchange for political services. But why would public
   employees comply with the agreement and provide political services after
   receiving the job? Departing from existing explanations, I argue that
   patronage employees engage in political activities because their jobs
   are tied to their patrons' political survival. Supporters' jobs will be
   maintained by the incumbent, but not by the opposition. Supporters,
   then, have incentives to help the incumbent, which makes their original
   commitment to provide political services a credible one. Using survey
   experiments embedded in a survey of 1,200 Argentine public employees, I
   show that patronage employees are involved in political activities and
   that they believe their jobs are tied to the political success of the
   incumbent.},

Abstract = {This article addresses certain interpretations of Brazilian protests
   known as the June Journeys of 2013. The qualitative research found 134
   Brazilian academic publications, among scientific articles, theses and
   dissertations. Based on this material we devoloped a critical
   systematization of the literature on the Journeys in which we discern
   the arguments present in the texts on the origins, characteristics and
   legacies of the Journeys, problematizing some of these interpretations.
   We argue that June 2013 was a cycle of protests that involved a variety
   of actors, agendas and repertoires producing diverse legacies. In this
   way, we provide the reader with an understanding of the Journeys,
   pointing to the disputes and complexities of the phenomenon, thus
   avoiding certain generalizations about it.},

Abstract = {We examine gender differences in policy influence and advancement within
   the congressional office context using US Congress payroll system data
   between 2001 and 2014. We document how congressional careers share
   structural features with nonpolitical occupations with gender gaps. We
   find that women staffers experience slower promotion and less
   compensation than men at the same rank and that the gender gap is most
   salient for positions presenting the greatest structural challenges for
   women. However, these differences are shaped by the salience of gender
   equality issues within the office, varying by legislators' party and
   gender and by the roles of other women within the office. Our analysis
   offers leverage for assessing previous explanations for women's
   underrepresentation among policy makers, suggesting that electoral
   factors, supply lag, and institutional inertia do not solely account for
   gender differences. However, the political context mitigates gender
   disparity because of the salience of gender equality within the
   political workplace.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the support that the Congreso Social Obrero
   (CSO) gave to the dictatorship of Carlos Ibanez del Campo (1927-1931).
   Until the establishment of the dictatorial regime, this organization
   remained aside from political conflicts, emphasizing its mutual
   orientation. This paper analyzes three phenomena: the strategic alliance
   between the CSO and the dictatorship on the Obligatory Workers Insurance
   Law, the levels of identification of the organization with the
   corporatist postulates and the Convencion Nacional de Obreros y
   Asalariados of 1929 where played an important role. I propose that, due
   to the type of corporatist worker participation promoted byIbanez, the
   CSO enjoyed a privileged position that it used to install its demands in
   the political environment of the 1927 dictatorship.},

Abstract = {Sexual harassment and gender discrimination have become more salient in
   U.S. politics in recent years due, in part, to the \#MeToo movement. We
   conducted two surveys on Californians in the 2018 primary and general
   election. We find that experiencing either of these types of
   interactions shaped how Independent voters evaluated political figures
   but had a smaller effect on Democratic and Republican party identifiers.
   On average, experiencing gender discrimination has stronger effects on
   the evaluation of political figures than sexual harassment. Both
   experiences played out differently for Independent men and Independent
   women. The boost in female support for Democratic candidates was
   counterbalanced by a backlash vote from Independent men who reported
   they experienced gender discrimination, aiding the President and hurting
   Democratic political figures. This suggests that the pro-Kavanaugh
   backlash had deeper roots in male resentment towards the perceived
   preferential treatment of women, especially in work environments.},

   Evidence from Emotional Rhetoric in German State Parliaments},

Abstract = {Political rhetoric has important effects on the quality of democracy,
   but we know very little about what causes variation in the tone of the
   political debate. We investigate how radical-right success affects the
   way the remaining politicians discuss political issues. Using an
   original dictionary, we measure different positive and negative emotions
   in a newly collected dataset of speeches in German state parliaments.
   Taking advantage of variation in the timing of elections when
   radical-right politicians enter these parliaments, we find that
   politicians of other parties respond to radical-right success by using
   more positive, instead of negative, emotions. The analyses suggest that
   this finding may be the result of a strategy by the remaining
   politicians to distance themselves from radical-right discourse. Our
   findings high-light how radical-right success can create incentives for
   other politicians to enforce democratic norms that radical-right
   politicians breach.},

Title = {Grieving Critically: Barack Obama and the Counter-Eulogy},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {307-320},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How can grieving communities respond to public loss while also seizing
   the reflective and transformative potential inherent in moments of
   collective mourning? In this article, I explore this question by
   analyzing and critiquing fifty-seven of the official funeral speeches
   Barack Obama delivered during his presidency. I compare Obama's national
   eulogies to two ancient mourning traditions: the Homeric mode and the
   Athenian mode. I further argue that, like these ancient modes, Obama's
   eulogies may suppress critical thought, perpetuate us/them thinking, and
   prioritize individual interests above communal ties. I therefore propose
   and theorize the counter-eulogy, a thoughtful, critical, and
   self-reflective mode of official funeral rhetoric inspired by the
   counter-monument artistic movement and other alternative mourning
   practices. I analyze Obama's eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney as an
   example of a counter-eulogy. In doing so, I illustrate how
   counter-eulogies preserve the ritual features of traditional national
   eulogies while also capturing the democratic potentiality inherent in
   moments of public grief.},

Abstract = {Which member states could leave the European Union in the years ahead?
   To answer this question, I develop the `EU Exit Index' measuring the
   exit propensities of all European Union member states. The index
   highlights that the United Kingdom was an outlier and uniquely
   positioned to leave the European Union. While all other states are far
   behind the United Kingdom, the index still reveals substantial variation
   among them. Moreover, the index allows monitoring the development of
   exit propensities over time. It shows that the European Union is in
   better shape today than before the Brexit referendum and that,
   currently, no further exits are on the horizon. Still, this could change
   in the future and the EU Exit Index provides systematic and reproducible
   measurements to track this development.},

Abstract = {Fridays for Future has risen as a new environmental movement pushing
   politicians to take action against climate change. However, its
   interaction with other political actors, most importantly political
   parties, has hardly been addressed systematically by scientific
   research. In this article, we take stock of party reactions to the
   movement on the national and subnational level in Germany. Furthermore,
   we investigate possible explanations for variances in these reactions in
   a comparison of subnational party organisations and thereby, focus on
   dynamics of party competition, especially on the impact of the Green
   Party as established contender and of the populist radical right AfD and
   its new role in environmental politics. We show that party reactions to
   the movement vary widely reflecting a clear divide on the
   left-right-spectrum. While centre-left parties, particularly the Green
   Party, support the movement, centre-right parties are utmost cautious
   and the populist radical right AfD stands out with a blatantly hostile
   attitude. Though indications for the impact of party competition
   dynamics were minor, we observed a strong polarisation on the climate
   issue that may take effect in the near future.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) opens up a new technological paradigm where
   not only many everyday objects are connected to the Internet, but also
   have delegated powers to make purchase decisions. However, artificial
   intelligence algorithms that take these decisions are not usually
   located within the electronics of objects connected to the internet, but
   are in the cloud. This paradigm, then, brings up new questions in the
   tax area that this article analyses. In particular, we analyse the
   current definition and evolution of the legal concepts of Permanent
   Establishment and Connection Points -or nexus- in relation to the
   technological paradigm of the IoT.},

Abstract = {Scholars have studied international NGOs as advocates and service
   providers, but have neglected their importance in autonomously enforcing
   international law. We have two basic aims: first to establish the nature
   and significance of transnational NGO enforcement, and second to explore
   the factors behind its rise. NGO enforcement comprises a spectrum of
   practices, from indirect (e.g., monitoring and investigation), to direct
   enforcement (e.g., prosecution and interdiction). We explain NGO
   enforcement by an increased demand for the enforcement of international
   law, and factors that have lowered the cost of supply for non-state
   enforcement. Increased demand for enforcement reflects the growing gap
   between the increased legalization of international politics and states'
   limited enforcement capacity. On the supply side, the diffusion of new
   technologies and greater access to new legal remedies facilitate
   increased non-state enforcement. We evidence these claims via case
   studies from the environmental and anti-corruption sectors.},

Abstract = {How do voters choose between a mainstream party and a populist radical
   right party (PRRP)? Existing research says that PRRP voters share
   specific attitudinal characteristics, but many mainstream party voters
   also have these attitudes. Drawing on spatial theories of party
   competition, voters make their decision to vote for a mainstream party
   or a PRRP based on their perceived placement of the mainstream party on
   immigration. Looking at the case of the 2015 United Kingdom (UK) General
   Election with the British Election Study Panel Survey, I analyse voters
   that think immigration is the most important issue facing the UK. These
   are the voters that prioritise the same issue as UK Independence Party
   (UKIP). The findings show that those who perceive the Conservative Party
   will reduce immigration are less likely to vote UKIP than those who
   perceive the Conservative Party will not reduce immigration. This
   relationship holds even when the respondent is highly Eurosceptic and
   anti-immigration.},

Abstract = {Flannery O'Connor sees bodily difference as a ubiquitous part of the
   human condition, as well as a reason invoked by society and politics to
   displace others. O'Connor redefines ``the grotesque{''} to refer to her
   exposition of the reality of human dependence in a way that shocks her
   readers. And this grotesque revelation of human dependence is the
   foundation for a politics grounded in the human need for relationships,
   as well as O'Connor's response to individualistic modern politics: she
   critiques communities in which pure self-interest leads to exclusion and
   displacement and opens up the possibility of communities that welcome
   members irrespective of differences in their bodies. Such communities
   are not abstract utopias but are built through engagement with
   particular people across lines of difference and need. In the small
   associations that arise from such engagement-families, religious
   communities, and other groups-O'Connor's Tocquevillian hope is found.},

Abstract = {Realists criticise the moralised approaches that inform ideal political
   theory for being unable to handle the brute facts of disagreement that
   constitute political reality. As a result, such approaches are
   insufficiently political, too ambitious in terms of the substantive
   unanimity that can be expected to emerge from political differences, and
   naive in the proposals they make. In this paper, I use Brian Barry's
   `moralised' approach - as developed in `Justice as Impartiality' - to
   argue that ideal theory can be reformulated to make it capable not only
   of responding to realist criticisms, but of offering a moralised
   approach to politics that has significant realist pedigree. As an
   instance of this pedigree, I argue thus understood, ideal theory can
   provide us the tools to distinguish between the making of compromises
   and the acceptance of capitulation and thereby contribute to an
   understanding of our political worlds.},

Abstract = {Are leaders held accountable for inherited conditions, and does
   accountability increase with time in office? I combine hundreds of
   opinion polls to test how new presidents are rewarded or punished for
   current economic perceptions, and how these judgments evolve over time.
   I find the economy influences voter evaluations in a president's first
   year, that it influences evaluations more so in the second year, and
   that it does not influence evaluations any more in later years. Surveys
   of governor approval and state economic conditions yield similar
   results, as does an original survey experiment exploiting the varying
   tenure of state governors in the wake of the 2018 elections. While
   raising questions about voter competence, these findings also suggest
   leaders have incentives to spread effort more broadly over their terms.},

Title = {The micro-macro interactive approach to political trust: Quality of
   representation and substantive representation across Europe},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {The relevance of the macro-context for understanding political trust has
   been widely studied in recent decades, with increasing attention paid to
   micro-macro level interactive relationships. Most of these studies rely
   on theorising about evaluation based on the quality of representation,
   stressing that more-educated citizens are most trusting of politics in
   countries with the least corrupt public domains. In our internationally
   comparative study, we add to the micro-macro interactive approach by
   theorising and testing an additional way in which the national context
   is associated with individual-level political trust, namely evaluation
   based on substantive representation. The relevance of both types of
   evaluation is tested by modelling not only macro-level corruption but
   also context indicators of the ideological stances of the governing
   cabinet (i.e., the level of its economic egalitarianism and cultural
   liberalism), and interacting these with individual-level education,
   economic egalitarianism and cultural liberalism, respectively. As we
   measure context characteristics separately from people's ideological
   preferences, we are able to dissect how the macro-context relates to the
   levels of political trust of different subgroups differently. Data from
   three waves (2006, 2010, 2014) of the European Social Survey (68,294
   respondents in 24 European countries and 62 country-year combinations),
   enriched with country-level data derived from various sources, including
   the Chapel Hill Expert Survey, are used in the multi-level regression
   analyses employed to test our hypotheses. We found support for the
   micro-macro level interactions theorised by the evaluation based on the
   quality of representation approach (with higher levels of trust among
   more-educated citizens in less corrupt countries), as well as for
   evaluation based on substantive representation in relation to cultural
   issues (with higher levels of trust among more culturally liberal
   citizens in countries with more culturally liberal governing cabinets).
   Our findings indicate that the latter approach is at least equally
   relevant as the approach conventionally used to explain context
   differences in political trust. Finally, we conclude our study with a
   discussion of our findings and avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {The paper defines a cognitive approach of regionalism and outlines a
   research agenda, proceeding from the assumption that the region is not a
   thing in the world, but a perspective on the world. Regionalism is a way
   of being in the world to which we are all subject. Therefore, instead of
   defining and describing a region and its identity, I suggest we should
   wonder how, when and why regionalist social actors interpret their
   social experience in regional terms. To do this, three cognitive levels
   are highlighted. Each region, first of all, is characterized by an
   ideological opportunities structure, which is a cognitive system with
   both constraints and leeway, defined by a more or less hegemonic
   ideology and more or less legitimate heterodox ideologies. The
   regionalist ideology then is characterized by the use of the region as a
   cognitive tool, notably in order to understand social problems on a
   regional territorial basis. Finally, the regionalist discourse in
   interaction during a social movement can take the form of a master frame
   of regional injustice.},

Abstract = {As the world starts reopening following the lockdowns prompted by the
   COVID-19 pandemic, regional collaborations and trade matters have
   resurfaced. While the Brexit (British exit from the EU) negotiations
   have dominated regional trade headlines, the fate of the African
   Continental Free Trade Agreement is also being rethought. In all these,
   however, the issue of regional integration, administration, and
   governance of treaties and policies remain contentious areas.
   Considering these concerns, this article draws insights from the
   regionalization of the Economic Community of West African States
   (ECOWAS). We explore the ``isms{''} (that is, the ideologies of realism,
   neoliberalism, intergovernmentalism, institutionalism, and regionalism)
   that impact upon the achievement and implementation of the regional
   governance system. We analyze ECOWAS' current strategy toward the
   integration of the West African region, its successes, and its failures.
   Also, we highlight some of the challenges concerning the implementation
   of treaties. Finally, we evaluate the underlying national preferences
   and the implications for the ``isms{''} in many settings.},

Title = {Policy congruence and its impact on satisfaction with democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The relationship between what citizens want in terms of policies and
   what they get from political elites is considered one of the key aspects
   of representative democracies. Scholars have thus investigated
   thoroughly the state of citizen-elite congruence in advanced democracies
   and whether this relationship influences citizens' democratic
   satisfaction. These studies do show that citizens' assessment of their
   political system and especially their satisfaction with democracy are
   importantly influenced by the quality of representation and how close
   they are to their preferred parties or the government position. In the
   paper, we build on this literature and consider whether congruence
   between citizen preferences and policies influences citizens'
   satisfaction with democracy. This last stage of representation has
   mostly been overlooked in past research. To address this question, we
   make use of data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (module
   4). Policy congruence is measured based on respondent answers to a
   series of questions with respect to their preferences on public
   expenditure in eight policy domains. We also compare the effect of
   policy congruence to other conventional measures of congruence (e.g.
   party and government congruence). Our results indicate that this new
   measure of policy congruence has substantial effect on citizens'
   satisfaction with democracy and more so than previous measures of
   ideological congruence.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy has long been central to SNP policy making and Scottish
   independence. During the 2014 referendum, green electricity generation
   was presented as a means for Scotland to achieve `reindustrialisation'.
   Despite a world-leading transition in electricity supply, the Scottish
   government has struggled to develop renewables manufacturing. Scotland's
   largest offshore engineering company, BiFab, entered administration in
   2020. This article explains the faltering of Scotland's green industrial
   revolution. First, it assesses renewables' privileged place in SNP
   perspectives, underlining its deep roots in North Sea oil and criticisms
   of British governments' mismanagement of offshore opportunities. Second,
   the failure of market-led policy making to provide the anticipated
   industrial benefits from offshore wind developments is explained through
   the domineering role of foreign state-owned enterprises and global
   supply chains in the UK's renewables sector. The conclusion argues that
   older nationalist perspectives offer remedies, but these require a more
   active industrial policy that diverges from the current approach of the
   Scottish Government.},

Abstract = {This article asks whether Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to
   bypass the House of Commons and order military action in Syria in 2018
   killed the UK's nascent War Powers Convention, established most visibly
   when MPs vetoed an essentially similar operation under Prime Minister
   David Cameron in 2013. It finds that the War Powers Convention survives,
   but in a weakened state, subject to new caveats that significantly
   narrow its scope. What happens next depends on the dynamic,
   unpredictable interaction between what future prime ministers believe,
   what strategic questions arise and what MPs will accept.},

   Comparative evidence from the Life in Transition Survey 2016},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Transition to the market economy and the related restructuring of
   welfare systems has produced new vulnerabilities in the formerly
   communist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia while
   simultaneously aggravating the existing ones. Given the limited fiscal
   capacities of the transition countries, this brings to the fore the
   issue of which of the new and old vulnerable groups of people are
   considered to be deserving of public support. Using data from the third
   round of the Life in Transition survey (2016), this article explores the
   perceived welfare deservingness of five groups: the elderly, the
   disabled, the unemployed, the working poor and families with children.
   We find that with some exceptions, the hierarchy of deservingness of
   these groups is similar to that systematically identified in Western
   welfare states. However, there is also a large variation in the
   deservingness levels across countries, some of which appear to be
   related to the differences in the levels of economic development. We
   also find that in transition countries, individual self-interest and
   ideological predispositions largely have the same effects on people's
   deservingness perceptions as those found in Western welfare states in
   previous studies.},

Abstract = {Despite the rapid growth of online political advertising, the vast
   majority of scholarship on political advertising relies exclusively on
   evidence from candidates' television advertisements. The relatively low
   cost of creating and deploying online advertisements and the ability to
   target online advertisements more precisely may broaden the set of
   candidates who advertise and allow candidates to craft messages to more
   narrow audiences than on television. Drawing on data from the newly
   released Facebook Ad Library API and television data from the Wesleyan
   Media Project, we find that a much broader set of candidates advertises
   on Facebook than television, particularly in down-ballot races. We then
   examine within-candidate variation in the strategic use and content of
   advertising on television relative to Facebook for all federal,
   statewide, and state legislative candidates in the 2018 election. Among
   candidates who use both advertising media, Facebook advertising occurs
   earlier in the campaign, is less negative, less issue focused, and more
   partisan than television advertising.},

Abstract = {How does making electoral systems more candidate-centered affect party
   unity? Using a principal-agent perspective, this study makes three
   contributions to the literature on this topic. Conceptually, it suggests
   thinking about the incentives due to personalization as arising from a
   shift in electoral impact from party selectors to voters. Theoretically,
   it incorporates this notion into a spatial model of parliamentary voting
   that also considers principals' monitoring capacities. From the
   resulting framework follows a rich set of observable implications,
   notably that candidate-centered electoral systems facilitate rather than
   undermine collective action within parliamentary parties under certain
   conditions. Empirically, this study then analyzes the 2010 reform of
   Sweden's flexible-list proportional representation system, which changed
   the preference vote threshold. As expected, I find that when extreme
   (district-based) selectors disagree with the moderate bills supported by
   the party group leadership, personalized rules incentivize politicians
   to support these policies and vote in unison.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long recognized that national identity-related factors are
   among the strongest predictors of citizens' attitudes toward the
   European Union. But while some find that they reinforce support for the
   European Union, other scholars show that national identity undermines
   its support. In this article, we aim to disentangle this puzzle by
   studying how the national identity profiles of European citizens relate
   to support for the European Union across individuals and member states.
   To this end, we employ data from the International Social Survey Program
   2013, by far the most extensive collection of survey questions on
   national identity, and the technique of latent class analysis. Our
   results show which specific configurations of national identity entail
   support, ambivalence or rejection of the European Union, their
   antecedents, and their variation across countries.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many scholars, mainly those focusing on populism, have
   analysed the role of `the people' in politics. This has allowed us to
   understand how many political actors emphasize the central position of
   this term. Today, `the people' has different meanings depending on how
   politicians use it in specific contexts. In this paper, the reference to
   `the people' was measured using the following question: How do political
   leaders use the word `people'? The analysis was conducted on Twitter
   through the study of the accounts of the foremost political leaders in
   the UK during the 2019 general election campaign. The results highlight
   three key attitudes related to the use of `people': a direct and
   immediate relationship between a leader and a wide people; a calling to
   a specific people, described as a strong and cohesive group; an
   appropriation of the voice of the people, grouping people without
   borders into the classic contraposition between a pure people and the
   corrupt elite.},

Abstract = {It is an orthodoxy of modern political thought that violence is morally
   incompatible with politics, with the important exception of the
   permissible violence carried out by the state. The `commonsense
   argument' for permissible political violence denies this by extending
   the principles of defensive ethics to the context of state-subject
   interaction. This article has two aims: First, I critically investigate
   the commonsense argument and its limits. I argue that the scope of
   permissions it licenses is significantly more limited than its
   proponents allow. Second, I develop an alternative (and supplementary)
   framework for thinking about permissible political violence. I argue
   that under certain circumstances, subjects may violently protest their
   treatment, where protest is understood as an expression of rejection of
   those circumstances. On my view, protest, including violent protest, is
   permissible when it is the fitting response to those circumstances. This
   alternative framework accounts for an important class of cases of
   intuitively permissible political violence, including cases in which
   such violence does not serve strategic political ends or is even
   counterproductive towards those ends.},

   Firstly, by reconstructing some of the different dichotomies included in

   the connections and ties that bind house and square. Thirdly, by trying
   to read the modern emergence of the two poles ``society{''} and
   ``interiority{''} as a double process of simultaneous expansion and
   concentration of domestic semantics and domestic performances.},

Title = {Party Bans: Deterrence or Backlash? Evidence from the Basque Country},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {325-358},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the electoral effects of party bans, studying
   the case of the ban on Batasuna, the political wing of ETA. In an
   initial electoral term, in 2003, Batasuna was banned from contesting
   local elections in all Basque municipalities; in a second term, in 2007,
   it was banned only in a subset of them, and in 2011 it became legal
   again. Exploiting the finite and heterogeneous length of the ban across
   municipalities, I find that a longer ban has a negative effect on
   electoral support for the targeted party. This effect is explained by
   the extent of the immediate loss in support in treated municipalities
   under the 2007 ban, observable in this instance because Batasuna called
   for a null vote. This pattern and further heterogeneous effects are
   consistent with voters learning from the new electoral scenario rather
   than with a direct cost attributable to the party no longer having
   institutional representation. This suggests that party bans may be used
   by incumbents to reduce their challengers' strength by triggering an
   electoral reshuffling, with voters learning about new parties and
   potentially switching allegiances.},

Abstract = {The Catalan secessionist parties, if added together, have won all the
   elections to the Parliament of Catalonia from 2010 to 2021. Their voters
   have been increasingly mobilized since the start of the controversial
   reform process of the Statute of Autonomy (2004-2010). The aim of this
   article is twofold. First, it intends to test whether language is the
   strongest predictor in preferring independence in two separate and
   distinct moments, 1996 and 2020. And second, to assess whether its
   strength has changed-and how-between both years. Only the most exogenous
   variables to the dependent variable are used in each of two logistic
   regressions to avoid problems of endogeneity: sex, age, size of town of
   residence, place of birth of the individual and of their parents, first
   language (L1), and educational level. Among them, L1 was-and still
   is-the most powerful predictor, although it is not entirely
   determinative. The secessionist movement not only gathers a plurality of
   Catalan native speakers, but it receives a not insignificant level of
   support among those who have Spanish as their L1. Conversely, the
   unionist group, despite being composed primarily by people who have
   Spanish as their L1 and have their family origins outside Catalonia, has
   a native Catalan-speaking minority inside. This imperfect division,
   which is based on ethnolinguistic alignments-and whose relevance cannot
   be neglected-alleviates the likelihood of an ethnic-based conflict.},

Abstract = {This study extracted knowledge on the association between terrorism
   inclusion criteria and one of the terrorism target/victim types known as
   ``private citizens and property.{''} Three criteria determine what
   constitutes a terror attack: Criterion 1: the action is done with
   intention to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal;
   Criterion 2: the action is done with the intention to coerce, intimidate
   or publicize to larger audience(s); Criterion 3: the action is outside
   international humanitarian law. Literally, all terror incidents ratify
   Criterion 3. As for Criteria 1 and 2, the odds ratio was deployed on the
   global terrorism database, consisting of 170,350 records of terrorist
   attack incidents, to evaluate the nexus between each of these criteria
   and terror attacks on private citizens and property. The results showed
   that any terror attack on private citizens and property is 2.2 times
   more likely to have been perpetrated by a terror group in order to
   achieve Criterion 2 than to achieve Criterion 1. The implications of the
   outcome in counterterrorism are discussed.},

Title = {RESCUING RAWLSIAN JUSTICE: ARE FRATERNITY AND DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE
   COMPATIBLE?},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},

Abstract = {The revival of the academic interest in the problem of fair distribution
   of resources in the society, which is one of the key issues for the
   political thought today, is largely associated with the name of John
   Rawls and his Theory of Justice. The article is devoted to the analysis
   of Rawls's arguments in support of the difference principle as one of
   the principles of social justice. According to Rawls (whose arguments
   later formed the foundation for a separate direction in the
   political-philosophical thought known as luck egalitarianism), due to
   the random nature of the original distribution of talents, inequality in
   human wellbeing cannot be justified by an appeal to a merit. However,
   because strict equality in distribution might reduce productivity of the
   owners of talent, achieving the best outcome for all requires such
   inequalities that incentivize the more talented to work as efficiently
   as possible for the benefit of the less talented. This compromise drew
   criticism from ardent egalitarians, among which Gerald Cohen articulated
   objections to the difference principle most clearly and compared the
   claims of the most talented for material rewards with extortion.
   Having considered possible justifications for the need for incentives,
   based on Rawls's argument in the Theory of Justice, the authors conclude
   that these justifications do not solve the problem that Cohen revealed.
   Appealing to human nature merely translates the dispute into the
   methodological realm: should the theory of justice proceed from reality,
   or should it be guided by the ideal? In turn, the inevitability of a
   conflict of private interests does not fit well with Rawls's ideal of
   fraternity as an integral part of a just social order. According to
   their conclusion, in order to resolve the internal contradiction in
   Rawls's theory, it is necessary to abandon either the postulates of luck
   egalitarianism or difference principle. However, both of these options
   directly contradict Rawls's intellectual constructs and undermine the
   basic foundations of his concept.},

   the study, it was found that the typical (universal) interaction fields
   between the chambers of parliament are represented by the legislative
   sphere (implemented in the course of adopting laws, holding joint
   meetings on various occasions); organizational and personnel sphere
   (provides for the consolidated participation of chambers during the
   formation of public authorities, as well as the appointment of
   officials); the control sphere, which is represented by three types:
   personnel and control (related to the implementation of the impeachment
   procedure against the head of state, resignation of senior state
   officials, expression of confidence lack in the government),
   organizational and control (concerns the formation of joint permanent
   and temporary commissions by the chambers of parliament) and financial
   control (assumes the consolidated participation of the chambers for the
   state budget adoption); the international sphere (concerns the joint
   activities of the chambers in the course of the ratification or
   denunciation of international treaties, the declaration of a state of
   war or the conclusion of peace). It is concluded that typical spheres of
   interaction between the chambers of parliaments in South American
   countries demonstrate the legislator's approaches to the development of
   interaction between the chambers of parliaments.},

   society: Is the distinction valid?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {18-33},
Abstract = {Partha Chatterjee's distinction between civil society and `political
   society' in post-colonial countries has provoked much debate and
   discussion. This has remained controversial in the current literature on
   post-colonialism in respect of democracy, development and politics. In
   this article I contest his distinction by pointing out, first that his
   conception of civil society is limited and abstract (and universalist)
   that leaves out the vast rural life in India. Second, I question the
   conceptual and empirical validity of his concept of political society,
   and argue that his original concept of political society was an urban
   space of illegality and criminality, but his subsequent shift to cover
   rural India does not explain how original conception works out in rural
   India. The empirical evidence available suggests that his so-called
   political society in rural India is actually part of civil society such
   as rural clubs, NGOs and other associations that operates in the
   interface of state, politics and society. In conclusion I seek to
   restore the political society as the space of the nation-state based on,
   following Locke, the right to life, liberty and property; trust
   (contract), definite and codified laws, impartial judiciary, separation
   of powers, limited government by popular consent and the people's right
   to revolt.},

Abstract = {Numerous Michigan prisons emerged as national hotspots early in the
   coronavirus crisis. Once the virus entered the prisons, key actions and
   inaction by Michigan Department of Corrections and Governor Gretchen
   Whitmer allowed COVID-19 to flourish unabated, resulting in unnecessary
   infection and death; a form of cruel and unusual punishment. The callous
   neglect of the human rights of prisoners during the pandemic is not new,
   but rather the result of decades of punitive sentencing policies that
   disproportionately target people of colour. Through a case study
   examination of early coronavirus outbreaks in Michigan prisons, this
   paper will consider how Truth in Sentencing legislation, increasingly
   long prison sentences and declining parole rates, helped set the stage
   for coronavirus to spread, disproportionately harming Black and elderly
   prisoners. As the intersecting crises of coronavirus and mass
   incarceration exemplify, state crime scholars can no longer ignore the
   state-organized race crime occurring behind prison walls.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a threat to all of humankind, yet there is still a
   leadership vacuum on climate governance. At the same time, the deepening
   climate crisis also presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to assume
   the role of a global leader. China has the capacity to do it in a way
   that the United States, Russia, India, and the European Union do not.
   Taking swift climate action is in Beijing's interest. Greater
   contributions to climate governance will certainly help advance China's
   long-term political interest in both raising its political status and
   demonstrating the claimed superiority of its system of government.
   Positive rhetoric and robust action by China are likely to have a
   disproportionate effect on the rest of the world. Policy adjustment and
   implementation by Beijing will bring benefits to the rest of the world.
   Climate policy options that Beijing may take in the future are not
   mutually exclusive. The policy shift on climate change could also be
   attached more firmly to the idea of sustainable development as a
   defining factor of China's approach to tackling the climate change
   threat.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Global Value Chain for agricultural
   biotechnology in seeds, identifying the barriers faced by Argentine
   actors when seeking to participate in high value added stages of the
   process. Economic international relations have undergone a complex
   process whereby goods and services are produced in a fragmented manner,
   yet are articulated among them. In the face of these changes, the Global
   Value Chain perspective underscores the key role that transnational
   companies play, including their ability to restrict the participation of
   new actors. Among the emerging technoproductive paradigms we find seed
   biotechnology. The area I analyze showcases the restrictions imposed by
   a few multinational corporations and the continued concentration of
   businesses.},

Abstract = {Sortition has for a long time been considered as an important
   democratizing mechanism in political theory. It was first practiced in
   Athens in the early 5th century BCE. However, sortition fell into disuse
   during the development of modern representative democracy, replaced by
   ballot box elections, a phenomenon which some authors labelled as
   ``electoral fundamentalism{''}. The objective of this article is to
   present, compare, and evaluate two so-called utopian proposals for
   democracy by lottery, offered by John Burnheim and Barbara Goodwin. The
   task at hand is to analyze their validity and limitations, as well as to
   consider their potential for improving today's representative
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Limitarianism takes an important step towards an appropriate concern in
   normative theory about the danger that financial power can pose to
   political equality. Despite its significant merits, this paper will show
   that Robeyns' proposal still has serious shortcomings. These criticisms
   pave the way for an alternative proposal that we call proportional
   justice. In the first section, we briefly reconstruct the limitarian
   approach. In the second section, we formulate a series of criticisms
   that expose the inadequacies of limitarianism. In the third section we
   explain how proportional justice is better equipped than limitarianism
   to defend political equality.},

Abstract = {We argue that leaders employ one of two strategies to govern subnational
   regions. These governance strategies, in turn, condition how leaders
   appoint and manage the regional executives to whom they delegate
   authority. In the co-optation strategy, leaders advance local welfare by
   appointing locally embedded regional executives, who are drawn from the
   local population and enjoy relatively long tenures. In the suppression
   strategy, leaders ensure that regional executives suppress local threats
   to the regime by minimizing local embeddedness, which entails appointing
   nonnative executives and shuffling them frequently. The regional
   governance strategy that a leader employs, we argue, depends on the
   region's ex ante level of regime support. We test the theory with
   original data from the Republic of Congo and Kenya, encompassing 250
   regional executives across three presidents. Although incumbent
   governments in Congo and Kenya confront different local threats, our
   findings highlight how similarly they manage the trade-offs of local
   embeddedness.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-47},
Abstract = {Interest groups have a vital role in international negotiations and
   carry the potential to influence their outcome. This article contributes
   to discussions surrounding Brexit and institutional change in the EU,
   focusing on Article 50 negotiations and stakeholder engagement. Drawing
   from theories on deliberative democracy and institutional legitimacy, we
   argue that different groups are given access to the Chief Negotiator
   depending on the resources they can contribute. Assessing our
   expectations, we inspect the entire interest group population that held
   meetings with Michel Barnier and his team from 2016 onwards. On the
   aggregate, we observe a pluralist approach. A closer inspection reveals
   a tightly knit circle of insiders that hold unparalleled access. To the
   extent that these meetings offer a glance into the future of EU
   lobbying, European trade and professional associations are likely to
   observe growing cohesion and significance. Conversely, UK private
   interests will see their presence and influence diluted as their
   relevance grows smaller in Brussels. Following the trends we observe,
   think tanks and socioeconomic interests are likely to experience a
   continuous surge in their involvement in stakeholder activities.},

Abstract = {Guyana, a small oft-forgotten country in South America, has seen its
   prospects shift markedly in recent years. Previously lauded as a world
   leader in environmental conservation and avoided deforestation
   initiatives, Guyana recently made international headlines when
   significant oil discoveries were made in its territorial waters. Using a
   model of convergence, stasis and reverberation, this article positions
   these developments historically and politically. In it, I argue that
   Guyana's shifting fortunes are reflective of broader regional and
   international shifts and contestations around post-colonial development
   and climate policy. The article shows how different forms of
   vulnerability coalesced over time to position Guyana as both vulnerable
   and as agential. The state's vulnerability lies in its susceptibility to
   natural disasters through climate change, imperialism in the wake of
   colonialism, and ethnic strife through race-based politics. Its agency,
   on the other hand, lies in its deployment of its natural resources and
   its geographic location to negotiate changing geo-political arrangements
   and efforts to address climate change. In developing this argument, the
   article views, and positions Guyana as a microcosm of several pressing
   and overlapping global crises - a metaphorical eye of the storm.},

Abstract = {Across Europe, banks remain, to this day, the main suppliers of finance
   to the European economy, but also a source of systemic risk. As such,
   regulating them requires that policymakers find an appropriate balance
   between restricting their risk-taking behaviour and increasing lending
   to support economic growth. However, the `varieties of financial
   capitalism' that characterize national banking sectors in Europe mean
   that the adoption of harmonised capital requirements has different
   effects across countries, depending on the country-specific
   institutional setting through which banks provide lending to the
   national economy. This article conducts a new analysis of Member State
   governments' positions in the post-financial crisis reform of the EU
   capital requirements legislation, expanding the scope of previous
   studies on the topic. Here, I examine in detail the positions of Member
   States on a wider set of issues and for a broader set of countries than
   the existing literature. Building on the varieties of financial
   capitalism approach, I explain these positions with regard to structural
   features of national banking sectors. I find that Member State
   governments' positions reveal a general agreement with the proposed
   increase of bank capital requirements, while seeking targeted exemptions
   and preferential treatment that they deem necessary to preserve their
   domestic supply of retail credit.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the new law decree on regularisation introduced in
   Italy during the Covid-19 crisis, which subsumes human rights
   protections for sans papiers to the economic imperatives of labour
   market needs. The new law decree in fact seems to be in line with a more
   utilitarian logic, oriented towards the preservation of productive
   sectors at risk. Apparently, those who up until now have been invisible,
   neglected, and forgotten have suddenly become essential, at least in the
   numbers necessary to provide for the needs of the labour market. The
   work presented here examines the Italian context before, during and
   after the application of the amnesty, which saw the regularization of a
   limited number of migrants working in the agricultural sector. We intend
   to argue here that the regularization put into practice by the Italian
   government must be critically challenged, both in the premises and in
   the effects produced.},

Title = {Use of Arts-based Research to Uncover Racism},

Year = {2021},

Number = {1},
Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {The article provides an overview of arts-based research (ABR) within
   social work and general healthcare practice in Canada, and how it can be
   used to uncover racism within vulnerable populations, particularly
   youth, women, immigrants and refugees. the lesbian. gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) community, and Indigenous
   peoples. This is a general review of the literature. A literature search
   was conducted using the University of Western Ontario's Summons
   database, with coverage from January 2000 to February 2019. Data
   exploring participant experiences, personal identity, voice, and
   invisible powers were extracted, and analyzed using a critical race lens
   to examine the intersection of societal and cultural practice with race
   and power. Results indicate that ABR can support therapeutic recovery
   from oppression by enhancing self-expression of feelings and thoughts,
   and affording participants the agency to reclaim and reframe their
   personal narrative. ABR can further generate a sense of community by
   creating connections between participants with similar oppressions to
   overcome disconnection and marginalization. Within a broader community
   context, ABR permits the sharing of stories and insights with others,
   which can generate dialogue on important social issues to expose areas
   of social inequity and oppression alongside potential solutions for
   transformative social action. This dialogue can also extend to
   discussions with policy makers on the impact of social inequities to
   guide recommendations that address system gaps for broader
   community-level change. The paper concludes that ABR can move beyond
   merely reflecting on social conditions toward actively addressing them
   by promoting sustainable social change. The voices expressed through ABR
   illustrate possible solutions to overcome racism through inclusive
   social practice. deconstruction of the racial status quo, and movement
   toward an equitable distribution of power.},

Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The article explores the rules that apply to inappropriate behavior of
   members of Althingi, such as harassment, sexual and gender-based
   harassment and violence. The article discusses the provisions of the
   Code of Ethics for members of Althingi, which emphasize a healthy
   working environment inside and outside Althingi and prohibit harassment,
   sexual and gender-based harassment as well as other disrespectful
   treatment by members of Althingi towards other members, staff and
   guests. Furthermore, the article analyses whether rules in the field of
   labour protection, which are intended to prevent such conduct in the
   workplace, apply to Althingi and to members of Althingi, and how they
   interact with the Code of Ethics. It also analyses to what extent
   members of Althingi can incur criminal and tort liability for conduct
   that is prohibited in the Code of Ethics. The main conclusions of the
   article are that the requirements imposed by the Code of Ethics on
   members of Althingi are akin to those that apply to the staff of
   Althingi according to rules in the field of labour protection. Members
   of Althingi can also incur criminal liability pursuant to the General
   Penal Code as well as tort liability for conduct that is prohibited by
   the relevant provisions of the Code of Ethics, provided that the
   conditions of such liability are met. Although members of Althingi enjoy
   a certain degree of immunity pursuant to the Constitution, its scope is
   limited and can always be revoked by Althingi.},

   years, the countries have made significant steps towards strengthening
   trade and economic cooperation. In February 2019, the countries signed
   an action plan for implementing 9 priority areas of cooperation -
   natural gas, energy, Railways, seaports, the Northern sea route (NSR),
   shipbuilding, industrial complexes, agriculture and fishing. The
   Russian-Korean innovation center was opened, and in September 2020 an
   agreement of intent was signed to create a South Korean industrial Park
   in Primorsky kray. At the end of 2019, Moscow and Seoul decided to

Abstract = {In Turkey, municipal council meetings are open to the participation of
   ordinary citizens without them needing to have the right to vote.
   Therefore, involvement in council meetings is a divergent participation
   behavior compared to voting in local elections or joining a political
   party. This study investigated the demographic traits, participation
   frequency, and motives of citizens who engage with municipal councils in
   the context of political engagement in urban policymaking. Moreover,
   their perceptions of local democracy and their views on the modes of
   political participation were analyzed. To achieve this, we monitored one
   metropolitan city council and four district municipalities in one city.
   We collected qualitative and quantitative data from these meetings
   through participatory observation and survey methods. Thus, we revealed
   the socio-demographic profile of the participating citizens and outlined
   their views on local democracy and political participation.},

Abstract = {Due to the spread of new methods of committing fraudulent actions using
   electronic devices, the problem arose to provide you with adequate
   characteristics of criminal law for the development of measures leading
   to counteracting such crimes. The objective of the article was to
   identify common methods in Ukraine of committing fraud using computers,
   to assess the characteristics of criminal law that these crimes have,
   and, in turn, to determine measures to counter them. Methodologically,
   this is a documentary investigation. The scientific novelty of the
   study's findings was to identify methods of performing fraudulent
   actions using electronic computers that will improve the legal
   qualification of crimes and affect the prosecution of persons guilty of
   committing such illegal actions. Measures to prevent such criminal
   offences were also developed. The results of the study help improve the
   work of law enforcement agencies in Ukraine, in determining recurrent
   methods of committing fraudulent actions using electronic means and
   their proper qualification, providing an opportunity to prosecute those
   who commit such illegal actions and develop ways for cybercrime research
   and prevention in general.},

Abstract = {When Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842, the educational system
   was not centralized. However, after World War II, a wave of
   decolonization swarmed the globe. In 1945 an internal war broke out
   between the Chinese Communists and the Nationalists, resulting in the
   founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the
   Nationalists' retreat to the Taiwan region. Both sides attempted to
   shape the direction of education to influence Chinese habitants in Hong
   Kong. The British colonizer in Hong Kong, in order to safeguard their
   vested interests, decided to centralize the Chinese people's education
   and impose a series of curricular reforms, which acted to instill
   negative feelings or political indifference towards China among younger
   Hong Kong residents. Following the Bourdieusian theory of social
   reproduction by educational means, this paper proposes to foster and
   develop critical thinking regarding the colonial history of Hong Kong
   and the changing nature of the local Chinese identity as fostered in the
   school curriculum. This study found that the British colonizer imposed
   cultural arbitraries in the pedagogic action of the colonial Chinese
   curriculum and gradually established a colonial educational system that
   guaranteed the reproduction of the Hong Kong residents with little
   Chinese nationalism.},

Pages = {83+},
Abstract = {After Russia's annexation of Crimea in the spring of 2014 and the start
   of the war in eastern Ukraine, the United States imposed numerous
   unilateral sanctions on Russia. In terms of the number of individuals
   and legal entities affected, Russia ranks second only to Iran among
   countries subject to US sanctions. Financial sanctions have restricted
   Russian state and private banks' access to Western capital markets.
   Overall, however, the US administration has taken a rather cautious
   approach to tightening sanctions out of consideration for the trade and
   energy linkages of its allies in Europe. This could change given the
   crisis between Russia and Ukraine as well as Russia and the West. The
   case of Russia in particular shows that sanctions are gaining in
   importance as a foreign and security policy instrument for dealing with
   international crises.},

Volume = {07},

Pages = {409-431},
Abstract = {``Technological decoupling{''} has become a key factor that affects
   China-U.S. relations. The United States has been trying to cut its ties
   with China in the field of emerging technologies in an attempt to win
   the bilateral strategic competition. Compared with traditional high
   technologies, emerging technologies have lots of uncertain implications,
   and the security problems brought by these technologies have made the
   United States fall into the dilemma of ``insecurity.{''} As a result,
   successive U.S. administrations view ``decoupling{''} as both a
   strategic move to address challenges from emerging technologies and a
   means to suppress China's development. Taken together, national
   security, ideology, and competition in the digital industry are distinct
   motivations behind the U.S. technological decoupling with China. Toward
   this end, the United States has formulated whole-of-government and
   whole-of-society measures, aiming at decoupling through a combination of
   domestic and foreign policy tools. As the target of technological
   decoupling, China holds the belief that the U.S. policy is a strategic
   misjudgment which is incompatible with the development trends of
   emerging technologies. Instead, China and the United States should
   strengthen their collaboration at levels of technology, industry,
   security, and ideology to reduce the risk of miscalculation and enhance
   ties in emerging technologies.},

Abstract = {Russia has concentrated over 130,000 soldiers around Ukraine. They are
   equipped with the most modern materiel equipment. This is an integrated
   invasion army ready for war. Since the end of the Second World War, such
   a deployment has been unprecedented in Europe. The military encirclement
   of Ukraine presents a threat of force within the meaning of Article 2(4)
   of the UN Charter and with that a serious breach of international law.
   The purpose of threatening violence is to induce the United States and
   NATO to conclude treaties that would allow Russia to assert its power
   and security interests in the post-Soviet space. By threatening to wage
   war against Ukraine if the West does not conclude the proposed treaties,
   Russia has taken Ukraine hostage. At the same time, the military
   encirclement is striving to achieve Moscow's hegemony over Kyiv as an
   intermediate step towards restoring a Russian empire.},

Abstract = {The `power debate' raises hard questions to which the recent `domination
   debate' among philosophers embracing neorepublicanism contributes.
   Concerning agents and structures, the neorepublican focus on dominators'
   wills needs broadening, replacing intentions with interests, since their
   power can be routine and unconsidered, and extend across generations.
   Neorepublicans see domination as a potential rendering others
   vulnerable; here the view needs to be narrowed to specify which
   potential dangers are relevant. There is no convincing way of
   determining what counts as dominating power that does not derive from
   one or another moral and political standpoint. These hard questions are
   and must remain open.},

Abstract = {The present study deals with the centrality of labor in the Brazilian
   Constitution of 1988 against the pressures to weaken it. This centrality
   interferes with the notion of dignity at the workplace and the social
   rights of workers regime, triggering advances in the
   constitutionalization of law, in general, and of the labor law, in
   particular. It is a significant change in the understanding of labor
   provisions from the constitutional norms, in the theoretical debate and
   their practical application. However, the essential movement in the
   process of the constitutionalization of labor law, necessary for its
   consolidation, here referred to as the two-way street, has been left
   aside: recognition of the importance of regulated and protected work,
   and its centrality in the constitution, aiming at enforcing other
   fundamental rights, and expanding of democratic principles through all
   segments of society. This interpretative deficiency has opened spaces
   for the dissemination of discourses against labor protection, harming
   not only workers but also society. The results come from examining the
   centrality of labor theories and its criticism, to clarify the notion of
   the centrality of labor in the constitutional text, its scope, and
   limits.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {The normative literature on secession has widely addressed the question
   of under which conditions the secession of a particular territory from a
   larger state might be regarded as justifiable. The idea of a normative
   justification of secession, however, remains ambiguous unless one
   distinguishes between the justice of secession and its legitimacy, a
   distinction that is now widely accepted in political philosophy. Much of
   the literature seems to have focused on the question about justice,
   while, in comparison, very little attention has been paid to the
   question of under which conditions secession can be regarded as
   democratically legitimate, as something explicitly different to the
   question of justice. This article addresses this second question. After
   some preliminary remarks, the article focuses on the main obstacle to
   develop a theory of democratic legitimacy of secessions, the so-called
   ``demos problem.{''} Such problem, it is argued, has no categorical
   solution. This does not imply, however, that there is no democratic,
   legitimate way of redrawing our borders. Two strategies are proposed in
   this article to overcome the difficulty posed by the demos problem: an
   ideal strategy of consensus building and a non-ideal strategy of
   decision-making in the circumstances of disagreement.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Abstract = {The issue of gender equality and respect for women's human rights is
   becoming highly topical in the context of growing security challenges.
   International cooperation in the field of conflict prevention and
   peace-keeping requires the Slovak Republic to support the increased
   political participation of women and strengthen their position in
   decision-making processes in local, national and international
   institutions and organizations, including the Armed Forces of the Slovak
   Republic. The article therefore deals with the systematization and
   analysis of basic documents and guidelines concerning domestic and
   international crisis management in the field of gender equality,
   specifically provides information on the state of gender equality in the
   conditions of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic. Taking into
   account the gender needs of members of the Armed Forces of the Slovak
   Republic requires the introduction of a gender perspective and the use
   of gender equality indicators in the evaluation of all new projects and
   programs, which we currently consider to be a major challenge for modern
   organizations.},

Abstract = {The description of the portrait of a literary character plays an
   important role in creating the overall image of the character. The
   urgency of the study is due to the anthropocentric direction of
   linguistic studies since reflection and interpretation of the existing
   world and descriptions of portraits play an important role in this. In
   this sense, it is necessary to analyze the use of linguistic units in
   the description of portraits of characters from English fiction and
   poetry in the sixteenth-nineteenth centuries and to know the influence
   of past trends in the present. During the study several general
   scientific methods were used: analogy, generalization, observation,
   comparison, experiment, analysis, and the historical method. The study
   analyzed portrait descriptions in English poetry and prose from the
   sixteenth and nineteenth centuries and found that writers used a variety
   of symbols to capture the author's intentions in characters. Often, the
   authors used somatic vocabulary to represent the appearance of the
   characters, the less used lexical units of the general characteristics
   of the portrayal of the characters and the least to represent the
   appearance of the characters used the kinetic vocabulary.},

Title = {Irritation Design: Updating Steering Theory in the Age of Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {393-402},
Abstract = {Is steering still a viable concept? The article answers this question
   with a conditional yes. On the one hand, its conceptual core remains
   intact. Getting others-who are considered to be idiosyncratic-to solve
   rather than pose societal problems is no less relevant for recent
   governance analyses. On the other, steering as a concept needs some
   updates in terms of subjects, objects, and ways of steering. Beyond
   merely extending the list of possible subjects and objects of steering,
   the concept of irritation design is proposed. It stresses that making
   communication hard to ignore can be a matter of design. Modern society
   seems to be crowded with steering entities, many of which displaying
   smart irritation designs. This leads to complex constellations. Yet it
   remains valuable to analyze strategies of influence because despite all
   dynamics and happenstance, different chances of impact correlate with
   different irritation design. Still, we have to account for two aspects:
   1) Capacities (beyond money or power) needed for designing irritations
   are unequally distributed; 2) material effects and empirical boundaries
   have their share in a decreased ignorability.},

Abstract = {On 28 October 2020, President Moon Jae-in declared Korea's 2050 carbon
   neutrality strategy as a comprehensive transformation plan towards a
   sustainable and green Korean economy. The key elements for the 2050
   carbon neutrality are: expanding the use of clean power and hydrogen
   across all sectors; improving energy efficiency to a significant level;
   commercial development of carbon removal and other future technologies;
   scaling up the circular economy to improve industrial sustainability;
   and enhancing carbon sinks. The success of the 2050 net-zero depends on
   whether the energy sector can be decarbonised on schedule. More
   fundamentally, the strength of carbon pricing to secure private climate
   finance will determine the future of Korea's vision to go carbon neutral

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Abstract = {The article reveals the peculiarities of the modern Ukrainian voter as a
   special phenomenon in political science. The main objective of the
   research is to form a portrait of the modern voter based on data from
   some sociological surveys, as well as to address the emergence and
   formation of the image of a desirable candidate for the voter.
   Historical and statistical analysis methods as well as the comparison
   method were used. In the results they emphasize that in the personality
   of the voter we will understand a subject who makes a conscious choice
   of that political figure that he (the voter) considers capable of
   solving urgent problems of life, both State and of his person. In this
   regard, the focus is on revealing the moods in modern Ukrainian society,
   to describe the image of ``an ideal candidate{''} in the eyes of a
   modern voter. Special attention was paid to personality as an integral
   element of the socio-political space and the worldview of the political
   and electoral sphere. It is concluded that the historical context is
   very important in the formation of the Ukrainian political environment,
   which makes us glimpse analytically the peculiarities of the meaning of
   the act of suffrage.},

   the radical right in Spain},
Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the growing prominence of the radical right party
   family of parties in Europe has received considerable academic
   attention, with one of the main objectives being to study their
   electoral performance. In this sense, the literature has given a
   preeminent role to the demand-side factors. The supply factors - which
   are those that refer to the characteristics of the parties themselves -
   have received much less attention. Nonetheless, there are reasons to
   think that, given the limitations of demand-centered explanations, the
   research agenda on the radical right needs a kind of `internalist turn'.
   Or what is the same: a more rigorous and systematized look at the
   supply-side factors (and especially, on those related to the party
   organization). The aim of this research is to examine the impact of the
   organizational dimension on the electoral performance of VOX in November
   2019 national elections. In particular, the impact of two organizational
   factors -socioeconomic status of the candidates and territorial
   implantation- is tested, through multivariate analysis. The results show
   the importance of the organizational sphere in the electoral performance
   of the radical right in Spain and point in the direction of continuing
   to deepen the study of the supply-side factors.},

Title = {Ready to React: Contextualizing the Visegrad Group's Energy Cooperation},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-84},
Abstract = {The Visegrad Group ranks among the most visible examples of regional
   cooperation in Europe. Within the Group's agenda, cooperation on energy
   policy appears to be especially important and it is also a field in
   which the Platform is considered to perform especially well. This
   article provides an account of what `energy cooperation' is according to
   the Platform itself. Specifically, it seeks to find out which energy
   policy issues are reflected by the Platform, how their reflection has
   evolved over time, and how they are framed (made sense of). To find out,
   all the official documents and communications issued by the V4 between
   2000 and 2018, totalling approximately 660,000 words of text, were
   thoroughly examined using three separate analytical approaches. The
   results show that energy indeed features prominently in the V4 agenda
   with a focus on energy security - tacitly understood as security of
   (natural gas) supply - and pursuing common interests within the EU. The
   results also indicate that the energy cooperation is largely reactive,
   with the V4 much more likely to find common positions and agree on joint
   actions when facing external pressures. Especially since 2015, the
   cooperation has been chiefly defined by common resistance to the
   ambitious climate policies pursued by the EU. The article concludes by
   suggesting that Visegrad energy cooperation is likely overrated and that
   there is little evidence in the documents of the Platform that this
   agenda represents an `especially successful' field of cooperation.},

Abstract = {While research on interstate rivalries is abundant, scholarship
   examining nonstate rivalries remains limited. To address this
   shortcoming, in this article we introduce the Armed Nonstate Actor
   Rivalry Dataset (ANARD) - a dataset which captures dyadic rivalries and
   militarised disputes among armed nonstate actors in the Middle East and
   North Africa (MENA) between 1993 and 2018. We begin by explaining why
   fine-grained data on militarised interactions between armed nonstate
   organisations are needed for a comprehensive understanding of conflict.
   We then provide details of the data collection process and coding
   practices. Finally, we identify the contributions that ANARD can make to
   conflict research.},

Abstract = {Facebook ads are increasingly used by political scientists as a method
   of survey recruitment. A key advantage is said to be the ability to
   recruit targeted audiences defined by demographics, political beliefs,
   location, and numerous other attributes. The same feature has been
   decried by non-researchers concerned about potential racial
   discrimination and foreign influence in elections. The extent to which
   these ads actually reach their targets, however, is unknown. Using a
   series of six surveys and 20 targeted ads, I show these ads regularly
   fail to reach their targets. The success rate ranges from 23 to 99
   percent, and ads targeted toward groups defined by self-reported data
   and broader geographic locations are generally more successful.},

   DIASPORA},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-195},
Abstract = {This article explores memory-making practice in a small section of the
   London Tamil diaspora, the shaping and reshaping of memories of state
   crime and resistance, and the potential and challenges of this memory
   work in the context of a globalized and criminalized justice struggle.
   The Tamil Information Centre's ``Tamils of Lanka: a Timeless
   Heritage{''} exhibition is discussed as an intervention into Tamil
   memory practices in London as a necessary, enlivening and hopeful
   departure from an increasingly dispirited reliance on street protest, a
   supplement to protest, political lobbying and accountability efforts,
   and a new space for community-based mourning rituals. Mobilizing the
   concept of ``memory knots{''} (Stern 2010), this article explores the
   radical shift in commemorative practice in 2019 pioneered by TIC
   volunteers, relying on interviews with exhibition organizers in their
   role as memory workers, and reflects on the potential of this public
   invitation to reimagine the past as one of resistance and resilience.
   The latter part of this article explores the contestations and
   contradictions that emerged in the exhibition organizing process; the
   damage wrought by prevailing terrorism discourses on community memory
   comes into view. 1 argue that the exhibition, as a process and an
   invitation, signals a new appetite for historical excavation and a
   reimagining of Tamil resistance.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {515-537},
Abstract = {Previous studies have found that party unity in legislative voting tends
   to be higher for governing parties, but little is known about why some
   governing parties have higher levels of party unity than others. This
   study aims to fill the empirical void by conducting analyses of
   governing parties' unity in legislative voting. We argue that
   presidential popularity matters for explaining variation in vote unity
   of governing parties because presidential approval is an important
   psychological component in executive-legislative relations. Focusing on
   deputies from the incumbent parties in roll-call votes for
   executive-sponsored bills in Mexico from 1998 through 2018, we find that
   the level of a governing party's unity increases with higher
   presidential approval. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity
   tests and to controlling for potential endogeneity.},

Abstract = {Modern political transformations involve free choice of ideology,
   ability to communicate with society and maintenance of their political
   preferences. Political struggle often leads to radical action and
   political extremism. The aim of this study involved an analysis of
   political extremism that occurs in modern democracies, and
   identification of the main factors underlying the development of
   political extremism. The determinants of the political
   stability/extremism are analysed based on the algorithm of hierarchical
   clustering. It is proved that 26 European countries studied in the work
   can be grouped into four clusters, which are characterised by the number
   of parties of extremist ideology in the national parliaments of European
   countries; Elite Quality Index (EQx); the Freedom in the World Index;
   Political Stability and Absence of Violence Index, which is part of The
   Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). It is revealed that today
   ideological trends of authoritarian populism, conservatism and extremism
   are spreading in European countries. Cluster analysis has shown that the
   political extremism is influenced by the level of quality of national
   elites, the development of fundamental rights and freedoms, the
   political stability, and the absence of violence. Further research
   should focus on econometric simulation of factors shaping political
   extremism through economic development indicators.},

Abstract = {Czech society's relationship to European integration has changed
   considerably over the past three decades. After accession to the EU in
   2004, a decade of enthusiasm was followed by ten years, during which
   Czech politics looked to Brussels, partly sobered, partly disillusioned,
   and domestic critics of the EU gained a greater hearing. The euro crisis
   and especially the issue of migration have led to a further cooling.
   Today, Czech politics is cultivating a pragmatic relationship with the
   European Union and seeks to derive advantages from its membership. But,
   in reality, many Czechs see European institutions as a foreign and
   threatening power that is undermining state sovereignty and social
   values.},

Abstract = {Ranked choice voting first gained a foothold in the U.S. during the
   Progressive movement in the 20th century as calls for electoral reforms
   grew. Ranked choice voting was implemented in many cities across the
   U.S. in both single- and multi-seat districts. But, by the 1940s it
   became a victim of its own success, turning the tides of the hegemonic
   white male leadership in U.S. legislative bodies with the election of
   women. Since the 1990s, ranked choice voting has once again gained
   traction in the U.S., this time with the focus on implementing single
   seat ranked choice voting. This article will build on the existing
   literature by filling in the gaps on how ranked choice voting-in both
   forms-has impacted women's representation both historically and in
   currently elected bodies in the U.S.},

Abstract = {The book Critical Geopolitics: The Politics of Writing Global Space was
   first published twenty-five years ago. In this article, I briefly
   discuss the geopolitical and intellectual sources of inspiration for the
   development Critical Geopolitics as a distinctive approach within
   Anglo-American political geography. In doing so, I distinguish it from
   other concurrent critical approached to International Relations and the
   world-system within English-speaking Geography at this time. Thereafter
   I consider four lines of critique of Critical Geopolitics. The first is
   the argument that the approach is too political. A subsidiary argument
   considers its relationship to violence. The second is the argument that
   it is neglects embodiment and everyday life and that, consequently, a
   Feminist Geopolitics is needed as a necessary corrective. The third is
   that claim that the approach is too textual and operates with a flawed
   conception of discourse, one that neglects practice. The fourth critique
   is that Critical Geopolitics has an undeveloped conception of
   materiality and neglects more-than-human agency. In discuss these
   criticisms, I make an argument for a continuity of concern with latent
   catastrophism in Critical Geopolitics from the danger of nuclear war in
   the mid-nineteen eighties to the climate emergency of today.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to provide a new conceptual approach to the
   analysis of terrorism in Security studies. A new approach was presented
   in which the starting point of the analysis is the position of the
   victim, which distinguishes this work from the majority of authors that
   start their research from the position of the perpetrator of the crime.
   At the same time, the originality of this article is reflected in one
   innovative approach to the classification of terrorism. The basic
   classification was focused on internal and external terrorism with
   different types and subtypes. Key attention in this article was given to
   the link between terrorism and political violence. The political message
   sent by violence is an essential element of the crime of terrorism. To
   carry out any terrorist attack, all elements must be met. In addition to
   the operational possibility of carrying out a terrorist attack, the most
   important component is the motivation that in this case comes from the
   radical ideology of Islamists. The methods that were used in this
   research are literature review, methods of analysis and synthesis, and
   comparative methods.},

Abstract = {This research analyses the Peruvian democratic experience on the basis

   as political participation, political competition, electoral
   accountability, inter-institutional accountability, rule of law,
   responsiveness, freedoms, and equality. The research builds on previous
   research, such as the first evaluation carried out in 2012; it
   spotlights a series of challenges in the field of public policy and the
   need to overcome the current political institutional design. In short,
   it seeks to verify the progress, obstacles, and setbacks in terms of the
   deterioration-or no-of democracy in Peru.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {91-101},
Abstract = {As the U.S. Government works to slow the spread of the novel
   coronavirus, messaging is important in getting individuals to comply
   with public health recommendations, especially as the response from the
   public seems to be polarized along partisan and ideological lines. Using
   a recent Centers for Disease Control recommendation of wearing
   facemasks, I use Regulatory Focus Theory to predict that conservatives
   will be more responsive to messages related to promotion, while liberals
   are more responsive to messages related to prevention. Using a
   pre-registered experimental design, I find no evidence that prevention
   messages influence attitudes toward mask wearing. Promotion messages,
   however, cause conservatives to become less supportive of mask wearing,
   in contrast to theoretical predictions. These findings suggest that,
   related to messaging about mask wearing, strong ideological differences
   do not emerge related to the focus of the message.},

Abstract = {What are the causes and consequences of systematic measurement error in
   violence measures drawn from media-based conflict event data? More
   specifically, how valid are such event data for geocoding and capturing
   election violence? This study examines sub-national variation in
   election violence and uses original data from domestic election monitor
   surveys as a comparison to widely used sources of event data. The
   authors show that conventional data under-report events throughout the
   election cycle, particularly in sparsely populated areas and outside
   anticipated violence hotspots. Moreover, systematic measurement error of
   media-based event data for measuring election violence can generate
   significant relationships where none exist, and can result in different
   effect magnitudes. The article suggests areas for future research and
   indicates ways in which existing work on election violence may have been
   affected by systematic measurement error.},

Abstract = {In the framework of a socio-historical reality which was strongly
   hostile to Italian women in the early twentieth century, many rebellious
   female voices express their dissent in works of social denunciation in
   which the enemy is always the patriarchal-misogynist system that
   discharged its violence onto women. One of these voices cries out
   powerfully, that of Sibilla Aleramo, whose feminist struggle was
   narrated in her autobiographical romance, A Woman, giving rise to an
   existential path towards the achievement of a new identity. A new woman
   was born, capable of heeding her own law, even relinquishing her own
   son: a human sacrifice for freedom.},

Abstract = {While extant studies have probed the causes, actors and effects of
   cybercrimes in Nigeria, knowledge is scarce on the adaptable nature of
   cybercrimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Fraud triangle theory
   and exploratory research design, I analyzed data emanating from the
   Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Nigerian Police,
   the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Central Bank of
   Nigeria (CBN). Partial and total lockdown imposed by Federal and State
   governments in Nigeria to curtail the spread of COVID-19 delayed
   government palliative intervention, weakened social support systems and
   increased the vulnerability of Nigerians to COVID-419ners. The fraud
   scheming deployed included relief package fraud, food and data fraud,
   and COVID-19 cash support and loan fraud. These fraud schemes were
   designed to align with federal government's policy on COVID-19
   palliative or intervention to defraud the unsuspecting public. Arising
   from the findings, the study recommends timely palliative support and
   unambiguous public enlightenment on beneficiaries to reduce
   victimization of vulnerable Nigerians. Anti-cybercrime agencies need to
   be proactive in preventing fraud occurrence, neutralizing fraudulent
   schemes and arresting cyber-offenders.},

Abstract = {Public policies that promote personal responsibility while minimizing
   government responsibility are a key feature of modern American political
   economy. They can decrease Americans' political participation on a given
   issue, with detrimental consequences for the wellbeing of economically
   insecure families. Can this pattern be overcome? I argue that
   attribution frames highlighting government's role in and responsibility
   for policies may increase people's propensity for political action on an
   issue, but only if the frame can increase the salience of their
   preexisting beliefs about government intervention. Drawing on the case
   of consumer financial protection, I administer an experiment to
   determine the effect of attribution framing on people's willingness to
   act in support of a popular banking reform. I find that helping people
   draw parallels between an issue they feel responsibility for and one
   they accept government responsibility for can boost political engagement
   on behalf of the original policy.},

Abstract = {Brexit has been at the centre of the last two British elections and the
   past legislative term. The UK's exit from the European Union was
   characterized by a series of parliamentary setbacks, with several
   government defeats, continuous rebellions and cross-party agreements
   made to secure control of the agenda. In the research reported in this
   article, we analyse the parliamentary Brexit process through careful
   examination of the 12 indicative votes held in Westminster in 2019 to
   find an alternative solution to Theresa May's exit agreement. We map the
   choices of each MP along two relevant dimensions, connecting them to the
   socioeconomic structure of their constituencies as well as to the
   preferences expressed in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Moreover, we
   associate these parliamentary behaviours - and thus MPs' attitudes
   towards compromise and responsiveness - to the gains and losses
   experienced during the subsequent 2019 general election.},

Abstract = {This article examines how European ``returnees{''} from the conflict in
   Iraq and Syria are managed by European governance and screening,
   prosecution, reintegration and rehabilitation (SPRR) processes. It
   explores the contestations and dynamics among professionals and
   practitioners involved in SPRR, and how they attempt to manage competing
   narratives of villain/victim. The article finds that underlying their
   efforts are different notions of ``care{''} that allow for benevolent
   control and risk mitigation. The integration of care into governance has
   unevenly distributed political effects, allowing for the ongoing
   resilience and adaptability of the war on terror.},

Abstract = {Experiential learning has been shown to help cultivate habits of
   effective democratic citizens, but it is often seen as infeasible for
   large classes. This need not be the case. In this paper, we describe a
   group project designed to introduce students in a 70-person Introduction
   to Politics course to the basic political processes of local government.
   In addition to guidance on how to implement the project, we also discuss
   survey data from students in the class to compare pre- and post-tests
   for each semester as well as comparing post-tests across two semesters.
   We explore how students who were enrolled in the course responded to the
   experiential learning component of the course on three separate
   dimensions: cognitive development, community awareness, and
   self-understanding. Ultimately, students reported that they felt
   civically engaged because they worked directly with community partners
   who they felt benefited from their involvement (community awareness) and
   they developed their skills for teamwork and collaboration
   (self-understanding). Our evaluation suggests that this group-level
   experiential learning project in a large course can be an effective tool
   for political science education as well as student development and
   implementing these kinds of experiential learning interventions can
   improve with each iteration of the project. Additionally, in light of
   student feedback, we provide suggestions on how other faculty members
   teaching large courses could incorporate this project into their own
   pedagogical practice.},

Title = {Blame shifting and blame obfuscation: The blame avoidance effects of
   delegation in the European Union},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {221-238},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The delegation of governance tasks to third parties is generally assumed
   to help governments to avoid blame once policies become contested.
   International organizations, including the European Union (EU), are
   considered particularly opportune in this regard. The literature lacks
   assessments of the blame avoidance effects of delegation, let alone of
   the effects of different delegation designs. To address this gap in the
   literature, we study public blame attributions in the media coverage of
   two contested EU policies during the financial crisis and the migration
   crisis. We show that the blame avoidance effect of delegation depends on
   the delegation design: When agents are independent (dependent) of
   government control, we observe lower (higher) shares of public blame
   attributions targeting the government (blame shifting effect), and when
   agents are external (internal) to the government apparatus, overall
   public blame attributions for a contested policy will be less (more)
   frequent (blame obfuscation effect). Our findings yield important
   normative implications for how to maintain governments' accountability
   once they have delegated governance tasks to third parties.},

Abstract = {From public health to political campaigns, numerous attempts to
   encourage behavior begin with the spread of information. Of course,
   seeding new information does not guarantee action, especially when it is
   difficult for receivers to verify this information. We use a novel
   design that introduced valuable, actionable information in rural Uganda
   and reveals the intermediate process that led many in the village to
   hear the information but only some to act on it. We find that the seeded
   information spread easily through word of mouth via a simple contagion
   process. However, acting on the information spread less easily; this
   process relied instead on endogenously created social information that
   served to vet, verify, and pass judgment. Our results highlight an
   important wedge between information that a policy intervention can best
   control and the behavior that ultimately results.},

Abstract = {This innovative teaching project brought students and professionals
   working at or with the European Union (EU) together via
   video-conferencing. The idea was that by having students talk to
   policymakers this would add to their understanding of the EU and allow
   them to practice their interview skills. These interviews would be
   incorporated in a regular first-year course on the political system of
   the EU. Students had to do the necessary research and prepare questions
   beforehand. Introducing this activity to the course made it more
   interactive, gave students a more practical orientation and added yet
   another international element to the already international group of
   students. In political science and legal courses there is rarely time
   for field research. Including long-distance interviews added an element
   of qualitative research with real persons, who are involved in EU policy
   making. Students not only had to prepare for the interviews but also
   practiced their research skills under realistic conditions (with a
   stranger who is an expert on a certain subject). It also contributed to
   the fulfillment of the Bologna agenda goals of internationalization and
   digitalization.},

Abstract = {During 2021, long-standing concerns about racism in English cricket rose
   to the surface to become very public, political questions. For the
   purposes of clarity, this article begins by drawing a distinction
   between racism on the one hand and `racial thinking' on the other. It
   suggests that racial thinking is related to, but analytically distinct
   from, and in fact prior to racism. It then goes on to develop a wider
   analysis of the historical connections between cricket, Englishness and
   racial thinking. With this in mind, the final section of the article
   draws on the preceding historical analysis to explore some of the more
   recent examples of racial thinking in cricket, and their implications
   for how we might approach the problem of racism in English cricket
   today.},

Abstract = {Although the literature on US Supreme Court agenda-setting is sizable,
   justice-vote-level multivariate analyses of certiorari are almost
   exclusively limited to samples of discussed cases from 1986 to 1993.
   Moreover, these studies have done very little to explore justice-level
   heterogeneity on certiorari. Here, we address these lacunae by analyzing
   the predictors of individual justices' cert votes on all paid cases from
   the 1939, 1968, and 1982 terms. We find substantial justice-level
   heterogeneity in the weight that justices place on the standard set of
   forces shaping the cert vote. We also show that some of this
   heterogeneity is associated with justices' experience and ideological
   extremism, largely in theoretically predicted ways. In closing, we sound
   a note of caution on drawing conclusions about effects of justice
   attributes, when the number of justices is relatively small.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South
   Africa) countries have experienced significant economic growth. However,
   their political voices in global governance have not grown on par with
   their economic surge. The contributions to the symposium `The BRICS,
   Global Governance, and Challenges for South-South Cooperation in a
   Post-Western World' argue there is a quest for emerging markets and
   developing countries to play a more significant role in global
   governance. There is a widening gap between the actual role of emerging
   markets and developing countries in the global system and their ability
   to participate in that system. However, for the moment, various domestic
   and international political-economic challenges limit this quest. To
   understand why this is the case, one should understand the BRICS
   phenomenon in the broader context of the global power shift towards the
   Global South.},

Abstract = {Subnational governments in the United States have taken the lead on many
   aspects of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Variation in
   government activity across states offers the opportunity to analyze
   responses in comparable settings. We study a common and informative
   activity among state officials-state legislators' attention to the
   pandemic on Twitter. We find that legislators' attention to the pandemic
   strongly correlates with the number of cases in the legislator's state,
   the national count of new deaths, and the number of pandemic-related
   public policies passed within the legislator's state. Furthermore, we
   find that the degree of responsiveness to pandemic indicators differs
   significantly across political parties, with Republicans exhibiting
   weaker responses, on average. Lastly, we find significant differences in
   the content of tweets about the pandemic by Democratic and Republican
   legislators, with Democrats focused on health indicators and impacts,
   and Republicans focused on business impacts and opening the economy.},

Abstract = {This study examines the policy preferences of political groups in the
   8th European Parliament regarding the design of agricultural policy and
   the integration of environmental goals therein. Due to the high degree
   of Europeanization of the Common Agricultural Policy, the analysis of
   party positions at the EU level is particularly interesting. To what
   extent are the positions of political groups changing against the
   background of the increasing public awareness for environmental and
   animal welfare issues in agricultural policy? By means of a discourse
   network analysis of the plenary debates on selected policy proposals
   during the 8th term of the European Parliament, the positions of the
   political groups in agricultural policymaking are explored. The
   comparative analysis clearly reveals differences in problem perceptions
   and preferred policy solutions between the different political groups.
   Substantive differences are apparent between the EPP on the one side and
   the Greens/EFA and the GUE/NGL on the other side. EPP members still
   mostly represent traditional agricultural goals such as food security
   and income support for farmers, whereas the Greens/EFA and the GUE/NGL
   deputies promote a change towards a more environmentally and animal
   welfare friendly agricultural policy. At the same time, the analysis
   reveals a broad consensus across political groups regarding the general
   need to increasingly integrate sustainability concerns in the design of
   the future Common Agricultural Policy.},

Abstract = {How has the Netherlands sought to influence the redesign of Economic and
   Monetary Union (EMU) since the financial crisis? Based on the case
   studies of the `New Hanseatic League' and the `Frugal Four' this study
   finds, firstly, that the Netherlands chooses strategies of foot-dragging
   when initiatives are brought up to deepen integration when the Dutch
   prefer the status quo. Secondly, its strategy is more bargaining-based
   but at times also persuasion-based; the bargaining occurs in part
   because the Netherlands builds occasional alliances with like-minded
   member states to counterbalance the asymmetry of power between it and
   Germany. Finally, the Netherlands oscillates between trying to influence
   Germany directly and bypassing it by reaching out to like-minded member
   states on various dossiers and tempting them to declare their positions
   in advance.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel analytical framework to compare the
   changing positions of five populist right-wing parties in the field of
   welfare policies. Results outline that a novel programmatic approach on
   the socio economic dimension materialised, which clearly departs from
   traditional right wing ideologies. We call it `exclusionary welfarism',
   characterised by (i) high salience of welfare issues, (ii) strong
   support for welfare state expansion, (iii) low support for the role of
   the market in welfare provision and (iv) the adoption of a chauvinistic
   stance in social policies. Furthermore, our research innovates previous
   literature by revealing the existence different profiles of exclusionary
   populist parties emerge. In fact, if both the salience of welfare issues
   and welfare chauvinism are shared across all parties' manifestos
   considered here, the analysis shows high heterogeneity and varieties of
   exclusionary populist approaches among populist right-wing parties for
   what concerns the roles of the two main institutional spheres in welfare
   provision: state and market.},

Volume = {46},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the wake of Bohm-Bawerk's criticism that Marx's law of value runs
   contrary to empirical facts, Marxian economics has developed mainly in
   two different directions: one based on the simple commodity production
   and the other on the mathematical identity of value with prices of
   production (the transformation problem). The author agrees with neither,
   arguing that Marx intended to base the law of value on the production
   process of capital, as in Capital Volume 1, independently of Capital
   Volume 3. However, the notion of this process and the law of value have
   not been sufficiently explained in Volume 1. Marx presents the value of
   a commodity as socially necessary labour objectified in Chapter 1 on the
   commodity, and later applies this rule to capitalist commodity products
   in Chapter 7. Pointing out the defects of this method, this article
   relocates the presentation of the dual nature of labour to the Labour
   Process (Chapter 7, Section 1), and the proof of the substance of value
   or the law of value to the Valorization Process (Chapter 7, Section 2).
   The Labour Process plays a key role in Volume 1, but it contains a fatal
   flaw. Consequently, Section 2 ends up with insufficient explanation. By
   reconstructing the Labour Process and the Process of Creating Value and
   Surplus value, the author confirms the meaning and reality of the law of
   value in Chapter 7, Section 2.},

Abstract = {How should the ordinary citizens of commercial societies navigate
   increasingly complex political landscapes characterized by global
   markets, specialization, and manipulation by special interests? In this
   article, I refer to the gap between the demands of political judgment
   and the capacities of ordinary citizens as the ``political judgment
   problem,{''} and I argue, drawing on Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations,
   that versions of this problem have existed since the early days of
   commercial society. By reconstructing Smith's account of collective
   action by ordinary citizens, we can better understand the importance of
   political judgment to Smith's political theory. Attending to it uncovers
   both classical solutions to the political judgment problem and a series
   of underappreciated modern answers focused on lowering the cognitive
   burdens of political judgment such as creating alternatives to partisan
   cues in public deliberation, reforming ideological shortcuts, and
   simplifying the multidimensional political space.},

Abstract = {This article examines the changes that have occurred in the Venezuelan
   Political System during the period 1999-2020, under the presidency of
   Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, based on the analytical
   approach proposed by David Easton (1999) , and it is tried to understand
   up to where the Socialism of the XXI Century, a political project
   promoted in that period, anchored in personal leadership, the call for a
   broad popular mobilization and the proclamation of a new
   institutionality, introduces a series of tensions that tend to threaten
   the persistence of the democratic system. From a descriptive
   historical-documentary research, it is concluded that the primacy of the
   Executive Power over the rest of the public powers and the use of
   non-democratic resources show elements of authoritarian regression in
   the country.},

Abstract = {Scholarship concerning American government visibility has focused on the
   state's growing submergence, yet these accounts contrast with racial and
   ethnic politics research focusing on the American state's
   conspicuousness in the lives of people of color. Attending to this
   disconnect, I ask how government visibility varies across racial groups.
   Combining interviews and quantitative analysis within a policy feedback
   framework, I argue that five public policy trends have created a racial
   split in the American state's visibility. For whites, submerged state
   policies have grown alongside the rising visibility of racialized
   poverty policies and taxation. As a result, whites are less aware of how
   government benefits them and more aware of how government uses tax
   dollars to fund programs perceived as solely benefitting racial others.
   For people of color, the decline of civil rights legislation has
   contrasted with criminal legal policies that have made the criminal
   legal system a uniquely visible manifestation of government in their
   lives. To demonstrate the political importance of this racial divide, I
   uncover a racial heterogeneity in people's political trust attachments,
   wherein white trust is connected to welfare attitudes, while trust among
   people of color is associated with feelings about the police.},

Abstract = {How do states differ in how difficult they make voter registration, and
   what effect does this have on voters? We propose and validate a new
   Difficulty of Registration Index (DORI) calculated via an item response
   theory (IRT) model of five key dimensions of registration (automaticity,
   portability, deadline, mode, and preregistration) for each state from
   2004 to 2020. Since 2004, most states eased registration processes, with
   Democratic statehouses in racially diverse and young states leading the
   way. Using CCES data, we find that DORI is associated with increased
   probability that voters experience problems registering and failing to
   turnout (in both self-reported and validated turnout data). These
   effects are pronounced for young voters. This study holds lessons for
   how restrictive registration procedures can change the shape of the
   electorate and make it harder to achieve political equality.},

Abstract = {We examine whether Justices appointed to the High Court of Australia are
   more likely to find in favour of the Federal Government when the Prime
   Minister who appointed them is in office than when subsequent Prime
   Ministers are in office, over the period 1995 to 2019. We find evidence
   of a loyalty effect, even when subsequent Prime Ministers are of the
   same political party as the Prime Minister who appointed them. We
   distinguish between Justices appointed by Labor and Liberal Prime
   Ministers and show that the loyalty effect holds for Justices appointed
   by the Howard and Turnbull governments. These findings are important
   because they are central to the understanding of judicial independence
   and the rule of law.},

Abstract = {There are not many studies on subnational electoral bodies in Latin
   America, especially with a comparative approach. This article describes
   these bodies based on their main traits and presents the first
   hypotheses to explain their development or atrophy. It posits that the
   nations' geographic extension and the complexity of the different levels
   of government-federalism or significant levels of mid-level autonomy-are
   associated with a greater degree of institutionalization, autonomy, and
   strength at the subnational electoral level, such that a smaller nation,
   or the absence of a mid-level government, limits consolidation. The
   article uses a comparative approach.},

Abstract = {International relations scholarship concerns dyads, yet standard
   modeling approaches fail to adequately capture the data generating
   process behind dyadic events and processes. As a result, they suffer
   from biased coefficients and poorly calibrated standard errors. We show
   how a regression-based approach, the Additive and Multiplicative Effects
   (AME) model, can be used to account for the inherent dependencies in
   dyadic data and glean substantive insights in the interrelations between
   actors. First, we conduct a simulation to highlight how the model
   captures dependencies and show that accounting for these processes
   improves our ability to conduct inference on dyadic data. Second, we
   compare the AME; model to approaches used in three prominent studies
   from recent international relations scholarship. For each study, we find
   that compared to AME, the modeling approach used performs notably worse
   at capturing the data generating process. Further, conventional methods
   misstate the effect of key variables and the uncertainty in these
   effects. Finally, AME outperforms standard approaches in terms of
   out-of-sample fit. In sum, our work shows the consequences of failing to
   take the dependencies inherent to dyadic data seriously. Most
   importantly, by better modeling the data generating process underlying
   political phenomena, the AME framework improves scholars' ability to
   conduct inferential analyses on dyadic data.},

Abstract = {The study of agenda power has largely been the study of negative agenda
   power. But standard measures of negative agenda power are insufficient
   to measure the majority's agenda choices: they only consider a small
   proportion of bills, only detail how often negative agenda power fails
   (rather than succeeds), and cannot help us understand positive agenda
   power. To understand the incentives and strategies of agenda
   decision-making, then, we must know about members' preferences on all
   bills. I develop an approach to estimate members' preferences on all
   bills, by generating quantitative characterizations of the policy
   content in each bill. I use the resulting estimates to examine both
   positive and negative agenda power using all bills and to directly
   compare levels of agenda power between chambers of the US Congress.
   While I find similarly strong negative agenda control in both chambers,
   I find substantially stronger positive agenda control in the House than
   the Senate.</p>},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-58},

Abstract = {This article has two main aims. First, it seeks to demonstrate the
   continuity of The Authoritarian Personality with the model of ``early
   Critical Theory{''} that was developed at the Institute for Social
   Research in the 1930s. Second, it attempts to show why The Authoritarian
   Personality-and early Critical Theory more generally-are still essential
   to understanding the frightening resurgence of authoritarianism in the
   United States in recent times. The article begins with an overview of
   the Institute's analyses in the 1930s of authoritarianism. It continues
   with an examination of how the empirical research carried out by the
   Institute in the U.S. in the 1940s informed Theodor Adorno's
   understanding of American society and the ways in which the U.S.
   embodies larger tendencies at work in modern capitalism as a whole. The
   third part of the article focuses on the key concept of
   pseudo-conservatism in The Authoritarian Personality, which was intended
   to describe the specific form that potentially authoritarian forces
   assume in the U.S. The article concludes with some observations about
   the recent resurgence of authoritarianism in the U.S. and some
   reflections upon how The Authoritarian Personality and early Critical
   Theory can still help us understand-and counter-them.</p>},

Abstract = {A UK-US free trade agreement has consistently been presented as the main
   prize from the UK's much touted post-Brexit trade policy independence.
   The UK Prime Minister's admission that this was not going to be realised
   any time soon may have surprised media pundits, but it merely confirmed
   what had become increasingly apparent since the referendum: that a free
   trade agreement with the US was a long shot. Taken together with the
   short-lived suggestion of the UK joining the United States-Mexico-Canada
   Agreement (USMCA), we argue that it is the desire to perform
   `independence' from the European Union rather than policy content which
   is driving the UK's trade strategy.},

Abstract = {Using a new measure of urbanity for every federal electoral district in
   Canada from 1896 to the present, this article describes the long-term
   development of the urban-rural divide in Canadian federal elections. We
   focus on three questions: (1) when the urban-rural divide has existed in
   Canada, identifying three main periods-the 1920s, the 1960s and
   1993-present-in which the urban-rural cleavage has been especially
   important in federal elections; (2) where the urban-rural divide has
   existed, finding that in the postwar period the urban-rural cleavage is
   a pan-Canadian phenomenon; and (3) how well urbanity predicts
   district-level election outcomes. We argue that the urban-rural divide
   is important for understanding election outcomes during several periods
   of Canadian political development, and never more so than in recent
   decades. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for
   research on urban-rural cleavages, Canadian electoral politics and
   Canadian political development.},

Abstract = {In this article, we concentrate on the question whether candidate
   selection mechanisms affect the propensity of members of parliament
   (MPs) to defect from party line. Literature suggests that MPs selected
   by more inclusive procedures (i.e. party primaries) are more likely to
   be rebels than legislators nominated directly by party leaders. Despite
   the increasing attention that scholars devote to candidate selection
   methods, empirical evidences are still limited and they are
   inconsistent, especially for as to concern the Italian case.
   Empirically, we focus our attention on the Democratic Party (Partito
   Democratico-PD) during the XVII legislature in Italy. The PD is an ideal
   laboratory to test whether candidate selection affects MPs' propensity
   to vote against party line because PD's legislators are both selected by
   party primaries and appointed by party leader. Our results suggest, in
   contrast to previous findings, that candidate selection is a strong
   predictor in explaining voting defection.},

Abstract = {Support for social distancing measures was, globally, high at the early
   stages of the COVID-19 pandemic but increasingly came under pressure.
   Focusing on the UK, this article provides a rigorous exploration of the
   drivers of public support for social distancing at their formative
   stage, via mixed methods. Synthesizing insights from crisis management
   and securitization theory, thematic analysis is employed to map the main
   frames promoted by the government and other actors on the
   nature/severity, blame/responsibility, and appropriate response to the
   pandemic, which `follows the science'. The impact of these on public
   attitudes is examined via a series of regression analyses, drawing on a
   representative survey of the UK population (n = 2100). Findings
   challenge the prevailing understanding that support for measures is
   driven by personal health considerations, socio-economic circumstances,
   and political influences. Instead, crisis framing dynamics, which the
   government is well-positioned to dominate, have the greatest impact on
   driving public attitudes.},

Abstract = {Advocacy NGOs in Croatia often emphasize their nonpartisan identity,
   meaning that they do not publicly associate with political parties or
   declare their endorsement of electoral candidates. While such NGOs'
   behavior could be explained based on overall negative public perception
   of political parties, as well as funding conditions imposed by NGOs'
   donors, this article argues that the continuous nonpartisan identity of
   advocacy NGOs is further reaffirmed by a specific civil society
   discourse. Drawing on the analysis of in-depth interviews with senior
   members of nine Croatian NGOs, active in areas of human rights, the rule
   of law, and education, three relevant themes of civil society discourse
   reaffirming NGOs' nonpartisanship are outlined: (1) idea of civil
   society as an answer to malfunctioning state, (2) NGOs' legitimation
   based on autonomy and expertise, and (3) perception of political parties
   as an inherently limiting organizational form.},

Abstract = {Developing states lacking a monopoly over the use of force are commonly
   seen as having failed to live up to the ideal Weberian sovereign type.
   Yet rather than being a calling card of anarchy, the devolution of
   important state functions to subnational actors is a rational strategy
   for developing states to effectively provide important public goods. The
   case study of the Jewish Community of Palestine demonstrates one
   instance where subnational communities provided public goods. This study
   highlights the causal effect of property rights within institutions to
   drive behavior consistent with the provision of public and private
   goods. Analyzing temporal and institutional variation across two
   agricultural communities demonstrates a unique strategy of subnational
   governance and public goods provision in a developing state. Devolution
   of public goods provision to subnational actors may be an alternative
   strategy of governance for developing states that are not yet able to
   effectively provide important public goods.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development provisions have become an integral part of the
   European Union's (EU's) `new generation' trade agreements. Yet, a
   growing number of empirical works show that their design varies
   significantly, even in the trade agreements signed with countries at
   similar (low) levels of development. We contend that this variation can
   be accounted for by discussing how the growing integration of the EU
   economy with specific developing countries across global value chains
   (GVCs) affects the domestic politics of regulatory export in the EU.
   European firms that operate within GVCs rely on imports of inputs
   produced in low-labor cost countries. These firms tend to oppose the
   export of those regulatory burdens that generate an increase in their
   imports' variable costs. The political mobilization of these actors
   weakens domestic coalitions supporting regulatory export strategies,
   which explains why the EU adopts a more lenient approach over the
   inclusion of sustainable development provisions in Preferential Trade
   Agreement negotiations with some developing countries.},

Abstract = {The election in Greece in 2015 of a governing coalition of populist
   parties-the radical left SYRIZA and the right-wing Independent Greeks
   (ANEL)-created questions about Greece's foreign policy orientation,
   particularly its alignment with Euro-Atlantic institutions and a
   potential rapprochement with non-Western powers. Yet these fears proved
   unfounded after Greece accepted a new bailout from the Eurozone in the
   summer of 2015. The trajectory of Greek foreign policy in this period
   points to an increase in the influence of populism on rhetoric and
   symbolic actions in the first six months of the government's tenure,
   followed by a gradual decline of populism's visibility for the rest of
   its term until 2019. On the whole, populism had a marginal influence on
   the content of Greek foreign policy during the years of the economic
   crisis, although it was more important in terms of rhetoric, style and
   domestic political strategies.},

Abstract = {The academic community continues to debate what the best
   conceptualization of populism may be. Three definitions stand out,
   populism as a communication style, as a political strategy, and as an
   ideology. Based on a sample of 21 days of morning conferences given by
   the Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, we analyze his
   discourse for content representative of these three conceptualizations.
   We observe that the analysis of populist discourse is enriched when
   populism is considered as a product where communication, ideology, and
   strategy are articulated to work for the political empowerment of a
   leader, who fuels and manages the anger of a base of followers.},

Abstract = {Existing scholarship on democratic theory has emphasized the role of
   political party's organization in establishing institutionalized party
   systems. If an intra-party organization is understood to be a key
   explanatory variable, then it is important to explain why some political
   parties have a strong internal organization in comparison to others.
   However, there is no single study, of which I am aware, that explains
   variations in the level of organizations within political parties in
   India. Using Chhibber, Jensenius and Suryanarayan's party organization
   dataset alongside a qualitative example from the sub-national level in
   India, I show that there exists a `U' shaped relationship between
   parties controlling the executive office and the strength of individual
   party organization. There exists a strong negative effect between time
   spent in the executive office and individual party organization. It is
   only in the very long run that parties in government reap the small
   benefits of the executive office for their individual party
   organizations.},

   essay `Secularisation of Caste and Making of New Middle Class', the

   `triumphalist' mode of encountering caste identities; and, along this
   course, the extant possibilities of the constructivist understanding of
   caste are addressed. The stakes of the exercise are largely theoretical
   and conceptual, although a further thought is thrown in about the
   contemporary ground of caste politics in India as well.},

Abstract = {When are inequalities in political power undemocratic, and why? While
   some writers condemn any inequalities in political power as a deviation
   from the ideal of democracy, this view is vulnerable to the simple
   objection that representative democracies concentrate political power in
   the hands of elected officials rather than distributing it equally among
   citizens, but they are no less democratic for it. Building on recent
   literature that interprets democracy as part of a broader vision of
   social equality, I argue that concentrations of political power are
   incompatible with democracy, and with a commitment to social equality
   more generally, when they consist in some having greater arbitrary power
   to influence decisions according to their idiosyncratic preferences. A
   novel account of the relationship between power and social status
   clarifies the role of social equality in the justification of democracy,
   including a representative democracy in which public officials have more
   political power than ordinary citizens.},

Title = {Are Irish voters biased against female candidates? Evidence from the

Abstract = {Ireland is the first country in the world to apply a legislative gender
   quota under an STV electoral system. Since 2016, the quota has required
   parties to ensure that at least thirty percent of their candidates
   running in the general election are women. Due to the nature of the
   electoral system, namely that it is candidate-centred, the impact of the
   quota has the potential to be limited if voter bias is present among the
   electorate. While the initial gains from the quota's first election in
   2016 were maintained at the 2020 general election, with one more woman
   elected to Dail eireann, the headline figures may be misleading. In this
   earthquake election, a significant number of high-profile women from
   across the political spectrum lost their seats, while male colleagues
   retained theirs, suggesting that female candidates may have been
   evaluated differently from their male counterparts. Using self-reported
   voter attitudes from the 2020 Irish National Election Study, we
   investigate whether there is an underlying bias against women amongst
   voters. We test whether such a bias has an impact on the share of women
   running and the share of women winning, as well as individual women's
   level of electoral success. Overall, we find no evidence that voter bias
   affected outcomes for women at the 2020 Irish general election.},

Abstract = {In his famous critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx criticized
   Hegel's contention that the general will can be achieved without popular
   sovereignty. Marx argued that Hegel's first error lay in his Idealist
   method, which mistook the realities of the family and civil society as
   mere emanations of the Idea. This methodological error, according to
   Marx, led Hegel to misunderstand the rational essence of the state as
   consisting in a ``universal{''} will that is abstracted from the real
   will of the people itself, allowing Hegel to defend the pursuit of the
   good of the whole not by popular government but government by a special
   bureaucratic, ``universal{''} estate, represented in government by civil
   servants. However, Marx failed to direct the same type of critique
   against Hegel's assertion that the bureaucracy would have the knowledge
   of the whole that it would need if it were to effectively regulate civil
   society in the universal interest.},

Title = {The Effect of ``Do Everything{''} on ``Unity in Diversity{''}: A
   Neopluralist Examination of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and
   the General Federation of Women's Clubs},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Pages = {645-665},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The neopluralist approach to interest groups emphasizes how context
   affects group development and survival. Yet these studies focus on
   modern-day interest populations and not those from the past, when the
   development of politically oriented voluntary associations occurred in
   less dense and less competitive environments. Here, we study the effect
   of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (the Union), the largest
   women's association of the late nineteenth century, on what became the
   largest women's association of the early twentieth century, the General
   Federation of Women's Clubs (the General Federation). There are three
   main findings. First, membership growth was mutually supportive; larger
   state-level membership in the Union predicts later General Federation
   membership strength. Second, in states with larger Union memberships,
   state General Federation associations had fewer clubs. Combined, these
   two findings suggest that Union membership constrained the General
   Federation's organizational growth while still supporting the expansion
   of its membership. Third, greater percentages of women's clubs joined
   directly with the national General Federation in states with smaller
   state-level Union and General Federation memberships, indicating efforts
   to build greater connections with women nationally when state-level
   environments were not as conducive to women's widespread engagement in
   these two major associations.},

Abstract = {Why are populist radical right parties (PRRPs) more successful in some
   countries than in others? This question is analysed here by focusing on
   Belgium. While Flanders (the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium)
   was home to one of the strongest far-right movements in Europe, Wallonia
   (the southern, francophone part) has remained `immune' to such
   tendencies. The article argues that different historical experiences
   have given rise to a hostile political environment for PRRPs in
   Wallonia, where mainstream parties and the media have created a
   successful cordon sanitaire. In Flanders, mainstream parties and the
   media have gradually become more accommodative towards PRRPs. By
   emphasizing the sociopolitical context in which parties operate, the
   findings suggest that the reactions of mainstream parties and the media
   are crucial to understanding the success of PRRPs. The conclusion
   reflects on potential lessons to be drawn from the Belgian case for
   mainstream parties and media practitioners elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Spain has a scarce culture of transparency, so the Law 19/2013 of
   transparency, access to public information and good government took
   longer to arrive than in other countries. Since then, there has been an
   effort by public institutions to launch open data portals that are
   accessible. In this context, the evaluation of transparency becomes
   necessary to ensure that the right of citizens to access public
   information is fulfilled and to guarantee that the information is of
   good quality. In Spain, there are very different models for monitoring
   transparency. From the public point of view, there is the Council for
   Transparency and Good Governance and several transparency commissioners
   set up in some autonomous communities. On the other hand, there are
   various transparency indexes that evaluate with indicators the
   information published by the institutions. In this article, we will
   study the current situation of the evaluation of transparency in Spain,
   analyze the failures and highlight necessary improvements to this
   system.},

Abstract = {Although scholarly interest in populism has increased as populist
   parties have risen across Europe, the subnational level has been largely
   overlooked. This article adopts an original subnational focus and
   explores an unlikely but increasingly prevalent political agenda: the
   combination of technocracy and populism. We focus on technocratic
   populism as a political and governance strategy at the municipal level
   and assess how the interaction of populism and technocracy plays out
   empirically in relation to administration and public policies and how
   the tensions and synergies between technocracy and populism are solved
   at the local level. The article argues that the local level is
   especially prone to this kind of intersection between technocratic and
   populist ideology. While the article is mainly an exercise in concept
   development, two illustrative cases at the city level, namely the
   Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S, Five Star Movement) in Rome and the Akce
   nespokojenych obcan (ANO, Action of Dissatisfied Citizens) in Prague are
   used to support the argument.},

Abstract = {In modern democracies, political parties are the vehicles through which
   new groups gain political entry. Are parties equally welcoming to all
   new activists, irrespective of their ethnicity? In a field experiment,
   we study the responsiveness of local party officials in Sweden who are
   being contacted by fictitious individuals who want to become active in
   the party. We find that party officials are more likely to respond, and
   give informative answers that use a warmer and more welcoming tone, when
   they are being contacted by an individual with a Swedish name than by an
   individual with an Arabic name. These discriminatory effects are mainly
   found when contacting parties on the rightmost end of the political
   spectrum but are unaffected by appeals to electoral gain, common
   ideology, and norms of democratic inclusion. Given the importance of
   parties as gateways into politics, our findings have troubling
   implications for equal representation.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Governments have great difficulties designing politically sustainable
   responses to rising public debt. These difficulties are grounded in a
   limited understanding of the popular constraints during periods of
   fiscal pressure. For instance, an influential view claims that fiscal
   austerity does not entail significant political risk. But this research
   potentially underestimates the impact of austerity on votes because of
   strategic selection bias. This study addresses this challenge by
   conducting survey experiments in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK and
   Germany. In contrast to previous findings, the results show that a
   government's re-election chances greatly decrease if it proposes
   austerity measures. Voters object particularly strongly to spending cuts
   and, to a lesser extent, to tax increases. While voters also disapprove
   of fiscal deficits, they weight the costs of austerity policies more
   than their potential benefits for the fiscal balance. These findings are
   inconsistent with the policy recommendations of international financial
   institutions.},

Title = {Nigeria: Power-Sharing and the Resurgence of Separatist Agitation. The
   Prospect of a Consociational Model},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {37},
Pages = {54-74},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The theory of consociationalism has been extensively discussed in
   literature; however, its feasibility in managing conflicts in deeply
   divided societies is heavily contested. The few studies that have
   examined how the theory applies in real-world situations remain
   inconclusive. The present work, therefore, explored the prospect of
   consociational power-sharing model in addressing the problem of
   under-representation, political exclusion, and marginalization in
   Nigeria. This is against the backdrop of the incessant separatist
   agitations in Nigeria, which has undermined the peace, stability, and
   unity of the country. Using qualitatively analyzed data from secondary
   sources, this study argues that even though Nigeria does not meet any of
   the favorable conditions of consociationalism set out by Lijphart
   (1985), it would still benefit from consociational power-sharing. The
   study proposes the adoption of semi-presidentialism based on the
   principle of grand coalition and proportionality and gives an assessment
   of how it could work for Nigeria. It contends that the rotation of power
   among the six geo-political zones in the country and the adoption of
   proportional sequential mechanism would facilitate elite cooperation and
   inclusion of all segments of the society in the political process,
   thereby easing the fear of sectional domination in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {The following paper compares libertarian utopia and queer utopia to
   explore if queer libertarianism is possible. I argue that the
   libertarian utopia of non-coercion offers a favorable framework for the
   expression of queer identities since it does not have a preferred
   conception of sexuality or gender. Likewise, I maintain that capitalism
   -as an economic system of the libertarian utopia- is not hostile to the
   claims or aspirations of the queer utopia. Thus, to the extent that
   capitalism does not presuppose or require compulsory heterosexuality for
   its own functioning, the possibility of queer libertarianism is highly
   plausible. However, the paper identifies some potential sources of
   conflict between both utopias. These conflicts problems will only be
   resolved if libertarianism broadens its concept of voluntariness. I
   conclude that marriage of both utopias is possible but only by mutual
   concessions.},

Abstract = {Foreign cyberattacks and interferences are becoming more frequent and
   sophisticated. In the continued absence of a general consensus regarding
   the applicability of concrete international legal rules in the domain of
   cybersecurity, individual States are beginning to determine unilaterally
   their national positions. The article introduces and critically assesses
   the national strategy of France published in late 2019 in light of
   current international law and further developments in 2020. France
   confirms the validity of current international legal norms and raises
   challenging and innovative legal points for an efficient update such as
   the right to respond to any unlawful cyberoperation that targets France,
   right to preemptive self-defence, and violation of the due diligence
   principle. The mission of the article is to evaluate the document as an
   important source of impetus and the potential of its impact in

Abstract = {This special issue focuses on the consequences of the heightened
   conflict between member states and increased politicization of European
   affairs for electoral politics in the European Union. In this
   introduction we begin by outlining three important developments that
   fuelled the politicization: (a) the common currency; (b) the increased
   pushback on the EU's open border policies; and (c) the inability of the
   EU to prevent democratic backsliding in some countries. We then discuss
   their consequences for EU elections, particularly campaigns, public
   opinion on Europe and voter behaviour, which are investigated against
   the backdrop of the 2019 European Parliament elections in the individual
   articles in this special issue. This introduction provides a contextual
   framework for these contributions and reflects upon some of its main
   findings.},

Abstract = {The adoption of active learning pedagogy and, later, the institution of
   the employability agenda in Higher Education have resulted in a severe
   loss of agency for academics and students in the Social Sciences. In
   this article, we reflect on our experiences of applying active learning
   methods. We argue that we have been part of a change that has occasioned
   a loss of key skills development, especially those associated with
   traditional learning and academic thinking. An overly headlong rush to
   implement the ``new{''} over the ``old{''} saw the discarding of certain
   skills central to the active learning agenda. Further, the emphasis on
   student satisfaction, professionalisation and quality assurance pushed
   the academic to the sidelines, to the detriment of Higher Education. We,
   therefore, first critique the skills debate and identify shortcomings in
   the active learning application that emerged from that debate. We focus
   on the skills emphasised in practice, how they are portrayed in
   opposition (instead of complementarity) to academic skills, and how they
   undermine the agency academics and students really require. Next, we
   propose a reconsideration of necessary but undervalued skills like
   reading, listening and note-taking.},

Abstract = {Through an ethnographic account of an immigrant worker centre in San
   Francisco, this paper examines their role in brokering the practice of
   citizenship among undocumented workers through strategies of visibility
   and recognition. Positioned as critical brokers in migrant struggles,
   worker centres aim to build the collective `political muscle' of those
   denied formal rights. Unlike previous research that documents the
   evolution and scope of worker centre activities, and their contribution
   to a worker-centred moral economy, this article focuses on how these
   representational brokers contribute to migration governance,
   particularly of precaritized workers who rely on them for their
   livelihoods. Drawing on critical citizenship and migration perspectives,
   it considers migrant activisms that are neither entirely voluntaristic
   nor particularly emancipatory. Instead, these mediated enactments are
   situated alongside a broader, increasingly normative (and
   assimilationist) process of `coming out of the shadows' - a process that
   is widely celebrated and encouraged as it is assumed to mark an
   ontological shift from anonymity, nonbeing, and shame to defiant
   resistance. Here, the concept of `coming out' emphasizes the highly
   laborious, selective, and normalizing nature of coming out politics. In
   the context of the worker centre movement, `coming out of the shadows'
   entails heightened exposure and risk-taking among those with precarious
   immigration statuses and labour prospects, thereby contributing to an
   institutional culture of compulsive (and compulsory) self-disclosure.},

Abstract = {Global capital mobility is a crucial determinant of economic, political,
   and social life. While much has been written about the ethics of human
   movement, political theory has remained nearly silent on the ethics of
   capital movement. In this article, we intend to develop a general
   account of the ethics of global capital mobility-identifying both the
   forms of mobility that merit protection and those that merit
   restriction. By integrating normative theorizing with an economic
   analysis of global investment, we argue that the movement of capital,
   with important exceptions, should be much more restricted than it is
   today. We make the case, on both grounds of global justice and
   international assistance, for imposing coercive limits on cross-border
   inflows and outflows of capital. To enable them, we also propose a
   radical reform of the international monetary system-a new global
   currency-that would simultaneously facilitate beneficial capital
   movements.},

Abstract = {The historical context of early post-Kantian debates on politics reveals
   the emergence of a new type of perfectionist ethics no longer based on
   the state-sponsored promotion of happiness, as the dominant German
   tendency in the eighteenth century had been, but on individual freedom.
   Post-Kantian perfectionism focused on maintaining and enhancing the
   conditions for rightful interaction among self-defining individuals.
   Rather than isolating and alienating, Kantian negative freedom enabled a
   new conception of social interaction based on the idea of right and the
   progressive extension of rightful relations. Humboldt, Schiller, Fichte,
   and Marx exemplified this new approach, despite their differences.},

Abstract = {Though political discussion amongst citizens is central in democracy,
   little is known about what triggers informal political discussions and
   through which pathways. This article argues that citizens gain knowledge
   about politics when they are exposed to political conflict in the news
   media and that this may encourage them to participate more in political
   discussions conditioned by their orientation towards conflict due to
   potential interpersonal conflict. The indirect effect is argued to be
   larger on social media where behaviour is more uncivil than in
   face-to-face interactions. Based on a content analysis of news coverage
   and a three-wave panel survey (n = 2,049), exposure to conflict framing
   is found to have a positive effect on changes in discussion frequency
   across social settings. The effect is mediated by knowledge and
   subsequently moderated by conflict avoidance: conflict non-avoiders are
   more positively influenced than conflict avoiders. The indirect effect
   is larger in social media than in public and private settings. The wider
   societal implications of the results are discussed.},

Abstract = {Prior research suggests that campaigns become more negative when the
   election environment becomes more competitive. Much of this research
   suffers from data and design limitations. I replicate and extend prior
   analyses using a much larger number of cases. Using advertising data
   drawn from 374 U.S. Senate and gubernatorial campaigns contested from
   2000 through 2018, I find evidence that electoral competition encourages
   candidates to engage in more negative advertising campaigns and that
   incumbency status conditions these effects. Incumbents of both parties
   use more negative messaging strategies as competition increases. The
   effects of competition among challengers and open seat candidates is
   mixed. These results add to what we know about campaign advertising
   behavior and suggest that researchers should take care to avoid ignoring
   important contextual factors that underlie candidates' strategic
   choices.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the representativeness of news coverage when
   there are nearly as many female candidates as there are male candidates
   by considering the 2018 Quebec Election, in which 47 per cent of
   candidates were women. We are interested not only in the magnitude of
   the coverage (that is, the volume of press coverage received by each
   candidate) but also in its tone (if the press coverage is negative or
   positive) and whether these parameters fluctuate based on the gender of
   the candidates. We know that the quality of the news coverage, and more
   specifically its tone, can affect voting intentions. We also know that
   journalists routinely portray politics as a masculine activity, but we
   know very little about the coverage that local female candidates receive
   in the context of parity in North America. We find that in spite of
   exceptional circumstances, female candidates received significantly less
   coverage than men.},

Abstract = {In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), Justices Alito, Thomas, and
   Gorsuch called for the reversal of Employment Division v. Smith (1990),
   the Supreme Court's leading Free Exercise Clause precedent. For years,
   Smith has been targeted by originalists who contend that, among other
   things, Smith is incompatible with a Madisonian understanding of
   religious freedom. This article challenges that conclusion. It attempts
   to do so not by employing the typical tools of originalist legal
   scholarship, but rather by setting forth Madison's political science of
   religious liberty. The article argues the logic of Federalist 10 is
   incompatible with exemptions from generally applicable laws and,
   therefore, that a Madisonian construction of the Free Exercise Clause
   would not support a constitutional right to religious exemptions.
   Insofar as Federalist 10 articulates the Constitution's underlying
   structural design, Free Exercise Clause exemptions undermine one of the
   principal mechanisms that Madison believed would protect liberty,
   including religious liberty.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that landed elites oppose democratization.
   Whether they fear rising wages, labor mobility or land redistribution,
   landowners have historically repressed agricultural workers and
   sustained autocracy. What might change landowning elites' preferences
   for dictatorship and reduce their opposition to democracy? Change
   requires reducing landowners' need to maintain political control over
   labor. This transition occurs when mechanization reduces the demand for
   agricultural workers, eliminating the need for labor-repressive
   policies. We explain how the adoption of labor-saving technology in
   agriculture alters landowners' political preferences for different
   regimes, so that the more mechanized the agricultural sector, the more
   likely is democracy to emerge and survive. Our theoretical argument
   offers a parsimonious revision to Moore's thesis that applies to the
   global transformation of agriculture since his Social Origins first
   appeared, and results from our cross-national statistical analyses
   strongly suggest that a positive relationship between agricultural
   mechanization and democracy does in fact exist.},

Abstract = {Contemporary research mainly relates police ineffectiveness in sectarian
   crimes prevention-investigation and enforcement of anti-terror laws to
   disorganized police infrastructure, a shortage of manpower, a lack of
   professionalism and limited access to modern equipment. This article, by
   applying capacity (i.e. manpower, resources, professional and technical
   training, etc.) and autonomy (effective and neutral exercise of powers
   within mandates delegated to them) concepts, aims to examine police
   effectiveness in the enforcement of anti-sectarian laws in the context
   of interference in their functions by the political executive and the
   State's Army. It addresses the question: How do police capacity and
   autonomy issues affect police effectiveness in prevention-investigation
   of sectarian crimes and enforcement of anti-terror laws? This article
   applies a mixed method research approach by using data from books,
   journal articles, newspapers, TV talk shows, online sources and
   interviews. It relates the police's effectiveness in
   prevention-investigation of sectarian crimes and enforcement of
   anti-terror laws to their capacity and autonomy issues in the Punjab
   Province of Pakistan. It argues that the police due to capacity and
   autonomy issues cannot exercise delegated powers impartially, which
   affects their effectiveness in prevention-investigation of sectarian
   crimes and enforcement of anti-terror laws.},

Abstract = {The article poses the following research questions: to what extent has
   the populist executive in Hungary affected formal and informal
   parliamentary powers? To what extent has the relation between the
   executive and the legislative changed over the three legislative periods
   of populist government? This article examines change in formal powers
   but also in the informal practices concerning parliament's legislative
   and scrutiny functions. Regarding the time frame, the empirical analysis
   compares the period when Fidesz was in opposition (2006-2010), with the
   period when Fidesz has been in government (2010-2020). The article
   establishes that during 2010-2020, the legislative suffered profound
   disempowerment that has been attributed to three factors: systemic
   collapse of democracy in Hungary, weakening formal powers of the
   legislature and the autocratic features of the Fidesz party. Moreover,
   the article demonstrates that executive-legislative relations have been
   dynamic between 2010 and 2020 and concern different formal and informal
   practices.},

Abstract = {The question ``What is Marxism?{''} is not as straightforward as it
   appears. There are different ways of answering it. One can study and
   describe what Marx himself wrote and said, but Marx's views changed, and
   Marxism has had a life beyond Marx. Some try to define Marxism by
   specifying an agreed core of doctrines, others by its method, or by its
   practical commitments. Each of these definitions captures an aspect of
   the nature of Marxism, but none is without problems. Controversy still
   rages about Marx's legacy and its contemporary significance.},

Abstract = {How does the state of American federalism explain responses to COVID-19?
   State-by-state variations to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the
   political dynamics of ``kaleidoscopic federalism,{''} under which there
   is no single prevailing principle of federalism. In the COVID-19
   pandemic, features of kaleidoscopic federalism combined with
   shortcomings in the public health system under the Trump administration,
   leading to fragmented responses to the pandemic among the states.
   Federalism alone does not explain the shortcomings of the United States'
   response to the pandemic. Rather, the fragmented response was driven by
   state partisanship, which shaped state public health interventions and
   resulted in differences in public health outcomes. This has sobering
   implications for American federalism because state-level partisan
   differences yield different and unequal responses to the pandemic.},

Abstract = {As presidents approach the end of their constitutionally defined term in
   office, they face a number of difficulties, most importantly the
   deprivation of sources of power, personal enrichment, and protection
   from prosecution. This leads many of them to attempt to circumvent their
   term limits. Recent studies explain both the reasons for the extension
   or full abolition of term limits, and failed attempts to do so. Key
   explanations include electoral competition and the post-term fate of
   previous post holders. What we do not know yet is how compliance with
   term limits may be tied to the current president's expectations for
   their post-term fate. In particular, we do not know whether leaders who
   attempt to remove term limits and fail to do so jeopardize their
   post-term career as a result, and conversely, whether leaders who comply
   will have better outcomes in terms of security, prestige, and economic
   gain. Hence, we ask how the decision of a leader to comply or not comply
   with term limits is conditioned by the expectation of their post-term
   fate. To address this question, this article introduces new data on the
   career trajectories of term-limited presidents and its systematic effect
   on term limit compliance.},

Abstract = {Bernard Yack's Longing for Total Revolution asserts that a prominent
   tradition of modern moral and political theory is founded on the binary
   opposition between nature and culture. Yack rejects this dichotomy in
   favor of an Aristotelean outlook, and in so doing embraces the
   opposition between the ancients and the moderns. Neither binary is as
   oppositional as Yack suggests. There is, however, a more viable
   distinction to be made between the ancients and the moderns-concerning
   the role played by teleology-and it better serves the purpose of mapping
   the historical trajectory of moral and political theorizing. Teleology
   does not survive modernity, and it is this development that was truly
   revolutionary.},

Abstract = {The Australian House of Representatives contains far fewer women than
   men. But is this because parties of left and right discriminate against
   women or because voters do? Using a new dataset comprising 7271 House
   candidates from 2001 to 2019, firstly, we find that the percentage of
   women candidates is increasing, but is consistently higher for parties
   of the left than the right. Secondly, women tend to be selected more by
   parties of both left and right in unsafe seats. Thirdly, all else being
   equal, voters reward women running for Labor with over 1400 votes more,
   are neutral towards those of the Liberals and Greens, but tend to
   penalise women standing for the Nationals. We conclude that, overall, it
   is parties, not voters, driving under-representation of women in
   Australia's lower house.},

   Policy},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {When can states implement policies against the opposition from powerful
   interest groups? Research on state capacity has examined bureaucratic
   sources of capacity, leaving unexplained why countries with similar
   levels of bureaucratic capacity vary in goal attainment. We introduce
   the notion of strategic state capacity to explain this puzzle. It refers
   to the ability of the state to mobilize or demobilize interest groups in
   pursuit of policy goals. We identify four general types of strategies
   states use to counter opposition: recruiting allies, aligning interests,
   limiting access, and quieting interests. We examine these in cases on
   climate and clean energy policymaking in California, France, Germany,
   and the United States. Climate politics is an increasingly important
   field of distributive politics with powerful opposition from interest
   groups. The concept of strategic state capacity complements bureaucratic
   notions of capacity to show how the state actively organizes its
   relations with interest groups to advance policy goals.},

Abstract = {Security forces are one of the main targets of political violence. This
   paper examines the effect of their casualties on electoral outcomes.
   Between two general elections in 2015, Turkey experienced a series of
   attacks that killed 153 members of its security forces. Based on the
   as-if random assignment of their funerals across the country, I estimate
   that government vote share increases in the funeral places of security
   force terror victims. However, in the localities with recurring
   funerals, it decreases by a similar percentage. These non-linear changes
   provide strong evidence for the rally theory.},

Abstract = {To explore the mechanisms that foster rational, communicative, and
   actionable citizenship, this research proposes a mediation as well as
   moderation research framework that links deliberative thinking,
   political self-efficacy, social capital, and civic participation. Data
   from 865 Taiwanese university students are analyzed with structural
   equation modeling, showing a positive association of deliberative
   thinking to political self-efficacy and civic participation, as well as
   a positive association between them. Moreover, the association between
   deliberative thinking and civic participation is signi?cantly and
   positively mediated by political self-efficacy. When background factors
   are controlled, only social capital is identified to be moderating any
   associations between variables in this study. The established
   association between deliberative thinking and political self-efficacy
   and that between deliberative thinking and the non-electoral, as well as
   community-based dimensions of civic participation, are significantly
   weaker among those possessing less social capital, while such
   differences are not significant in the case of gender and household
   income. Based on these findings, the relative roles of deliberative
   thinking, political self-efficacy, and social capital in promoting
   effective deliberative democracy will be discussed.},

Abstract = {How and when do opportunities for political participation through courts
   change under authoritarianism? Although China is better known for tight
   political control than for political expression, the 2008 Open
   Government Information (OGI) regulation ushered in a surge of
   political-legal activism. We draw on an original dataset of 57,095 OGI
   lawsuits, supplemented by interview data and government documents, to
   show how a feedback loop between judges and court users shaped
   possibilities for political activism and complaint between 2008 and
   2019. Existing work suggests that authoritarian leaders crack down on
   legal action when they feel politically threatened. In contrast, we find
   that courts minted, defined, and popularized new legal labels to cut off
   access to justice for the super-active litigants whose lawsuits had come
   to dominate the OGI docket. This study underscores the power of
   procedural rules and frontline judges in shaping possibilities for
   political participation under authoritarianism.},

Title = {The far right, the mainstream and mainstreaming: towards a heuristic
   framework},

Abstract = {The study of far-right parties and politics is one of the most
   high-profile research areas in political science and related
   disciplines. Far-right parties have been the subject of vast amounts of
   varied scholarship since their turn-of-the-century resurgence. However,
   as the far right has become a mainstay, with Brexit and the election of
   Donald Trump in 2016 blurring the boundaries between mainstream and
   far-right politics, it has become crucial to pay attention to the
   process of mainstreaming. Beyond a focus on far-right electoral success,
   studies of mainstreaming, as well as a critical account of the concept
   and role of the `mainstream', have proved elusive. This article provides
   a heuristic framework to understand these concepts and the mainstreaming
   of the far right. Key to our approach is a more holistic analysis,
   extending beyond traditional approaches which focus mostly on the
   electoral outcomes of far-right parties, positioning the mainstream as a

   we account for the significant role played by the mainstream in this

Abstract = {Structured in-class debates are a valuable addition to courses that seek
   to foster students' development as citizens. In this study, we examine
   how different debate formats can impact their effectiveness as a
   pedagogical tool for advancing students' civic learning outcomes. We
   consider moderated dualistic debates that ask students to bring
   empirical evidence to bear on a yes/no question about a particular
   policy issue and unmoderated pluralistic debates that ask students to
   engage with multiple perspectives about essential political values. We
   find that both debate formats contribute to students' civic education:
   Moderated dualistic debates cultivated some political skills while
   unmoderated pluralistic debates deepened-and complicated-students'
   thinking about democratic values. From these results, we conclude that
   students' civic development benefits from experience with a variety of
   different debate formats that can prepare students for effective
   citizenship in distinct ways.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the design, facilitation and outcomes of a pilot
   embedded librarian initiative that transpired in a research methods
   course in a political science program. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the impact and affordances of embedding a librarian in an
   undergraduate methods course. This study explored how embedding a
   librarian enhanced the pedagogical approach, student learning outcomes,
   and to what extent students became more comfortable collaborating with
   reference librarians to expand their research methods and improve their
   information literacy skills. The study used a quasi-experimental
   approach and embedded a librarian using a Just in Time approach. The
   overall findings of the research study reveal that while there were no
   statistically significant findings, there were subtle differences
   between course sections.},

Title = {What Kinds of Departments Promote Undergraduate Research in Political
   Science?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {371-384},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine the factors that are associated with the
   adoption of a formalized undergraduate research program in political
   science. What kinds of institutions and departments are more or less
   likely to adopt a formalized undergraduate research program? One the one
   hand, one might assume that such a program appears in departments that
   are well endowed with research resources, i.e. Ph.D. granting
   departments. On the other hand, the personal interaction between faculty
   members and undergraduate students required of mentored undergraduate
   research might suggest such programs are more likely to exist at
   primarily undergraduate degree-granting programs. Using data from the
   2017 to 18 American Political Science Departmental Survey of 383
   political science departments, I find that contrary to expectations,
   institutional characteristics are unrelated to the likelihood of
   offering an undergraduate research program. Rather the one factor that
   is significantly related to whether a department offers an undergraduate
   research program is whether the department also offers a capstone course
   as an indicator of a structured curriculum. This suggests a commitment
   to curricular structure is most associated with the promotion of
   undergraduate research, independent of institutional characteristics.},

Title = {The impact of a STEM background on MPs' legislative behaviour},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-166},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is widely accepted that an MP's background influences their
   legislative behaviour. Yet, little attention has been paid to the impact
   of an MP's occupational and educational background, especially with
   regards to having a STEM background (Science, Technology, Engineering
   and Maths). Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of
   having a STEM educational and/or occupational background on both the
   likelihood of MPs proposing a STEM Private Member's Bill (PMB) and the
   proportion of PMB proposals an MP dedicates to STEM bills. Focussing on
   the 2015-2017 UK Parliament, we find that having a STEM background does
   not affect the likelihood of proposing a STEM PMB (or not) but combining
   an educational and occupational STEM background significantly increases
   the proportion of an MP's PMB proposals dedicated to STEM bills. This
   effect is stronger for the co-sponsors of PMBs than for the primary
   presenters. We also find that having a STEM educational background
   matters more strongly for women than for men, and that the level of
   education in an MP's constituency also affects the link between having a
   STEM background and the proportion of submitted STEM PMBs. Our findings
   highlight the substantive consequences of having a diverse parliament,
   also in terms of educational and occupational backgrounds.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine how the process of foreign policy
   decision-making affects the conduct of states in the international
   system and how states respond to external threats according to internal
   factors, notably elite threat perceptions and the capacity of
   institutions to mobilize power. Despite its small size and population,
   Qatar has achieved enormous regional projection in the last decades. Our
   hypothesis is that the Arab Spring forced Qatar and the rest of the
   monarchies in the Gulf to restructure their foreign policies. The
   mediator-integrator role that Doha had played till then gave way to a
   more active, independent role in which the tools of hard power gradually
   replaced those of previous soft power. These changes aggravated tensions
   with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which, in 2017, decided
   to impose a blockade on Qatar.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {510-528},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Liberal political theory is often understood as being underpinned by an
   individualistic social ontology, and it is sometimes objected that this
   type of ontology makes it difficult to address injustices that involve
   social groups and informal forms of privilege. It is argued here that,
   to the extent that liberals do fail to properly address such structural
   injustices, the main problem can instead be understood to lie with a
   rules-centric understanding of institutions - one which is actually out
   of line with a proper ontological individualism. If institutions are
   instead understood as distributions of right and duties, held by
   individuals, it becomes much more straightforward to identify
   institutional privilege in terms of inequalities in those distributions.
   The relevant rights and duties can be explicated in terms of informal
   Hohfeldian incidents and it is argued that patterned distributions of
   such incidents can come to exist, and be maintained, through how we
   develop a largely intuitive sense of where our interpersonal boundaries
   run and form social expectations about which kinds of behaviour will
   typically receive pushback in some form.},

Abstract = {The monetary impact of mega data breaches has been a significant concern
   for enterprises. The study of data breach risk assessment is a necessity
   for organizations to have effective cybersecurity risk management. Due
   to the lack of available data, it is not easy to obtain a comprehensive
   understanding of the interactions among factors that affect the cost of
   mega data breaches. The Monte Carlo analysis results were used to
   explicate the interactions among independent variables and emerging
   patterns in the variation of the total data breach cost. The findings of
   this study are as follows: The total data breach cost varies
   significantly with personally identifiable information (PII) and
   sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) with unique
   patterns. Second, SPII must be a separate independent variable. Third,
   the multilevel factorial interactions between SPII and the other
   independent variables elucidate subtle patterns in the total data breach
   cost variation. Fourth, class action lawsuit (CAL) categorical variables
   regulate the variation in the total data breach cost.},

Abstract = {Some scholars have judged the Trump presidency to be an ineffective
   failure by applying theories of presidential power derived from the
   research of Richard Neustadt, who emphasized the need for presidents to
   master the task of bargaining with other stakeholders in the American
   political system to overcome what he saw as the limited potency of
   unilateral action. Such an approach, however, fails to account for two
   important considerations: (1) whether Trump's goals in office were
   similar to those of other presidents, and (2) whether the Trump
   presidency was instead organized around the principles of unitary
   executive theory, an increasingly popular conception of the presidency
   in conservative intellectual circles. Viewing the Trump presidency
   through this alternative lens emphasizes its successes in gaining
   political control over elements of the executive branch bureaucracy and
   resisting institutional checks by Congress, raising serious questions
   about whether Trump was indeed often effective in realizing his goals-
   and whether future presidents will follow in the same path.},

Abstract = {How does ethnicity influence mass support for radical reforms? Treating
   ethnicity as a set of cognitively useful categories serving both
   ethnocentric and inclusive ends, we argue people can strive toward civic
   visions for their state yet interpret obstacles through ``ethnic{''}
   lenses. We label this phenomenon aspirational identity politics,
   prominent when external aggressors exploit identity commonalities with
   home-state subpopulations. Consequently, ethnic cognition can facilitate
   radical reform support not only through ethnocentrism, but also by
   connecting prosocial dispositions to support for in-group favoring
   reforms. Accordingly, original survey data from Ukraine in 2017 reveal
   prosocial values better predict support for nine radical
   reforms-including in-group favoring ones-than does ethnocentrism.
   Support is also strongest among economically better-off people,
   indicating backing for radical reform is generally more about aspiration
   than desperation.},

Abstract = {The article aims to explore the relationships that arise with respect to
   intellectual property rights in sports. The objectives of the article
   are to establish points of contact between intellectual property law and
   sports, as well as a detailed analysis of relevant public relations in
   terms of intellectual property law and sports law. To achieve the
   objectives of the article, the authors used a number of scientific
   methods, among which the main methods are analysis, synthesis and
   comparative-legal method. The authors of the study concluded that modern
   sport is developing in close intertwining with intellectual property
   rights, because only in this way can a sports spectacle be conveyed to a
   wide range of spectators and consumers in a broad sense. In addition,
   the range of points of contact between intellectual property and sports
   law is constantly growing and such can now be called not only patents
   and trademarks in sports, but also copyright, ``image{''} rights,
   know-how in sports and the like.},

Abstract = {Using a comprehensive, global data set, we provide evidence toward
   settling a debate in the literature on party systems and national
   political institutions regarding the relationships between political
   centralization and nationalization of political party support. We also
   help explain disparate findings in the literature. Does political
   centralization or decentralization precede nationalization or
   regionalization of political party support, or the other way around? We
   confirm previous findings that centralization is correlated with
   nationalized party systems. Our analysis shows, however, that on average
   centralization precedes party system nationalization more often than the
   other way around. And specifically, we provide novel evidence that it is
   administrative centralization, and not fiscal centralization, that
   drives these changes. The findings, based on a variety of statistical
   specifications and measures, are important because they shed light on
   the way that institutional changes, including constitutional changes
   regarding the relationships between central governments and subnational
   governments, affect party competition.},

Abstract = {This article presents some considerations about how the reformist
   options, adopted in Brazil after 2016, operate as instruments of
   austerity and how it is weakening the democratic sovereign system. The
   conceptual and historical comparative discussions are combined to better
   understand the logic, the functioning and the interests associated with
   the current socio economic policy. In the light of the literature about
   democracy and reforms, the empirical scope is some budgetary issues
   raised by Constitutional Amendment n degrees. 95/16, and the aim is to
   discuss the impacts of austerity measures and to show that the rush
   reformist impulse builds a new legal and institutional architecture to
   protect the interests of investors in detriment of the social rights and
   the democratic citizenship proclaimed by the Brazilian Constitution. The
   final considerations show that the reforms analyzed, although it occurs
   in spaces democratically constituted, are marked by the asymmetry of
   interests that mitigate the possibilities of strengthening the
   democratic scope of the State.},

Abstract = {Innovation policies are currently one of the main axes for improving the
   efficiency of national economies in developed and developing countries.
   The innovation policy includes a comprehensive system of activities. In
   Russia, increasing the specific weight of commercial entities engaged in
   innovative activities is among the most important objectives for the
   short term. The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of innovation
   based on taking into account the specific weight of organizations that
   perform innovations in the total number of organizations operating in
   the regions of Russia. Our study was based on official statistical
   information on the 82 regions of Russia for 2017-2019.
   Economic-mathematical models have been developed that describe the
   specific weight of the organizations that implement innovation. There
   are no significant changes in the indicators for the years indicated. It
   has been shown that, to date, almost one in five organizations in the
   Russian Federation has used innovation in their activities. In addition,
   they have identified the regions with maximum and minimum values of the
   specific weightings of innovative organizations for 2019.},

Abstract = {What did Trump's four years do to our mass politics? Partisanism-a
   blind, often unyielding loyalty to one's own party-has come to define
   much of our political discourse, very much to the detriment of the
   American polity. Both the literature and the data on party evaluations
   confirm that people are behaving in ways that display not just
   consistent polarization but a deeper level of partisan bias, despite
   their lack of ideological consistency. Political science should respond
   to these developments with increased focus on the negative aspects of
   partisanship that can lead to this form of partisanism so dangerously
   exhibited in the Capitol riot, among other events, as well as a
   thoughtful classroom critique of these habits.},

Abstract = {Research in political science and other social sciences often relies on
   survey data to study a range of questions about politics in the
   developing world. This study identifies systematic measurement error in
   some of the most frequently used datasets with respect to one commonly
   employed variable: respondent's age. It shows evidence of substantial
   measurement error that is correlated with observable characteristics,
   and discusses and illustrates the implications for empirical analysis
   with an example from a recently published study. In doing so, it
   demonstrates tools for identifying and diagnosing systematic measurement
   error in survey data, as well as for investigating the robustness of
   one's findings when the problem arises.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the debates on the definition of the concept of
   populism in Colombia and its relation to the concept of violence between
   1970 and 2010. Following the footsteps of certain intellectuals and
   their hypotheses on violence, we also believe that this came as a
   consequence of several populist phenomena that did not come to power,
   such as gaitanismo and anapismo, or as antecedents of those that did, as
   in the case of uribismo. In our opinion, this link between populism and
   violence constructed by the authors is a fundamental part of the
   invention of Colombia as an exceptional case in Latin America. The work
   is developed thanks to different perspectives of the new intellectual
   history and tries to reconcile some of its theoretical and
   methodological tools to think of its own object of study and approach it
   from its own dimensions.},

Abstract = {How does the threat from future violence shape the opinions of those
   mired in violent intergroup disputes? Two competing rationales seem
   plausible. During conflict, threat from future violence increases
   support for dovish policies because the destruction and suffering
   associated with violence make peace seem more desirable and urgent. At
   the same time, threat from future violence can decrease support for
   dovish policies because peace seems inconceivable when violence is on
   the rise. Indeed, existing studies on the link between threat
   perceptions and support for conflict-related policies yielded mixed
   results. We argue that, to some extent, this puzzle could be solved by
   (1) examining threat through its two core components, namely perceived
   severity of harm and perceived likelihood of harm, and (2) linking these
   two components of threat with the two components of hope, namely the
   wish to attain a goal (in our case peace) and the expectations of
   attaining it. These arguments were tested using original data collected
   among 800 Israelis and Palestinians. Results show that the part of
   threat stemming from perceiving future violence as severe generates
   support for dovish policies because it increases citizens' wishes for
   peace. At the same time, the part of threat that stems from perceiving
   future violence as likely decreases support for the same policies due to
   decreased expectations that peace can be achieved. We show that the
   relative weight of the two components of threat determines citizens'
   support for conflict-related policies. Implications for political
   behavior during conflict are discussed.},

Abstract = {Whereas social scientists have devised various ways to measure
   representation gaps between the political elite and the masses across
   nations and time, few datasets can be used to measure this gap for
   particular social groups. Minding the gap between what parties social
   groups vote for and what parties actually attain seats in parliament can
   reveal the position of social groups in the political power structure.
   We help to fill this gap with a new publicly available dataset, Party
   Representation of Social Groups (PaReSoGo), consisting of 25 countries
   and 150 country-years, and a method for its construction. We used the
   European Social Survey 2002-2016 and ParlGov data for this time span to
   create a Dissimilarity Index. To demonstrate the utility and flexibility
   in the combination of cross-national surveys and administrative data, we
   chose social groups of gender, age, and education, as well as
   intersectional groups based on gender and age, and attitudinal groups.
   We conclude this research note with empirical illustrations of
   PaReSoGo's use.},

Abstract = {The ability of Members of Parliament (MPs) to know the policy
   preferences of their party voters is a precondition for substantive
   representation. This study investigates whether MPs' perceptions of
   their party voters' opinions are more accurate with policy statements on
   which they are competent-namely, those that are owned by their party and
   in which the MPs have specialised. It combines unique data from citizen
   surveys and face-to-face meetings with 367 MPs in Belgium, Canada,
   Germany and Switzerland. Both citizens and MPs evaluated the same
   statements, and MPs also estimated the support for each statement among
   their party voters. The comparison of party voters' preferences and MPs'
   estimations shows that MPs are more accurate on statements owned by
   their party, but not on issues they themselves specialise in through
   committee membership. Party issue ownership plays an important role in
   determining MPs' perceptual accuracy and, hence, democratic
   representation. Supplemental data for this article can be accessed

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic produced more significant immediate
   intergovernmental conflict in the U.S. than in Australia and Canada.
   This article considers three variables for this cross-national
   divergence: presidentialism versus parliamentarism; vertical party
   integration; and strength of intergovernmental arrangements. We find
   that the U.S. presidential system, contrary to parliamentarism in Canada
   and Australia, provided an opportunity for a populist outsider skeptical
   of experts to win the presidency and pursue a personalized style that
   favored intergovernmental conflict in times of crisis. Then, the
   intergovernmental conflict-inducing effect of the Trump presidency
   during the pandemic was compounded by the vertical integration of
   political parties, which provided incentives for the President to
   criticize Democratic governors and vice-versa. Third, the virtual
   absence of any structure for intergovernmental relations in the United
   States meant that, unlike Australian states and Canadian provinces,
   American states struggled to get the federal government's attention and
   publicly deplored its lack of leadership.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article revisits the debate over Chile's binomial electoral rules
   and its consequences and examines how the new electoral system conceived
   by a democratic congress altered political competition. It utilizes a
   seat-vote model of multiparty competition to analyze party bias under
   the binomial rule. This approach differs substantively from prior
   studies of the Chilean case that focused primarily on the
   disproportionality of aggregate results. In contrast to earlier
   analyses, the findings reveal that the allocation of the seats under the
   binominal resulted in significant party bias benefiting the main parties
   of the right. This bias, however, was eliminated after the electoral
   reform. The new rule continues to provide majoritarian benefits to
   parties receiving larger shares of votes, but this effect is less
   pronounced than before. It is now easier for small parties to gain
   seats, which has increased party fragmentation. However, we show that
   coalition incentives, which were heralded as one of the main advantages
   of the binomial rule, are also significant under the new rule in use
   since 2017.},

Abstract = {Advocacy groups often work to educate the public about voting
   requirements following changes to election laws. These outreach efforts
   have the potential to mobilize partisan groups who consider the laws a
   threat to their party's electoral prospects. In the 2017 Virginia
   election, we partnered with an advocacy organization to conduct a field
   experiment evaluating the effects of the organization's outreach
   campaign. We randomized which registered voters were mailed one of three
   informational postcards providing details about voter identification
   requirements in place at the time in Virginia. Overall, the postcards
   had minimal effects on turnout compared to the no-contact control group.
   However, each version of the postcards significantly increased turnout
   among subgroups based on their underlying partisanship and/or
   vote-propensity. Democrats were significantly mobilized by postcards
   highlighting the potentially disproportionate impact of ID laws on
   demographic groups that traditionally support the Democratic Party, with
   approximately a two percentage point increase in turnout overall, and
   even higher increases among high vote-propensity Democrats. A simple,
   informational postcard, on the other hand, elevated turnout among low
   vote-propensity recipients by two percentage points. The postcard
   treatments did not significantly increase turnout among Republicans or
   mid vote-propensity registrants of either party.},

   political scientists about the migration crisis in online public

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that Hungary was less affected by the 2015 migration
   crisis in objective terms-i.e. the negligible number of immigrants
   entering and settling in the country in the last years-, the Hungarian
   government has been pushing an extreme anti-immigration political
   communication since 2015, which resulted in an intensive and highly
   politicised public discourse about immigration. This analysis aims at
   exploring the involvement of political scientists in the online public
   discourse about the migration and refugee crisis in Hungary between 2015
   and 2019. In contrast with other countries, where high salient political
   crises have stimulated political scientists' public engagement, this
   analysis finds that such participation does not apply to the Hungarian
   case. The low visibility of political scientists is accompanied by the
   adoption among participants in news portals of either a partisan,
   pro-government stance or a neutral approach to the issue, while critical
   positions with the government are almost inexistent. These patterns
   suggest the influence of both the illiberal institutional turn of the
   Hungarian media environment and the decrease in academic freedom in the
   country, as factors deterring public engagement among political
   scientists in the immigration issue, particularly of those who could
   adopt a critical position.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {When assessing election forecasts, two important criteria emerge: their
   accuracy (precision) and lead time (distance to event). Curiously, in
   both 2010 and 2015 the most accurate forecasts came from models having
   the longest lead time-albeit at most 12 months. Can we increase the lead
   time further, supposing we tolerate a small decrease in accuracy? Here,
   we develop a model with a lead time of more than 3 years. Our Party
   Leadership Model relies on the votes of MPs when selecting their party
   leader. We assess the forecasting quality of our model with both
   leave-one-out cross-validation and a before-the-fact forecast of the
   2019 general election. Compared to both simple forecasting methods and
   other scientific forecasts, our model emerges as a leading contender.
   This result suggests that election forecasting may benefit from
   developing models with longer lead times, and that party leaders may
   influence election outcomes more than is usually thought.},

Abstract = {The article analyses whether and how the activity of populist
   governments in Italy has affected the performance of parliament's
   legislative and scrutiny functions. The analysis covers the government
   of Five Star Movement (5SM) and the Lega as well as the coalition
   government made up of the 5SM, the Democratic Party and centre-left
   junior allies up to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article uses selected
   bills and decree-laws to investigate the impact on the legislative
   function, while question time sessions and committees of inquiry are
   examined as case studies on the scrutiny function. The analysis
   demonstrates that although `subversive' constitutional and parliamentary
   conduct was already in place beforehand, when populists entered
   government in the 18th legislative term there was a worsening of a trend
   towards eroding representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Brexit has been a major crisis facing the European integration process.
   The paper examines how Brexit was framed and exploited by two EU member
   state governments, Czechia and Hungary. We conceptualize Brexit as a
   ``distant crisis{''} for these two countries: although it is likely to
   have significant impacts, these are uncertain and not immediate.
   Building on the crisis-framing literature, we apply frame analysis to
   examine governmental rhetoric and find that both governments have
   instrumentalized Brexit for internal purposes by pragmatically adapting
   their discursive positions on it to fit their political calculus on both
   domestic and European issues.},

Abstract = {Public responsiveness to policy is contingent on there being a
   sufficient amount of clear and accurate information about policy
   available to citizens. It is of some significance then, that there are
   increasing concerns about limits being placed on media outlets around
   the world. We examine the impact of these limits on the public's ability
   to respond meaningfully to policy by analyzing cross-national variation
   in the opinion-policy link. Using new measures on spending preferences
   from Wave 4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, merged with
   OECD data on government spending and Freedom House measures of press
   freedom, we assess the role of mass media in facilitating public
   responsiveness. We find evidence that when media are weak, so too is
   public responsiveness to policy. These results highlight the critical
   role that accurate, unfettered media can play in modern representative
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes homonationalist discourses in a context that has
   received little attention so far: a minority nation (Quebec) within a
   multinational state (Canada). To the extent that nationalism is often
   constructed in opposition to an ``Other,{''} we attempt to identify who
   this ``Other{''} is in Quebec's homonationalism. In particular, we
   explore whether this ``Other{''} can also take the form of the majority
   nation through an analysis of articles published between 1990 and 2017
   in various Quebec newspapers (La Presse, Le Devoir and Le Journal de
   Montreal). Our results show that if it is ``English Canada{''} that was
   more likely in the first half of the 2000s to be the ``Other{''} of
   Quebec's sexual nationalism, since the end of the 2000s, it is more
   often Muslims (here and elsewhere) and immigrants who are the object of
   an alteration in homonationalist discourses in Quebec.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes a rhetoric created by uribismo to construct a
   discourse of the nation and their enemy. In order to explain this, a
   theoretical methodology has been undertaken to compare a performative
   populist orientation and an interpretation methodology. The first part
   of this analysis reconstructs the time-space context in which the
   uribista discourse was produced and legitimized in Colombian society
   towards the end of the 20th century. The second section focuses on an
   interpretative look at various statements and expressions made by Uribe
   between 2000 and 2010, evidencing how the uribista discourse, by using
   certain literary figures and three logical strategies in particular, was
   able to construct and establish political indicators for the nation and
   its enemy, as patriotic or non patriotic identities respectively.},

Abstract = {This paper shows how an uneven electoral system in Japan shapes
   political parties' mobilization strategies by utilizing a majoritarian
   electoral system with heterogeneous district magnitudes, which in turn
   contributes to the gap in turnout across districts. Scholars have long
   debated the relationship between electoral systems and turnout; it is
   known that countries with proportional representation electoral systems
   - those with larger district magnitude - tend to have higher turnout
   rates than countries with majoritarian electoral systems, especially
   single-member district (SMD) systems. The current discussion on turnout
   and district magnitude of an electoral system assumes a monotonic
   relationship between these factors: the larger the district magnitude of
   the electoral system, the more (or less) participatory the electorate,
   due to competitiveness and mobilization efforts by political parties and
   other relevant groups. In contrast, this paper shows a mixed
   relationship between district magnitude of the electoral system and
   party mobilization and subsequent turnout, investigating a majoritarian
   electoral system with uneven district magnitude in the Japanese Upper
   House. During the survey period, the party system in Japan consisted of
   two major parties and a few smaller parties; consequently, the two major
   parties focused their efforts on SMDs in order to maximize their seat
   share, while smaller parties focused their resource on districts
   electing more than two members (where they have some chance to elect
   their party's candidates). In combination, these party strategies have
   resulted in the lowest mobilization and turnout rates in districts with
   two members.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus upended British politics in 2020 but where does it fit into
   the ideological map of party competition? Recent British elections have
   seen a shift from economic left-right competition between the major
   parties to competition on the cultural (liberal-authoritarian)
   dimension, most notably in terms of the issues of immigration and
   membership of the European Union. Using British Election Study data from
   June 2020, we find that coronavirus attitudes fall primarily onto the
   traditional economic left-right dimension, with left-wing voters more
   willing to make economic sacrifices of various types to reduce
   infections. However, more draconian coronavirus measures (such as fining
   or imprisoning those who violate the coronavirus rules) are most
   supported by voters who score high on authoritarianism. We show that the
   structure of coronavirus attitudes puts the Conservative government in a
   difficult position where many steps it takes to reduce infections risk
   alienating its core economic right-wing vote.},

Abstract = {Populist attitudes are generally considered to consist of three types of
   beliefs, viz. people-centrist, anti-elitist, and Manichean beliefs.
   There is less agreement, however, on how populist attitudes are related
   to liberal democratic attitudes. Some argue that populist attitudes are
   incompatible with liberal democratic attitudes (e.g., pluralism and
   elitism). Others assert that these attitudes are compatible. Starting
   off from the concept of belief systems, we analyze the different ways in
   which people interrelate populist, pluralist, and elitist attitudes.
   Using correlational class analysis, we uncover four belief systems that
   differ in (a) how consistently people support populist beliefs and (b)
   the direction of the relationship between populist and pluralist
   beliefs. We also find that the differences between belief systems are
   related to people's support for populism. People holding populist
   beliefs tend to associate populist attitudes with pluralist attitudes,
   while people who do not hold populist beliefs associate populist
   attitudes with anti-pluralist attitudes.},

Title = {Detecting Voter Understanding of Ideological Labels Using a Conjoint
   Experiment},

Abstract = {Understanding voters' conception of ideological labels is critical for
   political behavioral research. Conventional research designs have
   several limitations, such as endogeneity, insufficient responses to
   open-ended questions, and inseparability of composite treatment effects.
   To address these challenges, we propose a conjoint experiment to study
   the meanings ascribed to ideological labels in terms of policy
   positions. We also suggest using a mixture model approach to explore
   heterogeneity in voters' understandings of ideological labels, as well
   as the average interpretation of labels. We applied these approaches to
   conceptions of left-right labels in Japan, where the primary issue of
   elite-level conflicts has been distinctive compared with other developed
   countries. We found that, on average, while Japanese voters understand
   policy-related meanings of ``left{''} and ``right,{''} they primarily
   associate these labels with security and nationalism, and, secondarily,
   with social issues; they do not associate these labels with economic
   issues. Voters' understandings partly depend on their birth cohort, but
   observed patterns do not necessarily coincide with what many researchers
   would predict regarding generational differences in Japanese politics.
   Mixture model results suggest that some individuals tend to associate
   left-right labels with security and nationalism policies, while others
   link them to social policies. Over one-third of respondents seemed to
   barely understand the usage of left-right labels in policy positions.
   Our study improves upon existing methods for measuring voter
   understanding of ideological labels, and reconfirm the global diversity
   of meanings associated with left-right labels.},

Abstract = {The subservience of the AU to its influential partners compels it to
   protect their interests, even when these interests are detrimental to AU
   (peace) objectives. This is the case in Somalia where Ethiopia and the
   United States have waged a proxy war through the AU. Considering the
   current conflict stalemate, this paper questions if the AU ignored
   viable indigenous options for peace in Somalia? Using process tracing as
   the method of analysis, this paper argues that ignored local
   administrative processes that have stabilized the north, and once used
   by the ICU in south-central Somalia, are the best options for stability.},

Abstract = {With the arrival of vaccines against the novel coronavirus in late 2020,
   the issue of how vaccines should be distributed and which groups should
   be prioritized has become salient. We study popular attitudes toward the
   distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the
   course of the pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds
   of an original public opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter
   of 2020. We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups
   such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable
   degree of cross-generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize
   the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health
   care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven
   by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose
   solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among
   younger groups, however.},

Abstract = {Liberal democracy in the world is under pressure. This article will
   specifically look at security and stability related challenges for
   liberal democracy in a specific region, namely North-western Europe. As
   will be shown, three distinct security and stability related challenges
   put pressure on liberal democracy in this region. Firstly, the struggle
   by states to provide security for their citizens in an era where the
   blurring of internal and external security leads to ``new{''} security
   threats. Secondly, the decline of social cohesion in society, causing
   unrest and instability. Thirdly, the undermining of liberal democracy by
   the state. As will be shown, these challenges have an impact on the
   organizations working in the security domain as well, in particular the
   armed forces and the police. Paradoxically, efforts by governments to
   counter the security and stability related challenges could eventually
   lead to a declining stability of liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {This author's reply addresses critiques by Daniel Engster, Kelly Gawel,
   and Andrea Westlund about my 2020 book, Freedom to Care: Liberalism,
   Dependency Care, and Culture. I begin with a statement of my commitment
   to liberalism. In section two, I defend the value of a distinction
   between conceptions of persons in the real world and in contract theory
   to track inequalities in care when indexed to legitimate needs. I argue,
   as well, that my variety of contract theory supplies the normative
   content needed to reject the subordination of women of color.
   Acknowledging the enduring danger of expressive subordination, I
   emphasize my theory's compatibility with the full social inclusion of
   people with disabilities. Section three then defends liberal dependency
   care's compatibility with radical critique and transformative change by
   emphasizing the abstract nature of its core theoretical module. Finally,
   in section four, I reaffirm conceptual distinctions between autonomy
   skills, care skills, and a sense of justice by explicating their
   theoretical roles. In that section, I also embrace Westlund's insight
   that theorists of justice need to have skills enabling responsiveness to
   other perspectives. To this new requirement for actual theorists of
   justice, I further add that we must attain capacities to engage
   critically with our society's norms. Thus, the final section of this
   article supplements the justificatory module of liberal dependency care,
   building from the necessary conditions specified as two-level contract
   theory toward an account of necessary and sufficient conditions for this
   liberalism's justificatory module.},

Abstract = {Asha Bhandary's Freedom to Care represents an important challenge to the
   idea that care ethics and liberalism necessarily stand in tension,
   arguing instead that most of the commitments of care ethics can be
   integrated within a recognizably mainstream liberal contract theory.
   Although I am sympathetic to Bhandary's project, I identify three ways
   in which it falls short: Bhandary's thin moral premises fail to support
   decent care for all; her survival baseline principle of care does not
   support some important forms of care; and her proceduralist approach
   offers little alternative other than coercion for assuring sufficient
   care for all. I argue a thicker set of moral assumptions based on the
   importance of decent care for all are necessary for reconciling
   liberalism and care ethics on more equal terms.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},

Volume = {92},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most of those trying to assess what Keir Starmer stands for and how he
   plans to achieve his objectives are too impressed by an understanding of
   Thatcherism associated with Stuart Hall. That is one reason why they
   complain that Starmerism is little more than an empty space. But other
   less heroic ways of thinking about a leader's `ism' are available and
   using a more multidimensional approach, this article assesses the
   evolution of Starmerism through his successful campaign to be leader of
   a divided party and his first year as leader of the opposition. On that
   basis it suggests that Starmerism as currently articulated is close to a
   `Corbynism with the brakes on', although if it is to resonate with the
   public, Starmer himself needs to adopt some of the rhetorical tools
   associated with Wilsonism at its peak.},

   Liberalism, Dependency Care and Justice and engages with some key

Volume = {19},

Pages = {509-533},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article analyses the verbal display and role of emotions in the
   European Parliament (EP). Contributing both to European Studies and
   Parliamentary studies, this article shows how emotions are expressed and
   how they reflect power and status dynamics. Emotions are indeed used
   differently depending on the power position of Members of the EP (MEPs).
   This article also reveals that emotions may play a role in crisis
   situations by constraining the choices and policy solutions under
   consideration. This qualitative study compares parliamentary debates on
   two of the most relevant recent crises before 2020: the refugee crisis
   (2014-2017) and the economic crisis (2009-2014). Empirical evidence is
   drawn from the systematic in-depth content analysis of 25 EP debates.},

Abstract = {As long as ``fraternity{''} is considered a modern value, we should
   conclude that the crisis of modernity in the late 20th century would
   have some impact in how ``fraternity{''} is conceptualized and
   experienced in the present. In this article, we link the crisis of
   fraternity with the crisis of humanism and the critiques to the modern
   project made in the 1980's and the 1990's. We choose Bruno Latour's
   proposal of a relational ontology as the cornerstone of a political
   response widening fraternal practices and solidarity to the non-humans.
   This response should be the first step in the development of a brand,
   new cosmopolitics for the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic theory of the social and political
   foundations of governance quality. In the model, groups of citizens have
   different expected needs for a public service, and citizens choose
   whether to demand service when the need arises. Politicians representing
   these groups can determine policy benefits and delegate to bureaucrats
   the ability to invest in long-run service quality. The main feature of
   the theory is its foundation for citizen-government interactions, which
   draws from well-known queueing models of organizational service
   provision. The model provides a framework for characterizing the
   effectiveness and durability of government programs. A main implication
   is that politicized bureaucracies improve program survivability and
   increase the frequency of investment, while insulated bureaucracies
   increase the intensity of investment; overall service quality trades off
   between these two factors. Other results examine the implications of
   cross-group inequality, electoral conditions, and decentralization.},

Abstract = {The question this paper tries to provide an answer to is, why democratic
   transformation was successful in Tunisia and Indonesia? The theoretical
   approach is primarily rooted in descriptive-empirical actor theories,
   although cultural theories were used as well, as to better understand
   the political ideas and stances of Islamist actors. The research
   strategy is a binary comparative study with the same outcome on the
   dependent variable. Furthermore, the paper utilizes the Most Different
   Systems Design (MDSD) since both countries are quite different, but the
   dependent variable is the same - democratic transformation was
   successful. The aim of the paper is to isolate the independent variables
   which should be considered as the necessary prerequisites for the
   democratic transformation in both cases. However, the paper emphasises
   that further testing and more cases are needed.},

Abstract = {Disasters can destroy and damage private property like houses and public
   property like roads, schools, and hospitals. Do people prioritize the
   distribution of both private and public goods after being exposed to
   these negative events? How long do these priorities last after
   disasters? Using ten surveys spanning four years - half conducted before
   and half after the 2010 Chilean earthquake - and a
   difference-in-differences design, I find that exposure to this disaster
   makes people care more only about housing but not about crucial public
   goods also affected by the earthquake such as infrastructure and
   transportation. Additionally, these effects on policy priorities
   vanished after two years. These findings further our understanding of
   citizens' policy priorities after shocks that severely deteriorate
   people's living conditions, such as disasters.},

Abstract = {The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is under pressure to outline the
   ideological contours of his political agenda and make big policy
   announcements. But thus far, the Labour leader has resisted it. This
   article argues that Starmer's reluctance to reveal his agenda is
   deliberate and is part of a strategy of `ideological quietism' whose
   main purpose is to win the support of socially conservative voters.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ideological trends in Silicon Valley and how
   that influences the way Americans prepare for climatic, political, and
   economic disaster. The suite of ideas called the Dark Enlightenment
   influence the makers and designers of doomsday preparation products for
   the middle classes, which in turn folds addressing global instabilities
   into a neoliberal and anti-democratic project that emphasizes individual
   consumption over collective action. This article argues that even as
   human life confronts unprecedented challenges for survival, society
   organized through neoliberal principles precludes collective democratic
   processes for addressing an uncertain future.},

Abstract = {Theories of representation suggest that candidates should respond
   ideologically to their constituency. Two-stage elections like those in
   the U.S. force candidates to decide which parts of their constituency
   they should respond to: citizens who are active enough to participate in
   primaries or those who only participate in general elections. We posit
   that non-incumbent candidates should mostly focus on the preferences of
   primary voters while incumbents should be largely unmoved by the
   preferences of either set of voters. We test these expectations using
   data from U.S. House and Senate contests and find support for our
   theory. Our results suggest that scholars should pay closer attention to
   the two-stage nature of U.S. elections when evaluating electoral
   responsiveness.},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {127-145},

Abstract = {Historians have long recognized that one of the principal functions of
   early nineteenth-century American state governments was the distribution
   of economic privileges, including preferential grants of corporate
   privileges. North, Wallis, and Weingast label such regimes natural
   states and argue that government as privilege dispenser is a
   characteristic of most societies and, in some few instances, represents
   a transitional phase between traditional premodern societies and modern
   open-access democracies. This article documents the operation of the
   natural state in New York, focusing on how Martin Van Buren's Democratic
   coalition manipulated the distribution of bank and insurance company
   charters so as to advance the interests of their Democratic coalition.
   Consistent with the North, Wallis, and Weingast interpretation, the
   evidence shows that the transition to open access was neither smooth nor
   inevitable; Van Buren's Democratic coalition reversed the long-run trend
   toward greater access until they were unseated during the financial
   crisis years of the late 1830s.},

Abstract = {The FDR administration waged a war on crime starting in 1933. I argue
   that this war on crime had three primary effects. First, it created a
   ratchet effect whereby expanded institutions did not return to previous
   levels after the campaign ended. Second, it instilled enduring
   institutional and racial logics into law enforcement in America. By
   building a state through a war on crime, these leaders constructed a
   criminal justice system designed to make war. Moreover, they perpetuated
   the surveillance of Black leaders and eschewed calls from Black
   organizations demanding protection from widespread racial violence.
   Third, these political entrepreneurs induced an issue realignment that
   defined crime policy around a politics of consensus-a consensus that
   included every major political bloc but Black Americans, who
   unsuccesfully called on the federal government to hold local police
   accountable and address racial inequality. This coalition diffused their
   methods to states and deployed future wars on crime, and the racial
   logics cemented in the FDR era set the stage for these future wars to be
   deployed disproportionately against the Black community.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},

Abstract = {In many developing countries, national legislative seats are considered
   less valuable than (subnational) executive positions. Even then,
   ambitious politicians may seek a legislative seat either (a) as a window
   of opportunity for jumping to an executive office; or (b) as a
   consolation prize when no better option is available. Using a regression
   discontinuity design adapted to a pr setting, we examine these
   possibilities in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies between 1983 and
   2011. In line with the consolation prize story, we find that marginal
   candidates from the Peronist party-which controls most provincial
   governorships-are more likely to be renominated and serve an additional
   term in the legislature, but not necessarily to jump to an executive
   office. The effect is stronger in small provinces.},

Abstract = {After 9/11, law enforcement agencies in Southern California attempted to
   implement trust and cooperation approaches toward Muslim communities as
   part of counterterrorism policing. Based on interviews with key law
   enforcement officials and Muslim community leaders, alongside analysis
   of legal cases, reports, and media coverage, we argue that these trust
   and cooperation approaches have failed for three main reasons. First,
   law enforcement agencies failed to separate community outreach and
   intelligence gathering, and second, local and federal agencies engaged
   in extensive coordination in the name of efficiency. Both of these
   actions have led to hostility and distrust within the Muslim
   communities. Finally, dissident values from the Muslim communities found
   little space within the trust and cooperation forums, thereby requiring
   them to challenge unfair practices from outside.},

Abstract = {Since its independence in 1960, Nigeria has been ravaged by various
   categories of resource conflicts with consequential effects on rurality.
   These conflicts have caused untold hardship on rural communities in
   Nigeria to the extent that some of the communities have been deserted
   for safety elsewhere. These rural communities have valued heritage
   assets where they had leveraged on for meaningful socioeconomic
   recovery. This study was aimed at identifying these resource conflicts
   and their impacts on heritage assets in rural Nigeria. However, resource
   conflicts like Boko Haram, militancy, herdsmen, banditry, and communal
   conflicts were identified. Evidences show that these conflicts
   obliterate tangible and intangible heritage assets of rural communities
   in Nigeria, with correspondence effect on heritage transfer through
   memory loss. Effective international support among others was
   recommended as a possible option. This study has implications for the
   understanding of further effects of resource conflicts on rurality in
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Regional organisations (ROs) increasingly act as promoters of democracy
   by applying sanctions against members who do not comply with
   collectively agreed norms. Despite the absence of an official sanctions
   policy, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) does
   interfere in certain ways into member states' internal issues in some
   cases of norm violations. This study empirically explores how and why
   ASEAN decides to interfere or not in such situations. The findings
   derived from case studies on Cambodia and Myanmar, drawing on evidence
   from documents, media, and interview data reveal novel insights on ASEAN
   regionalism in the context of non-compliant member behaviour. I argue
   that the informal approach to regionalism provides ASEAN with a lot of
   room for discretion in responding to members' norm violations. The
   article identifies geopolitical preferences, extra-regional
   interference, and legitimation as explanatory factors for the RO's
   varying punitive actions.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long contemplated whether candidates are
   better off taking more ambiguous policy positions. Taking advantage of a
   lack of clarity in Senator Kamala Harris's healthcare position, I use an
   original survey experiment to apply these theories to the case of the
   2020 presidential election. I find that ambiguity offers Harris little
   to no advantage over two of her leading Democratic primary opponents
   and, among certain subjects, harms her relative to Senator Elizabeth
   Warren. I also find negative effects on Harris's favorability relative
   to President Donald Trump. These results have interesting implications
   for both the 2020 election and the broader study of candidate rhetoric
   because they illustrate potential downsides to avoiding clear issue
   statements.},

Title = {``Migrant labor{''}: accumulation by dispossession in the present-day
   Chile},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In a context of globalized migrant movements, Chile, since the beginning
   of the democratic transition and the deployment of neoliberalism in the
   1990s, has become a country of immigration, attracting people from
   bordering countries and, later, from the Caribbean, who seek to work in
   order to improve their living conditions. Forced to migrate, people face
   job insecurity, uncertainty and security-based migration policies. They
   are also exposed to discrimination from nationals who point to them as
   those who ``steal work{''}, generalizing ``migrant labor{''} as a
   ``threat{''} alien to the national working class. This article reflects
   on the migration/labor intersection from the perspective of the Critique
   of Political Economy, arguing as a hypothesis that migrant labor can be
   understood from the racist articulation of accumulation by
   dispossession. Methodologically, the results of a qualitative research
   on the discourse of Chileans regarding the construction of the migrant
   subject that emerges in representations of migration and migrants, and
   mainly, regarding their incorporation to the Chilean labor market, were
   analyzed. In this framework, the article addresses the representations
   of ``migrant labor{''} and ``theft of labor{''} to understand
   dispossession based on the racist construction of the migrant worker,
   which naturalizes the devaluation of wages and the extension of working
   hours, in order to reflect on racism as a system of domination
   intimately intertwined with the accumulation of capital.},

Abstract = {Existing research on the revolving door examines why employers hire
   former politicians. I complement this demand-side approach by
   demonstrating the importance of the supply-side. In particular, I argue
   that one important institutional factor that shapes politicians'
   willingness to leave office for a private sector job is campaign finance
   legislation. Less restrictive rules increase campaign spending for
   incumbents, which makes revolving door employment less attractive.
   Empirically, I use novel data from the US states and a
   difference-in-differences design to show that the exogenous removal of
   campaign finance legislation through Citizens United reduced the
   probability that incumbents left office to work as lobbyists. The
   supply-side approach provides insights into comparative differences in
   the prevalence of the revolving door.},

Abstract = {This article compares how the print media portrayed Margaret Thatcher
   and Theresa May in the first three weeks of their respective prime
   ministerial terms. Examining the similarities and differences between
   the media coverage of the two leaders, who ascended to the prime
   ministerial role almost 40 years apart, helps us understand how
   mainstream media coverage concentrates on the gendered differences of
   women political leaders from the masculine leadership norm. Seven major
   daily newspapers were examined, using feminist content analysis and
   feminist critical discourse analysis. The study revealed that, contrary
   to expectations, not only was there more attention to May's gender than
   to Thatcher's, but it was also more detailed and elaborate, particularly
   in the conservative press.},

Abstract = {Protestors often carry signs expressing their support or opposition to
   political issues. In recent years, people often take pictures holding
   their protests signs and post these images to social media platforms
   like Instagram. ``Black Lives Matter{''} has become a common and
   controversial refrain used on protest images online. Black protestors as
   well as white protestors have posted images holding signs that say
   ``Black Lives Matter.{''} In this study, I use experimental methods to
   explore how exposure to Instagram posts that vary the race of the
   protestor as well as the message on the protester's sign influence white
   people's emotional responses to political messages. I make use of new
   media to demonstrate the ways in which white guilt remains a powerful
   mobilizing tool in the era of social media. Using data from Amazon's
   Mechanical Turk, I conduct sentiment analysis of open-ended survey
   responses to explore the role of emotions in the process of political
   agenda setting. I find that when racial appeals elicit white guilt, they
   motivate support for identifying racism as an important issue in this
   country. However, when racial appeals elicit feelings of annoyance or
   irritation white respondents are significantly less likely to identify
   racism as an important issue.},

Abstract = {Police violence contributes to uneven experiences of citizenship.
   Identity often determines who is affected and the ability of loved ones
   to fight back. While reforms to the criminal justice system are
   important, I argue that police violence is best understood as situated
   within public contestations over the meaning and practice of
   citizenship. These are multilevel and interdependent contestations that
   occur at the interpersonal, discursive, and judicial levels and are
   embedded in power structures that aim to reproduce existing social
   inequalities. Through contestation, targeted communities, at the very
   least, create a dissensus on the practices that exclude them and, at
   best, contribute to the reconstruction of the meaning of citizenship in
   ways that include their voice. This argument is grounded in the
   literature on police violence in Latin America and in an in-depth
   qualitative analysis of the case study of the enforced disappearance of
   Luciano Arruga in Argentina in 2009.},

Abstract = {This study aims to propose a new macropartisanship indicator under a
   multiparty system. Previous macropartisanship studies have focused
   mainly on the US two-party system. To identify macropartisanship under a
   multiparty system, I propose an index that considers the effective
   number of parties in the electoral space and the proportion of
   non-partisan voters, using five countries as cases: the US, the UK,
   Japan, Germany, and Denmark. Further, a brief examination using
   fractional integration shows that the newly defined macropartisanship in
   two-party systems is more stable than in multiparty systems, where
   macropartisanship has more frequent updates.},

   Italian ventures through its own popular channels. Finally, we
   synthesize our findings, drawing conclusions regarding Russia's and

Abstract = {Jeremy Bentham is usually seen as an anti-realist political thinker, or
   a proponent of what Bernard Williams has termed `political moralism'.
   This article questions that prevalent view and suggests instead that
   there are good grounds for considering Bentham a political realist.
   Bentham's political thought has considerable commonalities with that of
   the sociologist and political realist Max Weber: both agree that
   politics is a unique domain of human activity defined by its association
   with power; that consequently, ethical conduct is unavoidably inflected
   by power in politics; that a commitment to truth in politics can only
   ever be contingent; and that politics has a set of basic conditions that
   it would be not only misguided but dangerous to attempt to transcend.
   Whilst it is often held that Bentham advanced a reductive framework for
   understanding politics, in fact, his utilitarianism was a far more
   realistic approach to political ends and means than has generally been
   acknowledged, and one that contemporary political theory realists would
   benefit from taking seriously.},

   find that while they may be reasonable worries to have about any concept

Abstract = {If political circumstances are an important cause of unemployment in the
   Middle East, does this tend to attenuate the influence of economic
   infrastructure? I approach this question by building a geospatial
   dataset of the West Bank, an area with high unemployment arguably linked
   to political problems. I find Israeli army road obstacles, deployed
   during the Second Intifada, obstructed peri-urban Palestinian commuters
   from accessing commercial centers and border crossings, inflicting
   employment losses that were substantially offset by employment gains
   among their more centrally located Palestinian competitors. The findings
   suggest that marginal economic interventions, such as removing obstacles
   or paving roads, have a good chance of altering the spatial distribution
   of unemployment, but may struggle to reduce overall unemployment levels
   absent political reform.},

Title = {Legislated candidate quotas and women's descriptive representation in
   preferential voting systems},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {154-174},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a worldwide diffusion of electoral gender
   quotas, an institution designed to enhance women's political
   representation. This has sparked scholars' interest in the actual
   effects of quotas, including their impact on female descriptive
   (numeric) representation in national legislatures. As with many other
   issues within the domain of comparative politics, however, establishing
   causality with respect to the effect of quota laws is intrinsically
   difficult. In this article, we attempt to overcome these difficulties.
   We apply the generalised synthetic control method to study the impact of
   legislated candidate quotas on the descriptive parliamentary
   representation of women in three European countries: Belgium, Greece and
   Poland. As these states elect their national parliaments by means of
   variants of a proportional representation system with preferential
   voting for candidates, we compare their levels of female descriptive
   representation to a set of corresponding figures observed for a
   `synthetic control' unit, comprising 16 European countries that
   implement fundamentally similar electoral systems but do not have
   legislated candidate quotas in place. The quota effects that we obtain
   vary substantially among the three cases analysed. The apparent effect
   for Belgium is strong, while much weaker effects are observed for the
   two other states. Relying on the extant literature, we qualitatively
   interpret these results, putting forward a number of conjectures as to
   how contextual factors can contribute to the strength and persistence of
   quota effects. We conclude that the impact of legislated candidate
   quotas is essentially limited, albeit it may be magnified under
   favourable contextual conditions, such as those which occurred in
   Belgium.},

Abstract = {Two decades ago, Peter Nannestad and Martin Paldam (2009) published a
   paper in which, having analyzed 282 elections held between 1948 and 1997
   in 19 developed democracies, they claimed that all incumbent parties on
   average incur a ``cost of ruling{''} of approximately 2.25\% points per
   term. They called this cost a ``robust fact,{''} ``an unusually stable
   constant{''} that operates across countries, institutions, and time. I
   evaluate how well N\&P's empirical assertions hold up in a much larger
   set of elections held in a set of well-established democracies similar
   to the one they studied, as well as in other, more recent electoral
   democracies outside the OECD region.},

Title = {Towards a territorial political capacity approach for studying European
   regions},

Abstract = {This article proposes a framework for studying the territorial political
   capacity of regions in Europe. The proposed framework identifies three
   main dimensions of territorial political capacity. Mainly material
   indicators include institutions and institutional resources. Mixed
   material and constructed indicators centre on causal mechanisms of party
   and leadership capacity. Mainly constructed indicators are drawn from
   territorial praxis. Understanding a region requires combining different
   levels of analysis and distinctive ways of knowing; broad-based
   (quasi-statistical) variables facilitate comparison, while the focus on
   resilience and capacity requires primary data collection, drilling down
   into the practices of comparable panels of actors. This article
   discusses this framework in relation to four European regions that were
   the object of empirical investigation in 2012-2014: namely Brittany
   (France), Andalusia (Spain), Wallonia (Belgium) and Wales (United
   Kingdom). It contributes to the conceptualization of comparative
   territorial capacity, in a manner distinct from, but largely consistent
   with the Regional Authority Index.},

Abstract = {I am grateful for the honor to write this comment because it gave me the
   opportunity to read this truly exquisite compilation of works collected
   under the editorship of Osterberg-Kaufmann, Stark and Mohamad-Klotzbach.
   The focus of the special section is on new frontiers in the empirical
   investigation of citizens' subjective understandings of democracy. It is
   a methodologically and phenomenologically diverse, and yet thematically
   cohesive, assemblage of studies that comes at due time and in which the
   various pieces indeed speak to each other. The compendium covers a
   significant portion of the innovations going on in the field of
   measuring lay perceptions of democracy across cultures. To me, the key
   point is how lay perceptions of democracy map on scholarly norms and
   where and why mismatches between lay perceptions and scholarly norms
   exist and what the implications of such mismatches are in terms of
   global regime-culture coevolution. My comments to the individual
   articles in the special issue are framed within this broader question. I
   am phrasing my reflections in a more brainstorming manner, rather than
   systematically going through each contribution in a point-by-point
   style. For this reason, my discussion will not address each contribution
   equally but rather in terms of what I feel should loom large on our
   research agenda. In a nutshell, I am advocating a decidedly cultural
   theory of autocracy-vs-democracy-cultural in the sense that we need to
   triangulate people's support for and their notions of democracy in the
   context of encultured values.},

Abstract = {A number of studies demonstrate that quantitative teaching provides
   social science students with analytical and critical skills.
   Accordingly, the skills acquired during quantitative teaching are
   assumed to enhance students' progress in and after their degree.
   However, previous studies rely on subjective measures of students'
   evaluations of their skills. So far, no prior studies have examined
   whether the skills obtained through quantitative teaching can be
   transferred to an overall better performance at university. In order to
   address this gap, we use high-quality administrative records to examine
   the impact of quantitative teaching on undergraduate students' overall
   marks. The results show that students subject to additional quantitative
   teaching obtain significantly better marks throughout their studies. The
   evidence emphasizes the importance of methodological pluralism for
   social science students.},

Abstract = {Recently several populist parties have become part of coalition
   governments in multiparty democracies, specifically in Western Europe.
   Based on the inclusion-moderation thesis, academics assume that
   incumbent populist parties tone down their populist rhetoric as a result
   of the daily businesses of deliberation and compromises in coalitions.
   However, while the assumption of tamed populists in power is widespread,
   there is little empirical work dealing with the topic. Using a classical
   quantitative content analysis of 1,210 Facebook posts published by
   populist parties in Italy, Spain, Austria and New Zealand, this article
   examines whether opposition parties are more populist and nativist than
   those in coalition governments. The findings indicate that populists do
   not decrease the degree of anti-elite and people-centred messages when
   they are in power but rather change the type of elites they attack and
   the antagonist groups they juxtapose. We should therefore rethink the
   validity of the inclusion-moderation thesis for populist parties in
   coalition governments.},

Abstract = {How does violence during civil war shape citizens' demand for
   state-provided security, especially in settings where non-state actors
   compete with the state for citizens' loyalties? This article draws on
   Hobbesian theory to argue that in post-conflict countries, citizens who
   were more severely victimized by wartime violence should substitute away
   from localized authorities and towards centralized ones, especially the
   state. The author tests the theory by combining two original surveys
   with existing media and non-governmental organization data on wartime
   violence in Liberia. The study shows that citizens who were more
   severely affected by violence during the Liberian civil war are more
   likely to demand state-provided security, both in absolute terms and
   relative to non-state alternatives. More sporadic collective violence in
   the post-conflict period does not reverse this substitution effect. Also
   consistent with Hobbesian theory, citizens who were more severely
   victimized are more fearful of threats to peace almost a decade later.},

Abstract = {Communities in developing countries often must cooperate to self-provide
   or co-produce local public goods. Many expect that community social
   networks facilitate this cooperation, but few studies directly observe
   real-life networks in these settings. We collect detailed social network
   data in rural Northern Ghana to explore how social positions and
   proximity to community leaders predict donations to a local public good.
   We then implement a field experiment manipulating participants'
   opportunity to communicate and apply social pressure before donating. We
   find clear evidence that locations in community social networks predict
   cooperative behavior, but no evidence that communication improves
   coordination or cooperation, in contrast to common theoretical
   expectations and laboratory findings. Our results show that evolved,
   real-life social networks serve as a mapping of community members'
   already-engrained behaviors, not only as an active technology through
   which social influence propagates to solve collective action problems.},

Abstract = {Scholars of contentious politics understand the critical role of
   opposition protests and the elite in influencing regime outcomes. What
   is less understood, however, is how opposition protest can impact the
   ``hearts and minds{''} of elites in authoritarian settings. Using the
   timing of the Survey of Russian Elites and a 2016 protest in Moscow to
   commemorate the death of a Russian opposition figure, we show that
   elites initially responded with sympathy to the peaceful and
   well-attended protest, but those feelings faded in the weeks following
   the event. We attribute the ephemeral nature of the protest's impact to
   a successful strategy by the Kremlin to acknowledge the event and then
   promptly ignore it in the following weeks. We posit this allowed the
   event to leave the consciousness of most elites and their feelings
   returned to pre-protest levels. Our findings suggest that certain
   opposition protests can garner sympathy among the elite in authoritarian
   settings, but also highlight the passive tools of authoritarian regimes
   in minimizing the impact of protest movements. Opposition movements,
   thus, not only have to cue sympathetic feelings among the elite, but
   also have to sustain that persuasion in subsequent news cycles.},

Abstract = {The EU's institutional, civic and social as well as economic norms enjoy
   comparably high levels of support in Tunisia. However, there are
   differences with regards to how individual of these three sets of norms
   resonate with different parts of Tunisian society and elites. This
   article examines their acceptance, modification and contestation by
   Islamists, secular conservatives and secular progressives within
   Tunisia. It finds that almost all EU norms are supported by some parts
   of Tunisian society and elites, but are also all, to some extent,
   contested by others. This is strongly shaped by previous domestic
   experiences and by ideas that evolved within Tunisia. The article thus
   argues that the extent to which external norms are adopted in law and
   practice primarily depends on local agency. Moreover, the extent to
   which EU norms are accepted as well as the openness to competing norms
   are linked to output legitimacy. Perceived inabilities of Tunisia's
   post-2011 system to deliver socio-economic gains, improvements to the
   security situation or legislation that reflects peoples' preferred
   values tend to go hand in hand with contestation of the model promoted
   by the EU.},

Abstract = {Anti-immigrant political rhetoric is proliferating in Europe, inspiring
   research to examine the potential effects on public opinion. However,
   studies of the reactions of first- and second-generation immigrants-the
   objects of this rhetoric-remain scarce. This article argues that
   political rhetoric should be treated as a context of integration
   affecting political outcomes, in particular political belonging. To that
   end, the article combines qualitative evidence from focus group
   discussions conducted in Denmark, a high-salience context, and
   quantitative evidence from cross-national survey and party manifesto
   data from 18 Western European countries over a 12-year period. In
   addition to demonstrating a negative mean effect, the analyses show that
   those most in focus of contemporary political messages (Muslims and
   immigrants with shorter educations) are most affected, suggesting a
   sophisticated processing of political rhetoric. In contrast, traditional
   explanations concerning structural incorporation, generational
   integration, and exposure to rhetoric are not supported. The article
   discusses the implications of the results for democratic inclusion in
   contemporary Europe.},

Abstract = {Viewed through the lens of social policy, Russia's 2020 constitutional
   reform codifies existing priorities without addressing the issues that
   have fragmented the meaning of social citizenship. Placing these changes
   in theoretical and historical context, we identify the core causes of
   inequity in the social welfare system, the sustained gap between state
   promises, and Russians' lived experience. Our case studies highlight the
   sources of shared social grievances and the obstacles to national
   collective action that maintain stability in the facing of increased
   localized protest actions. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of
   observing the opposing forces of continuity and change in Russian
   politics as they define and redefine the meaning of social citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article explains why some Americans support affirmative action and
   preferential hiring and promotion while others do not. Unlike most
   studies that examine White opinions exclusively, we explore the
   determinants of opinions by Whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and
   Asian Americans. We find that a majority of Americans draw a distinction
   between affirmative action and preferential hiring and promotion, with
   African Americans diverging noticeably from Whites when it comes to
   supporting the former policy relative to the latter. Using the 2004 and
   2008 waves of the National Politics Study, we test hypotheses regarding
   perceived racial discrimination and racial resentment. Evidence from
   logit regression analyses reveal that racial resentment is useful for
   explaining White opposition to affirmative action and preferential
   hiring and promotion. Perceived racial discrimination has little to no
   effect on Whites, but encourages African Americans, Hispanics, and
   Asians to support affirmative action and preferential hiring and
   promotion. Racial resentment fosters opposition to both among racial
   minorities.},

Abstract = {Political theories of modus vivendi start from an assumption of deep and
   permanent disagreement about conceptions of the good and conceptions of
   justice. In response to this disagreement, modus vivendi provides an
   account of legitimacy as a result of a minimally restricted bargaining
   process. This account of legitimacy faces three major criticisms.
   Firstly, that the political arrangement will be unstable, secondly that
   a modus vivendi will institutionalise injustice, and thirdly, that it
   will institutionalise the status quo. I concede the objection that a
   modus vivendi is unstable in order to address the more serious
   objections that it institutionalises injustice or the status quo.
   Through its acceptance of instability, modus vivendi theory is no more
   likely than liberal theory to institutionalise injustice. Far from the
   conservatism it is often associated with, modus vivendi permits radical
   political doctrines and radical political action in a way that is
   precluded by mainstream liberal theory.},

Abstract = {The mass media is conventionally assumed to play an important role in
   welfare state politics. So far, however, we have very little systematic
   theorizing or empirical evidence of when and how the mass media reports
   on welfare state reforms. Building on news value theory and the welfare
   state reform literature, we develop a set of hypotheses about mass media
   reporting on welfare state reforms. We argue that mass media attention
   is conditioned not only by the direction of reforms, with cuts getting
   more attention than expansions, but also by the election platform that
   the incumbent party ran on in the last election as well as by the policy
   reputation of the government. Drawing on a new dataset including about
   4,800 news articles in British, Danish and German quality newspapers
   from 1995 to 2014, we find supporting empirical evidence of our
   expectations.},

Abstract = {Taiwanese identity is distinct from and juxtaposed against the Chinese
   identity. What explains the emergence of a Taiwanese identity -
   specifically in the south? This identity formation is surprising
   considering the multiple decades of authoritarian rule where the
   government championed a Chinese identity. In this article, weargue that
   the Taiwanese identity manifested from a linguistic tension
   betweenHokloand Mandarinspeakers.And while the Kuomintang adopted a
   strict Mandarin monolingual policy, thehomogeneity of theHoklo speakers
   in the south - i.e., they constituted a minimal winningsizeand they were
   regionally concentrated -ensured the survival of theHoklovernacular.
   This vernacular would become the instrument for the formation of a
   Taiwanese identity. In contrast,we see initial push back from the Hakka
   speakers who were excluded from the narrative of Taiwanese identity.
   Likewise,in the north where there weregreater linguistic heterogeneity
   and increasing interethnic marriages, Taiwanese identity was not as
   coherent.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explore heterogeneity in the relationship between
   dissatisfaction with democratic representation and voting for a populist
   party. More specifically, we argue that numerous citizens are
   dissatisfied with modern political elites and processes, but that not
   all are attracted by populist parties' programmatic appeal. In
   particular, while citizens with stealth democratic attitudes are also
   dissatisfied with democratic representation - similar to citizens with
   populist ideas - voters with high levels of stealth democracy hold
   preferences for alternative forms of representation other than those
   proposed by populist parties. Hence, although stealth democrats are
   similar to populists on the attitudinal level, they will not be appealed
   to vote for a populist party. Analyses using the data of the Finnish
   Election Studies provide support for our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {What are the attitudinal consequences of the growing pervasiveness of
   populism and nativism? We conceive of both populism and nativism as
   binary moral frameworks predicated on an antagonistic relationship
   between `us' and `them'. Our study investigates the presence of
   spillover effects between these two forms of ingroup/outgroup thinking
   among survey respondents in the Netherlands. We posit that exposure to
   populist (nativist) messages fuels nativism (populism), but only among
   those positively predisposed toward these messages in the first place. A
   first survey experiment, focusing on antipathies toward refugees and
   Muslim immigrants, confirms the former expectation, but a second
   experiment calls into question the latter hypothesis. Moreover, the
   second experiment does not replicate the effects of populist message
   exposure on general immigration attitudes. We discuss several possible
   reasons for these mixed results.},

Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a strengthening of local autonomy in many
   European states. At the same time, local governance capacities were
   strengthened through intermunicipal structures and territorial
   consolidation to prepare local authorities for additional tasks. In this
   paper, we assess what citizens think about strengthening local autonomy
   and strengthening inter-local cooperation. We argue that citizens'
   attitudes towards local autonomy and inter-local cooperation are a
   function of their behavioural, emotional and ideological connection to
   the local. Using data from a population-based survey in eight West
   European metropolitan areas in France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK,
   we show that local autonomy and inter-local cooperation supporters have
   divergent ideological positions concerning the allocation of political
   authority across state scales. Inter-local cooperation is supported by
   voters of new progressive left parties but opposed by right-wing
   nationalist partisans-who in contrast favour local autonomy. This
   suggests that the demarcation-integration divide which structures
   citizens' attitudes towards international integration also matters for
   subnational and local governance reforms.},

Title = {Women's Descriptive Representation and Gendered Import Tax
   Discrimination},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Number = {1},
Pages = {307-315},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We identify a form of gender-based governmental discrimination that
   directly affects billions of women on a daily basis: the setting of
   import tariffs for gendered goods. These tax rates, which can differ
   across otherwise identical gender-specific products, often impose direct
   penalties on women as consumers. Comparing nearly 200,000 paired tariff
   rates on men's and women's apparel products in 167 countries between
   1995 and 2015, we find that women suffer a tax penalty that varies
   systematically across countries. We demonstrate that in democracies,
   women's presence in the legislature is associated with decreased import
   tax penalties on women's goods. This finding is buttressed by a
   comparison of democracies and non-democracies and analyses of the
   implementation of legislative gender quotas. Our work highlights a
   previously unacknowledged government policy that penalizes women and
   also provides powerful evidence that descriptive representation can have
   a substantial, direct impact on discriminatory policies.},

Title = {Emotions and voting behavior in self-determination referendums: the case
   of New Caledonia in 2018},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article we examine the impact of emotions in an independence
   referendum. New Caledonia - a French Pacific territory with 270,000
   inhabitants - held a self-determination referendum in November 2018, in
   which 56\% of the voters opted to remain a part of France. We conducted
   a post-referendum survey with 1496 respondents that included a specific
   battery to measure emotions as well as control variables. We find that
   experiencing anger with the national status of the territory increases
   the probability of voting for independence, while experiencing pride
   reduces it. These results remain after controlling for partisan, ethnic
   and national identification, expected effects of independence as well as
   sociodemographic factors. Moreover, emotions and identity interact and
   increase the effect of (the lack of) national identification. Beyond the
   effects of the traditional control variables, the results suggest that
   knowledge about voting behavior in independence referendums is
   transferable to decolonization in Pacific Islands.},

Abstract = {What was the impact of the 2014-2016 refugee crisis on immigration
   attitudes and national identification in Europe? Several studies show
   that radical right parties benefitted electorally from the refugee
   crisis, but research also shows that anti-immigration attitudes did not
   increase. We hypothesize that the refugee crisis affected right-wing
   citizens differently than left-wing citizens. We test this hypothesis by
   combining individual level survey data (from five Eurobarometer waves in
   the 2014-2016 period) with country level statistics on the asylum
   applications in 28 EU member states. In Western Europe, we find that
   increases in the number of asylum applications lead to a polarization of
   attitudes towards immigrants between left- and right-leaning citizens.
   In the Southern European `arrival countries' and in Central-Eastern
   Europe we find no significant effects. Nationalistic attitudes are also
   not affected significantly.},

Title = {More `Europe', less Democracy? European integration does not erode
   satisfaction with democracy},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The process of European integration, through institutions such as the
   European Union, the Eurozone, or Schengen, implies a shift in political
   decision-making away from the national governments and towards
   inter-national institutions. This gradual shift in the balance of power,
   furthermore, is increasingly debated by citizens. As a result, European
   integration might lead to an erosion of satisfaction with democracy in
   European countries. By means of a longitudinal analysis of the
   determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European countries, we
   test this expectation. We find no indication that the shift in the
   balance of power, and the trend towards more European integration indeed
   have eroded satisfaction with the functioning of (national) democracy.},

Abstract = {The boom in wealth inequality seen in recent decades has generated a
   steep rise in scholarly interest in both the drivers and the
   consequences of the wealth gap. In political science, a pertinent
   question regards the political behavior across the wealth spectrum. A
   common argument is that the wealthy practice patrimonial voting, i.e.
   voting for right-wing parties to maximize returns on their assets. While
   this pattern is descriptively well documented, it is less certain to
   what extent this reflects an actual causal relationship between wealth
   and political preferences. In this study, we provide new evidence by
   exploiting wealth variation within identical twin pairs. Our findings
   suggest that while more wealth is descriptively connected to more
   support for right-wing parties, the causal impact of wealth on policy
   preferences is likely highly overstated. For several relevant policy
   areas these effects may not exist at all. Furthermore, the bias in naive
   observational estimates seems to be mainly driven by environmental
   familial confounders shared within twin pairs, rather than genetic
   confounding.},

Abstract = {Heidegger pointed out that a minimally meaningful life requires
   sensitivity to the power of shared moods, which give `mattering' to our
   lives and meaning to events. As philosophers remind us, the German word
   Stimmung means `mood' in terms of atmosphere or ambiance. Often likened
   to music or to weather, Stimmung is something to which we unconsciously
   attune ourselves. That cities have their own distinct and discrete
   smells, weather, feeling, music, and mood is something immediately
   discernible to anyone who travels around the cities of Europe, where
   despite their close proximity, the cultures/spirits/aurae/airs/colors
   are immediately discernible from each other. Looking at the `spirit of
   cities' through the lens of my own personal life history, I explore the
   way Tokyo exerted power over my imagination. How did I become a
   different person in Japanese than I am in English? In what ways did the
   city impact my character and sense of self? Would I be a different
   person thinking and dreaming in second-language Chinese? French? Is
   there any fundamental `I' that is not in some way influenced by culture
   and language? I aim to ponder these questions by way of a cultural
   `conversation,' echoing meetings along the Silk Road between West and
   East, between my young American self and my fully-immersed,
   Japanese-speaking self, and with the residents, places, seasons, and
   past observers of the Eastern Capital and other great cities.},

Title = {The long shadow of lobbying: ideational power of lobbying as illustrated

Abstract = {The weak correlation between lobbying and policy outcomes is puzzling.
   The main argument developed here is that the puzzle is partly caused by
   a lack of attention to the long-term effects of lobbying on the ideas
   espoused by policymakers. An analysis of ideational power goes beyond
   the usual empirical focus on the immediate effects of lobbying. Thus, it
   provides a more complete understanding of how lobbying pays off. To
   illustrate this, the paper analyzes the battle over profits in the
   Swedish welfare sector. Despite a strong public opinion in favor of a
   cap on profits, the industry got its way. To justify this, policymakers
   relied on the argument that a cap on profits would drive out private
   welfare providers and, thereby, undermine choice for service users. In
   other words, the idea that private entrepreneurship, choice, and
   individual liberty are inextricably linked is a key factor in explaining
   the outcome. This idea had taken root among policymakers in Sweden
   following a massive and costly lobbying campaign, organized by the
   business community, several decades earlier. The main takeaway is a
   focus on the here and now risks underestimating the efficacy of efforts
   to influence policy.},

Abstract = {Does a government in a bicameral system strategically alter the length
   of the legislative process in the first chamber in anticipation of
   future majorities in the second chamber? Drawing on an existing formal
   model of dynamic policymaking, we argue that governing majorities
   strategically accelerate or delay their agenda when a potential majority
   change in the second chamber is imminent. If the government fears losing
   control over the second chamber, then the government accelerates their
   agenda. By contrast, if the government hopes to gain control over the
   second chamber, the government decelerates their agenda. We test our
   argument in Germany's symmetric and asymmetric bicameralism by analyzing
   1,966 governmental bills from 1998 to 2013. The analyses confirm our
   expectations for symmetric bicameralism, thus suggesting that the
   synchronicity of election cycles should be taken into account both in
   the analysis of bicameral systems and in institutional design of such
   systems.},

Abstract = {This article seeks an insight into the nature of intraparty competition
   in an open-list single preference voting system, and it does so by
   analysing the distribution of votes for Centre Party candidates in the
   40 or so municipalities making up the northern Finnish constituency of
   Oulu in each of the five general elections between 2003 and 2019. It
   builds on Grofman's distinction between a geographical constituency and
   a candidate's electoral constituency to map the ecology of candidate
   support in a constituency with (1) a larger than average district
   magnitude (M); (2) a significantly larger than average territorial
   magnitude (T); and (3) a substantially larger than average Centre party
   magnitude (P). Setting M, T and P within a party organisational
   framework, the article identifies (1) a significant disparity between
   levels of intraparty competition at district and sub-district levels;
   (2) several contextual factors that act more as disincentives than
   incentives to engage in personal vote seeking across the electoral
   district.},

Abstract = {Since 2011, considerable upheavals in domestic politics, shifting
   regional power balances and international shocks have been greatly
   affecting Islamist movements and parties coming to the forefront of the
   political arena in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. This Special Issue
   combines a more theoretical reflection upon the underappreciated
   interaction of domestic, regional and international factors with an
   empirical focus on the development of Islamists. It also enriches the
   case history of comparative politics analyses through the investigation
   of new relevant rational actors in countries whose political
   trajectories differ considerably. By opting for an inside-out
   perspective and actor-centered approach, we aim to overcome the
   `compartmentalization' of the three levels of analysis and the
   `obsession' with moderation for Islamists. Borrowing a set of mechanisms
   first identified by social movement and policy diffusion literature,
   this introduction lays out the analytical framework informing all the
   contributions which is based on adaptation, learning, competition, and
   collaboration dynamics.},

Abstract = {Nomination of candidates of non-Western origin on party lists is a major
   step toward immigrant-origin minorities' political representation,
   however its determinants are understudied. This paper focuses on such
   nominations by parties on the Left, Social Democratic and Green. We
   extend theory on the electoral risks of nominating immigrant-origin
   minority candidates to study systematically how cultural citizenship
   conditions the effects of political and economic factors on number of
   nominations. Belgium provides excellent testing grounds due to regional
   variation in cultural citizenship between Flanders and Wallonia, while
   electoral and citizenship acquisition laws remain constant. We collected
   an original dataset on 589 municipalities in the 2006 local elections,
   and conduct our analysis using Poisson regression models for count data
   that incorporate alternative explanations. Findings suggest that Social
   Democratic parties face greater political and economic constraints than
   Green parties and these constraints are conditioned by cultural
   citizenship; in Flanders where cultural citizenship is characterized by
   a strong ethnic component constraints are greater for Social Democratic
   than Green parties, but in civic Wallonia both parties do not appear
   constrained by these factors. Finally, we control for the conditioning
   effect of cultural citizenship for parties of the right, Christian
   Democratic and Liberal; we find no such effect.},

Abstract = {To his supporters, one very attractive feature of Donald Trump's
   candidacy was his prior experience as a business executive. Trump
   promised that he would run America like a business and would select the
   very best people. In this article, we evaluate President Trump's
   approach to managing the executive branch by scrutinizing his approach
   to personnel. We reference two sources of important new data. We first
   examine data on nominations to all Senate-confirmed positions during the
   last three presidencies. We also use data from the 2007, 2014, and 2020
   (preliminary) Surveys on the Future of Government Service, surveys of
   thousands of appointed and career federal executives, to determine
   whether the president selected the very best people. We conclude by
   using the survey data to evaluate whether the president's approach led
   to effective management. A close look at the new data reveals that the
   president has been slow to nominate officials to key positions. Federal
   executives rate the persons the president has appointed as less
   competent than appointees from the Bush administration or civil servants
   from the current one. The survey data also reveal that the president's
   approach has done nothing to arrest the decline in the capacity of the
   public service. We conclude by discussing the implications of the Trump
   presidency for our traditional understanding of the president as chief
   executive. Specifically, we discuss whether we should reevaluate common
   beliefs about presidents caring inherently about the management of the
   executive.},

Abstract = {Latin American welfare systems are truncated and marked by regressive
   spending patterns. Contributing an electoral microfoundation for the
   endurance of narrow social policies in the region, we argue that
   clientelism hollows out support for welfare progressivity. On the one
   hand, clientelism distorts the link between the vested interest of
   low-income earners and redistributive policies so that the poor are more
   likely to support parties with a residualistic social policy agenda; by
   paying off the poor in return for their vote, clientelistic parties gain
   greater leverage to pursue liberal social policies. On the other,
   clientelism induces uncertainty in the provision of public goods among
   middle and high-income earners, which makes them more likely to opt for
   residualistic social policies as well. We investigate how clientelism
   influences electoral support for parties with residualistic social
   policy platforms by merging information on party strategies from an
   expert survey with public opinion data for Latin America. Findings
   confirm that clientelistic practices have an impact on the electoral
   support for political parties which promote a liberal welfare state.},

Abstract = {This article examines the campaign of the Brexit Party via the
   conceptual frameworks of cultural performance and the politics of
   victimhood. The Brexit Party depicts the post-industrial working class
   communities as forgotten and betrayed and attacks the Labour Party for
   its stance on Brexit. While current research on national populism
   focuses on demographic and cultural changes and highlights a prevailing
   distrust of the political establishment there is little as to how
   victimhood is performed by the agents of national populism. By deploying
   Jeffrey Alexander's conceptualisation of cultural performance, the
   article identifies the current status of victimhood and its political
   communication in the Brexit debate. As a result, the post-industrial
   working class becomes the victim of failed policies and the authentic
   voice of a country unable to assert its dominance in the world. The
   social actors in the Brexit Party's campaign are being motivated by and
   towards concerns, the meanings of which are defined by signifiers of
   inequality and nostalgia. The article makes two arguments: the cultural
   performance of victimhood is a precondition for articulations of
   nationalism and belonging; the cultural performance of victimhood is
   integral for the communication of loss, democratic deficit and for
   presenting the working class as a racialised minority.},

Abstract = {Within this article, we aim at exploring the topic of clientelism in
   Cameroon as a species of a wider phenomenon affecting Central and
   Western Francophone Africa. Our argument is that, in spite of the
   repeated efforts of reinforcing the local power structures, we have
   witnessed a process of centralisation of clientelism: the new networks
   are shaped around the `Creatures', who are the President Paul Biya's
   formal or informal appointees and play the role of nodal elements
   relying the rest of the chain to the central command. This happened on
   the expenses of the locally dispersed and more autonomous clientelistic
   groups that were either included in or smashed by the pyramidal
   Creatures' structured. In order to test our assumption, we analysed a
   specific body of literature on the theorization of clientelism and on
   its African and Cameroonian specificity and organized four focus groups
   with the actual and former members of the clientelistic chains at
   different levels (central, regional and local). If our main
   presupposition proved to be generally correct, one of the sub-arguments
   was only partially validated through this empirical component of our
   research.},

Abstract = {Does intensifying immigrationenforcement lead to under-reporting of
   crime among undocumented immigrants and their communities? We
   empirically test the claims of activists and legal advocates that the
   escalation of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities in
   2017 negatively impacted the willingness of undocumented immigrants and
   Hispanic communities to report crime. We hypothesize that ICE
   cooperation with local law enforcement, in particular, discourages
   undocumented immigrants and their Hispanic community members from
   reporting crime. Using a difference-in-difference approach and FBI
   Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data at the county level, we find that
   total reported crime fell from 2016 to 2017 in counties with higher
   shares of Hispanic individuals and in counties where local law
   enforcement had more cooperation with ICE. Using the National Crime
   Victimization Survey (NCVS), we show that these declines in the measured
   crime rate are driven by decreased crime reporting by Hispanic
   communities rather than by decreased crime commission or victimization.
   Finally, we replicate these results in a second case study by leveraging
   the staggered roll-out of the 2008-2014 Secure Communities program
   across US counties. Taken together, our findings add to a growing body
   of literature demonstrating how immigration enforcement reduces
   vulnerable populations' access to state services, including the criminal
   justice system.},

Abstract = {The public and policymakers have increasingly recognized the role that
   industry plays in contributing to societal issues, such as climate
   change and childhood obesity. In fact, many people now support punitive
   action against major corporations. The question then becomes: What
   beliefs factor into a person's willingness to take political action
   against industry actors? I argue that one important predictor may be
   beliefs about whether the action will be effective at punishing the
   wrongdoer-a new concept I introduce called retributive efficacy. The
   goal of this investigation was to assess the psychometric properties of
   a novel measure of retributive efficacy. Across three studies and two
   social issues (climate change, childhood obesity), I demonstrate the
   reliability and validity of a retributive efficacy survey instrument.
   Specifically, I show that retributive efficacy is associated with (but
   is distinct from) other types of efficacy. I also provide evidence that
   retributive efficacy predicts intentions to participate in social issue
   activism and support for social policies, even when adjusting for the
   influence of demographics, covariates, and other forms of efficacy.},

Abstract = {The concept of parrhesia (free, true and courageous speech) is central
   to Michel Foucault's last lecture courses. In this ``late{''} period of
   his scientific career, the French philosopher started a thorough
   analysis of the ancient and early Christian sources with the aim to
   construct a detailed genealogy of the two phenomena that played a
   crucial role in the Western history - the genealogy of subjectivity and
   the genealogy of the ``critical tradition{''} in philosophy. In order to
   analyze the latter, during the lecture course ``The Government of Self
   and Others{''} (1982-1983), Foucault turned to the texts of Plato, which
   he considered foundational for the philosophical practices of
   veridiction in the West. The Platonic paradigm presents philosophy with
   a number of fundamental tasks, the main of which is the task of
   constantly testing the reality and seriousness - testing the words
   (logos) through the deeds and practices (ergon). Foucault postulates
   that in the modern philosophy this test invariably results in a certain
   attitude towards politics and power, which assumes rejection of the
   direct participation in political affairs, constant criticism of our
   mistakes and misconceptions, the search for and revelation of ways, in
   which we, as subjects, are able to change ourselves. In this article,
   the authors attempt to shed light on the genealogical significance of
   Foucault's concept of parrhesia and its relationship to the modern
   philosophy; present the classification of parrhesia (on the basis of
   Foucault's lectures) that allows to identify political and philosophical
   dimensions of this phenomenon and their different modalities, as well as
   review in a holistic way the Platonic philosophical parrhesia and
   consider the problem of its complex relationship with politics, which
   becomes especially acute when the ``reality of philosophy{''} is being
   tested.},

   frontlash-backlash dialectic is inherent to the democratic process,
   however the prominence that in this new millennium have gained, on one
   side and the other of the frontlash-backlash scheme, the conflicts
   around the collective identity, the binary discursive forms of populism,
   and the challenge to the values and institutions on which it is based
   modern democracy, suggest that we are witnessing, in this second phase
   of modernity, a shift in the way in which this type of dynamic has been
   taking place.},

Abstract = {This article examines what constitutional arrangements are more likely
   to facilitate the transfer of effective decision-making power to the
   regional level. We show that certain constitutional arrangements can
   result in institutional commitment problems between regional minority
   and national majority groups, which in turn influence levels of regional
   autonomy across regions. Specifically, we examine how the depth and
   scope of decentralization depend on the presence of federal agreements
   and the availability of institutional guarantees that make the federal
   contracts credible. Analyzing regional-level data, we show that regions
   where identity minority groups are majoritarian enjoy more regional
   autonomy when the commitment problem has resulted in a satisfactory
   national accommodation. Our findings highlight two important scenarios.
   The first occurs when the institutional commitment problem is solved,
   and regional minority groups are granted substantial levels of regional
   autonomy. The second scenario takes place when the commitment problem is
   not institutionally accommodated, and hence regional minority groups
   have systematically lower levels of autonomy. This article illustrates
   that both federal contracts and credible agreements are important tools
   to understand regional decision-making powers.},

Title = {Do anti-poverty policies sway voters? Evidence from a meta-analysis of
   Conditional Cash Transfers},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since the 1990s, many governments in middle and low-income countries
   have used conditional cash transfers to alleviate poverty. However, the
   evidence of the electoral consequences of this type of anti-poverty
   intervention remains inconclusive. Do voters reward politicians when
   they implement conditional cash transfers? This study conducts a
   meta-analysis using a sample of 10 randomized controlled trials and
   regression discontinuity designs (35 estimates from six countries in
   Latin America and Asia) to address this question. The result shows a
   positive effect of conditional cash transfers on voter support for the
   incumbents and no evidence of publication bias in the selected sample.
   Estimated effect sizes tend to be larger in observational studies,
   unpublished manuscripts, and articles published in political science.
   These results provide more conclusive evidence that poor voters also
   respond to non-clientelistic strategies of electoral targeting in
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {Many populist radical right parties compete on a regular basis in the
   Bulgarian legislative elections. Among these, the VMRO-Balgarsko
   Natsionalno Dvizhenie (VMRO-BND, IMRO-Bulgarian National Movement)
   enjoys the greatest organizational stability and maintains a regular
   presence in politics and society despite volatile electoral performance.
   Using qualitative content analysis of official party documents
   (programs, statutes, and policy papers) and media reports, this article
   argues that the organizational stability of the VMRO-BND stems from its
   grassroots efforts to establish deep links in society. While its
   membership is limited, the local activities of the party between and
   during elections, and its network of loosely affiliated organizations
   create a grandiose impression of presence across Bulgaria. Through this
   presence, VMRO-BND fosters a sense of belonging for its members which in
   turn supports the party's goal of achieving a so-called ``national
   cultural unity{''} and the preservation of Bulgarian traditions.
   Internally, VMRO-BND provides room for non-member participation and
   bottom-up initiatives from local activists, while remaining strongly
   centralized at the top around its leader, Krasimir Karakachanov.
   Overall, VMRO-BND reveals the importance populist radical right parties
   place on social presence, even when membership numbers are low.},

Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {167-186},

Abstract = {Neoliberal institutionalists frequently see regional organisations such
   as the EU, ASEAN or the EAS as expressions of the desire for economic
   integration, political cooperation and the resolution of collective
   action problems. In this formulation, the creation of inclusive regional
   identities is seen as one of the potentially desirable consequences of
   institution-building. The Indo-Pacific, by contrast, has since its
   inception been driven by a rather old-fashioned concern with the balance
   of power in a part of the world in which China is once again playing a
   dominant and destabilising role. We argue that realists still have much
   to tell us about the material forces that are not only transforming the
   region-however, it is defined-but also which underpin the rise to
   prominence of the Indo-Pacific idea in particular. The so-called `Quad'
   countries are both the main drivers of the Indo-Pacific concept and a
   clear manifestation of its underlying goals and principles. In such
   circumstances, we argue, the Indo-Pacific is unlikely to reproduce even
   the rather modest levels of institutionalisation achieved by other
   organisations, primarily because this vision of the region is one that
   is not intended to address the sorts of collective action problems
   neoliberal institutionalists highlight. On the contrary, the
   Indo-Pacific rescales the region to include India and strategically
   aligns certain regional states in an old-fashioned quasi-alliance to the
   strategic threat posed by China.},

Abstract = {The adoption of electoral quotas for politically under-represented
   groups has become a prominent policy worldwide. An increasing number of
   states have adopted youth quotas, which aim to foster the election of
   young members of parliament under 35 to 40 years of age. To date, youth
   quotas only occur in tandem with simultaneously or previously adopted
   gender quotas. Why do states adopt youth quotas? Are the driving actors
   similar as in the adoption of gender quotas? Using causal process
   tracing based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles,
   parliamentary debates, and interviews, this article investigates the
   adoption of youth quotas in Tunisia and Morocco after the Arab uprisings
   in 2011. The findings suggest that, contrary to the respective gender
   quotas, youth quotas were not part of civil society movements' agendas,
   but top-down initiatives from actors from within the domestic political
   elites.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Number = {8-9},
Pages = {5+},
Abstract = {The destruction of the rule of law in Poland continues, and the conflict
   with the European Union is escalating. Legal chaos now reigns. One-sixth
   of the judges in ordinary courts have now assumed office with the
   involvement of the National Council of the Judiciary. They have issued
   more than two million rulings. But as the European Court of Justice
   (ECJ) has confirmed, their appointment contradicted European law.
   According to the ECJ, Polish courts are obligated to examine the
   independence of these judges and their rulings. The government has been
   backed into a corner and is reacting by intensifying the conflict. A gag
   law prohibits this examination. Judges who adhere to judicial
   independence are bullied by the chairmen who have assumed office under
   the government formed in 2015, or they are treated patronisingly by the
   equally contentious disciplinary chamber. Now the government has
   resorted to the big guns. The Polish Constitutional Court, which is
   subservient to the government, has certified that the ECJ exceeded its
   powers, and that the Treaty on European Union is incompatible with the
   Polish constitution. Poland is facing fines and subsidy cuts, but giving
   in is not this government's style..},

Abstract = {The article investigates the use that the Colombian sexual dissidence
   movement gave to the pink triangle in the 80s as part of a process of
   framing. Specifically, it studies how the historical narrative of the
   persecution of homosexuals by National Socialism was re-signified by
   Colombian activists in the context of the deepening of the internal
   armed conflict. For this, sources little worked by the national
   historiography are used: documents produced by the most active
   organization at the time, the Colectivo Orgullo Gay (CORG), specifically
   the magazine De Ambiente. It concludes that the presence of the pink
   triangle in Colombia is part of a larger framing process carried out by
   CORG, which uses the image of systematic persecution to make sense of
   the emergence of phenomena of social cleansing linked to paramilitarism.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {146-158},
Abstract = {In this article, we examine the impact of terrorist attacks on
   asylum-related migration flows. So far, the literature that examines the
   ``push factors{''} such as terrorism that explain forced migration has
   omitted the fact that the vast majority of people forced to flee
   typically do so toward other locations within the country. The novel
   feature of our research is the estimation of a structural gravity
   equation that includes both international migration and internally
   displaced persons (IDP), a theoretically consistent framework that
   allows us to identify country-specific variables such as terror attacks.
   For that purpose, we use information on the number of asylum
   applications, the number of IDP, and the number of terrorist attacks in
   each country for a sample of 119 origin developing countries and 141
   destination countries over 2009-2018. The empirical results reveal
   several interesting and policy-relevant traits. Firstly, forced
   migration abroad is still minimal compared to IDP, but globalization
   forces are pushing up the ratio. Secondly, terror violence has a
   positive and significant effect on asylum migration flows relative to
   the number of IDP. Thirdly, omitting internally displaced people biases
   downward the impact of terrorism on asylum applications. Fourthly, we
   observe regional heterogeneity in the effect of terrorism on asylum
   migration flows; in Latin America, terrorist attacks have a much larger
   impact on the number of asylum applications relative to IDP than in Asia
   or Africa.},

Abstract = {The surprise resignation of the President of the NSW Legislative
   Council, Liberal John Ajaka, in February 2021, resulted in a critical
   situation when a deadlock between the Government and most of the non
   Government MLCs meant that a replacement could not be elected. Eight
   MLCs lodged informal votes in the ballot to fill the vacancy, leaving
   the Government's candidate short of an absolute majority. The Council
   could not function without a President and the NSW Parliament could not
   legislate without the upper house. This article traces the increasing
   politicisation of the election of the President since 1991 that formed
   the background to this crisis. It sets out the controversy over the
   status of the informal votes and the meaning of `a majority' in the
   Standing Orders relating to the election of the President. While the
   crisis was eventually resolved, none of the MLCs involved can escape
   blame for an unedifying spectacle likely to damage the standing of the
   NSW Parliament.},

Title = {Representing `Place': City Climate Commissions and the
   Institutionalisation of Experimental Governance in Edinburgh},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {64-75},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of increasingly fragmented and poly-centric urban
   climate governance, this article examines the establishment of city
   climate `commissions' as an experimental means of addressing the
   challenge of climate change at the city-scale. In doing so it addresses
   the question: What constitutes diversity in voices and perspectives when
   trying to represent the city as a place for climate action? To answer
   this question, the article presents an analysis of the Edinburgh Climate
   Commission's establishment, drawing on participatory ethnographic
   research carried out by a researcher embedded within the project team.
   The account of how this new mode of urban governance was both
   conceptualised and then put into practice offers a new institutional
   angle to the literature on urban `experimentation.' Through our
   reflective analysis we argue that aspirations to ensure pre-defined
   `key' industries (high carbon emitters) are accounted for in
   commissioner recruitment, and an over-emphasis on capturing discernible
   `impacts' in the short term (by involving organisations already
   pro-active in sustainable development) hindered an opportunity to
   embrace new perspectives on urban futures and harness the innovative
   potential of cities to engage with the multifaceted nature of the
   climate challenge. Furthermore, new insight into the relationship
   between local authorities and other `place-based' agents of change opens
   up important questions regarding how to balance the attainment of
   legitimacy within the political status quo, and the prospect of a new
   radical politics for urban transformation.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This essay explores the idea of dying for the economy that has been a
   proposition supported by President Trump and the Republican Party in
   discussions about how to reopen the economy in light of the COVID-19
   pandemic and massive lockdowns. While to most of us this seems like
   crazy talk, I argue that the loss of some peoples' lives in order to
   sustain a buoyant economy is a rationale acceptable to many in the
   corporate sector as well as their pro-business political partners. I
   first explore theoretical discussions about biopolitics, necropolitics,
   and the long historical relationship between capitalism and death. I
   then point to an emerging literature on ``economies of death{''} and
   apply that to the opioid epidemic in the United States as an
   illustrative case of a ``necroeconomy{''}. I reflect upon parallels
   between the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, turning to
   current debate in the United States about reopening the economy versus
   the associated public health risks of further lives being lost. The
   rhetoric of these debates reflects widespread economic values that
   prioritize some lives over others, making explicit who is ultimately
   ``killable{''} in the quest to return to a flourishing and efficient
   economy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the challenges that women face when exercising
   their parliamentary mandate in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. It is
   a multi-method study that combines quantitative and qualitative
   analysis. Firstly, an online focus group was held with the staff
   advisors of some female federal deputies. Then a survey was carried out
   with these advisors of the parliamentarians in Brasilia, in the states,
   the party leaderships and the permanent committees of the Chamber.
   Interviews were also conducted with 19 of the 55 female MPs. The results
   show that there is, in general, homogeneity of thoughts regarding the
   difficulties to the exercise of the mandate. The opinion of the deputies
   coincides with the view of their staff.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has posed challenges to the global community at large and to
   jurisprudence in particular. In the current context, it is of paramount
   importance to find the best possible solutions in the field of legal
   regulation that help minimize the harmful effects of the global
   multisectoral crisis, save lives and restore the well-being of society.
   The work aims to clarify the theoretical problems in the legal status of
   medical innovations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The subject
   of research is anticoronavirus innovations in the medical field. The
   research methods used were the dialectical method, the system method,
   the formal-legal method, the historical-legal method, and the structural
   method. As a result of this work, the current state of legal regulation
   of anti-ronavirus medical innovations was analysed, in particular the
   international legal framework, as well as national legislation in this
   area; contradictions in the observance of the balance of public and
   private interests under the conditions of a pandemic are revealed and,
   consequently, some ways of resolving them are suggested.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {223-234},
Abstract = {Affective polarization - partisans' dislike and distrust of those from
   the other party - has reached historically high levels in the United
   States. While numerous studies estimate its effect on apolitical
   outcomes (e.g., dating and economic transactions), we know much less
   about its effects on political beliefs. We argue that those who exhibit
   high levels of affective polarization politicize ostensibly apolitical
   issues and actors. An experiment focused on responses to COVID-19 that
   relies on pre-pandemic, exogenous measures of affective polarization
   supports our expectations. Partisans who harbor high levels of animus
   towards the other party do not differentiate the ``United States'{''}
   response to COVID-19 from that of the Trump administration. Less
   affectively polarized partisans, in contrast, do not politicize
   evaluations of the country's response. Our results provide evidence of
   how affective polarization, apart from partisanship itself, shapes
   substantive beliefs. Affective polarization has political consequences
   and political beliefs stem, in part, from partisan animus.},

Abstract = {In 2007, a controversial gender equality fund was introduced into
   collective bargaining in Sweden in order to decrease the gender pay gap.
   The present article explores the conflict associated with the fund to
   shed light on why it was so controversial. It also aims to further
   knowledge concerning the possibility of introducing an intersectional
   perspective to the bargaining agenda that accounts for both gender and
   class. The empirical findings demonstrate that the controversy resided
   in differences in how labor market inequalities are conceptualized. On a
   theoretical level, the article illustrates the difficulties associated
   with applying an intersectional perspective in practice.},

Pages = {157-162},
Abstract = {In the ``reform era{''} in Indonesia, political parties faced problems
   related to institutionalization, consolidating ideology, and sound
   platform. In addition, the party system in Indonesia is not yet
   compatible with the presidential system of government, so the government
   has not been effective. The study aims to identify the peculiarities of
   political parties and party systems in Indonesia developed during the
   reform era. `the results showed that several factors made the level of
   party institutionalization not yet developed properly. First, the
   existing parties often experience draining and time-consuming conflicts
   so that there is no time to build the institutionalization of political
   parties. Second, party elites have not become party rules. And third,
   the party tradition that respects differences (democratic political
   culture) among party elites has not yet grown, elements of
   patrimonialism and even feudalism are still strong among party elites.},

Title = {Beyond expertise: the public construction of legitimacy for EU agencies},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {How is the power of independent agencies legitimized? This is a central
   question in modern democratic societies. Earlier research has privileged
   technical expertise as the predominant source of legitimacy for such
   agencies. While recent contributions have challenged this assumption, we
   have seen few attempts to systematically analyze the conditions under
   which different sources of legitimacy are established in public
   discourse. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual framework of
   four legitimation arguments and test their prevalence through an
   empirical analysis of the public legitimation of EU agencies. We
   hypothesize that the prevalence of each argument depends on
   characteristics of the agency, especially its scientific `hardness' and
   its public salience. We test our hypotheses in three steps. We first
   combine automated text classification and qualitative content analysis
   to analyze Swedish news media coverage of three EU agencies, 2005-2019.
   In a third step, we quantitatively analyze aggregated data on the
   Swedish news coverage of all EU agencies 2005-2019. We find more
   technical-expertise discourse in coverage of hard-science agencies, and
   more political-control discourse where agencies are `softer' or more
   salient. Our findings are therefore relevant for ongoing normative and
   empirical discussions on the legitimacy of independent agencies.},

Abstract = {While there is disagreement as to the severity of the digital
   disinformation problem, scholars and practitioners have largely
   coalesced around the idea that a new system of safeguards is needed to
   prevent its spread. By minimizing the role of citizens in managing their
   own communities, however, I argue that these gatekeeping approaches are
   undemocratic. To develop a more democratic alternative, I draw from the
   work of Harold D. Lasswell and John Dewey to argue that we should study
   the organization of digital publics. For citizens to engage in
   democratic inquiry, publics must be organized so that they can (1)
   easily identify their common interests and (2) regularly encounter
   variety. I then analyze Facebook, showing how the News Feed and Facebook
   Groups together create a platform on which propagandists can effectively
   target and manipulate specific publics. I conclude by turning to Reddit
   to suggest alternative forms of organizing digital publics more
   democratically.},

Abstract = {This article characterizes the European Union's humanitarian aid and
   development policies. In so doing it shows the underpinnings of said
   opposition; on the one hand, it demonstrates that the notion of victim
   is associated with a humanitarian space that privileges the
   representation of a suffering stranger. On the other hand, it reproduces
   images of a citizen as an autonomous subject that can provide for
   themselves through the market. Thus, when such policies converge in what
   has been names emergency aid and development, the victim is depicted as
   a subject that can be developed.},

Title = {Undocumented Migration and Electoral Support: Evidence From Spain},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {196-209},
Abstract = {Unwrapping the political discourse against immigration is key to
   understanding the rise of populism in Western democracies. A growing
   body of literature has found ample evidence that immigration pays a
   premium to conservative political forces that propose tighter policies.
   Using data on presidential elections in Spain from 2008 to 2019, we shed
   light on this debate by highlighting the role played by irregular
   migration. Some studies show that undocumented immigrants consume less
   and earn lower wages than documented immigrants with similar observable
   characteristics. In addition, since they are relegated to working in the
   informal sector, they cannot contribute to the welfare state with direct
   taxes. This suggests that undocumented migration might intensify support
   for right-wing politics and that the effect is independent from the one
   caused by the presence of documented migrants. We apply an instrumental
   variable strategy to deal with the non-random distribution of migrants
   across political districts. Our findings indicate that increasing
   undocumented migration increases support for the right, while increasing
   documented migration rises support for the left. When we consider the
   irruption of the far-right into electoral competitions, we find that
   undocumented migration redistributes votes from the left to the right,
   as has been observed in other countries.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2021},
Number = {16},
Pages = {453-471},
Abstract = {The neo-republicanism of Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit and Maurizio
   Viroli has the merit of having recovered the republican idea of freedom
   to critically approach the different forms of domination that permeate
   contemporary democratic societies. However, in the first section, it is
   argued that such normative proposals make insufficient use of the
   critical reaches of republican freedom, because they only
   instrumentalize it to defend the freedoms of individuals, despite the
   fact that it also served the republicans of the past to raise the
   sovereignty of States in the field of international relations. Thus, in
   a second section, a vindication of republicanism is proposed as a useful
   political discourse to critically position itself in the face of the
   external domination suffered, above all, by peripheral states such as
   those in Latin America due to the conditionalities imposed by
   international financial organizations, multinational companies and
   hegemonic states in the framework of the neoliberal globalization
   process of the last decades.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research was to analyze the latest values of the EU in
   the context of their adaptation in the process of statebuilding in the
   candidate countries for enlargement with a view to reforming the legal
   field of the States. The main method was the observation method as a
   component of the experimental procedure with subsequent interpretation
   of the results (description). The results of the study demonstrate the
   axiological importance of the EU's main values. At the same time, the
   need for a gradual implementation of reforms in the sphere of
   state-building is argued, given the desirability of preserving national
   identity. It is concluded that the low level of adaptation of the EU
   pyramid of core values is corroborated and confirmed by statistical
   data, which requires a qualitative transformation of the reform strategy
   of the state-building processes of the candidate countries for EU
   enlargement. Scientific research was concerned with the search for the
   optimal and effective concepts of the integrated application of European
   values in the state-building processes in the candidate countries for EU
   enlargement.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {70},
Pages = {942-965},
Abstract = {In criminal proceedings, in special circumstances, exceptions have been
   provided for to deviate from the competences of the judicial
   authorities, and the present study aims to compare these cases in
   Iranian and French criminal procedure. As for intrinsic jurisdiction,
   the findings indicate that in Iranian criminal procedure deviation from
   intrinsic jurisdiction is permitted in cases such as issuing a
   collective verdict and observing the rules of multiple crimes. In French
   criminal procedure, deviation from the inherent jurisdiction is possible
   in limited cases and only within the framework of a referral. Moreover,
   as regards the rule of diversion from local jurisdiction, the fact that,
   without exception, that rule cannot lead to favourable judicial review
   of criminal cases is common to both criminal proceedings. Indeed, the
   need to establish exceptions and violations of this rule in order to
   increase the efficiency of the judiciary is inevitable. Moreover, in
   both Iranian and French criminal proceedings, the basis for determining
   personal jurisdiction is the perpetrator, so that the criminal procedure
   has placed the investigation of certain persons under the jurisdiction
   of a specific authority.},

   scientific policy in France},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2021},
Number = {135},
Pages = {73-106},
Abstract = {In response to significant budget cuts at the start of the twenty-first
   century, the Sauvons la recherche (SLR) movement was formed. Initiated
   outside the trade union structures, it was born in 2004 as renowned
   biologists mobilized to question the future of their profession and the
   ways of defending the interests of science. By articulating the
   sociology of professions, the sociology of mobilizations, and the
   sociology of public policy, this article deciphers the unique role that
   a social movement of researchers played in setting the agenda for
   research reforms at the start of the twenty-first century. Based on the
   collection of original archives and more than thirty in-depth interviews
   with the scientists who participated in the movement from the outset,
   this article traces how SLR first built a frontal opposition to the
   government, then came to participate in the CIP-the committee that
   organizes the reform work of the Etats generaux de la recherche-in 2004.
   The article shows that the constitution of this ``hinge,{''} that is to
   say in Andrew Abbott's sense, the space of intermediation between
   government and professional collective, is the product of a conflictual
   history, and of debates and games on the frontiers of the profession and
   its relation to politics. Between protest mobilization and reformist
   work, the case study reveals a singular form of the association of
   professionals in the government of their sector.},

Abstract = {Apart from Mauritius, five of the six African small island developing
   States (ASIDS) are relatively new to democracy with several only
   transitioning from one-party states to multiparty states in the early
   1990s. As signatories to the Banjul Charter and several other
   international and regional conventions that promote democracy and human
   rights, the ASIDS are committed to upholding and promoting the
   fundamental freedoms of their people. This article examines, by way of a
   comparative analysis, the extent to which citizens within the ASIDS are
   free (including freedom from personal indignities and intimidation),
   that is the degree to which their civil and political rights are
   guaranteed in practice. In pursuit of this, a research sub-questions is:
   To what degree are de jure civil and political rights guaranteed in
   practice (de facto)? Findings reveal that both vital legislation and
   political will do exist to protect islander freedoms. However, real,
   practical enjoyment is impaired by a lack of capacity and a tendency by
   some to count immovable traditions as preferable to advancement and
   recognition of equal freedoms.},

Abstract = {The ``Black Lives Matter{''} (BLM) movement is believed to be the
   largest social movement in American history. Making sense of such a
   historically significant social movement will certainly enable a fuller
   understanding of contemporary American politics and society. The
   significance of BLM also makes this movement a benchmark case that
   provides a testbed for social movement theories. Within the framework
   provided by political process theory and the process tracing method,
   this article seeks to explain the political and socioeconomic dynamics
   underlying the development of BLM. One important factor that stands out
   in the case of BLM is the presence of an enabling political-economic
   environment characterized by rising ethno-racial inequalities, police
   brutality, and racism under the socially polarizing effects of the 2008
   economic crisis. A second set of factors to be considered is BLM's
   adoption of a decentralized organizational structure, which facilitates
   the rallying and mobilization of large segments of society based on
   loose coalition strategies enacted through social media. Third, the rise
   and development of BLM greatly owe to the deployment of strongly
   motivating slogans, symbols, and modes of collective action that carry
   symbolic value, appeal to mass emotions, and address the political
   opportunities in place.},

Abstract = {The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European
   Union and the US is highly technical. Still, the negotiations triggered
   large-scale protests among citizens with very diverse socioeconomic
   backgrounds. Why has a complex issue such an enormous mobilizing effect
   although the economic consequences are either unclear or favorable for
   the participating economies? We argue that the transparency of
   negotiations is an important consideration for people evaluating the
   negotiation outcome. Conducting a survey experiment, we show that
   non-transparent decision-making decreases citizens' appraisal of the
   agreement independent of its outcome: A non-transparent negotiation is,
   on average, almost 16 percent less likely to find public approval than a
   transparent but otherwise identical agreement. Our findings have
   important implications for democratic decision-making.},

Pages = {131-140},
Abstract = {The term `sustainable development' was coined to denote a political goal
   some 40 years ago; debates about sustainability date back considerably
   further. These debates reflect the growing awareness of the destructive
   effects of human activities on the natural foundations of life. Numerous
   initiatives have been launched to trigger a turnaround, with the 2030
   Agenda and the SDGs being the latest attempt. However, substantial
   progress has been rather limited thus far. This discrepancy is the
   subject of the article. Starting from a historical overview of
   sustainability politics, the argument develops in three steps. First, it
   is shown that conventional conceptions to promote environmental change
   fall short in depicting the broader societal context. To provide a
   comprehensive picture of the challenges related to transformation
   processes, a theory of the functional differentiation of societies is
   presented in a second step. A systems theory perspective offers a
   convincing theoretical explication of the problem. Third, this approach
   is scrutinized with regard to the political system and the politics of
   sustainability. The key finding is that the specific functional logics
   of the different social subsystems must be taken into account when
   analysing sustainable development and the discrepancy between the aims
   and ambitions of (global) environmental policy and the visible
   consequences. On the one hand, the functional differentiation of modern
   society guarantees its high degree of effectiveness and flexibility. On
   the other hand, implementing fundamental change, such as a transition
   towards sustainability, is not simply a question of strategy or of
   political willingness and steering. Rather, there is a need for more
   elaborate explanatory instruments. As a result, we argue for a linking
   of theories of sustainable development and advanced social theory.},

Title = {COVID-19 IN GREECE: FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S CLASH WITH THE GREEK CHURCH TO
   THE DIFFUSION OF ANTI-MASK SUPPORTERS},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {241-260},
Abstract = {By March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had reached Greece, forcing the
   Greek government to enforce lockdown for two months. While governmental
   measures included banning citizens' mobility, except for a six-bullets
   catalogue, the church was excluded, remaining open for its believers.
   That resulted in an official clash, having on the one side, the state
   and the scientists, while on the other was the official church. After
   the decline in the number of COVID-19 cases during the summer period,
   the governmental decision of enforcing the use of masks indoors
   triggered the rise of anti-systemic and anti-governmental rhetoric.
   Having the above in mind, we aim to apply a grounded theory methodology,
   drawing our data from two derivations: the official announcements of the
   church and the Greek government during the examined period; and the
   scientific approach to the Church's and anti-mask supporters stand.
   Consequently, our main research question attempts to answer how the
   anti-systemic rhetoric of Greek society has been transformed during the
   pandemic crisis.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to reveal the international imbalances
   caused by the COVID-19 pandemic through the coordinates of chaos theory.
   Methodologically it is a critical essay based on documentary
   observation. To understand the current state of world politics and the
   balance of power in international relations, it is appropriate to use
   chaos theory. At the beginning of the article, the origins of chaos
   theory are an interdisciplinary study, and its basic concepts are
   introduced. The value of using chaos theory and its great potential for
   analysis and applications in the study of international relations is
   shown in the example of the 2019-2020 events in Wuhan is the capital of
   Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China (PRC). associated with
   the onset of a COVID-19 viral infection that has spread around the
   world. At the end of the article, conclusions are drawn and the
   strengths and weaknesses of the use of chaos theory in dialectical
   relation to international relations are revealed, both as a field of
   study and at the same time as geopolitical reality.},

   on the expansion of the territory of the logistics point of the Navy of
   the Russian Federation in the vicinity of the port of Tartus{''}. The
   participation of the Russian fleets in the military operations in Syria
   showed that the Russian Navy successfully overcame the systemic crisis
   and took up positions corresponding to the status of a great power.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {399-411},
Abstract = {National identifications, cues from political actors, and cost-benefit
   calculations have been pointed as the main determinants of secession
   preferences. However, a recent surge in independence support in Scotland
   suggests that abrupt political changes may also affect these
   preferences: Brexit and the differentiated management of the Covid-19
   pandemic by the UK and the Scottish governments are named as causes of
   the first independence sustained majority registered by polling in
   Scotland. In this article, I discuss how voting shocks may affect the
   levels of support for independence, revise the evidence that sustains
   these claims, and analyse how they have changed the profile of the
   pro-independence voter. The effect of these questions has substantial
   implications for a possible second independence referendum in Scotland,
   as well as for the broader debate on the sources of secession support.},

Abstract = {The Czech Republic's quality press finds itself in a difficult
   situation. The market is small, production costs are high, and revenues
   modest. Newspapers and news magazines often fail to live up to their
   claims of providing serious reporting. Responsibility for the
   tabloidization of the Czech press was long attributed to the foreign,
   predominantly German media houses that invested in the country in the
   1990s and dominated the press market. Since the 2008 global economic
   crisis, these investors have pulled out. The new owners are mostly large
   Czech companies. But the quality of reporting has not necessarily
   improved. Rather, the issue of freedom of the press has become even more
   urgent. This applies especially to products from the publishing house
   MAFRA, a subsidiary of the Agrofert Group, which was founded by Prime
   Minister Andrej Babis.},

Abstract = {For many decades, Northern Ireland has been characterized by a tense
   conflict of identities with frequent outbreaks of political and
   religious violence. At the end of the 20th century, a consensus was
   reached between the opposing sides on the need for a peaceful settlement
   of the contradictions, which was reflected in the 1998 Belfast
   Agreement. The most important part of the agreement was a transition to
   the consociational model of governance. Consociationalism was assumed to
   ``cure{''} the Northern Irish region, save it from violence and
   antagonism, and help to establish a dialogue between the representatives
   of the region's key collective identities - unionists and nationalists.
   However, although 22 years have passed since the introduction of the
   consociational system, the settlement of the conflict has not seen any
   obvious progress.
   The article attempts to trace the reasons for this state of affairs and,
   in particular, to find out whether consociational model could, in
   principle, live up to the expectations. Based on the analysis of the
   fundamental characteristics of this model, as well as the institutional
   patterns in the Northern Irish politics, P.Maksimova comes to the
   conclusion that consociational practices not only failed to contribute
   to the elimination of the antagonistic moods in the society, but also
   helped to preserve them. According to the author, consociational system
   is merely an instrument of crisis management, which, if misinterpreted,
   can only intensify confrontation and block the final settlement of the
   conflict. This is exactly what happened in Northern Ireland, where the
   specific features of the consociational system made it almost impossible
   to abandon group identities.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of digital media in mechanisms that
   sustain the achievement of social movement outcomes during key phases of
   mobilizations that aim to impact policymaking. It does so by comparing
   two anti-corruption initiatives in Brazil that became legislative bills
   through popular petition , included the employment of digital media to
   support them: the Ficha Limpa (or Clean State Law) and the Ten Measures
   Against Corruption (TMAC) campaigns. Based on in-depth interviews with
   key activists and secondary sources, including an analysis of the
   campaigns' digital media content, this study evaluates three types of
   outcomes in the political realm: access, agenda , policy responsiveness.
   Although both anti-corruption initiatives elicited public preference and
   placed their legal inputs in the public agenda of the political system,
   they were not equally successful in converting their ideas into new
   legislation. The Ten Measures was a campaign that occurred when the
   digital affordances for civil society actors were considerably higher,
   but it did not achieve positive outcomes as the Ficha Limpa did. This
   article suggests that initiatives focusing more on online mobilization
   strategies without a clear advocacy approach to negotiate with (and
   pressure) public officials do not seem to be enough to promote policy
   changes.},

Title = {CONCEPT OF COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIANISM AND ITS CRITICISM IN SCIENTIFIC

Abstract = {The concept of competitive authoritarianism by Steven Levitsky and Lucan
   Way has become one of the compelling responses to the decline of the
   transition paradigm that used to hold optimistic expectations about
   democratization of political regimes that combined elements of democracy
   and authoritarianism. According to Levitsky and Way's logic, the
   presence of an authoritarian component does not allow one to
   characterize such mixed regimes as democratic, and in this sense,
   competitive authoritarianism is still authoritarianism. At the same
   time, it differs from other forms of authoritarian regimes due to the
   non-illusory ability of the opposition to compete for the executive
   power.
   The concept of competitive authoritarianism has been widely used in the
   study of political regimes, but the resulting important need for a
   deeper understanding of its assumptions has given rise to a number of
   critical evaluations among the researchers. The main criticism of the
   opponents regards the operationalization of the concept of ``competitive
   authoritarianism{''}, the historical limitations of its usage, as well
   as Levitsky and Way's idea that competitive authoritarian regimes are
   predetermined to democratize if they maintain broad and close ties with
   the West that are regarded as some kind of frozen objective reality. The
   article attempts to bring together the critical arguments that have been
   expressed in the research literature against the concept of competitive
   authoritarianism, and thereby contribute to a more balanced reception of
   this concept in the domestic scientific discourse. According to the
   author's conclusion, the main flaws of the concept are related to the
   interpretation of the reasons for the vulnerability/stability of
   competitive authoritarian regimes. The focus on the role of the West and
   the regime's ability to control the political process ignores a number
   of other significant factors, including the ability of the opposition to
   counter the current government with some real alternative, which is
   especially important in the Russian context, where the absence of such
   an alternative is one of the key reasons for the exceptional stability
   of the authoritarian regime.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the approaches of variant criticism and textual
   genetics to drafts, manuscripts or unpublished texts. This branch of
   philology has proposed new ways of approaching and studying canonical
   works, offering unknown information that had remained in the private
   sphere of the text. However, this discipline has not yet been examined
   from the point of view of feminist literary criticism. For this reason,
   this study investigates the new proposals that can be put forward in the
   analysis of both canonical works and unpublished texts by merging the
   methodologies of textual genetics and gynocriticism, giving a new name
   to this line of research and work: gynogenetics.},

Abstract = {The primary concern of justice department law enforcement as the arms of
   the criminal justice system is the rapid discovery of the crime. This
   article seeks to investigate the attitude of Iran's criminal policy or,
   more specifically, Iran's criminal policy towards the observance of the
   right to remain silent in trials. In line with this, the problem of the
   study translates into the question: what are the results of the
   observance of the right to silence of the accused in the different
   stages of the criminal process? Utilizing the documentary investigation
   method, issues related to the right of the accused to remain silent in
   Iran's criminal proceedings at the stage of discovery of the crime, the
   initial investigation stage, and the trial stage in Iran's laws on
   criminal procedures were investigated seminally. Among the main
   conclusions is that Iran's trial system, which was in line with the
   inquisitorial trial system, changed its procedures with the passage of
   the law on criminal trial procedures in 2013 and was influenced by the
   effect of international human rights regulations.},

Title = {SUDETEN GERMAN LANDSMANSHAFT OR THE SUPPORT OF IMMIGRATION? GERMANY AS A
   SOURCE OF THREAT IN THE RHETORICS OF MILOS ZEMAN},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {216-236},
Abstract = {This paper is supposed to be a contribution to contemporary discussion
   about creating ``the others{''} as a populist strategy. One can say that
   the role of the most important ``the others{''} in modern Czech history
   has been played by the Germans (as a nation) and/or by Germany (as a
   political unit). On the case of Czech President Milos Zeman, the goal of
   this paper is to show the process of creation ``the others{''}. The main
   questions of this text are: ``Are the Germans the object of othering by
   Milos Zeman? If yes, what are his arguments for creating this enemy of
   the Czech people?{''} This paper stands as a content analysis of dataset
   consist of all speeches, interviews, and articles by Milos Zeman from
   his whole first presidential term in office. The main findings of this
   analysis are related to the reframing of the image of the Germans as a
   source of danger for the Czech people. Originally, Milos Zeman used to
   speak mostly about the problems related to the so-called ``Sudeten
   question{''}. However, this argumentation has been changed and Milos
   Zeman has been speaking especially about the negative role of Germany
   during ``immigration crisis{''} and immigration politics of Angela
   Merkel during the last years. Islam and immigration seem to be
   discoursively strong topics able to replace former importance of some
   other issues (the insignificant number of immigrants and especially
   Muslims in the country notwithstanding). Zeman often uses the historical
   images of Nazism to delegitimize Islam.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the notes here presented is to explore a series of
   aspects associated with institutional and anthropological views of the
   State, respectively and in a complementary manner. From a methodological
   perspective this study is of a strictly theoretical nature therefore,
   since it lacks concrete empirical support, questions such as the
   schooling of the State or its scope in terms of functions, institutions,
   and reforms will not be discussed here. Furthermore, We will work from
   the institutional and non-institutional -anthropological - aspects of
   the State, addressing different perspectives and authors. It is
   considered that these two positions offer different but necessarily
   complementary approaches that will make it possible to problematize the
   State by understanding both its macro and micro levels as areas in
   conflict. The paper concludes with an analytical reconsideration of the
   State's link to civil society, citizenship, and its heterogeneous
   manifestations.},

Abstract = {This contribution is based primarily on an analysis of the ``chronicles
   from abroad{''} of some of the many periodicals which were in
   circulation in the pre-unity States of Italy in 1848, and which carried
   reports of the riots that erupted in Paris in February of that year. The
   author sets out to provide an overview of those riots, highlighting the
   coverage in Italian newspapers, which, by 1848, had grown exponentially
   thanks to the concessions on press freedom throughout the country. In
   most cases, the editorial staff of the Italian newspapers associated
   news of the revolution in France with the high-priority issue of liberal
   reforms and the question of the outcome of the Italian national
   movement. But the articles in the newspapers illustrate above all the
   fragility of a deeply divided and immature society in comparison with
   the more advanced French situation. The Italian periodicals sought in
   vain to channel the ongoing popular frenzy, which instead should have
   been led by the ruling classes, who were only concerned with the
   interests of their respective States.},

Abstract = {In 2020, Ecuadorian politics was not only constrained by the COVID-19
   pandemic, but also stirred by political instability and an intense
   online electoral campaign. In this article, we outline the Ecuadorian
   economic, social, and political context from February 2020 to February
   2021. Then, we explore the core measures and overall impacts of the
   COVID-19 on Ecuadorian politics. We also present the main institutional
   and policy changes, bearing in mind that 2020 was the last year of Lenin
   Moreno's presidential term. In addition, this article examines the
   latest electoral reform and the main issues of the electoral campaign,
   as well as the key results of the national and Andean elections of
   February 2021.},

Abstract = {The ban on the human rights organization Memorial was prepared in
   Russia's statefriendly media well in advance. The television stations NW
   and Rossiia attacked Memorial's projects and advocates by way of
   propagandistic contributions. They used diverse artifices of political
   PR. The implements come from a universal tool kit employed in many
   states around the world - be they democratic or autocratic. However,
   they conveyed content specific to Russian history policy: what's at
   stake is interpretive sovereignty over a heroic historical image, which
   is to be achieved by all manner of the propagandistic arts.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Pages = {497-514},
Abstract = {Education laws involve, for all political parties, one of the most
   visible flagships of their ideological project. In this regard,
   different governments have made legislative modifications to introduce
   orientations in this field closer to their partisan interests.
   Therefore, following existing models of political communication, in
   Southern European countries the coverage of this information leads to a
   potential dichotomized media context. The present research displays an
   analysis of the Spanish case during the last forty years, to verify the
   influence that educational reforms have provoked in the press coverage.
   For that purpose, we have used new machine learning methodologies,
   complemented by the development of self measures, to capture complex
   social phenomena within semantic variability scenarios. As a result of
   those processes, findings have evidenced a clear relationship between
   the ideological proposal of political parties and the editorial line of
   the printed press, regarding the mentioned educational reforms that were
   developed under the period of study.},

   referral to parliamentary committees in the Finnish Eduskunta},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Existing research largely agrees that to minimize ministerial drift,
   political parties in multiparty governments tend to use parliamentary
   committees to monitor each other. Particularly, they strive to chair
   parliamentary committees corresponding to ministerial departments to
   keep tabs on their ruling partners. Yet, policing ministerial activities
   through a chair-based monitoring system requires perfect correspondence
   of jurisdictions between ministries and committees. We suggest that when
   perfect correspondence is absent, ministerial parties may strategically
   circumvent committee oversight. Specifically, motivated by policy
   preference divergence with the coalition partner, ministers can draft
   proposals to make their referral to a friendlier committee more likely
   than referral to a hostile watchdog committee chaired by the partner.
   Our analysis of committee referrals of over 2800 ministerial proposals
   from the Finnish Eduskunta (2001-2015) confirms this expectation. The
   results, therefore, bring important new insights to our understanding of
   parliamentary scrutiny and partner oversight under coalition
   governments.},

Abstract = {We analyze a model of leader gender and crisis bargaining under
   asymmetric information. There are no essential differences between the
   sexes in their willingness to use force, but sexist leaders receive a
   subjective boost for defeating female leaders in war and pay a
   subjective cost for defeat. We show that this hostile sexism can lead to
   war for two reasons, first by offering sufficient private benefits to
   make peace impossible and second by influencing an uninformed leader's
   willingness to risk war. We also show that (a) the effect of leader sex
   on disputes and war depends on the distribution of power, (b) sexist
   leaders may initiate disputes at less favorable distributions of power
   than non-sexist leaders, and (c) sexist leaders adopt bargaining
   strategies that make it difficult for women to cultivate and benefit
   from reputations for resolve, even in the absence of sex differences in
   the willingness to use force.},

Title = {Accounting for the past: the role of public apologies in Ireland},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Demands for accountability are a prominent feature of contemporary
   public life. Although much academic attention has focused on perceived
   denials of accountability and blame avoidance in various political,
   administrative and transitional justice contexts, there has been much
   less analysis of blame acceptance and efforts to provide accountability.
   This paper explores attempts to provide such accountability through the
   medium of public apologies. It considers accountability as an iterative
   process that is intrinsically linked to perceptions by target audiences.
   Our analysis draws on a survey of 1007 citizens across the island of
   Ireland and public attitudes to apologies reflected in focus groups with
   a stratified sample of the general population. We find that the public
   appetite for apologies is strong and that they are generally valued as a
   core element of accountability provision. Public evaluations of such
   apologies are nonetheless modulated by a range of intersecting
   variables. In the concluding section we consider these various dynamics
   and reflect on how viewing public apologies as a complex dialogic
   process can inform broader conceptual understandings of accountability.},

   history to become the primary driver of some of the world's biggest
   news. Given the prominence of nationalist conflict, students in
   political science increasingly study the subject with modern references
   in mind. This article describes the design for a timely undergraduate
   political science course on the causes and consequences of nationalism,
   with a focus on four central learning objectives: understanding theories
   and concepts in the study of nations and nationalism; applying theories
   to contemporary events; exploring issues of identity among a community
   of learners; and developing analytical and professional skills. I
   describe in detail two course assignments that exemplify these
   pedagogical objectives. In the ``nationalism in the news{''} assignment,
   students give an in-class oral presentation on a current news story,
   interpreting the event through the lens of course themes. In the
   ``national anthems analysis{''} paper, students analyze the lyrics of
   the national anthem of their choosing, linking symbols to
   interpretations of different nationalism types. I conclude by offering
   suggestions for adapting these and other course assignments to a range
   of classrooms and students.},

Abstract = {A team from the University of Dayton, consisting of undergraduate
   students, a faculty facilitator, and practitioner partners, conducted an
   innovative oral history project documenting the experiences of ordinary
   people who lived through the unrest following Michael Brown's death in
   2014. The Moral Courage Project sought to investigate the spectrum of
   stories from Ferguson that failed to fit into the extreme and polarized
   narratives emerging from mainstream media coverage and were, therefore,
   overlooked. With the testimonies collected, the team produced a
   multimedia exhibit featuring portraits and audio materials, as well as a
   podcast series and a storytelling website. This paper describes the
   origins and outlines of this unique program in the context of an
   experiential learning framework. While accounting for the project's
   successes, the author also reflects on ways that student outcomes could
   have been improved had greater focus been placed on experiential
   learning processes and structures.},

Abstract = {This study explored social media use by CGTN Africa and BBC Africa under
   the concept of digital diplomacy. Digital diplomacy has been seen
   recently as an important component that international media adapt to set
   agendas, expand their online presence and create, engage and sustain
   relationships with their foreign audience. A content analysis was
   employed to analyse 1200 posts from Facebook accounts of the media. The
   study's findings show that the media set an agenda through actively
   posting stories that promote African values and culture to generate
   interaction among their readership. Also, findings indicate that foreign
   media prioritized reporting on specific issues in Uganda, Sudan, South
   Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia over others. The audience engaged
   more with reports on sports and less with those on tourism and wildlife.
   CGTN Africa rarely engages in conversation with its audience. Thus,
   there is a need to build the capacity of its staff, which might help
   China's media perform better on social media.},

Abstract = {Informal trilogue meetings are the main legislative bargaining forum in
   the European Union, yet their dynamics remain largely understudied in a
   quantitative context. This article builds on the assumption that the
   negotiating delegations of the European Parliament and the Council play
   a two-level game whereby these actors can use their intra-institutional
   constraint to extract inter-institutional bargaining success.
   Negotiators can credibly claim that their hands are tied if the members
   of their parent institutions hold similar preferences and do not accept
   alternative proposals or if their institution is divided and negotiators
   need to defend a fragile compromise. Employing a measure of document
   similarity (minimum edit distance) between an institution's negotiation
   mandate and the trilogue outcome to measure bargaining success, the
   analysis supports the hypothesis for the European Parliament, but not
   for the Council.},

Abstract = {We combine the recent literature on issue competition with work on
   intra-party heterogeneity to advance a novel theoretical argument.
   Starting from the premise that party leaders and non-leaders have
   different motivations and incentives, we conjecture that issue
   strategies should vary across the party hierarchy. We, therefore, expect
   systematic intra-party differences in the use of riding the wave and
   issue ownership strategies. We test this claim by linking public opinion
   data to manually coded information on over 3600 press releases issued by
   over 500 party actors across five election campaigns in Austria between
   2006 and 2019. We account for self-selection into leadership roles by
   exploiting transitions into and out of leadership status over time. The
   results show that party leaders are more likely than non-leaders to
   respond to the public's issue priorities, but not more or less likely to
   pursue issue-ownership strategies.},

Abstract = {Murray Chotiner began working for Richard Nixon in his first
   congressional race in 1946 and managed Nixon's successful 1950
   senatorial campaign and 1952 vice-presidential campaign as well as
   handling the vice president's campaign schedule in the 1954 mid-term
   elections. Despite Nixon's trust in Chotiner, the latter played no role
   in Nixon's 1960 presidential contest against John Kennedy. This was in
   part due to JFK's younger brother, Robert Kennedy, who not only managed
   his brother's successful 1960 presidential campaign but, four years
   earlier, used his position as chief counsel of the Permanent
   Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Government Operations
   Committee (aka the Senate Rackets Committee) to sully Chotiner's
   political reputation. This article explores this forgotten chapter in
   the rivalry between the Kennedys and Nixon.},

Abstract = {Council members are key gatekeepers in political decision-making at the
   local level. This paper explains differences in the attitudes of 1638
   female and male council members toward representative, participatory,
   and direct democratic forms of participation. It focuses on (a) their
   party affiliation and (b) the strategic considerations they engage in to
   enforce their preferences. In contrast to existing comparative studies,
   this analysis places an emphasis on gender differences in attitudes. In
   doing so, it demonstrates that the attitudes of female council members
   depend precisely on the different experiences and perspectives they have
   with institutional power imbalances. Often, women find themselves in a
   minority position on the council and must overcome additional obstacles
   before they can assert their preferences as much as their male
   counterparts. The study shows that women councillors generally rate
   participatory participation opportunities better than their male
   counterparts. In particular, councilwomen from the Left Party and the
   CDU differ most from their male party colleagues on the council. And a
   common assumption from research on the attitude of council members
   toward participation opportunities must also be differentiated, at least
   for Baden-Wurttemberg: It is the men on the council who justify their
   attitudes from a position of strength, while being part of the majority
   on the council has no effect for women councillors on their attitudes
   toward the three different participation opportunities.},

Abstract = {Coups are forceful acts of removal staged against incumbent governments.
   Yet, the democratic coup hypothesis indicates the possibility of
   coup-led democratisation. Do coups really lead to democratisation? And
   if so, why do only some coups trigger a democratic transition? I analyse
   successful and failed coup events from 1950 to 2015 to address these
   questions, focusing on the mediating effects of domestic factors. The
   theoretical framework suggests that while successful coups lead to
   democratisation in wealthier countries, high levels of income and state
   capacity allow authoritarian-leaning leaders to autocratize the country
   following a failed coup attempt. These findings have broader
   implications for civil-military relations and the international
   community's effect on military behaviour in post-coup settings.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a deep impact on the
   future of work and employment. The paper outlines a normative framework
   to understand and protect human freedom and justice in this transition.
   The proposed framework is based on four main ideas: going beyond the
   idea of a Basic Income to compensate the losers in the transition
   towards AI-driven work, towards a Responsible Innovation approach, in
   which the development of AI technologies is governed by an inclusive and
   deliberate societal judgment; going beyond a philosophical
   conceptualisation of social justice only focused on the distribution of
   `primary goods', towards one focused on the different goals, values, and
   virtues of various social practices (Walzer's `spheres of justice') and
   the different individual capabilities of persons (Sen's `capabilities');
   going beyond a classical understanding of capital, towards one
   explicitly including mental capacities as a source of value for
   AI-driven activities. In an effort to promote an interdisciplinary
   approach, the paper combines political and economic theories of freedom,
   justice and capital with recent approaches in applied ethics of
   technology, and starts applying its normative framework to some concrete
   example of AI-based systems: healthcare robotics, `citizen science',
   social media and platform economy.},

Abstract = {When a party or candidate loses the popular vote but still wins the
   election, do voters view the winner as legitimate? This scenario, known
   as an electoral inversion, describes the winners of two of the last six
   presidential elections in the United States. We report results from two
   experiments testing the effect of inversions on democratic legitimacy in
   the US context. Our results indicate that inversions significantly
   decrease the perceived legitimacy of winning candidates. Strikingly,
   this effect does not vary with the margin by which the winner loses the
   popular vote, nor by whether the candidate benefiting from the inversion
   is a co-partisan. The effect is driven by Democrats, who punish
   inversions regardless of candidate partisanship; few effects are
   observed among Republicans. These results suggest that the experience of
   inversions increases sensitivity to such outcomes among supporters of
   the losing party.},

Title = {Bill Content, Legislative Outcomes, and State-Level Resistance to

Abstract = {Recently, scholars of the lawmaking process have urged their colleagues
   to devote more attention to the potential impact of bill content on
   legislative outcomes. Heeding their call, this paper builds an original
   dataset of over 5,000 pieces of state-level legislation addressing
   issues that span the ideological spectrum. It compares proposals that
   challenge the authority of the national government in a specific domain
   to proposals that lack federalism-related implications and finds that
   the former, all else being equal, make less legislative progress toward
   enactment. In addition, it categorizes the measures that resist national
   laws based on the specific nature of the challenge they pose. Its
   analysis finds that measures that are inconsistent with existing
   national law but work within the law's legal framework make more
   legislative progress than measures that seek to nullify the national law
   or that vow not to cooperate with it. It also confirms that sponsor
   characteristics such as majority status, the number of cosponsors,
   institutional rules such as hearing requirements, and state-level
   factors like party control of the state legislature affect how much
   progress proposals make toward enactment. Thus, the paper demonstrates
   the importance of legislative content as an explanatory factor and sheds
   light on the nature of intergovernmental relations in the contemporary
   United States.},

Abstract = {Political struggles need a politicisation of time, since their horizons
   vary according to the different time frames that are used. Through an
   interaction between the concepts of ``hauntology{''} (Mark Fisher) and
   ``rebellious tradition{''} (Fruela Fernandez via E.P. Thompson), the
   article proposes a model of politicised time that opposes itself to
   nostalgia, the dominant feeling in the current political space.
   Alternatives are explored through three scenes of the mining valleys of
   Asturias, their temporalities and the feelings -both political and
   antipolitical- that could derive from them.},

Abstract = {A key feature of parliamentary democracy is government accountability
   vis-a-vis the legislature, but the important question of who speaks for
   the government-cabinet ministers or unelected bureaucrats, and the
   institutional underpinnings of this behavior-receives scant attention in
   the existing literature. We investigate this question using the case of
   Japan, and data on more than four million committee speeches spanning
   distinct electoral and legislative institutional environments. We
   document how a party-strengthening electoral system reform in 1994
   facilitated a dramatic shift in the nature of government accountability
   to parliamentary committees: speeches by ministers increased, speeches
   by bureaucrats decreased, and discursive accountability between
   ministers and opposition legislators increased. Subsequent legislative
   reforms expanding junior ministerial roles and placing explicit limits
   on bureaucratic participation further reinforced the effects. These
   findings shed new light on the institutional foundations of responsible
   party government in general as well as its progressive development in
   Japan.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Republican Party's interactions with the
   South during the 1960 presidential election. It argues that southern
   Republican growth was built on foundations laid in 1960. Furthermore,
   this article illustrates the crucial importance of historical memory in
   southern political development. It presents white southern sentiment
   about the Civil War and Reconstruction as a key obstacle Republicans
   faced, illuminating the memory-heavy language politicians and southern
   supporters employed to foster desertions from the Democratic standard.
   By placing historical memory at the center of its analysis, this study
   sheds new light on the Republican ``Southern Strategy{''} and the
   figures most responsible for shaping Republican fortunes in the former
   Confederacy.},

Abstract = {This essay reframes the significance of the Authoritarian Personality
   study for the ``fascism debates `` and for the rapidly growing field of
   research on digitally mediated right-wing movements by rereading Theodor
   Adorno as a theorist of algorithms. Positing that the advent of ``the
   society of algorithms `` has transformed the nature of both
   authoritarianism and of personality, it returns to two empirical texts
   where Adorno analyzes two methods of classification and prediction: the
   ``Types and Syndromes `` chapter of The Authoritarian Personality, and
   Adorno's content analysis of the Los Angeles Times astrology column,
   Stars Down to Earth. On the basis of these texts, this essay formulates
   some initial hypotheses about certain widely observed changes in the
   character of the right and sketches a program for a critical data
   science inspired by Adorno's ``critical typology `` that could undertake
   further investigation. Finally, it proposes the ``systems update `` as a
   concept useful for understanding the relationship of contemporary
   right-wing movements to both digital media and historical fascism.},

Abstract = {In this article we argue that reinvigorating socialist politics requires
   championing a socialist worldview that goes beyond the critique of
   capitalism. Neglecting such an outlook leaves socialism tethered to the
   fortunes of capitalism and inhibits a broader account of its own
   virtues. We begin by explaining why worldview thinking is appropriate
   today. Then we examine two underappreciated works by Karl Polanyi (his
   1927 lecture ``On Freedom{''}) and Charles Taylor (his 1974 essay
   ``Socialism and Weltanschauung{''}). Each treats worldview thinking as
   indispensable and we use them as catalysts for developing a socialist
   vision. Finally, we bring our insights to bear on the worldview
   potential of socialist republicanism. We contend that a promising
   worldview emerges by elaborating the following components: a political
   anthropology of human possibilities; anti-capitalism, social freedom,
   and non-domination; socialist civic virtues; and the promise and limits
   of pluralism.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to demonstrate that bottom-up popular vote processes
   (the optional referendum and citizens' initiative) focused on ordinary
   legislation can help to improve democratic self-government by uniquely
   facilitating the development and expression of various forms of
   political agency. Most significantly, it is argued that such popular
   vote processes can be designed in ways that endow them with significant
   deliberative credentials. Methodologically, the paper employs Mark E.
   Warren's problem-based approach to democratic theory, which provides the
   conceptual tools necessary to advance a) a novel case for recovering
   popular vote processes as a valid institutional toolkit for exploration
   by democratic theory and b) an empirically informed set of best
   practices that can provide critical resources for normatively
   scrutinizing existing institutionalizations of bottom-up popular vote
   processes across the world.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak can be considered a potential
   driver of changes not only in academic disciplines but also, as most
   observers underline, in the teaching mission of higher education. This
   raises the main question of this article, that is, exactly whether and
   how an external shock such as COVID-19 can impact the comprehensive
   profile of academic disciplines. By focusing on European political
   science, the article assesses the differences among scholars in this
   community in terms of potential long-term reactions. The study, based on
   the outcomes of an original survey conducted among 1400 European
   professional political scientists (EPSs) at the end of 2020, aims at
   detecting the ``predisposition to adaptation{''} of the community, by
   examining the attitudes revealed by EPSs during the early phase of
   pandemic. In this regard, we focus on the explanations of different
   aspects of `professional adaptation', discussing three dimensions that
   seem to be present in our sample, although with very different weights:
   passive, proactive and innovative adaptation.},

Abstract = {The Philippines' humanitarian norms and frameworks have evolved from
   focusing on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to more
   pro-active disaster preparedness, enhancing community resilience and
   empowered participation of local and grassroots actors. The
   US-Philippines security alliance has evolved in line with these
   developments and needs to be understood more holistically and not be
   limited to providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief through
   sending foreign military assets in times of disasters. This article
   argues that the non-traditional aspect of the US-Philippines bilateral
   alliance is not intended to underplay the role of the US military, but
   highlights the importance of the private sector, humanitarian NGOs, and
   the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in deepening and
   broadening the security alliance.},

Abstract = {Incumbents in electoral regimes often retain power despite having to
   regularly compete in multiparty elections. We examine a specific channel
   through which incumbents can seek to prevent the emergence of a strong
   opposition that might threaten them in future elections. We present a
   formal model demonstrating that incumbents can strategically induce
   opposition fragmentation by appointing some opposition members to
   ministerial cabinet positions. Opposition politicians who have the
   opportunity to secure a cabinet position in an incumbent's government
   tend to compete for office independently rather than coalescing into
   broad-based parties or electoral alliances. The model shows that weaker
   incumbents are more likely to rely on this cooptation strategy. Using
   original data on presidential elections across African countries during
   1990-2016, we show that past cooptation of opposition politicians is
   associated with a more fragmented opposition field in subsequent
   elections.},

Abstract = {When, and under what circumstances, are congressional minority parties
   capable of influencing legislative outcomes? We argue that the capacity
   of the minority party to exert legislative influence is a function of
   three factors: constraints on the majority party, which create
   opportunities for the minority party; minority party cohesion on the
   issue at hand; and sufficient motivation for the minority to engage in
   legislating rather than electioneering. Drawing on data on every bill
   considered in the House of Representatives between 1985 and 2006 and
   case examples of notable lawmaking efforts during the same period, we
   show that our theory helps predict which bills are considered on the
   House floor, which bills become law, and the substance of policy-making
   outcomes. Our findings have important implications for theories of
   congressional party power and our understanding of minority party
   influence on Capitol Hill.},

Abstract = {Interest groups are playing a fundamental role in solving the problems
   generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as they address multiple issues and
   represent social groups around an unprecedented social challenge.
   Multiple organizations express their constituents' concerns and demands
   every day, thus forging an agenda in which they debate how to deal with
   the multiple effects of the pandemic in various sectors. However, given
   the dynamics of attention inherent to the emergency situation and the
   diversity of issues, it is difficult to follow the diver- sity and
   complexity of multiple actors and issues. This article describes the
   agenda of interest groups in Spain, based on the publications on Twitter
   by the 140 most active organizations between March 2018 and March 2021.
   Using automated text classification, it is possible to conclude that the
   aggregate attention by types of interest groups to the main items on the
   agenda vary little after the outbreak of the crisis caused by the
   pandemic. Attention to the health, socio-political and economic
   dimensions related to COVID-19 follows similar patterns among the
   different types of groups and is transversal to the issues on the
   agenda. These results show that interest groups continue to carry out
   their interest representation function without significantly altering
   their behaviour in response to the crisis.},

Abstract = {Migrants are politically marginalized in cities of the developing world,
   participating in destination-area elections less than do local-born
   residents. We theorize three reasons for this shortfall: migrants'
   socioeconomic links to origin regions, bureaucratic obstacles to
   enrollment that disproportionately burden newcomers, and ostracism by
   antimigrant politicians. We randomized a door-to-door drive to
   facilitate voter registration among internal migrants to two Indian
   cities. Ties to origin regions do not predict willingness to become
   registered locally. Meanwhile, assistance in navigating the electoral
   bureaucracy increased migrant registration rates by 24 percentage points
   and substantially boosted next-election turnout. An additional treatment
   arm informed politicians about the drive in a subset of localities;
   rather than ignoring new migrant voters, elites amplified campaign
   efforts in response. We conclude that onerous registration requirements
   impede the political incorporation, and thus the well-being, of migrant
   communities in fast-urbanizing settings. The findings also matter for
   assimilating naturalized yet politically excluded cross-border
   immigrants.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the nature and significance of belonging and its
   intersection with Identity and being in the world. Its primary impetus
   is to address the question of belonging as it arises in postcolonial
   multi-ethnic, language, religious and racial identities in Africa. Where
   does ethnic and national Identity intersect and diverge? It remains a
   highly politicised and contested issue. Narratives on African belongings
   provide insights into the shape and complexity of the contemporary
   African debate and illustrate how, in the presentation of belonging as
   having multiple and competing manifestations, what it is to belong per
   se is rendered indistinct. This exemplifies the critical problem where
   Belonging is concerned. While Belonging is invoked as an issue of
   crucial existential concern in public discourse and across a broad range
   of disciplines, there is an apparent and troubling lack of conceptual or
   linguistic apparatus. The notion can be grasped and critically analysed.
   Therefore, this paper seeks to explore and redress this problematic
   situation. Consideration of Belonging also involves Identity and
   thinking of how these two concepts are articulated together in theory.
   This latter question is explored by surveying the theoretical and
   conceptual frameworks from which `senses' of Identity and Belonging are
   commonly expressed in postcolonial Africa. Belonging qua correct
   relation represents an entirely new way of understanding, in existential
   terms, what it is to belong (or not), not only in the postcolonial
   African context but wherever and whenever the question arises.},

Abstract = {In the first part of the paper the author presents the key theses of
   Vickie Sullivan's reading of Machiavelli. Sullivan argues that, in order
   to prevent corruption, Machiavelli innovatively reworks elements of
   Christian teaching for entirely temporal purposes and offers a specific,
   modern solution, `new Rome', in the form of an irreligious, fearful
   republic which early and effectively punishes the ambitious few seeking
   to establish tyranny. In the internal realm of the city, the Florentine
   reduces class desires of the plebs and the greats under the common goal
   of acquisition. A bellicose, tumultuous republic satisfies the desires
   of all the social actors, resulting in a lasting political order. In the
   second part the author critically engages with Sullivan's
   interpretation, drawing on Claude Lefort's interpretation of
   Machiavelli. Surprisingly, Lefort's groundbreaking work on Machiavelli
   has been absent in Straussian readings of the Florentine. By
   highlighting the authentically democratic nature of Machiavelli's
   project, in contrast with Sullivan's reading, an entirely different `new
   Rome' arises on the horizon.},

Abstract = {At first glance, it can be stated that bodies do not play an important
   role in modern Western political theory. They are mostly privatized and
   set as natural or prepolitical. This article argues, however, that
   bodies are not absent in modern political theory but that they play a
   crucial political role. They legitimize political orders in a subtle
   way. Through an examination of central arguments in the work of Thomas
   Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Hannah Arendt,
   John Rawls, and Jurgen Habermas, three ways are identified in which
   bodies shape modern Western political theory. First, bodies are used to
   legitimize the political order; second, they serve to determine
   political subjectivity; and third, body politics define politics. The
   text aims to highlight how a body-theoretical perspective that does not
   define the body as prepolitical but rather as a political construct is
   able to expand the scope of political theory.},

Abstract = {Compulsory military service, due to its timing in the lives of men (at a
   young age, which is the key period for increasing human capital) and its
   length (in many cases, about a year and a half to two years), implies a
   significant cost (explicit or implicit) for them. Individual costs
   incurred as a result of compulsory military service is an important
   aspect to consider when measuring the economic and social costs of
   enforcing conscription. Compulsory military service has been a part of
   Iranian government policy since 1925. Accordingly, an attempt to
   estimate the cost for men in Iran is the main subject of this paper. We
   will estimate the willingness of men to pay for exemption from
   compulsory military service based on the dichotomous choice contingent
   valuation model (One-and-One-Half Bounded approach). The mean of
   willingness to pay is estimated at 1.61 billion Rials (38,000 USD) while
   the median of willingness to pay is 1.64 billion Rials. A calculation of
   the median of willingness to pay for sub-groups of respondents shows
   that individuals with an income of more than 70 million Rials (1670 USD)
   per month have the highest median of willingness to pay, followed by
   those with a Ph.D. degree, and finally, undergraduates are individuals
   with the lowest median of willingness to pay.},

Title = {Did they even try? Brazilian government policy measures in the first 12
   weeks of the pandemic},

Abstract = {This article draws from recently developed frameworks for the analysis
   of complex, boundary-spanning policy problems to consider the response
   of the Brazilian government in the initial stages of the novel
   coronavirus pandemic. The timeframe selected for analysis covers the
   first 12 weeks after the first confirmed case in the country. Analysis
   is focused on government coordination, including major policy measures
   such as a constitutional amendment and provisional presidential decrees,
   and on the role of discourses in policymaking. Findings indicate that
   the Brazilian government failed to respond properly to the pandemic and
   did not steer public action toward collectively accepted goals. Further
   consideration raises the question as to whether the government tried to
   halt the spread of the virus; an analysis of the ideology embraced by
   the national-populist political coalition suggests that the
   dehumanization of political enemies is a strategic alternative.
   Conclusions argue that the dehumanization of the other is a viable
   strategy for the government and suggest that the pandemic crisis is part
   of a continuum of crises that calls for a reframing of societal choices
   and political-economical design in Brazil and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This article explores the growing environmental activism of
   nondemocratic regional organizations (NDROs) by investigating the case
   of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), addressing the following
   questions: What explains the emergence of environmental regionalism in
   the SCO? What are its characteristics and effects? We show that China
   has acted as the driver of environmental regionalism in the SCO -whose
   members rank among the world's top CO(2 )emitters- providing positive
   incentives for the establishment of regional environmental institutions
   and fostering member states' green energy transition through the
   top-down deployment of Chinese financial institutions and construction
   companies. In so doing, China has sought to consolidate its regional
   leadership in Eurasia, while promoting its economic statecraft and its
   bid for global environmental leadership.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Most critics of our contemporary meritocratic practices and institutions
   believe their arguments speak to the defects of the ideal of meritocracy
   itself. I argue that this is a misguided generalization because
   meritocracy can take many forms depending on the conception of the good
   and broader theory of justice to which the distributive principle of
   merit it is attached. To illustrate, I contrast two radically different
   forms of meritocracy - a telic or end-oriented model based on Plato's
   Kallipolis and a procedural model inherent in our free market of careers
   open to talents. Far from being a unified ideal, meritocracy is a
   spectrum of social and political arrangements, ranging between the telic
   and the procedural poles. Thus, identifying `merit' and `meritocracy' as
   the main sources of injustice in our contemporary societies further
   conceals the background conditions and underlying commitments that
   should be subject to our critical scrutiny.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {What is the effect of residing in ethnic enclaves on immigrants' future
   political participation? We study a comprehensive refugee placement
   reform that was implemented in Sweden in the mid-1980s in combination
   with unique individual-level turnout data to study the causal effect of
   being settled in neighborhoods with a high residential concentration of
   coethnics on immigrants' future probability of voting. We find little
   evidence that ethnic concentration per se affects voter turnout. On
   average, newly arrived immigrants were equally likely to vote whether
   they were placed in a neighborhood with many or few coethnics. Further
   analyses, however, indicate that the effect of ethnic concentration
   depends on the degree of political integration among previously settled
   coethnics; ethnic concentration increases turnout among the newly
   immigrated when they are placed with already politically integrated
   coethnics. These results underscore the conditions under which the
   political socialization of immigrant newcomers is enhanced in ethnic
   enclaves.</p>},

Abstract = {This article proposes Maarten Hajer's concept of discourse coalition for
   analyzing anti-gender politics and its interlinkages with other forms of
   opposition to sexual and gender equality. The perspective conceptualizes
   how actors with disparate ideological, philosophical, and religious
   views can communicate and produce meaningful interventions, if they
   share certain storylines. This primarily conceptual contribution is
   illustrated with a study of how ``traditional values{''} are promoted by
   the Russian state. Two storylines, stressing the needs to protect
   ``traditional values{''} from outside interference, and children from
   harmful sexual information, enable discursive affinities and
   interconnections across differences, domestically, internationally, and
   transnationally.},

Abstract = {The article explores factors affecting the duration of the co-decision
   procedure (currently the ordinary legislative procedure), the main
   procedure for adopting legislation in the European Union. Drawing from
   rational choice institutionalism, it expects the speed of co-decision to
   be determined by three attributes: the impatience of legislators, issue
   linkage and the characteristics of Council and European Parliament
   negotiators (relais actors). The hypotheses are tested using survival
   analysis on a dataset of 599 controversial legislative acts submitted
   and enacted under co-decision between 1999 and 2009. The results show
   that co-decision proposals are decided faster when they are urgent,
   negotiated prior to the European Parliament elections and concluded
   through single proposal logrolls. By contrast, multi-proposal packages
   and the ideological distance between relais actors prolong
   decision-making. Overall, the article contributes to the literature by
   showing that the impatience of legislators, package deals and the
   properties of negotiators are relevant drivers of co-decision duration.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Pages = {682-690},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Belfast or Good Friday Agreement of 1998 makes provision for
   Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland
   through a unification referendum, if voters so wish. Yet, the provision
   is short on detail and has not been substantively explored. A Working
   Group on Unification Referendums on the Island of Ireland has recently
   sought to address this gap. In this article, the Working Group's chair
   and research assistant outline the project's methodology and key
   findings, covering overall referendum configurations and specific design
   features, as well as what steps might be taken in the coming years. The
   article also highlights two comparative lessons, relating to tensions
   between the values of informed consent and inclusive design, and between
   majoritarian and consensual politics. These tensions afflict many
   referendums, particularly on sovereignty questions. They cannot be
   resolved, but only tempered, through careful and inclusive design of
   referendum processes.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {441-467},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The general populace in Myanmar, as well as international observers,
   have expected that the National League for Democracy (NLD) would be able
   to consolidate democratic transition, since the latter obtained a
   certain degree of support from home and abroad. During the five years of
   the NLD administration, transition has nevertheless been in regression
   instead of progression. All rating agencies (Freedom House, Bertelsmann,
   VDem) consider that Myanmar is not yet a democracy. Freedom House's
   report indicates that Myanmar's status changed from `Partly Free' to
   `Not Free' in 2020. Much of the existing literature argues that this
   stems from the NLD having had to operate within structural constraints
   and agency curbs. Therefore, this article will examine why the NLD is
   unable to overcome these barriers, under which structural factors and
   what kind of agency. The article argues that, instead of
   structure-altering, the NLD has reinforced structural barriers without
   seeking any considerable leeway within the bounds of existing
   constraints. In the context of structure, this article will examine the
   transition process itself, as well as constitutional arrangements, the
   economic system, and the political culture. The agency context will
   include the behaviours of the chief executive, the Tatmadaw, and the
   general populace.},

Abstract = {Lenin's theories and tactics are specific to the early twentieth century
   and cannot be repeated. His project should be considered in terms of its
   methodology, its understanding of capitalism, the political agency of
   the working class and the geo-political structures of economic and
   political power. Lenin combined political economy, geo-politics,
   political organisation and a sociology of social structure to form an
   innovative revolutionary praxis. He was correct in his appraisal of the
   social forces in support of revolutions in Russia. But he provided an
   over-optimistic prediction for the disintegration of monopoly capitalism
   and a partial analysis of the working classes in the advanced capitalist
   countries. His political approach requires a redefinition of
   countervailing forces and class alliances and a shift of focus away from
   the semi-periphery to the ``strongest links{''} in the capitalist chain.
   His proposals for a ``party of a new type{''} and the ``dictatorship of
   the proletariat{''} require revision. A ``renewal{''} of Lenin has to
   consider the contradictions of global capitalism and the
   re-territorialisation of classes. The author considers that a ``return
   to Lenin{''} is not to adopt his policies but a prompt to reinvent a
   socialist political and economic vision derived from Marx's analysis of
   capitalism.},

Abstract = {Why do state authorities murder journalists? We show that the majority
   of journalists are killed in democracies and present an argument that
   focuses on institutional differences between democratic states. In
   democracies, journalists will most likely be targeted by local state
   authorities that have limited options to generally restrict press
   freedom. Where local governments are elected, negative reporting could
   mean that local politicians lose power and influence, especially if they
   are involved in corrupt practices. Analyzing new global data on
   journalist killings that identify the perpetrator and visibility of the
   journalist, we show that local-level elections carry an inherent risk,
   particularly for less visible journalists. Killings perpetrated by
   criminal groups follow a similar pattern to those by state authorities,
   pointing to possible connections between these groups. Our study shows
   that without effective monitoring and accountability, national
   democratic institutions alone are unable to effectively protect
   journalists from any perpetrator.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the twists of the construction process of the human
   rights violation problem, as a social problem, that occurred in Chile
   during the 1973-1990 civic and military dictatorship, that required a
   response from the State. For this, we analyze the discourses present in
   the debate on transitional justice in the public arena, developed in the
   country from the transition to democracy, based on the social
   constructionist approach and the model of the natural history of social
   problems. The analysis allows us to glimpse the various
   conceptualizations that have been delineating the public debate around
   the notions of truth and justice and their articulation in transitional
   public policies. The conclusions point to the decisive role of the human
   rights movement in promoting alternative responses and contribute to
   making victims visible as active actors in the political arena.},

Title = {Mobilization and Countermobilization: The Effect of Candidate Visits on
   Campaign Donations in the 2016 Presidential Election},

Abstract = {Political scientists studying the impact of campaign visits by
   presidential candidates have come to conflicting conclusions on whether
   campaigns change voter behavior in even small ways. In this article, we
   argue that, while scholars have generally interpreted campaign effect
   results as being unidirectional, the traditional metrics of such
   effects-polls and aggregate vote results-inherently reflect a net effect
   combining any potential mobilization of candidates' supporters, offset
   by any countermobilization of their opponents. If such
   countermobilization occurs, weak or null findings in the campaign
   effects literature may understate or miss the true impact of campaign
   activities on voter behavior. To assess whether campaign visits produce
   mixed effects, we measure the extent to which visits by presidential and
   vice presidential candidates in the 2016 presidential election produced
   increases in campaign donations in the immediate aftermath of a visit.
   Our results show that visits by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
   inspired their supporters to donate more money than they otherwise would
   have. However, we also find a considerable level of countermobilization:
   visits by both Trump and Clinton resulted in an increase in donations to
   the opposing presidential campaign.},

Abstract = {What strategies are behind major powers' decisions to deploy forces
   abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to
   create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the
   world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals
   from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in
   which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic
   response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This
   theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional
   clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We
   test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local
   structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each
   troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by
   ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Elite partisan polarization has been found to have several potentially
   problematic effects on citizens, such as creating political distrust and
   different types of polarization among partisans. However, it remains
   unclear whether these effects are caused by the parties moving apart in
   terms of issue positions (issue polarization) or by the rise of
   disrespectful rhetoric (incivility). In the literature, these two
   dimensions of elite polarization often appear to affect citizens in
   similar ways, but typical research designs have not been well suited to
   disentangling their effects. To determine their unique effects, four
   studies have been conducted using original designs and a mix of
   experimental and observational data. The results show that issue
   polarization and incivility have clearly distinct effects. A more
   uncivil tone lowers political trust, but increasing issue polarization
   does not. Conversely, only issue polarization creates attitude
   polarization among partisans. Both aspects of elite polarization create
   affective polarization.},

Title = {When Think Tanks Refuse Thinking: Why American Pro-Market Conservatives
   Oppose Market Integration},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-252},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {American pro-market conservatives often oppose use of federal authority
   to rein in anti-competitive behavior by market actors. Competitive
   barriers, whether created by local jurisdictions or the absence of
   national competitive rules, go unaddressed. In international comparison,
   especially considering the European Union's use of central authority for
   market openness, this is quite puzzling. Based on interviews and
   archival research, I trace inattention to market barriers to
   contradictions within Hayek's neoliberalism and an enthusiastic
   reception within the American academy of one possible interpretation of
   those writings. This conception of markets-competitive
   federalism-diffused into the conservative law and economics movements,
   think tanks, and eventually mainstream conservative politics. It
   permitted conservatism to align a strong pro-market rhetoric with
   demands for states' rights and federal retrenchment, albeit
   side-stepping many significant issues in economic theory and policy.
   Thus, conservatives pursue spending and tax cuts, deregulation and
   decentralization, often to the detriment of market openness.},

Abstract = {Recent literature in race, ethnicity, and politics has assessed how
   minority linked fate, defined as ``the idea that ethnoracial minorities
   might share a sense of commonality that extends beyond their particular
   ethnoracial group to other ethnoracial groups (Gershon et al., in
   Politics Groups Identities 7(3):642-653, 2019),{''} shapes attitudes
   toward descriptive representation and support for coalition building.
   However, scholarship has yet to examine the influence of minority linked
   fate on political participation. We argue that similar to those who view
   the interests of co-ethnics as a proxy for their individual interests,
   Latina/os, Asian Americans, and African Americans who express linked
   fate with a more expansive minority community are more likely to take
   political action. This political participation results from senses of
   obligation to and solidarity with other racial minorities outside of
   their own. Results from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election
   Survey show that controlling for conventional measures of linked fate,
   minority linked fate is associated primarily with more
   system-challenging modes of political activity for Latina/os, Asian
   Americans, and African Americans. We conclude by positioning minority
   linked fate as a complementary heuristic to traditional notions of
   intra-racial linked fate and note how shared inter-racial linked fate
   informs our understanding of recent political activism among people of
   color.},

Abstract = {This study tests the explanatory strength of the party-centered theory
   of electoral campaign professionalism. The theory was previously subject
   to testing in various types of elections during the first decade of the
   new millennium, covering Germany, Austria, Sweden, and Finland.
   Nevertheless, empirical research in this field has been on hold for
   almost a decade, obstructing the development of the theory during a time
   when politics and political campaigns have taken new paths. In this
   article, the theory is revisited, presenting results from a unique time
   series study covering 48 party campaigns between 2009 and 2019 in three
   consecutive European parliamentary elections in two multiparty
   democracies, Sweden and Finland. Our results provide weak support for
   the party-centered theory of campaign professionalism in the form it was
   originally operationalized. Only a centralized party organization and a
   large support base with a catch-all strategy were found to be
   statistically significant predictors of campaign professionalism.},

Abstract = {Irregular migrants tend to live in dense urban settings. Cities
   therefore formulate various policies in support of irregular migrants.
   Given the US phenomenon of sanctuary cities, the study of these policies
   has been rather US-centric so far. This letter examines urban policies
   in support of irregular migrants in Europe's 95 largest cities. Only 27
   per cent of European cities formulate these types of policies. We
   discovered two relevant policy categories: status and services. Only
   five cities formulate policies that aim to award irregular migrants with
   a (more) secure status, and 24 cities formulate policies that facilitate
   access to city services. Our mixed-methods analysis suggests that status
   policies take advantage of policy-making discretion whereas service
   policies hinge on the availability of local resources. Yet, there are no
   simple explanations for the observed policy diversity that is the
   product of place-based policy-making.},

Abstract = {While the 2020 Democratic field was touted as one of the most diverse in
   presidential nomination history, a white, male, heterosexual candidate
   ultimately won the nomination. This is, on its face, surprising, as we
   might expect less sexism and more enthusiasm for diverse candidates
   among Democratic voters. To help explain this outcome, we refocus
   attention on the ``third-person effect{''} and the anticipated reactions
   of others to a female candidate, rather than voters own individual
   beliefs in two ways. First, we demonstrate that attitudes about female
   presidential candidates still follow third-person effect predictions;
   individuals attribute socially desirable attitudes to themselves and
   less so more distant others (i.e. ``Americans{''}). Second, we analyze
   how voters take into account perceived potential gender bias by others,
   which in turn influences female candidates' perceived electability
   (likely support from other voters). Gendered electability then has
   measurable impacts on preference for female candidates, as they
   strategically choose the more electable candidate. Overall, these
   results demonstrate looking at the anticipated gender bias of others,
   rather than just an individual's attitudes, can be helpful in explaining
   the continued perception of female presidential candidates as less
   electable and, ultimately, why women have not yet broken the highest
   glass ceiling.},

Abstract = {Is there a gender gap barrier against the career advancement of women
   researchers in Mexico? To explore possible answers to this question, we
   review the specialized literature, based on the ``sticky floor{''} and
   ``glass ceiling{''} conceptual framework, and then offer an empirical
   approach to test whether such a gap exists as well as some theoretical
   reasons that could explain it. We analyzed a massive dataset of 41,000
   members of the National System of Researchers (SNI) under the National
   Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) in Mexico from 1991 to 2017.
   To test determinants of advancement, we consider gender, areas of
   knowledge, states in which researchers reside, years in which initial
   applications and promotions took place, and universities to which
   researchers belong to. We found that there is a similar chance to
   advance from the lower levels of the system, following the sticky floor
   analogy, but women make a little progress after these initial levels
   when compared to men, in line with the glass ceiling idea. We also offer
   additional research avenues in this topic, due to another important
   finding, which reveals that 62\% of researchers never make progress at
   the level in which they initially join.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first comprehensive analysis of how parties
   across 28 countries use digital political marketing on Facebook by
   drawing on the example of the 2019 European Parliament election. We
   introduce a theoretical model of political Facebook marketing and
   compare the paid media activity (sponsored posts, ads) of 186 parties to
   their owned media (posts) and earned media (user reactions, comments,
   shares). Our results concerning cross-country patterns indicate that
   differences in European parties' paid media activity exist and only a
   few parties leverage sophisticated targeting strategies. Regarding
   temporal dynamics, we find that paid media is used to supplement owned
   media during similar campaign phases. In terms of engagement-triggering
   effects, we show that sponsoring posts is a suitable tool to increase
   earned media. Overall, paid media activity on Facebook is largely
   embedded into parties' overall marketing strategy and national
   countries' regulatory settings. Our results have implications for the
   understanding of public opinion, voting behaviour and the regulations of
   elections in modern European democracies.},

   conclusions show that 65\% of the offices adopt specific strategies for
   each type of social media, although there is a wider principle, which is
   the constitution of multi-networks, in a coordinated and complementary
   way. Within these strategies, the disclosure regarding the
   parliamentarian's own actions and the agenda of their electoral bases is

Abstract = {The Global IR research agenda lays emphasis on the marginalised,
   non-Western forms of power and knowledge that underpin today's
   international system. Focusing on Africa, this article questions two
   fundamental assumptions of this approach, arguing that they err by
   excess of realism in two different ways. First, the claim that Africa is
   marginal to international relations (IR) thinking holds true only as
   long as one makes the whole of IR discipline coincide with the Realist
   school. Second, the Global IR commitment to better appreciate
   `non-Western' contributions is ontologically realist, because it fails
   to recognise that the West and the non-West are dialectically
   constitutive of one another. To demonstrate this, the article first
   shows that Africa has moved from the periphery to the core of IR
   scholarship: in the post-paradigmatic phase, Africa is no longer a mere
   provider of deviant cases, but a laboratory for theory-building of
   general validity. In the second part, the Sahel provides a case for
   unsettling reified conceptions of Africa's conceptual and geographical
   boundaries through the dialectical articulation of the inside/outside
   dichotomy. Questioning the `place' of Africa in IR both as identity and
   function thus paves the way to a `less realist' approach to Global IR.},

Abstract = {The article scrutinizes COVID-19-related state of emergency which tested
   and hence exposed vulnerability of certain values of liberal democracy
   where it has been fragile. It opened a window of opportunity for
   governments to operate in a political non-law realm through introduction
   of state emergency measures. Georgia was no exception, its political
   space has been particularly affected by the COVID-19-related state of
   emergency. Hence the research is interested in why the state emergency
   was damaging for democracy in Georgia? The article argues that by
   introduction of state of emergency the Georgian Dream government ushered
   Georgia-a hybrid democracy with rather limited history of power-sharing
   and weak democratic institutions-in a ``state of exception,{''} in a
   sense put forward by Carl Schmitt. This political act further flattened
   political diversity through limiting the space for political pluralism.},

   Reconstituting the Second Chamber as a Randomly Selected Assembly},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The two traditional justifications for bicameralism are that a second
   legislative chamber serves a legislative-review function (enhancing the
   quality of legislation) and a balancing function (checking concentrated
   power and protecting minorities). I furnish here a third justification
   for bicameralism, with one elected chamber and the second selected by
   lot, as an institutional compromise between contradictory imperatives
   facing representative democracy: elections are a mechanism of people's
   political agency and of accountability, but run counter to political
   equality and impartiality, and are insufficient for satisfactory
   responsiveness; sortition is a mechanism for equality and impartiality,
   and of enhancing responsiveness, but not of people's political agency or
   of holding representatives accountable. Whereas the two traditional
   justifications initially grew out of anti-egalitarian premises (about
   the need for elite wisdom and to protect the elite few against the
   many), the justification advanced here is grounded in egalitarian
   premises about the need to protect state institutions from capture by
   the powerful few and to treat all subjects as political equals.
   Reflecting the ``political{''} turn in political theory, I embed this
   general argument within the institutional context of Canadian
   parliamentary federalism, arguing that Canada's Senate ought to be
   reconstituted as a randomly selected citizen assembly.},

Abstract = {Published in 1964, the result of one of Aron's four cycles of university
   lectures dedicated to ``industrial society{''} between 1955 and 1958, La
   lutte de classes is - as the author himself admitted - one of his best
   works from a scientific point of view. In the book, the concept of
   ``class struggle{''}, used by Marxists as the main interpretative key of
   the economic and social transformations generated by industrialism,
   undergoes a radical critique. According to Aron, it was a political,
   ideological and metaphysical formula, which was not very useful from the
   point of view of sociological research. In order to understand the
   structure and the dynamics of industrial societies, it is instead more
   useful to reflect on the concepts of ``ruling class{''} or ``ruling
   minority{''} and the way how, within such societies, power is
   distributed, as well as how the relationships between social groups are
   structured. What Aron offers in this book is therefore an original
   re-elaboration of the theory of the elites.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {443-462},

Abstract = {Dating back to the Risorgimento, the project of creating the ``new
   Italians{''} occupied a central role in fascist politics, as a legacy of
   the Italianist movements of the early 20th century: imperialist
   nationalism, futurism, and revolutionary syndicalism. Among those who
   put forward proposals to implement this anthropological revolution was
   Count Vincenzo Fani Ciotti (1888-1927), better known under the futurist
   pseudonym Volt. After tracing his political evolution from the late
   1910s to the mid-1920s, the essay aims to reconstruct Volt's distinctive
   aristocratic version of fascist social engineering plan, through the
   analysis of both his articles in periodical press and his unpublished
   papers.},

Title = {Candidate Preference, State Context, and Voter Turnout: Comparing
   Non-Voters and Voters in the 2016 Presidential Election},

Abstract = {While much attention has been paid to understanding the drivers of
   support for Donald Trump, less focus has been placed on understanding
   the factors that led individuals to turn out and vote or stay home. This
   paper compares non-voters and voters in the 2016 election and explores
   how self-reported candidate preference prior to the election predicted
   turnout across three different state contexts: (1) all states, (2)
   closely contested states won by Trump, and (3) closely contested states
   won by Clinton. We find that preference for both candidates predicted
   turnout in the aggregate (all states) and in closely contested states
   won by Clinton, but only preference for Trump predicted turnout in the
   closely contested states won by Trump. Moreover, we find that political
   interest is negatively associated with preference for Clinton when
   examining candidate preferences among non-voters. Our analysis suggests
   that non-voters in the 2016 election held meaningful candidate
   preferences that impacted voter turnout but that state context played an
   important role in this relationship. This study sheds light on an
   understudied component of the 2016 election, the attitudes and behavior
   of non- voters, as well as points to the importance of incorporating
   contextual variation in future work on electoral behavior and voter
   turnout.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to an
   unprecedented crisis of global proportions that led to the blockade of
   vital components of social action on a scale that threatened
   international and national security. The pandemic has demonstrated the
   potential to evolve and generate a wider range of threats and has opened
   up essential questions of understanding the security and security
   organization of states. It is a threat to which, although recognized in
   most strategic security documents, the response of national and
   international security systems has not been successfully defined within
   the still dominant understanding of security based on traditional
   security studies. It has been shown that security systems are still
   determined by a traditional concept that does not fully identify the
   causes of threats and crises and their correlations, which increases
   uncertainty and negatively affects the normative and institutional
   capacity needed to respond effectively to crises. The paper is based on
   the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a security
   paradigm shift that challenges the scientific community and
   policy-makers to define new approaches and new methods of researching
   security phenomena and strategic modelling of security systems and
   crisis management nationally and globally. The paper will therefore
   analyse the impact of the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on
   understanding security through an analysis of the threats it has
   generated and defining the correlation between theoretical knowledge and
   practical crisis management experiences.},

Title = {Are Tax Cuts Supporters Self-Interested and/or Partisan? The Case of the

Abstract = {In late 2017, the first unified Republican government in 15 years
   enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cut taxes for corporations and
   the wealthy. Why did so many citizens support a policy that primarily
   benefited people richer than them? The self-interest hypothesis holds
   that individuals act upon the position they occupy in the income
   distribution: richer (poorer) taxpayers should favor (oppose) regressive
   policy. Associations between income and policy preferences are often
   inconsistent, however, suggesting that many citizens fail to connect
   their self-interest to taxation. Indeed, political psychologists have
   shown compellingly that citizens can be guided by partisan
   considerations not necessarily aligned with their own interests. This
   article assesses public support for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
   Using data from the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study as
   well as contemporaneous ANES and VOTER surveys to replicate our
   analyses, we show that self-interest and partisanship both come into
   play, but that partisanship matters more. Personal financial
   considerations, while less influential than party identification, are
   relevant for two groups of individuals: Republicans and the politically
   unsophisticated.},

Abstract = {Party membership seems to lose relevance for political careers in many
   established democracies. Increasing numbers of parties are recruiting
   non-members as candidates. Yet, what are the implications of a lack of
   long-term party membership for party cohesion? In this paper, I argue
   that pre-parliamentary party membership is in fact crucial for cohesion.
   Using data from the Comparative Candidate Survey and voting behavior of
   ca. 2,000 MPs of the German Bundestag on free votes from 1953 to 2013, I
   examine the effect of length of previous party membership and the age of
   joining the party on indicators of party cohesion. Examining free votes
   allows for credibly controlling alternative explanations of unified
   voting behavior. Results are in line with expectations generated from
   social identity theory and underscore the importance of party membership
   for party cohesion. The paper concludes with a discussion on the
   findings' implications in light of recent developments in parties'
   candidate recruitment.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Marx's conviction that the expansion of the
   capitalist mode of production was a basic prerequisite for the birth of
   communist society. It overviews this idea through the whole of Marx's
   oeuvre, from his early political writings to the studies of the last
   decade. Particular relevance is given to the analysis of Capital and its
   preparatory manuscripts, where Marx highlighted in depth the fundamental
   relationship between the productive growth generated by the capitalist
   mode of production and the preconditions for the communist society for
   which the workers' movement must struggle. Finally, the article shows
   that in the end of his life-for example when he studied the possible
   developments of the rural commune (obshchina) in Russia-Marx did not
   change his basic ideas about the profile of future communist society, as
   he sketched it from the Grundrisse on. Guided by hostility to schematism
   he thought it might be possible that the revolution would break out in
   forms and conditions that had never been considered before.},

Abstract = {Agency and representation are viewed as preconditions for democratic
   action. The dominant understanding of agency and representation is
   defined in terms of certain capacities and abilities that are considered
   to constitute the basis of personhood. The article will put into
   question this understanding and the assumptions that underpin it and
   argue that it rests on a mistaken conception of human animality - one
   that reduces the self to an autonomous and disembodied rational mind.
   The article will also suggest that it is problematic because it
   marginalizes more than human forms of life - as well as those of us who
   are differently human - and excludes their points of view from the
   political processes of world making. In contrast, I will put forward an
   understanding of agency and representation that is attuned to the
   relational dimensions of all life on earth. By paying attention to the
   semiotic propensities that all forms of life share - which entails
   considering nonlinguistic forms of communication - this article responds
   to the need for more radically democratic ways of listening, giving
   voice, and caring for the earth's beings and the relations that form the
   conditions for life to flourish.},

Abstract = {East Asia is increasingly at the centre of debates among International
   Relations (iR) scholars. China's political, economic, and military
   ascendency is increasingly considered as a crucial test case for main
   approaches to IR. Despite this renewed attention, mainstream theories
   employed to analyse contemporary Asia are still remarkably Euro-centric.
   A wave of studies has argued in favour of a broad `decolonization' of
   theoretical concepts used to analyse East Asia as well as other regions.
   These efforts have produced several distinct research agendas. Firstly,
   critical and post-colonial theorists have worked on the par destruens,
   highlighting the inherent Euro-centrism of many IR concepts and
   theories. Secondly, scholars such as Buzan and Acharya have promoted the
   idea of Global IR, seeking to advance a `non-Western' and
   non-Euro-centric research agenda. This agenda has found fertile ground
   especially in China, where several scholars have tried to promote a
   Chinese School of IR. This article has three main purposes. Firstly, it
   briefly explores the issue of Eurocentrism in IR studies dedicated to
   East Asia. Secondly, it maps the theoretical debates aimed at overcoming
   it, looking in particular at the `Global IR' research programme and the
   so-called Chinese School. Finally, it sketches a few other possible
   avenues of research for a very much needed cooperation between Global IR
   and area studies.},

Title = {Time matters: civic engagement and the development of anti-immigrant
   attitudes among adolescents},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {A recurring claim in the literature is that civic engagement in
   voluntary associations is crucial for the formation of a variety of
   interpersonal attitudes, such as social trust, tolerance, and
   intolerance. In this article, we study the role of membership in
   voluntary associations and volunteer work in the development of
   anti-immigrant attitudes among adolescents. Using a four-wave
   longitudinal design with a target sample comprising approximately 2000
   adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 at the first measurement
   occasion, this study contributes to previous research by analysing the
   impact on anti-immigrant attitudes of different dimensions of membership
   in voluntary associations and volunteer work. The results showed that
   membership in voluntary associations and volunteer work over several
   years serve to decrease anti-immigrant attitudes among adolescents over
   time. In addition, volunteering over several years seems to have a
   somewhat stronger impact on anti-immigrant attitudes than do various
   aspects of membership in associations. Our study also shows that
   anti-immigrant attitudes become more firmly established with age and
   that membership in only certain types of voluntary associations relates
   to attitudes toward immigrants. In sum, this study contributes to
   previous research focusing on the role of civic engagement in the
   development of interpersonal attitudes.},

Title = {Partisan Polarization Is the Primary Psychological Motivation behind
   Political Fake News Sharing on Twitter},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {The rise of ``fake news{''} is a major concern in contemporary Western
   democracies. Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the
   spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited.
   Are citizens who share fake news ignorant and lazy? Are they fueled by
   sinister motives, seeking to disrupt the social status quo? Or do they
   seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly polarized political
   environment? This article is the first to test these competing
   hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over
   2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and
   sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The
   findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support
   for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan
   polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their
   political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and
   selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents.
   Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same
   psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior,
   including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news
   sources.},

Abstract = {Political parties are likely to hold differing views about employment
   protection legislation (EPL). While pro-welfare parties could support
   EPL, pro-market parties might focus on labour market deregulation. In
   this paper, we investigate empirically whether partisan politics,
   especially the government participation of Social democrats and
   Christian democrats, matter for EPL in 21 established OECD countries
   from 1985 to 2019. We show that during the golden age of the welfare
   state, the level of EPL was much higher where Social and Christian
   democrats dominated the government than elsewhere. After the golden age
   and under conditions of high unemployment, these unconditional effects
   mostly disappeared. Instead, the level of unemployment conditions
   partisan differences. Christian democrats liberalize EPL for regular
   employment significantly less than other parties under high levels of
   unemployment. In contrast, Social democrats defend high levels of EPL
   for regular and temporary employment when unemployment is low. Against
   expectations, they even liberalize employment protection for labour
   market insiders more than other parties at very high levels of
   unemployment.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to explain how the political forces in Moldova
   used the issue of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve their
   particular goals. The instrumentalization of the fight against the
   pandemic was particularly visible as an element of the political rivalry
   preceding the presidential election. The analysis of social data
   confirms that the pandemic situation has become another field of
   competition in the internal policy of the state, as is customary in
   Moldova during crises.},

Abstract = {There have been three recent English Westminster by-elections, in
   Hartlepool, Chesham and Amersham, and Batley and Spen. Each of these
   seats illustrates a different type of party competition and so taken
   together allow a picture of how voters' preferences are evolving in the
   post-Brexit and post-pandemic world. This article places each of these
   by-elections into a longer-term perspective, looking at the underlying
   political changes that have driven the different results. The decline of
   party identification over this period means that voters are less
   attached to parties than in the past, more willing to vote for smaller
   parties and as a result, less predictable in their behaviour. Each of
   the by-elections highlights the behaviour of a different group of
   voters, related to both Brexit and other social identities. The results
   suggest that we should continue to expect the unexpected when the
   British electorate goes to the polls, as voting behaviour becomes
   influenced by complex combinations of values, identities and interests.},

Abstract = {Elected officials routinely do not reflect the racial diversity of the
   citizenry. In Latin America, these descriptive gaps are particularly
   pronounced. A growing number of studies investigate the causes of racial
   disparities in representation, however, extant research largely focuses
   on national assemblies. In this paper, I extend this well-trod line of
   research to an understudied context, local elections. Using a dataset
   that covers mayoral elections in Brazil, I demonstrate that multiple
   factors hinder Afro-Brazilians, who comprise a majority of the Brazilian
   population, from winning public office. I show that barriers to
   candidate entry, resource disparities between white and Afro-Brazilian
   candidates, and race-based preferences among voters contribute to racial
   inequality in political representation. These results indicate that
   members of marginalized racial groups often must overcome multiple
   barriers to achieve electoral success.},

Abstract = {By drawing a division between citizens and noncitizens, migration
   policies speak to implicit definitions of what makes a good citizen.
   Commonly accepted definitions of citizenship are produced not only
   through explicit political discourse but also through the everyday
   actions of state agencies. The selection of the ``worthy{''} migrants
   that those street-level bureaucracies operate is deeply rooted in
   interpretations of the nation's boundaries. In this article, I examine
   this everyday production of citizenship and nationhood by focusing on
   the case of Polish migration policies approached through the lens of an
   ethnographic study of street-level bureaucracies. While the rapid
   politicization of immigration in this country since 2015 resembles a
   major shift, an inquiry into the practices of policy implementation
   invites interrogations concerning continuities between past and present
   state practices, as well as concerning the definitions of citizens and
   of ``worthy{''} immigrants that were and are prevalent within Polish
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Adequately financed branches contribute to the integration of regional
   interests into statewide parties. Yet, we have limited knowledge about
   the determinants of branches' varying income levels in federal contexts.
   To address this shortage, this article elucidates why branches receive
   donations from citizens and businesses to different degrees. I
   hypothesise that party competition at the state level, the difference in
   regional economic performance and parties' historical legacies can
   account for the level of branches' donation revenue. Analysing German
   statewide party branches' income from 2009 to 2017, this study finds
   support for the facilitating impact of state and federal electoral
   contests on donation levels. Regional economic disparities, by contrast,
   only marginally affect donation revenues. At the same time, parties'
   path-dependent developments help explain asymmetries in average revenue
   levels between western and eastern branches. The study's findings
   suggest that intense regional party competition contributes to branches'
   financial independence within the statewide party organisation.},

Abstract = {National governments regularly balance concerns of transparency and
   access to information against the need for information security and
   confidentiality. Increased government transparency can inform the public
   of the reasons underlying government decisions and can promote the
   participation of outside parties and actors. However, increased
   transparency can uncover wrongdoing that can lead to embarrassment or
   legal action against government actors. This project explores the
   implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and analyzes how
   politicization affects aggregate federal executive branch transparency.
   Utilizing FOIA initial disposition data across the Bush II and Obama
   administrations, I find a complex relationship between politicization,
   as indicated by aggregate appointee presence within an agency, and FOIA
   requests outcomes. I find that increased politicization is associated
   with a higher proportion of responses, noting that agencies were not
   able to locate responsive FOIA records. However, I find less evidence
   that politicization affects the aggregate amount of information released
   to requesters from retrieved records.},

Abstract = {What explains the backlash against the liberal international order? Are
   its causes economic or cultural? We argue that while cultural values are
   central to understanding the backlash, those values are, in part,
   endogenous and shaped by long-run economic change. Using an original
   survey of the British population, we show that individuals living in
   regions where the local labor market was more substantially affected by
   imports from China have significantly more authoritarian values and that
   this relationship is driven by the effect of economic change on
   authoritarian aggression. This result is consistent with a
   frustration-aggression mechanism by which large economic shocks hinder
   individuals' expected attainment of their goals. This study provides a
   theoretical mechanism that helps to account for the opinions and
   behaviors of Leave voters in the 2016 UK referendum who in seeking the
   authoritarian values of order and conformity desired to reduce
   immigration and ``take back control{''} of policymaking.},

Abstract = {How do accounting practices interact with processes of state
   transformation? Focusing on the privatisation of social housing in the
   UK, we clarify an important mechanism through which accounting practices
   served to constitute material incentives in favour of privatisation. Our
   archival research demonstrates that the UK government's atypical
   practice of including public corporations' liabilities in its own debt
   calculations shaped discussions and decisions over the transfer of
   public housing stock to non-state Housing Associations in the 1980s. By
   unpacking the constitutive relationship between accounting practices and
   material incentives, we advance and bring together scholarship on state
   transformation and the politics of accounting.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on clientelism views the distribution of state
   jobs in the same way it does other forms of clientelistic exchange: as a
   mechanism of political mobilization. Despite its prevalence, this
   perspective does not account for the services that job recipients
   frequently provide to their political principals beyond the one-time
   exchange of political support. Drawing on extensive data from Benin and
   Ghana, including a comprehensive database of minister biographies,
   surveys of bureaucrats, administrative data, and elite interviews, this
   article argues that leaders distribute and manage state jobs in ways
   that enable them to extract and control state money for political
   financing. Whether incumbent leaders extract state resources themselves,
   delegate to elite party agents, or co-opt and coerce bureaucrats to
   divert money to the party shapes which jobs they distribute politically
   and to whom. The findings suggest that jobs are substantively different

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel conceptualization of democratic
   resilience - a two-stage process where democracies avoid democratic
   declines altogether or avert democratic breakdown given that such
   autocratization is ongoing. Drawing on the Episodes of Regime
   Transformation (ERT) dataset, we find that democracies have had a high
   level of resilience to onset of autocratization since 1900.
   Nevertheless, democratic resilience has become substantially weaker
   since the end of the Cold War. Fifty-nine episodes of sustained and
   substantial declines in democratic practices have occurred since 1993,
   leading to the unprecedented breakdown of 36 democratic regimes.
   Ominously, we find that once autocratization begins, only one in five
   democracies manage to avert breakdown. We also analyse which factors are
   associated with each stage of democratic resilience. The results suggest
   that democracies are more resilient when strong judicial constraints on
   the executive are present and democratic institutions were strong in the
   past. Conversely and adding nuance to the literature, economic
   development is only associated with resilience to onset of
   autocratization, not to resilience against breakdown once
   autocratization has begun.},

Abstract = {This article analyses political business cycles (PBCs) in ten former
   European communist countries. The dataset used covers the period
   1990-2018. The results show that the PBCs manifest themselves in these
   countries through both fiscal and monetary policy. Changes in government
   expenditure during election times are found to be significant in
   reducing unemployment. Hence, it signals that there is a politically
   driven fiscal expansion. The results also show the importance of
   institutional quality in reducing the effects of the PBCs. The monetary
   policy models indicate that changes in money stock during and around
   election times affect the unemployment rate. Undertaking a subsample
   analysis of the non-EU and EU members highlights the case that the
   membership of the EU is an important factor in preventing the
   development of PBCs.},

Title = {Issue politicization and social class: How the electoral supply

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Against premature claims about the declining political relevance of
   social class in post-industrial democracies, recent research indicates
   that class continues to be a relevant determinant of political
   preferences. In post-industrial societies `old' class divides on
   economic issues coexist with `new' class alignments on cultural topics.
   While there is cumulated evidence of social classes' distinct placement
   on these issues, this paper argues that the strength of class divides
   depends on the extent to which these issues are politicized by political
   parties. Studying preferences on economic and cultural issues (attitudes
   towards redistribution, immigration, gay rights and European
   integration), this study shows that class divides in preferences are
   context dependent. The multilevel analyses drawing on data from the
   European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey for 27 European
   democracies demonstrate that classes' differences in preferences are
   accentuated on issues strongly contested and emphasized by parties, and
   mitigated on issues where party conflict is weaker. Adding to recent
   literature on parties and class conflict, this study identifies another
   stage at which parties can affect the strength of class voting. The
   varying strength of class divides across contexts also has implications
   for parties' ability to garner support beyond a single class. This
   becomes increasingly unlikely in contexts of high issue politicization.},

Abstract = {Does political office cause worse or better longevity prospects? Two
   perspectives in the literature offer contradicting answers. First,
   increased income, social status, and political connections obtained
   through holding office can increase longevity. Second, increased stress
   and working hours associated with holding office can have detrimental
   effects on longevity. To provide causal evidence, we exploit a
   regression discontinuity design with unique data on the longevity of
   candidates for US gubernatorial office. The results show that
   politicians winning a close election live 5-10 years longer than
   candidates who lose.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is a familiar mantra of American politics that the best response to
   dangerous speech that incites violence and spreads hate is `more
   speech'. Yet the principle obscures at least three crucial questions.
   Who, in particular, is to undertake the counter-speech that the doctrine
   recommends? What, exactly, are they required to do? And why is it
   morally justified to demand that they do it? This article argues that if
   citizens are to rely on counter-speech to defuse the dangers of
   dangerous expression, it is not enough to cheerlead its abstract
   importance and then sit back and hope for the best. Someone needs to do
   the work, and do it well. The article defends the thesis that all
   citizens have a moral duty to engage in counter-speech against dangerous
   expression. Focusing on counter-speech against expression that
   implicitly or explicitly advocates wrongful criminal violence, it argues
   that these duties can be derived from a much more basic normative
   source: the samaritan obligation, held by all moral agents, to rescue
   others from risks of harm. The specification of these duties' content,
   however, depends upon interdisciplinary work that integrates normative
   theory with social scientific research on human communication.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to reveal political and legal aspects at
   international level in the field of citizens' participation in the fight
   against crime. Attention is paid to the most common forms of public
   participation: patrolling; provide information on criminals or criminal
   acts committed; participation in anti-corruption measures; assistance in
   the resocialization of offenders; aiding victims of crime; strengthening
   the security of one's own property; participation in information on
   anti-criminal measures. Methodologically it is a documentary research.
   In conclusion, the benefits of public participation in crime prevention,
   based on international crime prevention, can be divided into two groups:
   basic and additional. The main advantages are reduction of crime and
   delinquency; improve security in relevant areas of cities; reducing
   citizens' fear of crime; strengthening the service function of the
   police forces in relation to the inhabitants of territorial communities;
   improve police partnerships with the public.},

Abstract = {How does armed conflict affect attitudes that tolerate violence against
   women? This article examines the effects of armed violence on
   preferences for punishing crimes against women using original
   quantitative data from 80 focus groups across 20 villages in Democratic
   Republic of Congo and a matched pair design. Challenging unidirectional
   logics within theories of violence against women, the data reveal that
   local exposure to armed violence increases how severely men prefer to
   punish rape while decreasing how severely men and women prefer to punish
   domestic violence. Building inductively, I develop a theory of
   protective masculine norms to account for armed conflict's gendered and
   crime-specific effects. When armed violence heightens demand for local
   male protection, crimes perceived to pose a community threat are
   affected differently from ``private{''} crimes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the formation and survival of presidential cabinets
   in Colombia between 1958 and 2018. We compare two periods in the
   country's political history: During the first period, 1958 to 1990,
   Colombia operated with a two-party system. The second period, 1991 to
   the present, is characterized by the opening of the political regime to
   new parties and the formation of coalition governments. For this
   purpose, we use semi-parametric models and Cox regressions that allow us
   to estimate the survival of 581 ministerial appointments and identify
   the predictors of survival in their positions from both individual
   characteristics of the ministers and the institutional characteristics
   of the system. The study shows that the stability in the position of
   ministers during the bipartisan era is lower than the duration of
   ministers during the period of coalition governments.},

Title = {The Liberal Party of Paraguay: Reorganization, Internal Crisis and

Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},
Year = {2021},
Number = {42},
Pages = {87-118},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The Liberal Party of Paraguay is the oldest party organization in the
   country and one of the oldest in the region. During the dictatorships of
   the 20th century, the party was persecuted, outlawed and encouraged to
   multiple divisions. Once the dictatorship of general Stroessner (1989)
   fell and the transition to democracy began, liberalism then divided into
   five parties - had to quickly reorganize itself to compete for national
   and sub-national positions. Despite the doubts and uncertainties
   regarding its chances of becoming competitive, the electoral results
   soon showed that the party organization knew how to adapt to the new
   democratic challenges.
   This work explores, in an electoral key, the process of reorganization
   and adaptation of Paraguayan liberalism between 1989 and 2021, dividing
   party history into three stages: (i) party reorganization (1989-1998);
   (ii) factional struggle, alliances and government (1999-2013); and (iii)
   return to opposition and party stability (2013-2021). It shows how
   internal instability and lack of cohesion is capable of generating
   external crises (being one of the causes of Lugo's downfall), while,
   inside, it serves as a source of vitality from its wide range of
   possible liberal options.},

   order to publicize the history of the accident and its impact on

   experience was carried out at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Manresa

   Early Childhood Education, in the subject of Art Tuition II. Using
   Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) and artistic creation, we propose from

   foster dynamics of action that not only promote awareness and
   reflection, but also allow structuring student concerns regarding

   Evidence From a Survey Experiment in Argentina},

Abstract = {Standard theories in comparative political economy predict that labor
   market insiders oppose redistribution to poorer, often informal, labor
   market outsiders. In contrast, I argue that not all insiders oppose
   redistribution to outsiders. Extending recent work emphasizing the
   importance of economic insecurity for insiders, I argue that exposure to
   risk leads to greater polarization regarding preferences for
   non-contributory social policy between low- and high-skilled insiders. I
   test implications of this logic using a survey experiment from a
   nationally representative sample in Argentina and complement this with
   analysis of observational data for 16 Latin American countries. I find
   strong evidence of polarization regarding preferences over social
   protection among low- and high-skilled insiders. The experiment reveals
   that low (high)-skilled insiders primed about the risk of becoming
   outsiders become more supportive of transfers to outsiders (insiders).
   The article provides new micro-foundations for insider-outsider
   coalitions in support of social policy expansion in middle-income
   countries.},

Abstract = {During recent years media discussion over the gravity of climate change
   has increased rapidly. One of the most used bywords has been `carbon
   footprint', a concept with a moral appeal to global responsibility and a
   sense of global environmental togetherness. However, `carbon footprint
   responsibility' cannot be separated from nationalistically loaded
   affects and their representations but instead it has effected new
   articulations that support state-centric ideologies, offering a fresh
   starting point for re-conceptualizing the theories of nationalism. This
   article analyses how the Finnish media constructs a contradictory
   discourse in which the moral debate over carbon footprint responsibility
   merges with nationalistically loaded argumentation.},

Abstract = {Throughout his presidency, Barack Obama promoted open government and
   transparency at home and abroad as instruments of American soft power.
   President Obama sought to improve the American people's confidence in
   democracy by making the executive branch of the national government more
   open and transparent. Through the power of its example, Obama further
   sought to encourage other countries to do the same and want what America
   wants: the strengthening of liberal democracy globally, greater openness
   and transparency in international relations generally, and reinvigorated
   American leadership of the liberal international order. This paper
   relies on Obama's own words, White House documents, and government
   reports to demonstrate why and how his administration sought to assert
   America's global leadership through the power of America's example. It
   identifies Obama's open government and transparency agenda as a critical
   tool of the administration's national security strategy to address
   growing disillusionment with liberal democratic governance in America
   and elsewhere and to counter the rising challenge to the liberal order
   by rival, authoritarian states - China and Russia especially.},

Abstract = {From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Donald Trump
   regularly used nicknames to deride his opponents' appearances,
   demeanors, beliefs, or personal histories. Employing such nicknames
   defied norms of campaigning and captured media attention, but little is
   known about how these monikers penetrated public awareness, were
   perceived by the public, and shaped evaluations of those targeted.
   Examining Trump's effort to label Joe Biden as ``Sleepy Joe{''} offers a
   window through which to begin to answer such questions. Findings from an
   August 2020 survey experiment reveal that those who participate in
   politics are likely to contemporaneously know the nicknames Trump is
   using during the campaign. Perceptions of nickname accuracy were shaped
   by political beliefs. Amongst a random subset of survey participants
   asked to consider the use and intent of ``Sleepy Joe{''} more deeply,
   those who knew it going in and also approved of how the President did
   his job were the only ones to look significantly more negatively upon
   Biden. Subsequent findings also reveal the extent to which Americans
   have forgotten Trump's nicknames of past rivals, calling into question
   whether such a strategy leaves lasting legacies.},

Abstract = {This article studies recent trends in the composition and uses of
   Swedish commissions of inquiry in preparing policy for the government.
   For much of the 20th century, commissions with representatives of major
   parliamentary parties and other policy stakeholders served as an arena
   of negotiation and compromise between the government, the opposition
   parties, and organised interests. Drawing on a unique data set of 2,087
   commissions appointed between 1990 and 2016, we show that their
   representativeness has declined significantly. We also document a
   significant decrease in the inclusion of politicians and an increase in
   the presence of civil servants. Governments have also increased their
   control over commissions by issuing more directives. We further document
   a dramatic decline of reservations and dissenting opinions in the
   commission reports. This may be due to a combination of including fewer
   potentially dissenting voices and restricting commissions' scope. We
   conclude that commissions are no longer the arenas of compromise-seeking
   that they were for most of the 20th century.},

Volume = {17},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, changes in judicial power have been accompanied
   by a competition between the several modes by which that power is
   legitimated: sometimes polite and sometimes fractious. Each mode of
   legitimation brings to bear its own view of the judicial role, its
   source of authority and supporting normative framework which together
   constitute a particular interpretation of judicial culture and its
   contribution to the British constitution. As both judicial powers and
   modes have changed, so the constitutional tensions have increased with
   Parliament and the executive becoming belatedly aware that their
   relationship with the judiciary is not all that they would wish. Under
   the impact of Brexit and the demands this placed on the judiciary, the
   character of the political contest between the competing modes of
   legitimation on which judicial power relies has become more intense,
   visible and disputatious as the modes have been stretched and tested by
   the institutional collisions Brexit has evoked. With the implementation
   of Brexit now in train and devolution firmly on the political agenda,
   the politics of legitimation can only become yet more evident as the
   role and power of the judiciary are drawn inexorably further into the

Abstract = {As colleges and universities push to offer more online offerings,
   particularly during this current pandemic, concerns about upholding
   standards of excellence surface. As a result, programs like Quality
   Matters (QM) have flourished in an attempt to make courses not only
   easily accessible, but also tied to learning outcomes. This paper takes
   a look at the Quality Matters framework with the goal of easing new
   instructors into the process; it breaks down the specific review
   standards into easily understandable ``bucket{''} categories, and
   assesses how it fits within introductory political science and
   international relations courses. It will also make recommendations on
   potential activities and assignments to help fit QM's active learning
   framework, which should be helpful for new and seasoned instructors
   alike.},

Abstract = {In democratic countries, public support for the judiciary is crucial to
   prevent abuse of power by the government. While facing the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments may overly restrict their
   citizens' rights to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This
   study examined whether voters would support a court's ruling if the
   court decided that the government's restriction of their rights was
   illegal and nullified the risk-averse policies. We suppose that voters
   faced with the risk of a pandemic will support a government with the
   expertise and resources to prevent a pandemic, and we set up the
   following hypotheses: If the courts nullify the measures against
   COVID-19, the public will not support the courts, and the government's
   failure to comply with the court's ruling will not diminish support for
   the government. We find support for these hypotheses in the contexts
   wherein the degree of restriction on voters' rights is weak. Because
   there is a close relationship between ``public support for the court{''}
   and ``government abuse of power,{''} we need to consider which factors
   determine support for the court.},

Abstract = {Public opinion research finds that a shared racial or ethnic identity
   can shape constituent support for political candidates and elected
   officials. While several studies find strong evidence of this
   relationship among Black Americans, many of these studies presume that
   Black Americans are an ethnically homogeneous group with a shared
   perspective on the relationship between race, ethnicity, and politics in
   the United States. This presumption proves problematic, as a growing
   body of research finds that Black immigrants maintain ethnic identities,
   experiences, and political attitudes that are distinct from those of the
   native Black population (i.e. African Americans). Using the presidency
   of Barack Obama as a case study, this article investigates the impact of
   identity on Black immigrant evaluation of racially descriptive
   representation. Analysis of 71 in-depth interviews with first- through
   second-generation Afro-Caribbeans suggests strong support for the Obama
   presidency. Despite migration from predominantly Black nations that have
   diverse experiences with Black leadership at the national level, study
   participants express support for Obama emphasizing the importance of
   respectability in the representation of Black people nationally and
   internationally. The research adds to the literature on identity and
   representation by highlighting the salience of racial identity in
   shaping immigrant political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The underrepresentation of women in elected assemblies is one of the
   fundamental problems modern democracies struggle with. This paper
   focuses on party selectors as one of the core actors on the demand side.
   By exploring which Flemish local party chairs hold conservative or
   progressive gender role attitudes, this paper moves beyond the formal
   dimensions of the political recruitment process. Our results demonstrate
   that although conservative gender role attitudes are only to a limited
   extent present among the Flemish local party chairs, there remains a
   significant part of the local chairs that does not fully endorse the
   idea that political responsibilities should be equally shared between
   men and women. Overall, male party chairs and rightist party chairs have
   more conservative gender role attitudes than their female and leftist
   counterparts. Taken together, our results suggest that in some parties,
   conservative gender role attitudes held by the party elite could help to
   understand the barriers faced by female aspirants, candidates and
   politicians alike.},

Abstract = {There is little research examining the gender gap in public opinion
   among Americans of African descent. Amid emerging evidence that Black
   men are more conservative than Black women, there is reason to believe
   there may be gender differences in their policy preferences. We use the
   1980-2016 cumulative ANES data to observe when racial and gender
   considerations will be more salient for Black women in determining their
   policy preferences. We find no gender gap on race-based policies
   suggesting racial group interests may be driving similar support among
   Black men and women. We do find gender differences on women's issues and
   social welfare policies. We attribute Black women's support for women's
   issues to their gendered interests and demonstrate the gap in social
   welfare attitudes is mediated by their lower economic status relative to
   Black men. Despite these differences, we discover that Black men and
   women support race-oriented and social welfare policies more than either
   white men or women.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the extent to which European governments' legal
   strategies (i.e. the choices of and changes in the legal foundation(s)
   authorising executive action) to address the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced
   executive autonomy to the detriment of parliamentary policy-making
   power, defined as the formal ability of parliaments to constrain
   executive rule making. Approaching the reduction in parliamentary
   policy-making power as one indication of `executive aggrandisement', it
   contrasts the prominent claim in the literature that populist
   governments tend to use emergencies to weaken formal checks on executive
   power with a hypothesis derived from research on crisis policy making,
   associating such tendencies with unified executives lacking internal
   checks and balances. Assessing six European governments' legal
   strategies between January 2020 until the present (spring 2021), the
   formal weakening of parliaments' role in law making was - overall - more
   pronounced among `unified executives' than governments including major
   populist parties, pointing to a source of `democratic vulnerability' in
   emergency situations transcending Central Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {While there has been considerable philosophical attention given to
   injustices surrounding work, there has been much less on those
   injustices that pertain specifically to workers' commutes. In this
   paper, I argue that commutes are important parts of people's working
   lives, and thus deserve attention as sites of potentially considerable
   injustice. I evaluate commutes in terms of their impact on people's
   work, their rest, the control they exercise over their lives outside of
   work, and their ability to meet the demands of democratic citizenship.
   In the second half, I offer some proposals that could reform commuting,
   while recognizing the ways in which commuting injustice is not
   incidental to structures of contemporary capitalism, especially with
   regards to housing, but is rather a structural and constitutive feature.
   As a result, remedying the injustices of the commute might require a
   more radical restructuring of current modes of urban development.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long been concerned with the implications of income
   inequality for democracy. Conventional wisdom suggests that high income
   inequality is associated with political parties taking polarized
   positions as the left advocates for increased redistribution while the
   right aims to entrench the position of economic elites. This article
   argues that the connection between party positions and income inequality
   depends on how party bases are sorted by income and the issue content of
   national elections. It uses data from European national elections from
   1996 to 2016 to show that income inequality has a positive relationship
   with party polarization on economic issues when partisans are sorted
   with respect to income and when economic issues are relatively salient
   in elections. When these factors are weak, however, the author finds no

Abstract = {This article examines the role of U.S. government deception in the
   handling of the anti-Castro terrorist Luis Posada. The Luis Posada
   scandal involved more than just the terrorist; it also involved the
   questionable collaboration of several U.S. presidents, government
   officials, and agencies with entities in Cuban-exile communities. The
   theoretical framework used in this analysis is information manipulation
   theory, which postulates that information is packaged through
   manipulative messages; it is transmitted from a sender who gives false
   information to a receiver, the audience. An important conclusion of this
   analysis is that U.S. federal employees propagated lies and deception
   for political gain. They also contributed to deceiving the U.S. audience
   by breaking the oath that no anti-Castro terrorists such as Luis Posada
   would be harbored or protected.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case that a deficit or absence of trust in media
   sources to report on newsworthy items facilitates acceptance of fake
   news. The article begins by identifying the sort of fake news that is of
   interest for the purposes of this article. Epistemic coverage is then
   explained-in particular, how an individual's expectations about their
   epistemic environment can lead them to accepting or rejecting claims.
   The article explains that when an individual believes that mainstream
   media report on what is deemed newsworthy, it follows that an individual
   will have grounds to dismiss a newsworthy claim that has not been
   reported upon-such as a claim made by fake news. Trust-which has both a
   believed competence requirement and a believed goodwill requirement-is
   then discussed as part of this explanation. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the implications of the argument for regulating mainstream
   media.},

Abstract = {This article examines Corbynism's gender politics, and its relationship
   with feminism. We note that in the early years of the Corbyn period
   there were starkly opposed positions on the gender dynamics and
   feminist-friendliness of the Corbyn project. This, in turn, reflected
   wider factional divisions, often mapping onto different articulations of
   the relationship between feminism, race/whiteness, and trans rights. We
   then describe how initial prospects for the cultivation of a more
   gender-sensitive left politics were ultimately undermined by two key
   developments: first, a discursive terrain in which feminism increasingly
   became pitted against the Corbynite left; and second, a defensiveness
   within the Corbyn project that made it resistant to immanent critique.
   We conclude by arguing that the failure of pro-Corbyn feminists to gain
   much traction must be contextualised within the dynamics of
   personalisation, instrumentalisation and polarisation that increasingly
   shape our political culture.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that there are resources within theories of corrective
   justice to make the case against the deportation of immigrants,
   including those accused of committing criminal actions. More
   specifically, the argument defended here is that a nation acts
   impermissibly by deporting criminal immigrants who belong to countries
   that the nation itself wronged in a manner that contributed to create
   the migratory flow that led the immigrants in question there. In that
   case, admission and, equally important, permanent residence in the host
   nation must be understood as a form of compensation for past wrongs, the
   interruption of which represents a breach of its duties of
   rectification, and is therefore unjust. Put in slightly different terms,
   some migrants have a retributive right-claim against their host state
   (which they may or may not exercise) to be admitted into the host state
   and not be deported.},

Abstract = {Few empirical studies have investigated career-related incentives for
   party membership, including for young party members. Through the lens of
   rational choice, we ask what career-related incentives young and active
   party members consider when calculating costs and benefits of party
   membership. We argue for a broad understanding of career-related
   incentives, including careers outside party politics. The study is based
   on in-depth interviews with 25 young party members in Sweden. Our main
   empirical finding is that the interviewees experience a `super-dilemma':
   Although the young party members might consider a political career, they
   think it is important to leave the party if it departs from their
   perceived ideology. Hence, these young members must keep non-political
   career options open. At the same time, many of the interviewees express
   concern that their party membership could negatively affect their
   non-political career.},

Abstract = {Globalization and automation have contributed to deindustrialization and
   the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, yielding important electoral
   implications across advanced democracies. Coupling insights from
   economic voting and social identity theory, we consider how different
   groups in society may construe manufacturing job losses in contrasting
   ways. We argue that deindustrialization threatens dominant group status,
   leading some white voters in affected localities to favor candidates
   they believe will address economic distress and defend racial hierarchy.
   Examining three US presidential elections, we find white voters were
   more likely to vote for Republican challengers where manufacturing
   layoffs were high, whereas Black voters in hard-hit localities were more
   likely to vote for Democrats. In survey data, white respondents, in
   contrast to people of color, associated local manufacturing job losses
   with obstacles to individual upward mobility and with broader American
   economic decline. Group-based identities help explain divergent
   political reactions to common economic shocks.},

   notion of communitas, as developed by the anthropology of experience in

Abstract = {At the end of the 19th century in the US utopian tradition there are
   some images of societies led by women that describe a social order based
   on the love bonding mother and child. If read as ``fictions of the
   possibility{''} as Hans Blumenberg suggests, these representations can
   be interpreted as critical political stance against women's
   subordination based on the idea that women are ``fit{''} for public life
   and political charges. Reinterpreting the ``republican motherhood{''},
   these utopias ask for recognition for full women's emancipation
   developing the idea that matriarchate guarantees the convergence between
   individual rights and social cooperation better than men's political
   order.},

Abstract = {Although EU member states have committed themselves to upholding the
   fundamental democratic values enshrined in Article 2 Treaty on European
   Union, violations of these values could be observed in some member
   states-first and foremost in Hungary and Poland. This article studies
   whether these negative developments, which are often summarized under
   the terms backsliding or erosion of democracy, should be classified as a
   loss in the quality of democracy or even as a decline of democracy. By
   drawing on Gero Erdmann's (2011) theoretical definition of decline of
   democracy and using Democracy Barometer data for the period between 2004
   and 2016, this form of loss of the quality of democracy is analysed for
   the 28 EU member states. In addition, the EU's role in safeguarding
   democracy in its member states is discussed. The article shows that it
   is not only the new EU members that show a decline of democracy more
   frequently, but the old EU members. The EU as guardian of the democratic
   fundamental values is failing to live up to its role despite the
   numerous instruments it has at its disposal.},

Abstract = {Mexico has one of the largest networks of trade and investment
   agreements in the world. However, the legal architecture in Mexico does
   not allow sub-federal governments (SGFs) to participate in free trade
   negotiations. While this explains the rather weak role of Mexican
   sub-federal units in trade politics, this case study shows that the
   states are not absent from trade. They utilize semiformal and informal
   resources which account for variation in trade engagement. Permissive
   secondary legislation, cooperation agreements and projects, and
   intergovernmental bargaining are all institutional resources used by
   Mexican SFGs to engage in trade politics. These resources function under
   supportive conditions that facilitate trade, such as interest
   identification, institutional capacities, and learning processes. A
   variation of such conditions sets the basis for the use of certain
   resources. This article presents empirical evidence of SFGs
   differentiated engagement in the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement
   (USMCA) and the revamped Mexico-European Union trade agreement (MEX-EU).},

Abstract = {Previous research into the relationship between income inequality and
   turnout inequality has produced mixed results, as consensus is lacking
   whether inequality reduces turnout for all income groups, low-income
   earners, or no one. Therefore, this paper builds on this literature by
   introducing supply-side logic, through the first individual-level test
   of the impact that income inequality (moderated by policy manifesto
   positions) has on turnout. It does so through multilevel logistic
   regressions utilizing mixed effects, on a sample of 30 advanced
   democracies in 102 elections from 1996 to 2016. It finds that higher
   levels of income inequality significantly reduce turnout and widen the
   turnout gap between rich and poor. However, it also finds that when
   party systems are more polarized, low-income earners are mobilized the
   greatest extent coupled with higher inequality, resulting in a
   significantly reduced income gap in turnout. The findings magnify the
   negative impacts income inequality can exert on political behavior and
   contribute to the study of policy offerings as a key moderating
   mechanism in the relationship.},

Abstract = {A convergence between vulnerability, radicalisation and children has
   been framed as an emergent category of abuse: ``childhood
   radicalisation{''}. Focusing on the UK PREVENT programme, this paper
   explores the ways children have become interrelated with
   counter-radicalisation. While PREVENT engages with people of all ages,
   Home Office data indicates children are a target group. This approach
   has been consolidated through the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security
   Act which legislates PREVENT as safeguarding. Inspired by Ernst Bloch's
   ``ontology-of-the-not-yet{''}, this article draws upon critical
   geographies of ``hope{''} as a theoretical tool to unpack PREVENT. I
   explore the productive power of PREVENT in catalysing ``hopeful{''}
   forms of subjectivity; specifically, the pedagogy of PREVENT, and
   de-radicalisation through Channel. The article then extends Bloch's
   original apparatus to examine the ways hope acts as an assemblage of
   affects to enact practices of control. It is the reciprocal influence of
   hope, fear and anticipatory security that helps illuminate how PREVENT
   makes visible, and thus regulates, processes of becoming. The article
   traverses disciplines encompassing criminology, critical geography,
   critical international relations, and critical terrorism studies. This
   inter-disciplinary approach usefully captures PREVENT in terms of
   performativity, anticipatory security and the figuration of the child.},

Abstract = {Building on Hegel's speculative philosophy, this paper seeks to engage
   critically with Ernesto Laclau's highly influential theory of ideology.
   Three central points of contention are developed. First, while Laclau's
   view of ideological distortion as a distortion of a lack is well taken,
   the paper affirms that in order to sustain itself this distortion
   becomes a paradoxical two, or in Hegelian terms an oppositional unity.
   The distortive illusion of fullness (the concealment of basic lack) only
   becomes operational via a reciprocal supplementary distortive illusion
   of an external obstacle to that fullness - the illusion of fullness is
   thus sustained by its opposite.
   Second, in contrast to Laclau's view of the extra-discursive as a
   distant imaginary, it is argued that the existing capitalist power
   structure functions effectively as its own extra-discursive in a far
   more immediate sense in the organization of reality. Third, the real
   problem of ideology is not simply that (extra-discursive) closure is
   absent and has to be imposed but rather that the very proximity of
   closure generates unbearable tensions and antagonisms that need to be
   externalized and re-staged in more manageable ways. Drawing on a range
   of examples, the paper aims to synthesize an alternative speculative
   approach to ideology.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Some agencies derive legitimacy from their political independence: for
   example, political meddling in monetary policy is problematic, as
   politicians favor short-term electoral goals over long-term economic
   stability. Nevertheless, the process of agency reform, even for agencies
   that are thought to be independent, is seldom onerous and often follows
   standard legislative procedures. Furthermore, citizens frequently lack
   expertise to hold policymakers accountable for new bureaucratic
   policies. Why then do politicians abstain from exercising influence
   through agency reform? This article delineates an informational cost to
   agency reform. In issue areas where politicians are frequently biased
   and citizens cannot perfectly observe the quality of agency reforms,
   citizens assume that reforms serve the politicians' self-interest and
   punish politicians for any reform at all. Agency independence then comes
   more from informational challenges than from institutional design. This
   article develops a formal model to explain when agencies are reformed
   and when they retain their independence.},

Abstract = {Fact-checks have become prolific in U.S. campaigns over the last ten
   years. As a result, fact-checks have become one of the easiest ways for
   individuals to analyze the truthfulness of politicians' statements. The
   increase in both fact-checking and its accessibility to voters led us to
   ask whether fact-checks influence individuals' attitudes and evaluations
   of political candidates and campaign messages. To examine the impact of
   fact-checking, we conduct two original experiments using the 2012 Ohio
   Senate race between Republican challenger Josh Mandel and Democratic
   incumbent Sherrod Brown. The first experiment utilized a sample of over
   300 students during the fall of 2013. The second experiment is a
   crowdsourced Amazon Mechanical Turk Sample in the fall of 2014. We find
   the content of fact-check messages are influential in altering
   assessments of candidates' advertisements. We also find the source of
   the fact-check only modestly impacts assessments. The findings
   illustrate the potential power of fact-checks to influence the
   effectiveness of candidates' messages and reaffirm the important role
   the news media plays in validating candidate claims and arguments during
   political campaigns.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the taxation legal framework applicable to the
   peer-to-peer lending platforms which manage projects that do not involve
   any kind of financial profitability. Given that there is an absence of
   specific regulations in this area, the study has been conducted by using
   as a starting point the two management models underlying the functioning
   of these kinds of platforms, as well as the functioning of the legal
   nature of their owners and the operations which they carry out. In this
   context, an analysis regarding the taxation of peer-to-peer lending
   platforms in area of direct and indirect taxes is made. The work also
   includes indications of the main legal problems that these platforms
   create. Finally, the article concludes with proposals as lex ferenda
   that may be useful for future regulations in this area.},

Abstract = {The thought of Francis Bacon (1561-1626) has been more closely related
   to empiricism, science, and utopia than to colonialism and imperialism.
   However, the Chancellor was always attentive to the economic, social or
   military transformations of his world, both because of the period in
   which he lived, because of his parliamentary and government
   responsibilities and because of his intellectual tastes. Furthermore, he
   did so, not with the indifferent eyes of a spectator, but with the
   interest of a man who was aware of the great advances that were taking
   place and the changes they generated, and, above all, with the
   determination that England was not left behind when it came to taking
   advantage of them. In this sense, no one in his time seems so aware of
   the need to look at the actions of the Spaniards, as a model with which
   to compete and to imitate.},

Abstract = {The literature on bureaucratic capacity and autonomy in American
   political development is focused on federal agencies, with little
   attention paid to the development of subnational bureaucracies whose
   leaders are elected. I argue that while the ``policrats{''} who lead
   such agencies value their status as elected officials, it also makes
   them vulnerable to the charge of being mere political hacks. Using the
   example of district attorneys, I argue that the rise of the
   administrative state enhanced the potency of this threat, so that
   policrats increasingly had to harmonize their classic electoral,
   credit-claiming activity with the work of building the reputations of
   their bureaucracies. One solution was to create professional
   organizations and claim they had expertise, authority, and standards
   analogous to those of the traditional professions, such as medicine or
   the law. Critically, this expertise was claimed to incorporate a
   ``commonsense{''} mentality compatible with popular election. Thus,
   subnational actors borrowed core tactics and ideas of national
   statebuilding to entrench the fragmented ``old American state{''} and
   layer it with new coercive powers.},

Abstract = {Dictators can choose not only whether to repress but also how to
   repress. This paper demonstrates that autocrats select their repressive
   methods based on the anticipated likelihood of responsive dissent. While
   dictators would prefer to use violence against their most prominent
   opposition, the more visible the opponent, the more likely their death
   or detention will provoke backlash. Instead, dictators can target these
   enemies with alternative methods of repression like exile. To test this
   theory, I draw on original data on the fates of candidates in the last
   elections before Chile's coup. While elected politicians experienced
   more repression when accounting for exile, results-including those of a
   regression discontinuity-demonstrate that election decreased the
   likelihood of suffering violence. Evidence suggests that this is due to
   the increased prominence associated with winning office. My findings
   offer new insight into how autocrats avoid backlash, as well as when
   they adopt different repressive tools.},

Title = {When Deliberation Produces Persuasion rather than Polarization:
   Measuring and modeling Small Group Dynamics in a Field Experiment},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new statistical method to measure persuasion
   within small groups, and applies this approach to a large-scale
   randomized deliberative experiment. The authors define the construct of
   `persuasion' as a change in the systematic component of an individual's
   preference, separate from measurement error, that results from exposure
   to interpersonal interaction. Their method separately measures
   persuasion in a latent (left-right) preference space and in a
   topic-specific preference space. The model's functional form
   accommodates tests of substantive hypotheses found in the small-group
   literature. The article illustrates the measurement method by examining
   changes in study participants' views on US fiscal policy resulting from
   the composition of the small discussion groups to which they were
   randomly assigned. The results are inconsistent with the `law of
   small-group polarization', the typical result found in small-group
   research; instead, the authors observe patterns of latent and
   policy-specific persuasion consistent with the aspirations of
   deliberation.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the idea of social change towards democracy from the
   liberal and conventional perspective presented in the work of Francis
   Fukuyama and compares it with the proposal of social evolution made by
   Hauke Brunkhorst, who combines aspects of the Habermasian communicative
   theory and Marxian dialectical materialism. The objective is to present
   an idea of social transformation from the disruptive communicative
   actions carried out in the public sphere by social movements in a
   conflictive social context through the public expression of the
   experiences of injustice.},

Abstract = {The characters and preferences of individual leaders matter greatly for
   policies and governance in many political systems, yet systematic
   evidence on how politicians lead and the consequences of their
   leadership styles remains scant. This study sheds light on these issues
   by analyzing a unique data set of internal evaluation remarks for top
   provincial politicians in China. Latent class analyses on evaluation
   keywords reveal two distinct styles: an assertive, autocratic style that
   focuses on centralized decision-making and efficient execution and a
   relatively soft, collegial style that respects dissent and fosters
   intraelite collaboration. We further show that these two leadership
   styles are associated with distinct governing strategies and that they
   both offer viable, but different, paths to political survival. These
   findings enrich our understanding of survival tactics and selection
   dynamics in one-party systems.},

Abstract = {The former rebel party Revolutionary United Front Party (RUFP) in Sierra
   Leone has struggled with a discredited wartime reputation and electoral
   defeats throughout the post-war period. In spite of this, the party has
   remained loyal to its wartime revolutionary ideas, symbols and political
   rhetoric. Why is this the case? In this article, I argue that the answer
   lies in the premises of party politics in war-torn states and new
   democracies on the African continent. In a political landscape where
   brokerage is power, retaining wartime identities can sometimes serve as
   a valuable source of (potential) patronage. With few other options for
   access to resources and opportunities, the core of the party membership
   has clung to its past as a means to both rally electoral support among
   the marginalized ex-combatant community and to get access to the
   long-awaited funds that were promised to them in the peace negotiations.},
