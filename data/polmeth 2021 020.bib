Title = {The global visa cost divide: How and why the price for travel permits
   varies worldwide},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Visas are an important means for countries to regulate the potential
   access of non-nationals to their territory. Past datasets and
   quantitative research on visas have focused on visa waivers, ignoring
   the fact that visas, where demanded, can vary greatly by cost. This
   paper presents a novel dataset based on a manual collection of visa
   costs for travel between a global set of country pairs in seven
   different categories (tourist, work, student, family reunification,
   business, transit, and other). Our analyses reveal a strong global visa
   cost divide that exposes the injustice in the right to travel for people
   located in different areas of the world. Whereas Europeans usually
   hardly have to work at all for travel permits, visa costs often amount
   to several weeks of mean income in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia. The
   result is a fundamentally paradoxical situation: The richer a country,
   the less its citizens pay for visas to go abroad (both in absolute terms
   and relative to their income). Poisson pseudomaximum likelihood
   regression analyses reveal that a variety of factors influence the costs
   of visas between countries: reciprocal treatment, processing costs,
   historical-cultural ties, geographic proximity and regional, religious,
   economic, and political discrimination. This confirms the important role
   of visa costs as a tool for states to control population movements and
   simultaneously position themselves in international relations.},

Abstract = {Starting from the observation that the levels of expenditure and of
   resources are very different from one French department to another, the
   aim of this article is to shed light on the origins of the disparities
   in the departments' expenditure in order to be able to question the
   effectiveness of equalization mechanisms intended to reduce them. For
   that purpose, we identify the explanatory variables of departmental
   expenditure and then we measure the contribution of each of them to the
   explanation of disparities in departmental expenditure. Based on data
   from the Directorate General of Local Authorities (DGCL), our study
   covers the period 2006-2016 and distinguishes in total expenditure,
   current expenditure from investment expenditure. We then show that the
   disparities in expenditure are explained above all by disparities in
   resources, whether these come from state endowments or taxes, which
   raises questions as to the role played by social expenditure often
   considered as the major factor explaining the behavior of departments'
   expenditures. In addition, our results allow clarifying the relative
   weight of the vertical and horizontal equalization mechanisms in
   explaining the disparities in expenditure of the departments while
   raising questions about their relative effectiveness.},

Title = {A coalbed methane `stratum ` for a low-carbon future: A critical inquiry
   from the Lorraine Basin (France)},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coalbed methane exploration in Lorraine (France) is part of a rush to
   unconventional natural gas around the world. These resources are
   envisioned as a ``transitional bridge{''} to a low-carbon economy
   dominated by renewable generation. This paper tackles the idea that such
   a ``fuel bridge{''} could lead to a more sustainable transition. It
   studies the network of actors and interests involved in exploring a
   coalbed methane `volume', its modelling and how it becomes public.
   Through this lens, it shows how a `volume' endures in a `stratum', as
   well as the political issues related to this reconfiguring of the
   underground in Lorraine. The article contributes to three debates in
   relation with political geology. First, it proposes a renewed definition
   of `volume' based on the work of Michel Serres. The `volume' is not a
   property of the underground nor a geometric ideality but defined as a
   transitory ordering of the `multitude' that encompasses material,
   knowledge and political issues. It enables the development of a more
   continuous analytical strategy to follow geological and political
   crossed influences, and contributes to this project by going beyond
   existing divides (e.g. vitalist/ constructivist). Second, the paper
   provides the reader with a complementary perspective (from the field
   instead of a compilation of data at an international level) about what
   it means to assess an unconventional resource. The proposed definition
   of `volume' does not reduce uncertainty to a matter of knowing but makes
   it constitutive of the making of a gas potential. This enables one to
   follow the chain of mediations through which uncertainty is framed and
   strategically managed to meet industrial, scientific and political
   interests, while taming local oppositions. Third, the paper analyses why
   this coalbed methane `stratum' may be democratically contested and
   transitory instead of preparing the ground for a low-carbon transition.
   This case study looks at a unique situation in France, namely a private
   company receiving public support in the context of political tensions
   about unconventional gas, and shows the country's internal
   contradictions and delays in updating its institutions and strategy
   concerning the use of underground resources for a low-carbon transition.},

Abstract = {In 2018, Maine became the first American state to use ranked choice
   voting in statewide and congressional elections. In a decentralized
   system of election administration local officials play an important role
   implementing new voting rules. We examine the implementation of ranked
   choice voting based on a survey of municipal clerks and interviews with
   several election officials in Maine. We test hypotheses derived from
   policy implementation theory in assessing election officials'
   evaluations of ranked choice voting. We find that most municipal clerks
   in our sample are not enthusiastic about implementing ranked choice
   voting and do not want to continue its use in Maine. In addition, there
   are strong partisan divisions, with Democratic clerks offering much more
   positive assessments of ranked choice voting than Republican clerks. We
   also find differences in voter education efforts across jurisdictions.
   The findings raise concerns about the implementation of ranked choice
   voting in Maine.},

Abstract = {We defend the moral and legal right to secede in accordance with
   plebiscitary theory. Our paper has three main goals. First, by offering
   a schematic characterization of plebiscitary theory, the main arguments
   in its favour (and the main objections to them), we contribute to
   clarify the structure of this complex debate. Second, we stress the
   point that, if the moral right to secede is established, the resistance
   for its inclusion into positive law is unjustified. Finally, by
   addressing old and new objections to plebiscitary theory, we hope to
   make a compelling case for a wider recognition of secessionist rights.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-321},
Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the relationship between service exports
   and productivity in 27 OECD countries by using a panel dataset for the
   years 1995-2018. In the theoretical context, this relationship is
   basically handled by the learning-by-exporting and self-selection
   mechanisms. Additionally, product life cycle and technological gap
   theories also have implications related to the export and productivity
   association. In the study, after detecting the cross-sectional
   dependence, the stationarity characteristics of the exports and
   productivity series were investigated by Pesaran's (2007) panel unit
   root tests. The findings of Westerlund (2007) panel co-integration test
   indicated that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between
   service exports and productivity. Common correlated effects estimators
   also supported this finding and showed that productivity affects exports
   positively in both short and long run. Finally, Dumitrescu and Hurlin's
   (2012) heterogeneous panel causality tests showed that there is a
   unidirectional causal relationship running from productivity to service
   exports. The findings support the predictions of product life cycle
   theory and technological gap theory regarding the exports and
   productivity linkage and indicate the validity of the self-selection
   mechanism for OECD countries' service exports.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a reconstitution of Nogaro's approach to monetary
   phenomena, and highlights his contribution to the explanation of
   hyperinflationary phenomena. To do this, we present his methodological
   approach and his conception of money: the historical method and monetary
   nominalism. These led him to propose an original interpretation of the
   hyperinflationary crises that emerged in the aftermath of the two Great
   World Wars. He emphasizes the importance of the exchange rate and
   monetary practices in the dynamics of hyperinflationary phenomena;
   elements of analysis that are later found among francophone monetary
   institutionalists and post-Keynesian authors. Nogaro has also sought to
   propose international monetary reform to remedy exchange rate
   instability.},

Title = {Illiberalism, revolution and the 2016 Macedonian elections: The effects

Abstract = {To what extent are social movements capable of steering voters' choices
   in illiberal societies? Through the empirical exploration of Macedonia's
   2016 Colourful Revolution, this study examines the potential of
   Anti-Corruption Movements (ACMs) to inflict electoral punishment on
   illiberal leaders. It adopts a corruption-based conception of
   illiberalism, whereby `the misuse of public office for private gain' in
   the shape of bribery, nepotism, clientelism, and misuse of public party
   funding presents itself as one of the foremost components of illiberal
   rule. Drawing from original survey data and a set of semistructured
   interviews with representatives of the Colourful Revolution and members
   of the Macedonian civil society, this paper sheds light upon the effects
   of ACMs on electoral behaviour and, ultimately, on the political
   potential of ACMs in the reversal of a country's illiberal course. The
   study finds strong indicators pointing to the Colourful Revolution's
   encouraging role in stoking increasingly negative perceptions towards
   Macedonia's illiberal government ahead of the 2016 election, but
   primarily among voters that had not supported the main government party
   in the previous election.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to verify the sensitivity of national labour
   markets to economic growth while respecting its sources and different
   growth trends. We monitored the change in employment caused by economic
   growth in the set of EU27 member states in the period 2000-2019. The
   sensitivity of the labour market was quantified by finding the values of
   the elasticity coefficient. To obtain it, we used a relation to
   calculate the point elasticity as well as a logarithmic linear
   regression model compiled for each member state. The differences in the
   response of the labour market were identified by comparing the values of
   the indicator. To determine the factors of employment changes, partial
   analyses were performed by dividing the evaluated period into sections,
   especially into periods of growth and decline. As a result, it was
   possible to identify the impact of economic development trends on the
   elasticity of the labour market. At the same time, subsets (groups of
   countries) were created based on similarity of labour productivity
   levels and employment rates. The results of the analyses indicated that
   the labour market in all cases responded to changes in economic
   performance in a short period of time, while the strength of the
   influence is also affected by the stability of economic development.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has hit us hard. It is not only difficult in terms
   of psychological and medical issues, but it has turned into an economic
   crisis as well. One of the most significant `side effects' of the first
   wave was widespread remote work, which was not regular - many people had
   to work from home while also taking care of their loved ones (be they
   children or other family members, or friends). Our research - part of an
   EU-funded project on sustainable mobility - was carried out in the city
   of Szeged (Hungary) among seven companies/employers. As the project was
   strongly affected by the crisis, the research focused on the impact of
   COVID19 and the lockdown on remote work. How did remote work affect
   employees' mental, physical, and social wellbeing? How did employers and
   employees deal with the new situation? What can we learn from this
   crisis regarding the relationship between remote work and mental health?
   To find answers to our questions, we used mixed methods, i.e., combined
   qualitative with quantitative methodology. This case study analyses the
   related difficulties and challenges from the employee point of view and
   sheds light on some of the good practices and measures which can be
   applied by other companies.},

Abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD) has been framed as a collection of tools
   enabling the achievement of diverse goals: to increase transparency and
   thus improve democracy, to boost economic development, and to enhance
   the efficiency of public services. To investigate the evolution of OGD,
   this study focuses on the work of the Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development (OECD). To identify the underlying values
   and multiple purposes of OGD, we propose a Critical Discourse Analysis
   (CDA) study, which aims to show how OGD has been forged and how the
   expectations towards it have evolved. This paper aims to contribute to
   the existing literature, offering a critical perspective of the OECD's
   work on OGD, as well as developing a more nuanced understanding of OGD's
   conceptual features. Finally, the study reveals the emergence of a
   data-driven government model, paving the way for further research on its
   effects on Public Administration and Public Law.},

Abstract = {Carl von Clausewitz's On War has traditionally been analysed from the
   perspective of his classic `trinity'. However, it has not been analysed
   from the perspective of what John Agnew calls `territoriality', or the
   political and economic use of a territory to fulfil a state's
   objectives. Drawing from Agnew's concept, I define `military
   territoriality' as an amalgamation of human morale and a new trinity of
   strategy, plan and battle as the essence of preparedness in war.
   Military territoriality is useful to better understand the importance of
   human morale, battle, plan and strategy in Clausewitz's conception of
   war. Moreover, in relation to the new trinity, military territoriality
   is important for the deployment of men in strategically advantageous
   positions. It involves making calculations about territorial conditions
   essential for successfully undertaking all stages of war, from strategic
   preparations to actual combat. From the perspective of `military
   territoriality', the importance of Clausewitz's famous dictum `politics
   is war by other means' lies in his recognition that an efficient and a
   strategic understanding of military territoriality is what truly renders
   war as a political activity. War attains its political character through
   a careful usage and planning of military territoriality to ensure the
   greatest chance for victory.},

Abstract = {Corruption is a complex, widespread phenomenon with harmful economic and
   societal effects. Drawing upon theories in social psychology, political
   science, and communication, this study examines the direct and joint
   effects of mediated exposure to grand corruption and the presence of
   monetary incentives on people's likelihood to engage in dishonest
   behavior. In a 2 x 2 factorial design (N = 404), half of all
   participants were exposed to a newscast about political corruption and
   one half was offered a reward for correctly answering questions about
   the newscast. Findings suggest that incentivizing was highly effective
   in predicting chances of cheating while news exposure to corruption was
   not. The data also indicate cheating is more common among certain
   sociodemographic groups.},

Abstract = {Why have feminists in Mexico been arguing with women's groups and
   against the state over the criminalization of digital violence, and what
   do these struggles mean for its governance? This article analyzes the
   social struggles surrounding passage of the Olimpia Law of 2019, which
   criminalizes digital violence in Mexico. Although criminalization of
   digital violence as a means of governing online behavior has recently
   attracted much attention globally, this study proposes that such
   measures can, at the same time, put at risk the human rights of women
   actively participating in the political realm (human rights defenders,
   activists, and journalists). I further contend that governing digital
   violence is not so much a regulatory question but should, rather, be
   understood as a field of struggle among diverse collective projects.
   Thus, I argue that there is a need to further reconceptualize digital
   violence against women in politics as a way to address the multiplicity
   of actors and perspectives involved in internet governance. Following
   textual analysis of documents from feminist organizations arguing
   against the criminalization of digital violence, I conclude by proposing
   public policies to fight this phenomenon beyond criminalization.},

Abstract = {This article explores the financialisation of the world's most important
   commodity, oil. It argues that much of the literature on the
   financialisation of commodities tends to adopt a dualistic approach to
   financial markets and physical producers, where financial and
   non-financial activities are assumed to be externally-related and
   counterposed to one another. The article locates the roots of this
   analytical separation in a mistaken acceptance of the fetish character
   of interest-bearing capital (IBC) - a view that the exchange of loanable
   sums of capital represents a relationship between money-capitalists
   rather than a relationship to the moment of production. Against such
   dichotomous readings, the article argues that the financialisation of
   oil needs to be understood as part of the reworking of ownership and
   control across the oil commodity circuit, expressed through the combined
   centralisation and concentration of capital over the money, productive
   and commercial moments. This argument is demonstrated through an
   original empirical investigation of the US oil industry, including 2o
   years of weekly trading data on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
   and a detailed study of more than i6o oil and energy-related firms in
   the US. By mapping the structural weight and connections between
   different capitalist actors involved in accumulation across the oil
   sector, we gain a better understanding of the ultimate dynamics (and
   beneficiaries) of the carbon economy.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the welfare state literature has been witnessing a
   ``religious turn,{''} (re)reminding us the pivotal role of religion in
   shaping the modern welfare state. Notwithstanding its theoretical
   importance, this turn has been largely confined to European, North
   American, and antipodean settings. By drawing upon the historical case
   of Israeli burial services, this study seeks to make a modest step in
   closing this theoretical and empirical gap. Specifically, its findings
   point to the historical role of the Judaism in establishing universal
   burial services, funded by the state and operated almost exclusively by
   religious burial societies. Moreover, this policy legacy, which already
   had its roots in the British Mandate rule, is still at work, even in an
   era of ``permanent austerity.{''} These findings problematize mainstream
   historical observations, which view the Israeli welfare state as a
   secular project, by suggesting a more nuanced and progressive role for
   Judaism in its history.},

Abstract = {The vicuna (the wild camelid Vicugna vicugna) has a successful history
   of population recovery. The Vicuna Convention and the Convention on
   International Trade in Endangered Wild Species of Flora and Fauna
   (CITES) promotes sustainable use of the species focused on fibre
   production for the benefit of Andean communities, such as those
   inhabiting the Argentinean altiplano. This study describes and analyses
   the design, implementation and results of the Management of the Vicuna
   Conservation and Sustainable Use project executed between 2002 and 2015
   in the Catamarca province of Argentina in relation to (1) the scope and
   objectives of the applied legal regulations; (2) the control of poaching
   and illegal fibre; and (3) the distribution of benefits from free-range
   shearing populations and the Fiber Redistribution Program (FRP). The
   availability of legal fibre has helped to maintain the region's textile
   traditions. The project financed local communities' development of their
   own free-ranging shears, but the low human population density in the
   Catamarca puna and the land's propriety have resulted in a mixed model
   with the participation of private, including large private
   international, companies. This management model among international and
   local government agencies, communities and private companies with
   corporate responsibility has led to the promotion of regulations for the
   sustainability of this iconic species.},

Title = {Unpacking administrative rank: Intercity competition and the remaking of
   local state space in China},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The literature on interurban competition emphasizes that market rules as
   an external coercive power dominate local state space conductive to
   economic growth. Is there another external coercive power, other than
   the market as a hidden hand, to promote and mitigate interurban
   competition? Addressing this question, this paper specifies that the
   Chinese state's political efforts to downplay the role of the market in,
   and remake the rule of, interurban competition could have far reaching
   implications for urban political economy. The two cases are Ruili and
   Wanding, two border cities located on the edge of China's southwestern
   borderland adjacent to Myanmar. While reranking is supposed to balance
   out the inefficiencies of market principles in interurban competition,
   multiple rounds of reranking in Ruili and Wanding in the past seven
   decades indicate that this political orchestration can accelerate
   interurban competition into a cutthroat game for economic growth and
   thus create problems for macro economic management. Nevertheless, it can
   become a political tool to revamp the game by strategically selecting
   some cities as nodes of development at the sacrifice of urban fortunes
   of other cities. In this process, market rules operate in parallel with,
   and sometimes succumb to, the principle of political order from above.
   This finding expands the geographies of the state: the co-constitution
   of the local and the national becomes necessary and pragmatic since
   interurban competition is not a territorially-conditioned endeavor, but
   remains open to extralocal stakeholders-upper-level governments in this
   case-who can remake local state space.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the neglected topic of the organization and use of
   household space for work (paid and unpaid) during the early modern
   period. It engages critically with the concept of `the open house' in
   relation to recent arguments about processes of spatial and social
   closure of houses and households in the early modern period associated
   with the development of a capitalist socio-economic system. Drawing on a
   variety of sources including diaries, autobiographies, inventories and
   court records the analysis considers how work was organized in the
   domestic context and how experience varied according to gender, age,
   status and location as well as time of day, week or year. The paper
   argues that a perceived dichotomy between an open house and a closed
   home secluded from the social and business world of community and
   commerce is inadequate in the consideration of space and attitudes in
   this period. Individuals in larger houses could control access to
   certain spaces at specific times and work could be concentrated in
   certain rooms. But in practice in most households the complicated
   demands of the household economy required openness to outsiders that
   rendered the boundaries of houses more permeable and potentially more
   unstable than they are today. The analysis considers the case of England
   and compares rural and urban homes in a particular regional context, but
   it opens up several ways for historians to think about the relationship
   between work and home in other European regions.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {91},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {`The Game' is how many refugees describe their attempts to informally
   travel to Western Europe via the so-called Balkan Route. This article
   conceptualises The Game as a spatial tactic implemented by refugees as a
   response to the impossibility of legally entering the EU and as a gray
   area in the governance of informal migrant mobilities. It does so by
   engaging with the recent literature on the Balkan Route to analyse how
   The Game has been performed and `managed' in Serbia, a key `buffer
   state' along this corridor. Drawing from Tazzioli's work on `The Making
   of Migration', and in particular on her understanding of refugee forced
   mobility as a form of `migrant management' on the part of the
   authorities, this article shows how the ambivalent connotations of The
   Game reveal the troubling configurations of EU border politics and of
   its formal and informal geopolitical arrangements. At the same time, it
   argues that the practices related to The Game ultimately reflect the
   extraordinary determination of the refugees in creating new itineraries,
   spatial interstices, invisible networks and `holes in the border walls'
   that allow them, despite all the difficulties, to challenge such border
   politics. We conclude by proposing to understand The Game as part of the
   biopolitics of migration and by suggesting that it represents a powerful
   manifestation of the condition (and the field of possibility) of
   thousands of refugees along the Balkan Route today.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a novel explanation for extortion, which is the
   practice of demanding payments from compliant agents by law-enforcement
   officers. Namely, that extortion occurs due to the officer's
   incompetence, where the competence level is endogenous. Because
   competence improves enforcement, extortion affects deterrence directly
   by weakening agents' incentive to be compliant and indirectly by
   affecting officers' incentives to become competent. Accordingly, the
   harmful effects of extortion on deterrence depend on whether the
   competent or incompetent officer extorts. We show that extortion by
   incompetent officers is the lesser of the two evils, compared to
   bribery.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the causal effect of local exposure to COVID-19 on
   voting behaviour and electoral outcomes using evidence from the regional
   elections held in Spain on 12 July 2020. Exploiting the variation in
   exposure to COVID-19 and using a difference-in-differences
   identification strategy, we show that turnout was between 2.6 and 5.1
   percentage points lower in municipalities that experienced positive
   cases of COVID-19. In addition, the results show a substantial increase
   in the probability of voting for nationalist parties. We discuss the
   idea of perceived fear being the potential mechanism driving our
   results.},

Abstract = {In recent years, practices of control at EU border crossing points have
   been progressively transferred to electronic gates, or what is often
   called Automated Border Control (ABC). In this paper, I unpack ABC's
   infrastructure and argue that e-gates enact three distinct modes of
   suspicion: First, they address the mistrust towards travellers' identity
   claims and promise to better detect identity fraud and the misuse of
   other persons' ID documents. Second, they replace the manual work of
   border guards, which has itself been suspected of being unreliable and
   error-prone. Third, however, ABC has also raised suspicion among border
   guards and data protection advocates alike, due to its opaque mode of
   operation. To examine how these three modes of suspicion unfold, I first
   show that automating border control relies on a heterogeneous
   entanglement of material devices, calculative practices and new forms of
   data. Drawing on document analysis and participant observation of ABC, I
   then trace the socio-technical controversies that its proliferation has
   sparked, arguing that e-gates have significantly reconfigured how
   suspicion at the EU borders is enacted and led to a multiplication of
   mistrust in the European border regime.},

Abstract = {Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMS) were first used for political
   campaigning in the 2018 Brazilian elections; they were also used for
   engaging people in public consultations. This article aims to analyze
   the specifics of the call to action used on WhatsApp for consultations
   on the Brazilian Senate's e-Cidadania Portal during the 2018 electoral
   campaign. Moreover, our research aims to understand the extent to which
   the calls to action were used in the campaign during a time of strong
   political polarization in the country. The methodology consists of a
   content analysis aimed at understanding the message content of the
   consultations, how that content was shared, and similarities between
   this call to action and the electoral campaign strategies. The results
   show that this call to action caused a participatory distortion on that
   particular Portal, the topics covered were part of the elected
   candidate's campaign platform, and the strategy was maintained after
   elections.},

   analysis of keyword descriptions provides strength and direction of

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Objectives Previous research suggests that governments usually gain
   support during crises such as the Covid-19. However, these findings are
   based on rating scales that only allow us to measure the strength of
   this support. This article proposes a new measure of how voters evaluate
   Prime Ministers (PM) by asking for descriptive keywords that are
   analyzed by natural language processing. Methods By collecting a
   representative sample of citizens' own key words describing their PM in
   15 countries in Europe during the outbreak of Covid-19, and analyzing
   these by latent semantic analysis and a multiple OLS regression, we
   could quantify the strength and direction of voters' view. Results The
   strength analysis supported previous studies that describing the PM with
   positive words was strongly associated with vote intention. Furthermore,
   a change in the direction of the attitudes from ``good{''} to
   ``honest{''} was found. A new finding was that the pandemic was
   associated with an increase in polarization. Conclusions The keyword
   evaluation analysis provides opportunities of evaluating both strength
   and direction of voters' view of their PM, where we show new results
   related to increased polarization and shift in the direction of
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {We introduce simulated packing and cracking as a technique for
   evaluating partisan-gerrymandering measures. We apply it to historical
   congressional and legislative elections to evaluate four measures:
   partisan bias, declination, efficiency gap, and mean-median difference.
   While the efficiency gap recognizes simulated packing and cracking in a
   completely predictable manner (a fact that follows immediately from the
   efficiency gap's definition) and the declination does a very good job of
   recording simulated packing and cracking, we conclude that both of the
   other two measures record it less well. This variation is especially
   notable given the frequent use of such measures in outlier analyses.},

Abstract = {Voters in ageing societies expect pension reforms to be both
   inter-generationally and intra-generationally fair. In this paper, we
   propose a global measure of intra-generational redistribution in
   pay-as-you-go pension schemes as a basis for voters' evaluations of
   reforms. Our novel index only requires information on contributions by
   and pension benefits paid to retirees, enabling us to measure
   intra-generational redistribution isolated from possible
   inter-generational redistribution. We rely on the contribution records
   of approximately 100,000 Germans, who progressed into retirement in
   2007-2015, to measure the level of intra-generational redistribution in
   the German statutory pension scheme (GRV). A recent reform of the
   childcare benefit provision, which became effective in 2014, confirms
   the predictions of our index. The reform introduced additional benefits
   for a substantial subgroup of German mothers, owing to which the index
   value for women, but not for men, jumps up. Our findings suggests that
   GRV fulfills the ideal of a Bismarckian pension system without
   intra-generational redistribution for men, while women benefit
   significantly from intra-generational redistribution.},

Abstract = {The disciplinary regime as a basic element of the state organization to
   fulfill the purposes of the Social State of Law presents several
   problems with respect to the principle of impartiality in the processes
   advanced against public servants. That same rule violates the
   impartiality principle by granting broad powers to the Attorney
   General's Office. The article will address the origin of the problem,
   define impartiality from the Colombian Constitutional Court's and the
   Inter-American Court of Human Rights' points of view, and, finally, it
   will present a case study. The article will try to explain the exercise
   of the principle of impartiality in the imposition of sanctions to
   public servants in Colombia according to Law 734 of 2002, through the
   descriptive-analytical and bibliographic or documentary method, which
   will undoubtedly provide the reader with an overview of the importance
   of the subject.},

Abstract = {This article tries to reconstruct and clarify some of the causes and
   consequences of the climate of emancipation that, as it happened in
   other areas of Spanish society, seized psychiatric discourses and
   practices in the final years of General Franco's dictatorship. In this
   way, the crystallization of a new sensibility towards the situation of
   people affected by mental disorders, the increasing professional demands
   of participation and involvement in the management of institutions and
   the efforts to implement more horizontal therapeutic interventions are
   interpreted in the framework of the emergence of a more active,
   assertive and inclusive civic consciousness. Taking into account the
   severe restriction of political rights and the repressive measures with
   which the regime finally faced all this wave of psychiatric dissent, the
   paper offers a brief final reflection on the scarce compatibility of the
   culture of community mental health with authoritarian sociopolitical
   environments and on the inevitable disenchantment caused later by the
   effective implementation of the processes of deinstitutionalization and
   psychiatric reform.},

Title = {Challenging absolute executive powers in times of corona: re-examining
   constitutional courts and the collective right to public contestation as
   instruments of institutional control},

Abstract = {Purpose The CoViD-19 pandemic has brought about a panoply of
   institutional challenges both domestically and in the international
   arena. Classical constitutional theory thereby underwent a reinvention
   by the executive for the sake of speedy policy action and to the
   detriment of institutional control while favouring authoritarian forms
   of governance. This paper concerns itself with institutional responses
   to such developments, placing emphasis on the role of the judiciary and
   people{*}s in contesting emergency decrees and other executive orders,
   especially where fundamental rights are infringed upon. The paper aims
   to explore the difficulties arising with exerting absolute executive
   powers during the health crisis, the respective role assumed by
   constitutional courts and the impact of the new governance paradigm on
   forms of public contestation, also as a means of quasi institutional
   control. Design/methodology/approach Indeed, the right to health may be
   translated into political discourse and become foundational to security
   and public interest paradigms. This may result in a shrinking public
   space given the constraints to the freedom of movement. In the name of
   public safety, the (collective) right to assembly, expression and
   protest have been submitted to major limitations in that regard.
   Findings Ultimately, this re-opens debates on the meaning of absolute
   rights and contextualities of derogations, as well as the
   reconcilability of civil and political rights and economic, social and
   cultural rights. It also exposes social inequalities, social justice
   dimensions and vulnerabilities, often exacerbated by the health crisis;
   migrant rights demonstrably face particularly severe and intersectional
   forms of violations. Originality/value Particular values lie with the
   interdisciplinary approach embraced in this paper; the authors draw on a
   variety of social sciences disciplines to shed light on this very
   current issue. Both theoretical and empirical methods are used and
   combined here, making sense of the underlying logic of virus governance
   and its impacts on fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {Ecological catastrophe and global inequality are pressing, yet
   socio-ecologically destructive natural resource extraction continues
   unabated. This special issue explores the strategies and tactics
   employed by large-scale mining and energy companies to render extraction
   socio-politically feasible in the face of multi-pronged opposition.
   Extraction, we contend, does not only need physical engineering, but
   requires social engineering as well. This entails shaping the behavior
   of people to `manage' dissent and `manufacture' consent. Situating the
   social engineering of extraction in key debates in the literature, this
   special issue introduction traces the evolution of its main technologies
   and techniques, related to colonialism, wars of decolonization,
   neoliberalism and the `green' economy, respectively. We conclude by
   outlining a number of ways to advance research on the social engineering
   of extraction.},

Title = {The Mediterranean as a carceral seascape},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In May 2019, 75 distressed migrants fleeing Libya were rescued by the
   merchant vessel Maridive 601 in the central Mediterranean Sea. With
   Italy, Malta, and Tunisia denying permission to disembark, the merchant
   vessel turned from a floating refuge into an offshore carceral space,
   leaving the migrants stranded near the Tunisian coast for 19 days. This
   article traces the migratory trajectories of the Maridive 75, as I will
   collectively refer to them, in order to show how EUrope's desire to
   deter, capture, and contain migrant mobilities has transformed the
   Mediterranean Sea into a carceral seascape. While offshore carcerality
   is not specific to EUrope's southern maritime border and also not a
   novel phenomenon, increasingly restrictive migration policies have
   dramatically reshaped the Mediterranean borderzone over recent years,
   multiplying infrastructures, technologies, and spaces of confinement.
   Interrogating the Mediterranean Sea as a carceral space generates
   insights into an ever-growing panoply of carceral but mobile forms of
   governance seeking to discipline and police unauthorised and precarious
   human movements, both at sea and on land. At the same time, as this
   article demonstrates, unruly migrant mobilities and struggles at sea
   continue to expose the often-conflictual processes at work in the
   production of the Mediterranean carceral seascape.},

Title = {Official framing-portraying the implementation of an unpopular policy as
   responsive governance},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {571-589},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Official framing has received increasing attention in social movement
   studies. Yet current research often focuses on the negative side of
   framing, that is, how authorities vilify and demonize challengers to
   justify coercive reactions, whereas little scholarship has scrutinized
   positive framing, i.e., how officials recognize the legitimacy of
   citizens' grievances and portray state co-optation or conciliation as
   responsive governance. Neither does existing research examine
   institutional foundations of official framings. To address these
   omissions, this paper devises a conceptual framework of negative and
   positive framings, which incorporates the examination of a variety of
   formal and less formal institutions undergirding different types of
   framing strategies. I develop this conceptual framework through a case
   study of how a local government framed protest against waste
   incineration in China. It documents how authorities portray the
   implementation of an unpopular policy as responsive governance and how
   different institutions facilitate official frames. An in-depth analysis
   of official framing not only contributes to the development of studies
   of frames and contentious politics but to a better understanding of
   social control and legitimation.},

Abstract = {The article discusses parallelisms between the social and political
   realities of East Central Europe around 1917-1923 and the current state
   of affairs. It starts with an analysis of the dynamic social relations
   in the final year of the Great War to follow with the question of their
   impact on politics and a short outline of the region's history after
   1918. While in terms of political and social reality there is little to
   invite comparison between these two periods under scrutiny, the language
   of politics and popular sentiments do. Most importantly, and similarly
   to East Central Europe in the interwar period, fear of a radical change
   (be it Bolshevism as in 1917-1923 or the cultural revolution) is the
   main tool of conservative mobilization which represents the sole actual
   danger to the existing social and political order.},

Abstract = {Objective More than 50 percent of nonincumbent candidates competing in
   each of the 2010-2016 election cycles for seats in the House used loans
   to supplement their campaign revenue streams but their use remains
   understudied.
   Method Using both summary and quarterly campaign reports from the U.S.
   Federal Election Commission 2010-2016, I examine the frequency, timing,
   and the types of loans utilized by nonincumbent House campaigns. I
   investigate which candidate characteristics and conditions lead to loan
   financing. And in a matching analysis, I test the impact of loaning
   financing at different points in time on inexperienced nonincumbent
   House candidates' competitiveness.
   Results I find loan financing in the primary election has a greater
   positive impact on inexperienced House candidates' vote margins than
   loan financing later in the election cycle.
   Conclusion The results suggest a number of best practices for
   nonincumbent candidates' use of loans.},

Title = {``Lost Cause{''} Memories and Cultural Amnesias: Mayor Mitch Landrieu's
   Tragicomic Speech on Confederate Monument Removals},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective This essay examines the rhetorical strategies used in former
   New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's speech explaining the city's decision
   to remove several Confederate memorials.
   Method The author performs a Burkean rhetorical analysis to the
   transcript and social context of Landrieu's May 19, 2017, speech.
   Additionally, the author applies frameworks of visual rhetoric, public
   memory, and third persona to engage Landrieu's construction of the
   memorials' meaning and their amnesias.
   Results Landrieu used identification, a nuanced commemorative rhetorical
   analysis, and a comic frame to explain both the lure and the damaging
   falsehood of the Lost Cause narrative that the memorials represent. He
   reserved the tragic frame for those who continue to support the Lost
   Cause narrative.
   Conclusions In this rhetorical move, Landrieu divides monument
   supporters between those explicitly tied to the Confederate cause of
   white supremacy-these people are consciously evil-and those who have
   been hoodwinked by the monuments' narrative-for these people, he offers
   redemption. The tragicomic frame made Landrieu's speech well received
   nationally and revealed promise through its distinction between
   supporters of white supremacy and passive adopters of the memorials'
   narratives. However, it did not appear to persuade monument supporters,
   revealing the limitations of an agency-centered approach to combating
   the Lost Cause narrative.},

Title = {The Trichan takedown: Lessons in the governance and regulation of child
   sexual abuse material},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Amidst renewed concern about the prevalence of online child sexual abuse
   material, the global technology sector is refocusing on models of
   multistakeholder governance and the development of new technological
   solutions. This paper argues that the language of multistakeholderism
   and technological solutionism obscures the administrative and commercial
   practices that facilitate the widespread distribution of abuse material.
   To illustrate this point, the paper describes the 2019 intervention of
   the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in the operations of
   ``Trichan{''}, three websites that were amongst the largest purveyors of
   abuse material on the open web for 7 years. The case study underscores
   the materiality of the Internet and the role of commercial relations
   within the infrastructure stack in the provision of illegal content.
   While identifying opportunities for the mass removal of abuse material,
   the paper questions the discretion granted to technology companies under
   laissez faire regulation, and troubles characterizations of Internet
   infrastructure as neutral and instrumental factors in the epidemic
   availability of abuse material.},

Title = {Frontiers' violence: The interplay of state of exception, frontier
   habitus, and organized violence},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As global capitalism is expanding to the most remote areas of the world,
   the notion of ``frontier{''}, where competing social orders are
   contesting each other, is gaining traction in academic analyses.
   Contemporary frontiers are associated with resource exploitation in
   marginalized spaces and processes of socioecological transformation,
   which are characterized as particularly violent. This article offers a
   conceptual contribution to the frontier debate by putting violence in
   the center of a frontier concept. Building on a sociology of violence,
   this approach assumes that every social order comes with some form of
   organized violence. We argue that the frontier is characterized by a
   tidal passage: Existing orders and their institutions, which socially
   embed and constrain a particular use of violence, are challenged by an
   expansive order which comes along with new formations of violence,
   leading to a reorganization of violence. Thus the frontier describes a
   momentum in which the interplay of social order and organized violence
   becomes highly disputed. Representatives of the expansive order refuse
   to recognize existing orders and favour a state of exception, in which
   law is set aside to impose the new order.},

Abstract = {Objective The study investigates the relationship between perceived
   loneliness and the individuals' attitude whether voting is a civic duty.
   With that, it is the first study to shed light on the mechanism linking
   perceived loneliness to voting behavior.
   Methods Two independent, cross-sectional, and representative datasets
   from Germany (n = 1641) and the Netherlands (n = 1431) are analyzed.
   Results The regression results and effect decomposition techniques show
   that loneliness is associated with reduced intention to vote as well as
   a lower sense of duty to vote. The effect of loneliness on voting
   behavior is partially mediated through a reduced sense of duty.
   Conclusion Loneliness is associated with political disengagement. The
   study provides empirical evidence that the relationship between
   loneliness and turnout is partially mediated through sense of duty. This
   showcases that lonely individuals tend to feel detached from society and
   are less likely to feel obligated to participate in the electoral
   process.},

Abstract = {A key claim in the study of emotions is that anger makes people less
   responsive to risks, whereas fear makes people more responsive. Although
   risk is a fundamental concern in the area of military conflict, no
   studies have directly tested whether anger and fear moderate the impact
   of risk on public support for war. We test this key claim with casualty
   risks as our case. Across five experiments (N = 4,559), utilizing
   well-established treatment material to vary casualty risk and induce
   emotions, we replicate the central finding that higher casualty risk
   decreases support for war. Emotions, however, do not moderate the effect
   of risk. These findings, combined with limitations in existing research,
   raise debate about the empirical robustness of the prominent
   emotion-risk interaction as well as widely used emotion inductions.},

Abstract = {This study examined interviewer gender effects on attitudes toward male
   and female journalists in a survey experiment in six Arab countries.
   Respondents (N = 5,040) in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
   Tunisia, and UAE were read a scenario, by a male or female interviewer,
   of either a male or female journalist covering a political scandal, and
   were then asked about the journalist's perceived credibility.
   Interviewer gender affected ratings of journalist conscientiousness in
   four of six countries (positively in Tunisia and UAE, and negatively in
   Jordan and Lebanon), and negatively affected knowledgeability ratings in
   Lebanon. Implications for research on media credibility, gender bias,
   and survey research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Through what processes does territory facilitate the formation and
   growth of a grassroots party organization? Despite an extensive
   literature into why parties favour a territorial model of activist
   organization, much less is known about how territory facilitates
   grassroots party-building. The paper addresses this question by drawing
   on qualitative research with a centre-left Argentine party named Nuevo
   Encuentro (NE), focusing on the period of its growth in the City of
   Buenos Aires (CABA) between 2011 and 2017. NE is a typical case study of
   a party that sought to establish itself and grow via the build-up of a
   territorial organization. Bridging across, and extending, literatures on
   party organization and the geographies of activism, the paper argues
   that territory facilitates grassroots party-building through three
   interrelated processes. First, territory facilitates the recruitment of
   party activists by providing a relational context for building shared
   political subjectivities. Second, the territoriality of the branch as a
   site of political organization provides social proximity that nurtures
   the building of new bonds and strong-tie relations. Third, following
   recruitment, territory supports that reproduction of party activism
   through place-based attachment and emotional ties. These interrelated
   processes are considered through an analysis of three NE branches in
   CABA.},

Abstract = {Chinese outbound tourism is extending into new frontiers, including the
   Arctic. In this region, where the Chinese state does not claim
   territorial sovereignty, it seeks to exert its influence by other means.
   One strategy involves the development of `tourism resources', which the
   government's 2018 Arctic Policy promotes. In line with recent work
   interrogating the geopolitics of tourism, we draw on a review of policy
   and media documents complemented by field observations to interrogate
   how the Chinese state and enterprises seek to envision, regulate and
   extract value from three key forms of tourism resources: individuals,
   infrastructure and data. Empirically, we advance knowledge of the
   politics and processes underlying Chinese tourism in a new region.
   Theoretically, we contribute to a critical geopolitics that reflects
   upon how governments can develop resources and exercise authority in
   spaces where they lack territorial sovereignty and where physical
   territory may be altogether absent, as in the high seas or cyberspace.
   This study is particularly timely in light of the Chinese state's
   expanding governance of areas and issues experiencing calls for
   international cooperation, including not only the Arctic but also the
   global commons, the internet and climate change.},

Title = {The Transferability of Out-Group Contact: Does Knowing a Member of the
   LGBT Community Improve Feelings Toward Racial Minorities, Muslims, and
   Immigrants?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {102},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective This article seeks to establish a positive relationship
   between in-group contact with members of one particular out-group and
   affect toward all out-groups. I hope to provide early evidence that
   contact with one specific out-group may have a transferable effect on
   feelings toward all out-groups.
   Methods Using data from the American National Election Study, I use a
   series of regression models to estimate the effect of Lesbian, Gay,
   Bisexual and Transsexual (LGBT) contact on authoritarianism, social
   dominance orientation, and ethnocentrism as well as feeling thermometers
   toward Muslims, undocumented immigrants, Latinos, Asian Americans, and
   blacks. I also analyze the effect of LGBT contact on political issues
   that affect other out-groups.
   Results I find that contact with a member of the LGBT community is
   negatively associated with ethnocentrism, authoritarianism, and social
   dominance orientation. It is also positively associated with feelings
   toward Muslims, undocumented immigrants, and racial minorities. It also
   seems to be correlated with political positions that affect these
   groups, though these results are less robust.
   Conclusions This article provides preliminary support for the hypothesis
   that out-group contact has transferable effects. It suggests that
   contact with members of one out-group may affect how in-group members
   see all out-groups.},

Abstract = {Following the uprisings of 2011, only a few Arab countries have made

Abstract = {This paper takes a closer look at how the relation between liberalism
   and democracy has been addressed by different strands of the liberal
   tradition. Its purpose is to argue in support of two claims. Firstly,
   the claim that discourse on what the two ideals are about, and how they
   are related to one another, has been impaired by a failure to pay due
   attention to the distinction between the question of legitimacy and the
   question of institutional expediency. Secondly, the claim that, when the
   noted distinction is taken into account, the two ideals can be shown to
   complement each other in their outlook at how social and political life
   should be organized.},

Abstract = {This article unpacks how state-led borderwork from above is dynamically
   and creatively negotiated and navigated from below by migrants and
   smugglers. It identifies certain everyday borderwork assemblages and
   describes the struggles that produce social and material infrastructure
   and geographical reconfigurations of mobility. The empirical material
   presented in this study is drawn from legal and policy reviews,
   life-story interviews with return migrants and key informant interviews
   with refugees, smugglers and migration-governing actors. In the Horn of
   Africa in recent years, Ethiopia has become a major sending and transit
   country of migrants and asylum-seekers. This development has generated
   both internal political challenges, as well as Epsilon U pressure on the
   Ethiopian government to introduce legislative and organisational
   structures to control clandestine migratory exits from and refugee
   transitions through Ethiopia. In exchange, the EU extends various
   promises to provide, for example, development aid and economic
   cooperation. However, the external pressure calling for stricter border
   controls and Ethiopia's tighter migration laws have not stopped
   clandestine migration and refugee transits, nor have they facilitated
   safe and orderly migration, as promised. The article argues that
   migrants, their families and brokers continuously struggle and develop
   new strategies to redirect and spatially reconfigure migratory
   departures, despite the new restrictions. These are manifested in
   Ethiopia by the emergence of dynamic forms of clandestine migration
   pathways and complex smuggling arrangements facilitating migration to
   the Middle East and southern Africa.},

Abstract = {The employment of asymmetric decentralization to deal with separatist
   conflicts has become increasingly popular in recent years. However,
   contentions remain as to whether it is an effective tool to deal with
   separatist conflict. This article extends the debate by looking
   specifically at the conditions that affect the effectiveness of
   decentralization. It argues that the workability of decentralization in
   dealing with separatist conflicts is affected by the degree of
   accommodation in both the process of designing the policy and the policy
   outcomes it succeeds to bring. It pursues this argument qualitatively by
   using the cases of Aceh and Papua in Indonesia. Decentralization
   successfully tamed the separatist conflict in Aceh because it involved
   separatist elements in designing the plan and succeeded in achieving
   most of the promised outcomes. In contrast, decentralization failed to
   tame separatist demands in Papua because it enabled only limited
   participation of separatist elements in the design process and brought
   only limited outcomes.},

Abstract = {Alarmism has enabled the extension and reconfiguration of sovereign
   power at thresholds of human mobility in ways that exemplify the
   shifting and polymorphic nature of borders. Extending critical
   geopolitical scholarship on alarmism and the geographies of bordering,
   this paper examines how alarmism is used to exert control over
   legal-discursive thresholds that people must cross to gain political
   asylum in the US. By analysing the most ambiguous area of asylum
   protection: proving that persecution is motivated by one's ``membership
   in a particular social group{''}, I demonstrate how refugee definitions
   are often contested and changed in response to ``floodgate fears{''}, a
   type of alarmist legal argumentation. Rather than addressing the merits
   of an individual asylum case, the floodgate argument invites speculation
   about the effects a particular juridical decision will have on future
   cases, and therein translates wider racist, nationalist fears of being
   overwhelmed by alien ``others{''} into otherwise banal legal codes. In
   precedent-setting asylum law, these fear-laden speculations can shape
   legal-discursive thresholds for years to come, enacting targeted
   exclusion and widening the pool of ``legitimate{''} targets of evolving
   border enforcement tactics. This analysis of legal alarmism and the
   formation of asylum case law focuses on the unique relationship between
   the particular social group threshold and the history and contemporary
   struggles of Central American asylum seekers.},

Abstract = {A large body of research exists concerning determinants of public
   opinion on immigration and immigrants, primarily based on Western
   countries. Given that South-South migratory flows have increased
   dramatically in recent decades, we contribute to the literature by
   analyzing cross-national probability data in the Asian context. Using
   multilevel modeling, we derive and test economic and cultural hypotheses
   concerning natives' support for restrictive immigration policy. Results
   show that at the individual level, along with xenophobic tendency,
   personal financial insecurity, unequal material distribution in society,
   and sociotropic economic concern all significantly predict the outcome.
   As a theoretical contribution, contextual effects are also reported:
   living in a subnational region with more national pride and with higher
   parochialism is positively associated with it.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {52-69},
Abstract = {As members of a stigmatised intersectional group, Muslim women in
   Hungary not only receive unwanted attention but also verbal/physical
   attacks, assaults, and hate crimes. What kind of individual strategies
   and collective resilience patterns have they developed to cope with or
   to improve the hazardous situations they experience? This paper utilises
   participant observation data and qualitative interviews to study these
   issues. Two major dimensions of the participants' strategies were
   detected: active versus Passive and Individual versus Collective.
   Exposition of these coping strategies was also accompanied by discussing
   the relevance of the types of reactions to threatened identity as
   suggested by Breakwell's social identity theory-inspired model and
   Pargament's studies on religious resilience practices.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The joint development by Belarus and China of the Great Stone Industrial
   Park (GSIP) is designed to establish a high-tech industrial zone and an
   eco-friendly satellite city of Minsk as a key node on the Eurasian Land
   Bridge linking China with the Eurasian Economic Union and the European
   Union. The development and organization of the GSIP are explained in the
   light of a coupling of the strategic goals of the two countries in the
   context of a new Chinese model of external engagement called an emergent
   geo-political economic culture. These goals include Belarus' desire to
   reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil, upgrade and diversify its
   economy, strengthen its integration with Eurasia and find new partners,
   by attracting Chinese and other foreign direct investment in the context
   of China's Going Out and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An analysis of
   the roles of national leaders Aliaksandr Lukashenka and Xi Jinping and
   of different stakeholders in the predominantly top-down design,
   development and governance of the park reveals the way in which a BRI
   cooperation platform permits the coupling of Chinese and Belarusian
   interests and strategies in ways through which each side expects to
   benefit.},

Title = {MODERATING EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
   FOREIGN AID AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-478},
Abstract = {Africa has received considerable amounts of external aid over the last
   two decades without significant improvements in socio-economic
   conditions on the continent. This study, therefore, examines the effects
   of foreign aid on growth in Africa, and how institutional quality can
   moderate these effects. The study used the system generalized method of
   moments estimation technique and a panel of forty-two African countries
   over the period 2010-2018. Interestingly, the study established that
   even though foreign aid impacts negatively on growth in Africa,
   improving the quality of institutions on the continent can reverse this
   negative effect. In fact, the study computed a threshold value of
   institutional quality beyond which foreign aid would be a blessing to
   Africa. This implies that for foreign aid to contribute meaningfully to
   growth in Africa, the quality of institutions should improve beyond this
   threshold. Unfortunately, the average level of institutional quality in
   Africa is presently below this threshold. The study concluded that
   policymakers in Africa should take urgent steps to strengthen the
   quality of institutions on the continent as a means of exploiting the
   continent's huge foreign aid to drive growth and reduce the excruciating
   effects of poverty plaguing more than half of its population.},

Abstract = {This text tries to expose some of the central ideas of the Theory of
   Justice of the North American philosopher John Rawls. First, I will
   examine the general characteristics of the two principles of justice;
   secondly, I will analyze how these principles are developed in a
   democratic state in what Rawls calls the ``four-stage sequence{''}.
   Having exposed the above, I will concentrate on two of those four
   stages: on the one hand, I will relate the second of the four stages to
   the theory of popular constitutionalism (constituent power), a central
   concept in modern constitutionalism. On the other hand, I will study the
   last stage of this sequence facing the role of the judge in Colombia,
   specifically in relation to the constitutional control of law. Finally,
   I will try to show how the reception of the North American author has
   been in the jurisprudence of the Colombian Constitutional Court.},

Abstract = {The study provides estimates of the size of the fatherhood premium for
   the Czech Republic in the years 2006-2017, using data from the EU SILC
   survey. In the years 2006-2009, the fatherhood premium in the Czech
   Republic does not manifest itself if explanatory variables include the
   marriage premium and the partner's labour market participation. The
   fatherhood premium only starts to express itself in 2010 and the
   following years, when it reaches values from 11\% to 15\% as a
   consequence of a decision of families with high-income fathers to have a
   third child in the years after 2010.},

Title = {Polarization Between the Rich and the Poor? The Dynamics and Structure

Abstract = {Citizens' support for redistribution varies largely between and within
   countries. An important empirical challenge in this field is the
   scarcity of comparative data, which this study overcomes by designing a
   novel time-series cross-sectional dataset that spans more than three
   decades in seven European countries. Using nearly 300 surveys and a
   dyadic ratios algorithm, we estimate aggregate redistributive
   preferences for each country, as well as for population strata within
   countries based on household income. We then ask to what extent support
   for redistribution varies across the rich and the poor. We find that
   citizens are not systematically becoming more reluctant toward or more
   supportive of redistribution. While redistributive preferences of the
   rich and the poor do not strictly move in parallel, there is no
   polarization between the two. Moreover, both the demand for
   redistribution and the preference gap between the rich and the poor
   evolve in a cyclical way.},

Abstract = {How do social movements respond to geopolitical uncertainties and
   mobilize aspirations and imagined futures for progressive social change?
   Building on scholarship on social movements and imagined futures, this
   article provides an empirical analysis of Taiwan's marriage equality
   movement as it navigated the shifting horizon of the nation's future.
   With the economic and diplomatic rise of mainland China, Taiwan has
   confronted with an increasing international isolation due to the
   nation's lack of widespread external legitimacy as a nation-state. Given
   this geopolitical context, Taiwan's marriage equality movement not
   simply drew on the globalized notion of equal rights for same-sex
   couples. Instead, it rearticulated the meaning of `equality' of sexual
   minorities in parallel to Taiwan's aspirational equal status as a
   nation-state in the global sphere. Through the intimate entanglement of
   LGBT rights claims and sovereign aspirations, the marriage equality
   movement became a powerful emblem of the national vision that
   differentiated Taiwan from mainland China. This article thus provides
   new insights for scholarship on social movements and imagined futures,
   geopolitics, and gender and sexual rights movements.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the impact of religious oppositions in
   Muslim-majority states towards security cooperation with the U.S. Such
   cooperation provides security but is risky as the U.S. can coerce its
   weaker allies and push for regime change. To protect against this
   possibility, this paper suggests that incumbents in recipient states
   strategically extend or limit cooperation based on the strength of
   Islamist opposition parties. Weaker Islamist oppositions pose a threat
   to incumbents in recipient states as the U.S. can coerce and replace
   them without fear of bringing anti-U.S. elements to power, which results
   in lower cooperation. In case of a stronger Islamist opposition, the
   regime's replacement cannot offer better policy concessions to the U.S.;
   hence, a strong Islamist opposition leads to more extensive cooperation.
   This mechanism is demonstrated through U.S. military aid acceptance in
   40 Muslim-majority states during 2002-2015, and a comparison of U.S.
   security relations with Algeria and Tunisia.},

Abstract = {In the context of increasing concerns about false and deceptive
   information in public opinion, this research note explores which causes
   and sources news users associate with the dissemination of
   misinformation. Based on representative survey data collected in the
   Netherlands (N = 1,994), we found that news users distinguish
   unintentional causes related to uncertain evidence and lacking expert
   knowledge from politically or financially motivated falsehoods. People
   on the left-wing of the political spectrum associate falsehoods more
   with the radical-right, whereas those on the right-wing tend to
   associate misinformation with the radical-left. Right-wing participants,
   however, are most likely to perceive misinformation as driven by a
   deliberate attempt to hide reality. Our findings point to an ideological
   bias in information credibility that could foster polarization along
   epistemic lines.},

Abstract = {We model a two-party electoral game with rationally inattentive voters.
   Parties are endowed with different administrative competencies and
   announce a fiscal platform to be credibly implemented in case of
   electoral success. The budgetary impact of each platform depends on the
   party's competence and on a stochastic implementation shock. Voters rely
   on the announced platform to infer a party's unobserved competence. In
   addition, voters receive noisy signals on the impact of each fiscal
   platform with noise depending ultimately on a voter's cognitive skills.
   We predict that the interplay between the desire of parties to win the
   election (the incentive to manipulate voters' beliefs) and voters' (lack
   of) cognitive skills (the scope for manipulation) distorts fiscal
   policies towards excessive budget deficits. The mechanism is that
   parties attempt to manipulate inferences on their competencies by
   implementing a loose fiscal policy. The predictions are tested
   empirically on a sample of advanced economies over years 1999-2008. Our
   results remain stable after controlling for potentially confounding
   differences across countries and over time, along with unobserved
   heterogeneity. Finally, alternative mechanisms potentially driving our
   results are investigated and ruled out.},

Abstract = {The dramatic increase in the number of forced migrants and asylum
   seekers in Europe in the past decade, and the national redistribution
   policies aimed at diffusing the `burden' of reception across national
   territories, have led mayors in small towns in rural areas to face the
   challenges of reception in their communities. In this study, we analyse
   how this challenge was dealt with in three mountain valleys in the
   Alpine area of Turin, in the North-West of Italy, where in 2014 the
   prefecture opened emergency shelters overnight and without consulting
   with the municipalities. Results from our research show that, in
   contrast to the thesis that mayors are pragmatic problem-solvers because
   of their proximity to the issues at hand, the local governance of asylum
   seekers' reception is the result of the mobilization of relational and
   reputational resources on the part of community leaders. Mayors of small
   towns in rural areas will proactively engage on migrants' reception only
   insofar as they can rely on and are willing to mobilize such crucial
   resources. When mayors fall short of relational and reputational
   resources, community leaders can eventually fill the gaps and contribute
   to `embedding' national policies in the local community.},

Abstract = {Can residents of Ukraine discern between pro-Kremlin disinformation and
   true statements? Moreover, which pro-Kremlin disinformation claims are
   more likely to be believed, and by which audiences? We present the
   results from two surveys carried out in 2019-one online and the other
   face-to-face-that address these questions in Ukraine, where the Russian
   government and its supporters have heavily targeted disinformation
   campaigns. We find that, on average, respondents can distinguish between
   true stories and disinformation. However, many Ukrainians remain
   uncertain about a variety of disinformation claims' truthfulness. We
   show that the topic of the disinformation claim matters. Disinformation
   about the economy is more likely to be believed than disinformation
   about politics, historical experience, or the military. Additionally,
   Ukrainians with partisan and ethnolinguistic ties to Russia are more
   likely to believe pro-Kremlin disinformation across topics. Our findings
   underscore the importance of evaluating multiple types of disinformation
   claims present in a country and examining these claims' target
   audiences.},

Abstract = {Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in
   Economics for improvement to auction theory and inventions of new
   auction formats. This article presents their contributions with a focus
   on the practical applications of their work. First, we show how their
   theoretical work led to an understanding of how auctions work when
   valuations are common and uncertain. Then we highlight the considerable
   influence of Wilson on the design of electricity markets after the
   liberalisation of this sector. Finally, we show how P. Milgrom and R.
   Wilson contributed to design multi-object auctions implemented to
   allocate licenses to the broadcast spectrum used for wireless
   communications.},

Abstract = {Objective U.S. politicians use social media to engage directly with
   citizens, though the motivations that determine the choice to use social
   media remain opaque. We argue that there is a clear ``electoral
   connection{''} in using social media that exceeds the influence of other
   motivations. Politicians use social media to cultivate support from
   electorally relevant actors. Methods We analyze Twitter usage from 2017
   to 2020 by state attorneys general (AGs), who vary in being appointed or
   elected. Results We find that elected AGs are more likely to have
   Twitter accounts, use the accounts more often, and receive more
   engagement from other users as a result. We also find that they automate
   their tweeting more often. We replicate our primary findings on state
   secretaries of state and find similar results. Conclusion Our findings
   point to the importance of elections for motivating social-media use by
   politicians.},

Title = {Rigid rules and slippery standards: How the nature of US Supreme Court
   precedents influences subsequent state court treatments},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2894-2906},

Abstract = {Objective This research develops a new theoretical framework that
   explains how the U.S. Supreme Court's decision between a rigid rule and
   a flexible standard influences compliance with the decisions of state
   high courts over time. Methods To assess the effects of doctrinal rules
   and standards on state court compliance, we apply our theoretical
   framework to an examination of state court responses to Miller v.
   California (1973) and Atkins v. Virginia (2002). Results Our findings
   show that doctrinal characteristics of Supreme Court precedents
   influence state court treatments. Our central theoretical argument
   posits that applications and positive treatments of deterministic rules
   should decrease the likelihood of future positive treatments, whereas
   applications and positive treatments of indeterministic standards should
   increase the likelihood of future positive treatment. Our findings
   provide support for this expectation. Conclusion This research
   demonstrates the importance of doctrinal characteristics in shaping
   state court compliance with U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Our findings
   suggest that rigid, deterministic rules, and slippery indeterministic
   standards influence lower court compliance in unique ways.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {In this paper I respond to the central claims presented in Samuel Moyn's
   influential book, Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World. Moyn
   argues that human rights have the following features: they are powerless
   to combat growing material inequality; they share key characteristics
   with neoliberalism; they make only minimalist or sufficientarian demands
   and therefore are not enough to achieve the equality demanded by
   justice. He suggests, in particular, that Henry Shue's Basic Rights
   exemplifies these features. My response argues that Moyn does not
   accurately present the core conceptual and normative characteristics of
   human rights, nor does he succeed in implicating Shue's conception in
   his critique. I suggest that Moyn's own ideas about global justice are
   incompletely developed, including his views about the scope, content,
   and distributive principles that should guide an account of global
   justice. Finally, I argue that, even though human rights are only part
   of an account of global justice, nonetheless they do provide reasons to
   limit socioeconomic inequality. This point is exemplified by the claim
   that a human right to democracy requires limits on material inequality
   in order to prevent power hierarchy. In short, I agree with Moyn that
   human rights are not enough by themselves to achieve global justice, but
   I reject his multi-pronged critique of human rights, specifically his
   claim that they imply no constraints on socioeconomic inequality.},

Abstract = {This article analyses immigrant sanctuary policies and practices in San
   Francisco between 1985 and 2018 to theorise about the role of mayors in
   developing, defending, and adjusting city efforts to shield undocumented
   immigrants from federal immigration authorities. Drawing on assorted
   qualitative data, it makes the case that the multilevel context of US
   immigration policy is an important determinant for how mayors have
   addressed immigration issues locally. In particular, it highlights two
   strategies that San Francisco mayors have used to influence sanctuary
   policies and practices while navigating ongoing intergovernmental
   scrutiny of the city's lenient treatment of undocumented immigrants.
   When the risk of intergovernmental antagonism over city policies and
   practices was low, mayors adopted facilitative, democratic leadership
   strategies characterised by collaboration with local governmental and
   non-governmental actors to strengthen or institutionalise immigrant
   sanctuary. When the risk of intergovernmental antagonism was high,
   mayors retreated to executive, less democratic leadership strategies
   characterised by top-down decision-making and mayoral insulation from
   local political actors to curtail immigrant sanctuary and protect the
   city from state or federal attacks. This research illustrates how state
   and federal interference in city affairs can make it challenging for
   mayors to govern democratically by collaborating with other local
   actors.},

Abstract = {Immigration policies in western democracies have often been contrary to
   the predictions of the mainstream theory of international economics.
   Political parties that are predicted to adopt policies beneficial for
   lower-income constituents have not protected workers from labor-market
   competition. Nor have workers been protected from a fiscal burden of
   financing incomes and benefits for welfare-dependent immigrants. We
   explain the contradiction by immigrants being future voters. We give a
   hearing to alternative interpretations.},

Abstract = {Historical research is always in danger of being made use of for
   explaining and illustrating instead of testing one's theoretical
   conceptions. Since Marxist historical research has certainly not been
   exempt from this temptation, one has to start any debate about Marxist
   historiography with the demand to accord empirical research the chance
   to shake even the cornerstones of one's own theoretical conceptions. In
   a paper that has triggered off a new discussion on `Political Marxism,
   Samuel Knafo and Benno Teschke insist on such a practice. In what
   follows I try to position the ongoing discussion in the wider context of
   theoretical concepts of Marxist historiography.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that Knafo and Teschke fundamentally misread Brenner's
   original contribution to the transition debate. They equate his
   rejection of trans-historical or trans-modal laws of motion with the
   notion that social-property relations do not have strong rules of
   reproduction that structure the actions of agents and give rise to
   `devel-opmental patterns' specific to each form of social labour. Knafo
   and Teschke's critique of Brenner's analysis of capitalist expansion and
   crisis is also theoretically and empiri-cally questionable.},

   ecology of climate change},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that othering is central to the government of
   climate change. Critically engaging with Foucault's ideas on biopolitics
   and racism, we elaborate a conceptual perspective for analysing how such
   a ``technology of government{''} operates. We review diverse literatures
   from geography, political ecology, critical adaptation studies and the
   environmental humanities dealing with discursive constructions of the
   other in three exemplary areas of intervention-mitigation (particularly
   ``green{''} mineral extraction for renewable energy production);
   constructions of ``vulnerability{''} in adaptation policies; and the
   governing of ``climate migrants{''}. We contend that these interventions
   largely work through the extension of capitalist relations, underpinned
   by racist and colonial ways of seeing populations and territories as
   ``in need of improvement{''}. And that, by legitimising and
   depoliticizing such interventions, and by suspending responsibility for
   their unwanted or even deadly im-pacts, othering helps to preserve
   existing relations of racial, patriarchal and class domination in the
   face of climate-induced social upheavals. Othering, we conclude, is not
   only a feature of fossil fuelled development, but a way of functioning
   of capitalist governmentality more broadly-which has important
   implications for thinking about emancipatory and climate-just
   transformations.},

Abstract = {Every taxable arrangement is subject to an anti-abuse test. Abusive
   arrangements are treated as not valid for tax purposes, which is similar
   to the treatment of artificial arrangements in civil law. The European
   Union has introduced in its Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive a general
   anti-abuse test which must be transposed into the domestic laws of
   Member States. Such a test has its inner structure, consisting of an
   elimination and requalification stage, while the elimination stage
   entails genuineness and a tax benefit test. The general anti-abuse test
   has a great potential (or scalability when speaking in the language of
   start-ups) of being automated and integrated into different legal
   application processes (such as taxpayer self-assessment systems,
   transactions certified by public notary or merger and acquisition deals)
   to discover debt push down abuses or other arrangement structures which
   may have abusive content. While the best method for create a reliable
   algorithm is a decision tree type model, the inner ambiguity of the
   general anti-abuse test prevents using the full benefits of automation
   of tax laws. The purpose of this article is to design a decision tree
   type model for the test and address the main challenges of such a model,
   both from the perspective of the clarity of concepts and the quality of
   input information such an engine would use.},

Abstract = {Asian Americans are the fastest growing and most diverse minority in the
   United States, but they have become more alike in terms of their
   partisan preferences and increasing politicization. Evidence for these
   changes can be found in two National Surveys of Asian Americans, the
   first of which was completed in 2008 and showed that Asian Americans
   were mostly nonpartisans but also that those who were partisans tended
   to support the Democratic Party. The second survey, completed in 2016,
   however, indicated that there was an increase in the proportion of
   democratic identifiers and, also, a significant decline in the
   proportion of nonpartisans with a concomitant rise in the number of
   purposive Independents. These shifts suggest that there has been a
   distinct politicization of Asian Americans, and our purpose in this
   article is to identify and calibrate the factors that account for these
   partisan shifts.},

Abstract = {This article approaches the process of opening accommodation centres
   from the perspective of mayors in rural municipalities. Although the
   allocation and accommodation of refugees is a competence of the
   nation-state, it is in the realm of municipalities where reception
   policies transform into social practices. Mayors have to negotiate
   socio-political conflicts on the vertical and horizontal dimensions
   against the background of uneven decision-making structures stemming
   from multi-governance arrangements and conflicting claims of local
   citizens. Through qualitative interviews with mayors from rural
   municipalities in four European countries (Austria, France, Germany and
   Italy), we show that even though national asylum systems differ, mayors
   assume similar handling strategies to defuse conflicts and increase
   acceptance. We introduce the concept of `politics of adjustment' to
   describe the simultaneous process of people adapting to a new situation
   as well as the alteration of implementation practices according to the
   needs of the municipality. Mayors modify the tight legal framework of
   reception policies to find a local consensus on accommodation, whilst
   steering the socio-political process of demarcation and othering that
   leaves imaginaries on rural whiteness and homogeneity unchallenged.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which different
   health problems among Syrian refugees in Turkey can be traced back to
   three different conditions in Syria (Family Member Killed, House
   Damaged, and Income) as well as to Commonality among Neighbors back in
   Syria as well as in Turkey. As is common, the findings show their
   effects on mental health to be most common, especially among females,
   but also that (1) the effects on diseases and physical/mobility problems
   are also quite significant, (2) in most cases, the effects of income in
   Syria on Health adversities are positive, and (3) that some of these
   adverse effects have been growing over time since fleeing Syria.},

Abstract = {The article takes the approach of multilevel politics to analyse the way
   the presence of illegalized `transit migrants' is dealt with within the
   urban space of Ventimiglia - a medium-sized city located south of the
   French-Italian border - by the town government and its mayor after
   heightened French border controls. It focuses on the period between 2015
   and 2019. Within the unneutral and criminalizing framing of `transit
   migration', border towns have narrow room for political manoeuvre, and
   yet they can be seen as the contentious scene of migration policies and
   politics. Presented and justified as a pragmatic compromise between the
   migrants' humanitarian needs and the inhabitants' claims for security
   and decorum, Ventimiglia's municipal policy of encampment was built on
   cooperation, conflict and contestation with both higher tier authorities
   and grassroots civil society, thus showing an intricate system of
   multilevel politics. Followed by widespread discontent which partially
   translated into electoral disavowal, the town government's actions
   eventually reinforced the framing of `transit migration' policies as
   emergency measures and strengthened the migrants' invisibility and
   precariousness in the urban space. This ethnography-based case study
   thus provides greater understanding of the particularities of local and
   multilevel migration politics in border towns and how these contribute
   to shape and enhance the exclusionary border regime.},

   multiperspectival border studies. Lessons from the Western Sahara},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Contributing to the growing interest in multiperspectival border
   studies, this article advocates for a re-centring of subaltern
   geopolitics in the debate. Focusing empirically on Morocco's diplomatic
   dispute with the EU over the application of trade agreements to the
   Western Sahara (2015-2019), the analysis considers the geopolitical
   bordering of the controversy through the concepts of dependency and
   engagement to explain how the disputed territory both structured
   Morocco's disadvantageous relationship to the EU, while also giving rise
   to material and symbolic possibilities for the state leadership to
   subvert these geopolitical asymmetries in the late 2010s. The events are
   theorised through the combined lenses of critical border studies,
   subaltern geopolitics, and the politics of space to bring two
   complementary insights to the fore: (i) to insist that multiperspectival
   approaches account for the uneven landscape of borders, and the entities
   that act upon, animate, and transform geopolitical affairs from outside
   the dominant nodes of power and knowledge; conversely (ii) to
   destabilize prevailing binaries of geopolitical marginality and
   centrality through a reading of borders in an irreducibly multiple
   sense. Together, the analysis demonstrates the value of centring
   subaltern geopolitics in emerging debates on border multiplicity in the
   field today, while also avoiding the tendency to reinforce the spectacle
   of the border itself.},

Abstract = {Progressive liberalism was articulated in the mid-nineteenth century in
   Spain as an ideological trend. For several reasons, it has remained
   hidden beneath other discourses which have hegemonized the history of
   political cultures. However, thanks to the increasing research on
   progressive liberalism, we have today a more detailed knowledge of this
   movement, both regarding the different factions that formed it and the
   public figures that adhered to it, especially the writers that combined
   art and business with the diffusion of the political principles that
   they shared. Based on these previous investigations, this article
   proposes a reading of the opera Padilla or the siege of Medina,
   premiered in Madrid in 1845, which considers spaces of sociability
   linked to music and the political culture shared by its authors: the
   writer Gregorio Romero Larranaga and the composer Joaquin Espin y
   Guillen. Thus, this opera is contextualized in the delicate historical
   moment that led to the period known as the Moderate Decade, which
   favoured the use of specific symbols of progressivism -among others, the
   Comunero movement- with a clear communicative function. This
   contextualization is carried out in this article by using the press as
   the primary source and by placing the opera and its authors within the
   framework of three types of networks: social, media and intertextual
   ones. Ultimately, it shows that Padilla or the siege of Medina, a
   milestone in the development of Spanish national lyric theatre, was the
   result of artistic cooperation largely conditioned by political
   affinities.},

Abstract = {The diversification of information sources has reignited the controversy
   on media-induced fragmentation endangering social integration. The
   media's capability to set the public agenda and create issues as a
   common core is a pivotal part of the public sphere and contributes
   fundamentally to society's cohesion. Algorithm-driven sources like
   social media that personalize content to the preferences of individuals
   and their social networks are considered agents of fragmentation of the
   public sphere. Politically extreme individuals relying on them may be
   particularly vulnerable to losing touch with society's common core. We
   employ an innovative operationalization of fragmentation on the
   individual level: ``issue horizons{''}-comprising issue diversity, top
   issue focus, and issue overlap-to investigate how different information
   sources affect fragmentation. In a two-week daily diary, conducted 2016
   in Germany, 356 participants named the two most important political
   issues of each day and reported the issue-specific sources of
   information. Results show that social media reliance neither increases
   nor decreases the compatibility of individuals' issue horizons, but news
   media reliance significantly increases the compatibility of issue
   horizons among the politically more extreme. Not relying on news media
   (but rather on social media) means that politically extreme persons are
   at risk of losing touch with society's mainstream. This attests to the
   news media's ongoing, indispensable integration function. Using multiple
   sources of political information-including the news media-appears to be
   of paramount importance in ensuring that most citizens are aware of the
   most important issues facing the nation.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the role of local political leadership in
   municipal policy responses to the arrival of forced migrants. Initially,
   I bring together insights from research on leadership, migration and
   crisis management to develop a conceptual framework for studying local
   political leadership in the reception of forced migrants. To this end, I
   adopt an interactionist perspective and define local political
   leadership as the product of the interaction between mayors and their
   leadership environment (institutional and societal context).
   Subsequently, I apply this conceptual framework to a qualitative
   comparative case study, using data from desk research and fieldwork in
   two Greek municipalities. The findings indicate that differences in
   local political leadership can lead to the development of very different
   municipal policy responses in the field of forced migrants' reception.
   In particular, I argue that by exercising interactive and multilevel
   political leadership, mayors can increase their chances of advancing
   strategic policy objectives in migration governance, and by extension,
   strengthen the protection and fulfilment of migrants' fundamental
   rights. Finally, in the light of the conceptual and empirical insights
   arising from this research, I emphasize the need to improve the dialogue
   between leadership and migration scholars, and suggest questions for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Based on Chinese city-level panel dataset, this paper examines the
   effects of vertical fiscal imbalances (VFI) on local fiscal indiscipline
   in a partial fiscal decentralization setting. We find that higher VFI
   induces a form of fiscal indiscipline: a reduction of tax collection
   effort by local governments. In addition, by exploiting the unique
   Chinese fiscal institution of ``extra-budgetary{''} revenues, we show
   that in this case higher VFI does not alter local governments' tax
   collection effort. Even though local governments also possess full
   taxing power for ``extra-budgetary{''} revenues, these revenues do not
   contribute to the determination of central fiscal transfers to local
   governments, thus creating very different incentives for local
   governments response to VFI. Our results shed light on the working
   mechanism of the VFI and provide significant implications for improving
   the design of fiscal decentralization policy in China and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of low oil prices and heightened geopolitical
   risks on economic growth and investment in Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA) countries. We find that negative shocks to oil prices and
   positive shocks to geopolitical risk have adverse effects on GDP and
   investment. Moreover, we find that the impact of investment on GDP in
   MENA countries is muted when oil prices are low and/or geopolitical risk
   level is high. These findings cast doubts on the prospects of
   mega-project economic transformation plans as envisioned in 2030 visions
   for several MENA countries.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms have been found to be the primary gateway through
   which individuals are exposed to fake news. The algorithmic filter
   bubbles and echo chambers that have popularized these platforms may also
   increase exposure to fake news. Because of this, scholars have suggested
   disrupting the stream of congruent information that filter bubbles and
   echo chambers produce, as this may reduce the impact and circulation of
   misinformation. To test this, a survey experiment was conducted via
   Amazon MTurk. Participants read 10 short stories that were either all
   fake or half real and half fake. These treatment conditions were made up
   of stories agreeable to the perspective of Democrats, Republicans, or a
   mix of both. The results show that participants assigned to conditions
   that were agreeable to their political world view found fake stories
   more believable compared to participants who received a heterogeneous
   mix of news stories complementary to both world views. However, this
   ``break up{''} effect appears confined to Democratic participants;
   findings indicate that Republicans assigned to filter bubble treatment
   conditions believed fake news stories at approximately the same rate as
   their fellow partisans receiving a heterogeneous mix of news items. This
   suggests that a potential ``break up{''} may only influence more
   progressive users.},

Abstract = {On 18 November 1918, the independent Republic of Latvia was declared in
   an extremely complicated international and domestic environment-the
   First World War was still going on, empires were collapsing, and
   ethnically and ideologically diverse military troops were fighting
   within the boundaries of Latvian territory. Despite the historical
   context of a previously tense relationship between Latvians and other
   ethnic groups, representatives of all minorities fought next to Latvians
   against the enemies of the Latvian state. Up until 11 August 1920, when
   the Peace Treaty with the Soviet Russia was signed, the prospects of de
   jure recognition of the newly established state were blurred; yet, the
   defeat of the White forces in the Russian Civil War opened the long
   awaited ``window of opportunity{''}, as a result of which Latvia managed
   to achieve its international recognition on 26 January 1921. More than
   seventy years later, on 4 May 1990, when the Declaration of Independence
   was adopted by the Supreme Council of the Latvian Soviet Socialist
   Republic (SSR), the international and domestic situation was no less
   complicated. Latvia was forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union in
   1940 and became part of it, yet the economic and political deterioration
   of the Soviet Union, the national awakening in the Baltic States and
   other Soviet republics alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall gave
   momentum for the regime to change. On 21 August 1991, after the
   barricades and bloody clashes with the Soviet Special Purpose Police
   Units (OMON) in Riga on January and the failed coup d'etat in Moscow in
   August, Latvia's independence once again became a reality.
   In the events of the 1990s, the memories of 1918 and Latvia's
   independence in the period between the two world wars were crucial. It
   is manifested by the fact that Latvian statehood in 1991 was not
   established anew but restored. Acknowledging the importance of history
   on contemporary identification and policymaking, this article aims to
   provide an insight into the history of 1917-1922 and its resonance in
   the contemporary situation. Using the methodology of literature analysis
   and historical process-tracing it will reveal the complicated process of
   the state's formation and recognition in the period of 1917-1922, paying
   particular attention to the role of the minorities and diplomatic
   efforts. It will also uncover the resonance of the events of 1918-1922
   in the 1990s, when Latvia's independence from the Soviet Union was
   declared, focusing in particular on aspects defining the statehood of
   Latvia and its citizenship. In this part, it will be argued that the
   history of 1917-1922 was brought back when the statehood of Latvia was
   concerned, while overshadowed by fifty years of the Soviet occupation,
   when the citizenship issue was on the agenda. Indeed, not only ethnic
   Latvians but also minorities living in Latvia played a decisive role in
   the efforts of restoring Latvia's independence. However, as a result of
   the Citizenship Law,1 adopted in 1994, more than one-fourth of the
   population-in most cases, representatives of the Russian-speaking
   community-were denied citizenship. This practice contrasts the Act that
   had been adopted in the interwar period, when Latvian citizenship was
   granted to all ethnic groups who were living within the borders of the
   then agreed Latvian territory, notwithstanding their diverse ideological
   background. Given this fact, the article provides future research
   opportunities related to perceptions of history in contemporary
   policy-making.},

Abstract = {Although an active body of literature exists on the relationship between
   government size and corruption, different findings proliferate the
   literature due to the nuances of geographical context, methods, and
   variables employed. The paper employs the novel method of moment
   quantile regression with fixed effects over the period 1984-2018 to
   investigate the dynamic impact of government size and press freedom on
   corruption in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The main contribution
   is to examine the impact of government size and press freedom across the
   conditional distribution of corruption in SSA. The findings show that
   the impacts of government size and press freedom are heterogeneous
   across the conditional quantile distribution of corruption. Among the
   most corrupt countries in SSA, larger government size and press freedom
   significantly increase corruption. Some policy recommendations are
   offered based on these findings.},

Abstract = {In this study, we map the legal work seven U.S. digital consultancies
   and public relations firms undertook across social media and digital
   platforms of behalf of four foreign governments. We find these firms
   used a range of different strategies on social and digital media, very
   few of which featured legally required disclosures linking the content
   to their country of origin. Firms targeted journalists and other elites,
   but exactly how is not clear. Our most powerful findings regard what is
   absent. Our study reveals as much about the inconsistencies and
   inadequacies of the current FARA disclosure process and gaps in tech
   firms' ad archives as it does about the content and strategies of the
   messages themselves. We conclude with a series of recommendations for
   technology firms and the Department of Justice for enforcing FARA
   regulations as they relate to social and digital content.},

Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Prominent extant definitions of, and approaches to, parliamentary roles
   conflate roles and behaviour and, consequently, contain a latent
   behaviouralism that enfeebles the role that institutions and other
   structural features play in outcomes. To overcome such issues, this
   article makes the case for a historical institutionalist approach to the
   study of parliamentary roles, premised on a critical realist ontology
   and the figure of homo sentiens. Such an approach defines parliamentary
   roles in terms of sets of expectations impinging on incumbents of the
   social position of Member of Parliament and has a number of consequences
   for how we study parliamentary roles. Namely: the focus of research is
   squarely on legislative roles; attention is shifted away from focusing
   (so much or solely) on what MP s think; patterns of behaviour become the
   starting point for identifying parliamentary roles; and normative
   questions concerning the `goodness' of parliamentary roles and attendant
   parliamentary institutional architecture gain prominence.},

Abstract = {We develop a political economy theory of the endogenous emergence of
   fiscal crises based on the idea that the adjustment mechanism to a
   crisis favors some social groups, that may be induced ex-ante to vote
   for fiscal policies that are more likely to lead to a crisis. Greater
   levels of favoritism lead to a higher public debt and more frequent
   crises, as well as to higher public expenditure, if the favored group is
   large enough. We provide conditions under which the favored group
   strategically favors a weaker state's fiscal capacity and when
   constitutional limits on debt raise the utility of all poor.},

Title = {Does Legislative Institutionalization Impact Policy Adoption? New
   Evidence from the Colonial and Early State Legislatures 1757-1795},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1451-1465},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective. Using an original data set, I explore the impact of
   institutionalization on policy adoption using a case study of the use of
   sunset provisions across the 13 colonies and states from 1757 to 1795.
   This time frame allows for a thorough investigation of sunset provision
   use during the period in which the colonial legislatures were undergoing
   the institutionalization process, and had yet to develop standing
   committee systems. Methods. I employ a fractional logit regression to
   examine the effect of legislative institutionalization on the rate of
   sunset provision use. Results. As the colonial legislatures
   institutionalized, sunset provisions were less frequently used.
   Conclusion. Through exploring sunset provision use prior to partisanship
   and standing committee development, this study extends our understanding
   of the impact of institutionalization on policy adoption.},

Title = {Bureaucratic discrimination in electoral authoritarian regimes:
   Experimental evidence from Russia},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Are investors in electoral authoritarian regimes discriminated against
   for political activism? In this paper, we implement a simple experiment
   to test whether affiliation with the ruling party or the political
   opposition affects the probability that investors receive advice from
   investment promotion agencies in Russian regions. Between December 2016
   and June 2017, we sent 1504 emails with a short question and a number of
   randomized treatments to 188 investment promotion agencies in 70 Russian
   regions. Although investment promotion agencies are nominally
   depoliticized in Russia, we find that switching the political
   affiliation of a potential investor from the opposition party ?Yabloko?
   to the government party ?United Russia? on average increases the chances
   to receive a reply by 30\%. The effect strongly depends on regional
   levels of political competition, with higher levels of discrimination in
   regions that are less politically competitive.},

Abstract = {This article draws a typology of autonomy in the Northeast to examine
   how the Indian state territorially manages ethnic conflicts in its
   periphery. The differential nature and history of conflicts, and timing
   and mode of negotiation, are used as two broad explanatory variables to
   account for when, how and under what circumstances the Indian state is
   likely to recognize and accommodate self-determination/self-rule claims
   of territorially concentrated tribal groups, and simultaneously foster
   peace and stability. While timely, yet partial, recognition and
   accommodation of self-determination/self-rule claims of the Naga, Bodo
   and Manipur's tribal groups are considered necessary to promote peace
   and stability, they are found to be insufficient conditions to promote
   durable peace and stability unless they are supplemented by robust
   identity-preserving powers over land and resources, on the one hand, and
   power-sharing not only across India's multilevel federal polity -
   Centre, State and sub-State - but also within and across
   tribal/non-tribal groups, on the other hand. These findings have
   resonance in other deeply divided places, inter alia, Cyprus and Iraq
   where the failure to simultaneously recognize self-determination claims
   and envision robust power-sharing entail stalemated conflicts and
   instability.},

Title = {The spaces of Australian capitalism: Making `` place `` out of `` space
   `` in The Unknown Industrial Prisoner},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Radical geographers have emphasised the centrality of class relations to
   the production of social space. In particular, this literature makes the
   distinction between the homogenising ``abstract space{''} of global
   capital and meaningful, specific social ``places.{''} The tension
   between the two expresses itself in spatial forms, creating the
   landscapes of capitalism. This political-economic conception of space
   and place is generally under-explored in the Australian context,
   particularly regarding the highly important post-World War II Long Boom
   period. This article interrogates the spatiality of this epoch through
   David Ireland's award-winning novel The Unknown Industrial Prisoner.
   Rooted in the notion of literary geography, which argues that literature
   ``knows{''} things about the space of the society into which it is born,
   the article argues that Ireland portrays and handles in a particularly
   vivid and powerful way the dialectical articulations, simultaneously
   contradictory and intertwined, of space and place in the spatiality of
   Australian capitalism. Whilst he ultimately concludes that the powers of
   capital's abstract space dominate, he nevertheless demonstrates that
   through explicitly spatial projects of place-making, workers can attempt
   to impose their own political economy on the spatial form.},

Abstract = {This study examines how interviewers' gender and education affect the
   measured level of factual political knowledge by drawing on competing
   theoretical frameworks: stereotype threat theory and interviewer
   noncompliance with the instructions. Testing these mechanisms using
   survey data from the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES) and the
   German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we find no evidence for a
   stereotype threat effect, but seem to observe interviewer effects
   resulting from interviewer non-compliance. In Germany, respondents'
   measured level of knowledge was significantly higher when a male
   interviewer, regardless of his education, conducted the interview,
   compared with low educated female interviewers. This finding has
   implications for survey-based studies, which measure factual political
   knowledge, for example attempts to limit such effects should be made
   during the interviewer briefing.},

Abstract = {This study makes two contributions by, first, developing `variegated
   agglomeration of multi-scalar state spatial strategies' as a conceptual
   innovation for theorizing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), based,
   second, on the methodological angles of multi-scalar analysis. Taking
   the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and the China-Indochina Peninsula
   Economic Corridor (CICPEC) as a case study, the article argues that the
   latter is the path-dependent outcome of the former as a result of the
   spatial layering of competing and complementary state spatial
   strategies, emerging from the inter-scalar dynamics between (1) the
   Asian Development Bank (ADB), (2) the Chinese central government, and
   (3) Yunnan and Guangxi qua provincial governments. The case study
   identifies two distinct periods of inter-scalar dynamics between 1992
   and 2016, highlighting the shifting dynamics of horizontal and vertical
   scalar tensions emerging in response to different scale- and
   place-specific horizons of opportunities and challenges confronting
   differentially situated scalar actors. The conceptual innovation lays
   the groundwork for deepening our understanding of the BRI - and the
   context of the Chinese political economy from which it has emerged -
   through the analytical lens of multi-scalar analysis, opening up for the
   future possibility of examining the other constituent corridors.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the relationship between population ageing and
   sustainability of the EU countries' pension systems, and assesses how
   this relationship is affected by pension system design and parameters.
   The findings show that there is a link between population ageing and
   unsustainability of pension systems; however there are exceptions in
   both directions. Despite the significant problem of population ageing,
   pension systems of some countries are found to be sustainable and vice
   versa. The elements enhancing sustainability are, for example,
   hypothetical defined contribution accounts or linking the pension
   benefit or retirement age to demographic changes. The article also
   analyses the relative significance of population ageing determinants.
   Life expectancy appears to be the most significant determinant of
   population ageing.},

Title = {`Civilized States' and Situational Sovereignty: The Dilemmas of Romanian
   Neutrality, 1914-1916},

Abstract = {At the 1914 Crown Council, which decided to keep Romania neutral in
   1914, former Conservative prime minister Petre Carp offered his succinct
   and direct opinion about the direction of Romanian foreign policy in the
   opening days of the Great War. He admonished the Council that, if
   Romania wanted to remain among the `civilized states' (statele
   civilizate) it had to follow Germany and Austria-Hungary into war
   immediately. The idea of `civilized states' that dominated the remainder
   of the Crown Council was not merely an intersubjective social
   construction. It was a legal term of art in fin de siecle international
   law that could be applied in the real world. It was only the
   legally-civilized states that enjoyed the full panoply of rights,
   privileges, and protections under international law.
   This is a study of how Romania's policy-making elite, and Ion I. C.
   Bratianu's government, in particular, confronted the challenges of
   `situational sovereignty'. It asserts that, during Romania's two-year
   Period of Neutrality (3 August 1914-17 August 1916), Bratianu initially
   used bilateral conventions as both a method to establish recognition of
   Romania's status (or at least a guarantee of territorial integrity) and
   as a litmus test to determine which (if any) foreign powers recognized
   Romania as a legal equal. Although he was able to achieve a short-term
   victory of having an equality clause inserted into the August 1916
   political convention with the Entente, it is unclear if that clause
   could have been durable. Ultimately, Bratianu was trapped between a
   desire to secure Romania's recognition through international agreement,
   but confronted with the reality that Romania's lack of recognition as a
   legally-civilized equal meant those very conventions could be
   unenforceable.},

Title = {The field of solidarity in times of a pandemic: Results of an online

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Despite its central importance, solidarity is seldom analysed in a
   comprehensive manner. Most related studies target only specific aspects
   of its complex mechanisms, such as the functioning of redistributive
   systems, the private networks and practices of care, or civil society.
   Our study aims at providing a comprehensive analysis by understanding
   solidarity as a field in Bourdieu's sense: involving supportive
   interactions; competition for the related symbolic capital; illusio that
   provides legitimate frames of deservingness and respectability; and
   habitus depending on the broader structural position. To understand the
   contemporary solidarity field of Hungary, these dimensions are mapped
   all at once in a unified framework: types of problems and needs of
   individuals; sources and perceptions of received support; types of
   support provided to family members and friends; and finally, types of
   support provided to generalised others - these factors constitute the
   dimensions of a cluster analysis that describes ideal-typical positions.
   The positions are analysed from the perspective of their structural
   background and the related attitudes. From a sociological perspective,
   situations like the pandemic provide a unique opportunity for analysing
   otherwise tacit patterns of solidarity. Besides this opportunity, the
   pandemic is also used as a comparative framework: in the final section,
   the changes occurring in the various positions are also overviewed to
   highlight the dynamics of the solidarity field.},

Abstract = {Objective This paper seeks to understand the impact of sustained
   protests for racial justice on attitudes toward racial minorities, the
   police, and policies that would benefit racial minorities. Methods Using
   a large, nationally representative survey collected before and after the
   death of George Floyd and the protest movement that followed it, I
   employ a propensity score matching to identify the causal impact of
   these protests on perceptions of discrimination against blacks,
   favorability of the police, racial prejudice, and support for
   reparations for slavery. I also identify heterogeneous effects in rural
   America to identify the limits of these attitude shifts. Results I find
   evidence that George Floyd's death caused an increased perception of
   discrimination against blacks, decreased favorability of the police,
   decreased racial prejudice, and increased support for reparations. I
   also find muted and heterogeneous effects in rural America. Conclusion
   These findings speak to the power of social protest to shift attitudes
   and policy preferences and to the persistent divide between urban and
   rural Americans.},

Abstract = {The relations of the Evangelical movement and Israel have drawn the
   attention of many scholars of religion, public opinion, and political
   science in the last two decades. This study examines the influence of
   Evangelicals on their country's policy toward Israel. I conduct the
   first quantitative, cross-national research, investigating the links
   between the size of the Evangelical population of a country and its
   support for Israel. Analyzing 198 UN General Assembly votes of 18 Latin
   American countries from 2009 to 2019, my results show that as the
   Evangelical population in a country grows, so does its support for
   Israel. Unpredictably, I also find that a state of armed conflict
   between Israel and the Palestinians does not decrease the support for
   Israel.},

Abstract = {Objective As the coronavirus pandemic raged throughout 2020, political
   leaders faced a difficult choice: Should strict social distancing
   guidelines be maintained until the threat posed by COVID-19 was
   diminished enough for citizens to return to their regular activities? Or
   was the economic disruption caused by the pandemic something that was,
   according to President Trump, ``worse than the problem itself{''}?
   Methods We analyze data from a 2020 survey of registered voters. Results
   Democrats were more likely than Republicans to resolve the tradeoff in
   favor of maintaining social distancing over rebuilding the economy. More
   importantly, we find that when faced with this moral dilemma (measured
   by one's choice between a utilitarian vs. a deontological approach when
   confronted with a real-life ``trolley problem{''}), many citizens from
   both sides of the partisan aisle were of two minds on the subject.
   Conclusion Americans are ambivalent about the appropriate government
   response to COVID-19.},

Abstract = {The existing critical literature on NGOs operating in the context of
   European migration has interrogated their involvement in systems of
   state surveillance and neoliberal governmentality. We supplement this
   with a critical political economy perspective which reveals the
   implication of the humanitarian sector in broader systems of capital
   accumulation. We draw on two related critical literatures, on Racial
   Capitalism and Relative Surplus Populations (RSPs), to explore the
   complex role that NGOs, both large and grassroots, serve in managing
   displaced populations at the borders of Europe. By introducing the
   concepts of the `migration fix', secondary exploitation and
   racialisation, we show how NGOs are implicated, often unwittingly, in
   the production and management of displaced people as surplus
   populations, through their dequalification, categorisation and
   containment. We conclude by exploring the political dilemmas generated
   by this situation with regard to the practice of NGOs, as well as the
   possibility for alternative forms of solidarity.},

Abstract = {This article presents a study of variability in the governance of
   internal migration in urban China as envisioned in official policy
   documents launched since 2011. Such policies were meant to promote the
   making of 100 million Chinese nationals into new local citizens of
   cities before 2021, thereby conferring upon successful applicants access
   to public services provided by local governments. By means of adapted
   concepts of space, spatiality and spatial selectivity, this article
   offers a preliminary account of variation in policy between municipal
   authorities in Beijing and Suzhou, using key centrally issued policy
   documents as a standard. Particularly in the case of Suzhou, the
   diffusion of central policy form was not always accompanied by the
   diffusion of central policy function. Local uptake of form but not
   function was achieved, for instance, by inverting barriers against
   settlement into enablers of settlement. The study shows the importance
   of human capital in strategies by which the central state intended to
   manage the local state, and vice versa, even as they all sought to
   engage in territorial governance from different positions. In light of
   these findings, implications for the theorizing of territorial
   governance and for further research are drawn out.},

Abstract = {As revolutions swept across Central and South America in the 1820s and
   1830s, Andrew Jackson's administration undertook a landmark reform that
   transformed the US foreign policy apparatus into the nation's first
   global bureaucracy. With the introduction of Edward Livingston's 1833
   consular reform bill to Congress, the nation embarked on a long path
   toward the modernization of its consular service in line with the powers
   of Europe and the new American republics. Despite the popularity of
   Livingston's plan to turn a dated US consular service comprised of
   mercantile elites into a salaried professional bureaucracy, the
   Jacksonian consular reform dragged on for more than two decades before
   the passing of a consular bill in 1856. Contrary to Weberian models
   positing a straightforward path toward bureaucratization, the trajectory
   of Jacksonian consular reform demonstrates the power of mercantile
   elites to resist central government regulation just as much as it
   highlights how petty partisans-the protege consuls appointed via the
   Jacksonian ``spoils system{''}-powerfully shaped government policy to
   achieve personal advantages. In the constant tug-of-war between
   merchant-consuls and Jacksonian proteges, both groups mobilized
   competing visions of the ``national character{''} in their
   correspondence with the Department of State and in the national press.
   Ultimately, the Jacksonian reform vision of an egalitarian and loyal
   consular officialdom prevailed over the old mercantile model of
   consulship as a promoter of national prestige and commercial expertise,
   but only after protege consuls successfully exploited merchant-consuls'
   perceived inability to compete with the salaried European officials
   across the sister-republics of the southwestern hemisphere.},

Abstract = {Muslims in the United States are often constructed as anti-American and
   are perceived to have little engagement with politics. Moreover, Arab
   and Muslim identity is often conflated in the public mind. In this note,
   we introduce results from a randomized survey experiment conducted in
   three states with varying Muslim populations-Ohio, California, and
   Michigan-to assess how trustworthy respondents rate a local community
   leader calling for unity when that individual signals themselves to be
   an Arab, Muslim, or Arab Muslim, as opposed to when they do not signal
   their background. Across the board, and in each state, respondents rate
   the community leader as less trustworthy when he is identified as Muslim
   American or as Arab Muslim, but not when he is identified as Arab. These
   results suggest that the public does not conflate these two identities
   and that Muslims are evaluated more negatively than Arabs, even when
   hearing about their prosocial democratic behavior.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the investment in digital tools and the allocation
   of communication expenses in a Global South country with an uneven
   digital penetration rate. Data were collected for 2,563 candidates in
   the 2018 legislative election in Colombia, based on the official
   campaign finance disclosure documents. A multivariate analysis shows
   that particularly challengers invest in social media tools, which is a
   strong indication in favor of the equalization model. That such an
   effect is not found for radio and television expenses confirms this
   interpretation. Candidates on open lists are more inclined to spend on
   both digital and radio and television tools than candidates on closed
   lists. At the district level, the odds of spending on digital media
   increase with the digital media use, but so does the odds of spending on
   radio and television ads.},

Title = {Realizing citizenship in property: Houseless encampments and the limits
   of liberalism's promise},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {91},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper argues that geographers ought to pay closer attention to the
   role of property relations within political liberalism. Developing on
   the idea that propertied-citizenship excludes houseless or other
   property-insecure people from space, the paper argues that
   property-insecure people are instead incorporated within the relations
   of property. Examining how houseless people are incorporated within
   rather than outside of property, illustrates how key values of property
   long-held in liberalism are maintained and used to devalue a sense of
   social and political autonomy for the property-insecure. After tracing
   the dialectical relations of property with citizenship through the
   historical emergence of American liberalism, the paper examines how the
   values connecting property with citizenship continue to diminish the
   livelihoods of houseless people. Based on ethnographic research with
   self-governed houseless encampments in Portland, Oregon, I analyze how
   opposition to these unique types of houseless shelter affect encampment
   residents. What we are able to see from Portland's encampments, I argue,
   are the broader limitations of citizenship within liberalism which
   continue to be demarcated through a proper social order defined by
   property.},

Abstract = {Objective This study empirically investigates the impact of economic
   inequality on the cost of living in U.S. metropolitan areas. Methods
   Using a special Census tabulation, a standard cost-of-living model is
   sequentially augmented with measures of poverty and income inequality in
   a cross-sectional regression analysis of 90 metropolitan areas;
   interaction and regional effects are also explored. Results Higher costs
   of living are associated with increasing economic inequality, especially
   in the distribution of metropolitan income. The effects of household
   poverty are significant but less consistent. Conclusions Reducing
   economic inequality would produce benefits enjoyed by all metropolitan
   residents via lower living costs. The benefits are likely to be greater
   in large, fast growing areas where income disparities are pronounced.},

Abstract = {Although humans have voluntarily joined militaries throughout history,
   research on the motivation to enlist has increased dramatically since
   the adoption of the All-Volunteer Force in the United States. Moskos
   categorized the motivations to enlist as institutional (the value
   alignment of the individual with the military) or occupational (the
   seeking of monetary rewards for competencies at market rates). This
   study explores the prevalence of these two traditional motivations in
   addition to two less commonly studied motivations-group mobilization and
   revenge-seeking-in an important context: the Kurds of northern Iraq. A
   survey of 2301 Kurdish soldiers (Peshmerga) during their war against the
   Islamic State (IS) indicates that institutional motivations are the most
   prevalent, although all four motivations are present. The importance of
   group mobilization and revenge-seeking represent important variations
   from the better-studied Western contexts that complicate our
   understanding of the motivation to enlist.},

Abstract = {Objectives The existing studies based on the rational voter theory
   analyze voter turnout as the aggregate of individuals' binary choice of
   to vote or not to vote. However, when people need to travel to vote, the
   cost associated with different transportation modes directly affects
   their voting decisions. We thus generalize the rational voter theory by
   taking an individual's specific choice of transportation mode into
   account. Methods We show that our proposed discrete choice model can be
   estimated via the approach of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)
   (henceforth, BLP). We then use transportation and census data to analyze
   voters' behavior in Taiwan where absentee voting is not allowed. Results
   As compared to the observed 30.14 percent turnout rates of
   travel-to-vote electorates in Taiwan's 2014 local elections, the
   counterfactual simulations herein suggest that the turnout rates would
   be 61.77 percent if absentee voting were to be allowed. Conclusion The
   BLP method allows us to estimate a generalized rational voter model
   accounting for the transportation mode choice.},

Abstract = {Today's tensions and challenges at the global governance level seem to
   constitute structural expressions of the global system's mutations
   towards the post-COVID-19 era. This study examines whether the
   structural changes observed in various socio-economic dimensions and
   interdependent spatial levels due to the pandemic crisis are
   accelerating the emergence of a new phase of global governance. It
   investigates whether Rodrik's trilemma (the incompatibility of
   synchronously achieving national sovereignty, democracy and
   globalization) seems to be relatively inadequate to approach today's
   emerging global reality and challenges comprehensively. After an
   elliptic overview of world governance's evolutionary shaping and
   reaching the present-day necessarily repositioned role of Brazil,
   Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), we argue that these
   countries must no longer be perceived as emerging exceptional cases but
   as central participants, equally responsible for promoting a more
   balanced and sustainable development perspective for the less developed
   socio-economic formations and the entire global socio-economic system's
   stability. We conclude that in the progressively shaped `new
   globalization', which is a distinct evolutionary phase of the
   international economy and international relations, Rodrik's trilemma
   seems to some extent analytically insufficient since there is no more a
   sustainable optimum in any of its coupled dimensions, which could allow
   a viable exit from the current crisis.},

Title = {Canals, climate, and corruption: The provisioning of public

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We develop a two-stage model to study the strategic interaction between
   a politician (the principal) and a bureaucrat (the agent) over the level
   of infrastructure provision with uncertainty about possible weather
   shocks. The bureaucrat chooses how much effort to contribute to
   infrastructure maintenance and the politician offers either a lump-sum
   wage (non-corrupt) contract or proportional bribe (corrupt) contract to
   induce effort. The degree of uncertainty about weather shocks, the size
   of the fixed wage, and the level of external monitoring to detect
   corruption all interact to affect (a) the politician's choice of
   contract and (b) whether this choice improves infrastructure outcomes.
   Our results suggest that curbing corruption is most likely to yield
   improvements in infrastructure provision when climate uncertainty is low
   and when bureaucratic wages are relatively high. If climate uncertainty
   is high, increasing monitoring has an unambiguous negative effect on
   infrastructure provision. Previous literature has focused either on
   public goods provision but not corruption or on bribery in a regulatory
   context that lacks public goods provision. We extend both literatures by
   analyzing how bribes between government officials affect a principal's
   ability to more effectively incentivize public goods provision by her
   agent.},

Abstract = {Based on a comparative content analysis of political talk in three
   popular Chinese online forums (government-run, commercial-lifestyle, and
   commercial-topical), this paper investigates how the private and public
   spheres are connected thru everyday talk about childcare concerns.
   Compared to the government-run (party-state) forum, the nonpolitical
   (lifestyle and topical) forums created open and inclusive `third spaces'
   for citizens to engage in child welfare politics. In such spaces, the
   reason, rule-based deliberation was not the dominant communicative
   practice. Rather, political (narrative) acts of complaining and sharing
   personal concerns - grounded in citizens' life experiences - were the
   norm, capturing and recognizing public problems in the private sphere.
   We argue that to understand the nature of political talk in Chinese
   third spaces, communicative acts that have not been considered central
   to deliberative reasoning, such as complaining and sharing personal
   concerns should be given more normative importance.},

Abstract = {We analyze the impact of elected competitors from the same constituency
   on legislative shirking in the German Bundestag from 1953 to 2017. The
   German electoral system ensures at least one federal legislator per
   constituency with a varying number of elected competitors between zero
   to four from the same constituency. We exploit the exogenous variation
   in elected competitors by investigating changes in competition induced
   by legislators who leave parliament during the legislative period and
   their respective replacement candidates in an instrumental variables
   setting with legislator fixed effects. The existence of elected
   competitors from the same constituency reduces absentee rates in
   roll-call votes by about 6.1 percentage points, which corresponds to
   almost half of the mean absentee rate in our sample. The effect is
   robust to the inclusion of other measures of political competition.},

Abstract = {The communication mediation model asserts that the effects of news use
   on political participation are mostly indirect, mediated through
   discussion. Recent research has shown that this mediation process is
   stronger in countries where freedom of the press and expression are also
   greater. Relying on data collected during election cycles in seventeen
   countries between 2013 and 2018, we examine how additional country-level
   factors, including political freedom and digital infrastructure,
   moderate the indirect relationship between news use and political
   participation via political talk. Results provide evidence that these
   factors condition both outcomes, but in different ways. For protest, two
   of three country-level indices moderate individual-level variation in
   the pathway between political talk and protest. For voting, two of three
   country-level indices moderate aggregate-level variation in the pathway
   between news use and political talk. Results are discussed in light of
   their implications for the communication mediation model and comparative
   political communication research.},

Abstract = {The 1972 abortion-initiative campaign in North Dakota provides an
   example where elites on one side of an issue were able to provide cues
   and get supporters to participate in an election while the other side
   was unable to do so. North Dakota Right to Life through the formation of
   branch chapters and its work with the Catholic churches became the focus
   of the anti-initiative campaign. Flush with resources, the NDRL made
   sure that its supporters turned out to such an extent that initiative
   voters outnumbered presidential voters in most counties. While the
   pro-initiative elements proved effective at getting the question on the
   ballot, they were unable to get their message out, let alone galvanize
   supporters. The result was confusion among potential supports and lower
   turnout rates in the most populous counties.},

Abstract = {This text is fundamentally built upon the diplomatic correspondence held
   between the State Department and the US Embassy in Madrid during the
   second half of the 40s (preserved at the National Archives Records
   Administration (NARA). Our attention has been focused on this rich and
   abundant material with the aim of highlighting how emphatically was
   reiterated the proposition in American political channels that
   refraining from carrying out threatening (let alone punitive) actions
   against Francoist Spain was the best formula, if not the only one, to
   produce favourable conditions for a transition from Dictatorship to
   Democracy in the country. Even though each one through their own lenses
   and personal outlook, both Carlton J.H. Hayes and Norman Armour, as well
   as William W. Butterworth, Philip W. Bonsal and Paul T. Culbertson
   (successively heading the American Mission at the time) reached the
   conclusion that good doses of pragmatism, flexibility and perseverance
   were required to successfully face the Spanish question. Only by doing
   this, they thought, the conditions the country needed to overcome its
   deep-rooted social and historical contradictions and shortcomings might
   be met.},

Abstract = {Australia-India relations during the Cold War years were tense. The
   dominant argument in the current literature that explains this tension
   is the Nehru-Menzies dissonance, which resulted in fundamentally
   opposite readings of the Cold War. However, the role of Australian aid
   to India has been understudied in the bilateral relations literature.
   India was the largest receiver of Australian aid between 1951-1969, but
   in 1969, there was a marked decrease in this aid as Indonesia replaced
   India as the main aid recipient. By drawing on archival material, this
   article suggests an additional explanation for the dramatic change to
   the Australia-India relationship. By examining the role of Australian
   ministers and senior bureaucrats, this paper argues that between
   1951-1969, Australia's aid to India was driven by its strategic
   interests in India. However, by 1966 Australia's strategic interests in
   India became tenuous due to the souring of United States-India
   relations, primarily because of the stresses of the Vietnam War. Thus, a
   sizeable cut in Australian aid to India was made in 1969 and the
   subsequent decision to make Indonesia the foremost beneficiary of its
   aid was a result of strategic reassessments in Australian foreign
   policy, to adhere more closely to United States (US) interests in Asia.},

Abstract = {The UK's referendum on EU membership that resulted in a narrow minority
   in favour of leave was followed by a leadership vacuum and intense
   debate about the implementation of the result. The politicization over
   Brexit resulted in the development of `Brexit identities' of Remainers
   and Leavers that superseded party identities. We argue that in order to
   understand how this politicization took place despite a leadership
   vacuum we firstly need to look beyond the arena of formal party politics
   to more informal arenas of political contestation on social media,
   especially Facebook, and secondly understand the linkages between EU and
   national level politicization that polarised the country around new
   British-specific identities. Through this, we analyse the `politics of
   division' not simply as a form of contentious politics driven by
   political parties, but as a social conflict driven by
   non-institutionalised groups, grassroots campaigns and ordinary
   citizens. We find evidence of significant mobilisation that extends
   beyond the realm of party politics but argue that this mobilisation
   cannot necessarily be considered entirely `grassroots'. Rather, it is
   driven not just by citizens but also shaped by mainstream and
   alternative media platforms. The debates cannot, however, be considered
   purely a form of EU politicization, rather, analysis of Facebook
   comments shows that politicization over Brexit through these campaigns
   is primarily contestation over the nature and legitimacy of British
   democracy. Because of this, we argue that social media is an essential
   site for the study of EU politicization and political campaigns in
   general.},

Abstract = {While changes in governance and ownership patterns of urban
   infrastructure in the light of capital expansion remain a worldwide
   phenomenon, the processes underlying the governance changes and their
   impact are still under-researched. This paper addresses this gap in
   knowledge by drawing on empirical case studies of two urban development
   projects in India. The study uses the conceptual framework of state
   spatial rescaling to examine the impact of the emergence of new
   institutional configurations within the urban governance sphere, such as
   special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). Through an in-depth investigation of
   the role of SPVs in facilitating urban development projects in Indian
   cities, the paper argues that the entrenchment of the institutional
   mechanism of SPVs within the urban governance sphere results in new
   modes of urban planning, the alteration of existing power hierarchies
   within the urban governance sphere as well as forging of links across
   geographical locales. The findings of the study imply that SPVs in their
   current form denote a top-down process of urban planning that risks
   democratic mechanisms associated with urban governance. The study
   contributes to the growing academic literature that discusses how urban
   mega-projects in the course of their development are restructuring the
   urban political and economic landscape.},

Abstract = {Bureaucrats are a crucial part of states, but only recently has a
   pioneer literature focused on the determinants of their recruitment. In
   this article, we study the role of rank in bureaucratic selection in the
   context of the Chilean civil service, where a decision maker (the
   President or agency director) chooses a candidate from a shortlist
   ranked according to a final interview score. Using a regression
   discontinuity design, we document that first-place candidates have a
   large advantage in the probability of being selected for top positions
   in the public sector relative to those in second place. In contrast, all
   other ranks seem to be irrelevant. Our results are robust to the use of
   several methods of estimation that take into account the discrete nature
   of the running variable. Moreover, the effect is associated with a
   selection process with low levels of competition and low-quality final
   candidates.},

Abstract = {Comparative research on authoritarianism has largely neglected religion.
   Yet, in order to understand the logic of authoritarian control over the
   civil society, it is necessary to study how the authoritarian regimes
   deal with religious groups. In this paper, lessons from the two rapidly
   expanding fields on regulation of religion and comparative
   authoritarianism are combined. In particular, a conceptualization of
   regulation of religion in the authoritarian context is proposed,
   according to which positive endorsement of religion can be understood as
   co-optation, whereas negative restrictions can be seen as repression. By
   employing data on positive endorsement and negative restrictions on
   religion from 2014 for ca. 70 countries, three different clusters of
   authoritarian countries regarding the regulation of religion are
   identified. Finally, it is argued that capacity and ambition of both the
   religious groups and the authoritarian regimes are the main determinants
   of regulation.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to apply the debt sustainability framework
   using various ratios to review the current state of sovereign debt of
   Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Debt sustainability framework using
   various ratios (which include the present value approach, Country Policy
   and Institutional Assessment debt policy assessment ranking and solvency
   ratio of external debt) for the period 2010 and 2017 were used for the
   analysis to determine external debt sustainability and solvency of
   ECOWAS members.
   Findings - The findings indicate that most ECOWAS countries are already
   turning at the unsustainable debt path and may renege in their debt
   obligations, thus creating a vicious cycle of external borrowing that
   could lead to capital flight.
   Originality/value - This paper offers the empirical evidence to identify
   which of the ECOWAS countries are already at the threshold of external
   debt stress, and in the likelihood to renege on their debt obligations.},

Abstract = {Objective To demonstrate how a novel method enhances our understanding
   of determinants of inequality.
   Methods We take advantage of recent advances in dynamic models of
   compositional dependent variables to simultaneously study tradeoffs
   across multiple slices of the composition of income in the United States
   between 1947 and 2014.
   Results Our analyses demonstrate the utility of dynamic compositional
   models of income shares. Factors that increase the income share of the
   top income group often also increase the income share of the second
   income group and decrease the shares of lower groups at different rates.
   Polarization and marginal tax rates have large effects on relative
   income shares, while returns to labor, returns to capital, and partisan
   control of Congress have smaller, but statistically significant effects.
   Conclusion Our suggested approach allows researchers to effectively
   explore interesting variation across multiple income groups in response
   to changes in determinants of inequality.},

Title = {The Emergence of New States in Eastern Europe in 1918-Lessons for All of

Abstract = {The year of 1918 was a crucial point in the history of Europe. Its
   importance does not only stem from the end of World War I, but also from
   the establishment of new states. Eastern Europe was particularly an
   arena where many new states emerged after the dissolution of tsarist
   Russia. The abovementioned process was correlated with the outcome of
   World War I (the defeat of the Central Powers on the Western Front and
   their victory on the Eastern Front against the tsarist Russia resulting
   in imposing their protectorate over Eastern Europe) but simultaneously
   it was influenced by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution originating from a
   structural crisis of Russia.
   The legacy of nation-building processes, taking place in the period of
   1917-1921 in the European part of the tsarist Russiaeven when some of
   the states did not manage to surviveoccupies a key role in the
   historical memories of those countries. The importance of this legacy
   originates from the fact that these states often constituted the most
   progressive nation-building efforts in the world. The wider context of
   these developments and the important interlinkages existing between them
   are very often unfamiliar to many Europeans today. Despite that, the
   state- building attempts, undertaken in Eastern Europe between 1917 and
   1921, had a huge impact on the trajectory of European history.
   Contextualising this particular academic enquiry with the events of 1918
   and benefiting from methodological advantages of process tracing, our
   project represents an attempt to restore (or, if necessary, build from
   scratch) a communicational system for sending a historical message to a
   wider Europe. A century after, while celebrating the Finnish, Estonian,
   Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish truly big anniversaries in 2017- 2018,
   Europeans have already forgotten how interconnected and interlinked the
   1918-bound events had been and by how much those events had affected the
   entire European continent as well as the international system.},

   of the world's most influential and powerful economies in spite of the
   United States' reserved behavior. In addition, this unique era in Latvia
   and the Baltic States as a whole (influenced by the Soviet Russian and
   German factors, war and its aftermath, and the ethnically diverse and
   complicated social situation) illustrates the specifi cs of US policy
   towards Eastern Europe and Russia.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Theories of justice rely on a variety of criteria to determine what
   social arrangements should be considered just. For most theories, the
   distribution of financial resources matters. However, they take the
   existence of money as a given and tend to ignore the way in which the
   creation of money impacts distributive justice. Those with access to
   collateral are favoured in the creation of credit or debt, which
   represents the main form of money today. Appealing to the idea that
   access to credit confers freedom, and that inequalities in this freedom
   are morally arbitrary, this article shows how the advantage to those
   with collateral plays out in different ways in today's economy. The
   article identifies several forms of bias inherent in money creation, and
   its subsequent destruction: loans from commercial banks to individuals
   and corporations, interbank lending, lending from central banks to
   commercial banks, and selective bail-outs by central banks. These are
   not mere inequalities: they are unjust since alternative designs of the
   financial architecture exist that would significantly reduce them. The
   paper focuses on one possible reform with the potential to address
   several of the types of bias identified, namely the separation of money
   creation from private bank credit.},

Abstract = {Although the value of diversity-in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and
   socioeconomic status-to the U.S. military has been subject to debate,
   preferences for diversity at educational institutions for the military
   officers are rarely examined systematically. To address this, we
   investigate whether midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy favor
   prioritizing diversity in student admissions and faculty recruitment
   using conjoint analysis, a method suited for estimating attitudes on
   sensitive and politicized issues. The results show strong preferences in
   favor of applicants from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds and
   moderate but still positive preferences for members of traditionally
   underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in both admissions and faculty
   recruitment. Midshipmen's preferences with respect to gender are,
   however, less straightforward. In particular, we find a strong negative
   preference against gender nonbinary applicants and candidates. Our
   findings suggest that midshipmen's attitudes reflect both resolved and
   unresolved debates that resonate throughout the armed forces.},

Abstract = {While the traditional concepts of sustainability and sustainable
   development have focused on the equitable usage of earthly resources
   across generations, the increasing commercial and military saturation of
   low-Earth orbit (LEO) highlights the need to expand this discourse to
   areas outside of our planet. Beginning with an overview of the outer
   space legal regime and its relationship to sustainability, the paper
   notes the increasing state reticence to forfeit sovereignty over outer
   space resources. Although the economic and geopolitical advantages of
   occupying outer space are of tremendous interest to public and private
   organizations, the continued proliferation of space objects in LEO could
   trigger a global dispossession through collision. Endorsing the concept
   of `planetary sustainability', this article emphasizes the importance of
   space-based technologies in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) and in reducing vulnerabilities to environmental and human health
   disasters. The crises facing our planet must be incentives to manage
   this `commons' and ensure that the prosperity of this resource is
   broadly and equitably shared.},

   Germany},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Volume = {87},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Asylum laws cannot function without spatial technologies and practices.
   Refugee camps, detention centers and accommodation facilities, in
   addition to dispersal and residential obligations, highlight the
   spatiality of asylum laws and policies. They are not only designed to
   regulate forced migrants' movement and place them in alternative legal
   and spatial regimes, but they are also spaces where migrants' legal
   rights are violated and access to integrating institutions are
   restricted. Based on findings from Germany and the United States, this
   paper argues that current asylum regimes are characterized by a system
   of legal-spatial violence; a process in which a form of violence is
   embedded in law, implemented through policies and formal processes, and
   realized and reproduced spatially. This entanglement between the law,
   space, and violence involves complex and paradoxical processes:
   immobility and internal bordering practices (where forced migrants are
   confined and their movement is limited), as well as forced mobility and
   situations of unbordering (where movement is forced, and where spatial
   restrictions are either repealed or replaced). These processes fragment
   and prolong the trajectories of forced migration. Compulsion,
   displacement, and the dispossession of rights-which constitute the
   process of forced migration-do not cease on entering Germany or the
   United States, but can continue. The rationale for legalspatial violence
   goes beyond the securitization of forced migration and the control and
   deterrence of forced migrants, and also includes economic logic and
   profit making.},

Title = {Operationalising memory and identity politics to influence public
   opinion of refugees: A snapshot from Poland},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Using a politics of identity and memory approach, herein, we explore how
   political discourse plays out in practice and ?in place? when Poles were
   compelled to consider the introduction of visibly different persons,
   with different cultural characteristics, to their society. In 2017, and
   at the height of the ``migrant/refugee crisis{''}, we conducted 200
   short interviews in Wroc?aw, Poland, to gauge and interpolate attitudes
   and opinions to refugees, in a context where the refugees had been
   strategically Othered, and constructed as a threat to Polish society.
   Our discussion focuses on how the strategic use and dissemination of
   threat and fear, in public discourse, was operationalised to disrupt
   steadfast notions of belonging to the Polish nation. By exploring
   belonging to the nation through a politics of identity and memory
   framework, we can better understand and provide contextual nuance to the
   import of maintaining ?a {[}Polish] cultural sense of belonging?
   (Brockmeier, 2002, p. 18). While in a Polish context, place-based and
   culturally historical narratives of conflict, territorial incursion, and
   occupation have framed threats to belonging in the past, the
   contemporary political exploitation of threat and its (re)production in
   public discourse is not only strongly exclusionary, but also denies the
   opportunity for Poles to know diversity as a felt experience reinforcing
   ideas of a ?closed? Poland. The contribution of this paper, then, is to
   demonstrate both the effectiveness of control of public discourse in a
   specific place and time, but to also elucidate the less often heard
   Eastern European states responses to the refugee crises.},

Abstract = {This study aims to construct reliable measures of religiosity and to
   cross-validate survey-based measures in operationalization of this
   central variable. We obtain measures of sub-national religiosity in the
   Egyptian governorates from the Arab Barometer surveys using
   disaggregation and multilevel regression and post-stratification
   techniques. Then, we use satellite imagery to compare these measures to
   the intensity of nighttime lights during the holy month of Ramadan.
   Although not designed to be fully representative, the analysis reveals
   that survey data at the sub-national level can provide approximate
   measures when aggregated. These findings contribute to scholarship by
   introducing a novel measure of religiosity based on nighttime activity
   during Ramadan and by cross-validating the reliability of survey-based
   measures of aggregate religiosity.},

Title = {The French Legislation Against Digital Information Manipulation in
   Electoral Campaigns: A Scope Limited by Freedom of Expression},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {98-115},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {As France is traditionally opposed to electronic voting, especially when
   used in general elections or national referenda, electoral interference
   could take the form of false information disseminated online. Indeed,
   misinformation may affect the honesty of electoral debates and influence
   voting behavior. This article first studies the electoral interference
   that occurred in France, during the 2017 presidential campaign, and that
   targeted more particularly the future president of the republic,
   Emmanuel Macron. It shows that the laws that existed at the time could
   only imperfectly counter disinformation spread in an online environment.
   This article then analyzes the new laws on the fight against the
   manipulation of information, adopted in reaction to the 2017 electoral
   interference with the support of the president of the republic. It
   studies how those laws aim to react to manipulation of digital
   information before general elections and national referenda. A new judge
   sitting for urgent matters may order the suspension or suppression of
   limited digital false information. The French regulatory broadcasting
   agency may suspend, interrupt, or refuse broadcasting of false
   information by audiovisual media controlled or influenced by a foreign
   state. Its powers are, however, restrained for legal and political
   reasons. This article then studies how the new laws aim to prevent
   manipulation of digital information. They give users of online platforms
   more means to critically assess digital information and be less
   influenced by it. Thus, online platforms must be more transparent about
   the information they host, especially during electoral campaigns.
   Furthermore, information and media literacy are strengthened. Finally,
   this article concludes that the scope of the new legislation against the
   manipulation of information, constrained by the freedom of expression,
   remains modest. It argues that facilitating the detection of false
   information by platforms' users is the way forward to diminish the
   impact of that information on electoral debates.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions can faith leaders influence peace in civil wars?
   The ongoing conflict in Congo, Syria, and Yemen indicate that faith
   leaders can fuel sectarian divide, but also intervene on the side of
   peace. Drawing on experiences in Sierra Leone's civil war, this paper
   highlights the role of faith leaders as moral guarantors of peace
   processes, with respondent former rebels indicating that without
   interfaith delegations personally bringing the peace accord to their
   remote jungle camps, they would not have trusted the UN-led process.
   Ethnographic analysis and over 60 field interviews with former
   combatants and religious leaders, presents a model for answering why
   faith leaders were central in terminating this conflict. Combatant's
   personal experience with a diverse mixture of Christian, Traditional,
   and Islamic leaders contributed to high confidence in peace accords, due
   to interfaith practices deeply embedded within the culture and shows the
   dispositions, rituals, and interfaith practices that provided the
   cultural foundations for successful interfaith intervention. The paper
   ends with generalizations for other interfaith groups seeking to
   intervene in conflict.},

Abstract = {In Marxist circles it is common to refer to Karl Marx's The Civil War in
   France for a theoretical analysis of the historical significance of the
   Paris Commune, and to Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray's History of the
   Commune of 1871 for a description of the facts surrounding the
   insurrection of the Paris workers and its repression by the National
   Assembly led by Adolphe Thiers. What is less well-known is that Marx
   himself oversaw the German translation of Lissagaray's book and made
   numerous additions to it. In this article we describe Marx's addenda to
   Lissagaray's work, showing how they contribute to concretising his
   analysis of the Paris Commune and how they relate to the split in the
   International Working Men's Association between Marxists and anarchists
   that took place after the Commune's defeat. We also show how Marx's
   additions to the German version of Lissagaray's book were linked to his
   involvement with the recently created Socialist Workers' Party of
   Germany and to his criticism of the programme it had adopted at the
   congress celebrated in the city of Gotha.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the political topics that triggered user
   engagement on candidates' Facebook pages during the 2018 Hungarian
   general election campaign on a full dataset of politicians'
   communication by using automated content analysis approaches. We have
   limited knowledge on what topics spread well on Facebook. This study
   aims to fill this gap by investigating the engagement-triggering effects
   of prominent topics of the 2018 Hungarian election campaign. It
   hypothesizes that salient issues (immigration and corruption) and
   campaign-related posts will obtain more user reaction, while policy
   topics and mobilization-related content will be less engaging. The
   effects of issue ownership on user engagement are also tested. For this,
   the study draws upon an extensive dataset that includes all Facebook
   posts of each candidate (511 candidates 38030 posts) running for MP
   positions, posted between the official starting day of the campaign and
   Election Day. Topics are identified by dictionary-based and supervised
   learning methods that allow us to categorize a larger set of data than
   earlier works. The results show that corruption, development policy, and
   campaign are the most popular topics with users. The most interesting
   finding, however, is related to the reversed issue ownership effect on
   user engagement.},

Abstract = {Threats of social media manipulation during elections have become a
   central concern for modern democracies. This study tackles the problem
   of identifying the purpose and origins of social bots during electoral
   campaigns. We propose a methodology - uniform manifold approximation and
   projection combined with user-level document embeddings - that
   efficiently reveals the community structure of social media users. We
   show that this method can be used to predict the partisan affiliation of
   social media users with high accuracy, detect anomalous concentrations
   of social bots, and infer their geographical origin. We illustrate the
   methodology using Twitter data from the 2019 Canadian electoral
   campaign. Our evidence supports the thesis that social bots have become
   an integral component of campaign strategy for national actors. We also
   demonstrate how the methodology can be deployed to identify clusters of
   foreign bots, and we show that such accounts were used to share
   far-right and environment-related content during the campaign.},

Abstract = {Rules are central to the constitutional political economy (CPE)
   approach. On this approach, rules, of a variety of types and forms, are
   necessary for the emergence of a political and social order, so that all
   genuine political order is rule-based. The central role of rules within
   the CPE approach is examined starting from an explicit definitional
   discussion of the concept of a rule and including discussion of the
   nature of rule-following behavior, the supply of rules, and rule
   enforcement.},

Abstract = {I investigate how the third wave of democracy influenced national
   defense spending by reference to a panel of 110 countries over the
   1972-2013 period. I apply new data from the Stockholm International
   Peace Research Institute on military expenditures, which has been
   extended to years prior to 1988, and four democracy measures to address
   differences among indices of democracy. The results from a dynamic panel
   data model suggest that democracy's third wave reduced defense spending
   relative to GDP by about 10\% within countries that experienced
   democratization. I exploit the regional diffusion of democracy in the
   context of the third wave of democratization as an instrumental variable
   (IV) for democracy in order to overcome endogeneity problems. The IV
   estimates indicate that democracy reduced national defense spending
   relative to GDP by about 20\% within countries that experienced
   democratization, demonstrating that OLS underestimates the effect of
   democracy on national defense spending. The cumulative long-run effect
   of democratization resulting from the dynamics in defense spending is
   almost three times larger for both OLS and IV estimates.},

Abstract = {This paper provides evidence of alignment effects between the executive
   and the legislative branches of the central government. We rely on
   detailed data on Brazilian intergovernmental grants whose allocations
   are determined by legislators. The executive branch cannot interfere
   with the destinies or volumes of grants, but it can control the transfer
   pace. We group the data into municipalities and estimate the effects of
   the share of aligned legislators associated with a municipality on the
   average time to receive grants. We show that legislators politically
   aligned to the executive branch transfer resources to their
   constituencies nine months faster than unaligned legislators. To achieve
   a causal interpretation of these results, we rely on exogenous
   variations in the shares of elected aligned legislators caused by the
   phased-in introduction of electronic voting. Our findings regarding how
   political alignment affects the speed of transfer are consistent across
   different periods and alternative definitions of the dependent variable.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous
   panel data estimators, including partially heterogeneous ones, in
   presence of cross-sectional dependence generated by common factors and
   spatial error dependence. Our specifications allow us to consider and
   contrast weak cross-sectional dependence and strong cross-sectional
   dependence in a general linear heterogeneous panel data model. An
   overview of the estimation procedures, including heterogeneous,
   homogeneous and partially heterogeneous estimators, is presented. Then,
   an extensive Monte Carlo study is conducted using a general framework
   encompassing recent contributions in the literature especially in terms
   of considering common factors and spatial dependence simultaneously. Our
   simulation results show that, even for small individual and time
   dimensions, heterogeneous estimators perform better in terms of bias,
   root mean squared error, size and size adjusted power compared to
   homogeneous estimators. Last, the superiority of the heterogeneous
   estimators is confirmed by an empirical application relating fiscal
   decentralization and government size in 22 OECD countries over the
   period 1973-2017.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explain the ideological framework of the
   first generation of the Red Army Faction (RAF), a West-German armed
   organization. This framework will be linked to the question of
   subjectivity developed by the student movement in The Federal Republic
   of Germany in 1968. In order to achieve a logical explanation for these
   questions, firstly, we will consider summarizing the intellectual
   connection between the student movement and the theories developed by
   the Frankfurt School. Secondly, we will analyse the most important
   theoretical papers of the first generation of the Red Army Faction. As
   for the main results of this analysis, we could say that this terrorist
   group adopted a classical position on the problem of subjectivity. In
   other words, at the beginning of its history, the RAF considered the
   German working class as the Revolutionary Subject. Then, thanks to the
   theoretical works of one of the most charismatic leaders of the group,
   Ulrike Meinhof, the RAF finally embraced the anti-authoritarian
   paradigm, which has a clear relationship with the student movement of
   `68 and the Frankfurt School philosophers.},

Abstract = {The Colombian Constitution of 1991 includes some rules about
   environmental protection, which make it an ``ecological
   constitution{''}. Within these rules, some are identified as important
   precepts in the development of environmental protection ideals. Those
   are the property's ecological function and the participation of citizens
   in environmental matters starting from a healthy environment as a right.
   The article will examine some cases known by the Constitutional Court.
   The aim is to study how, in practice, these constitutional environmental
   provisions have been applied and if it has fulfilled those promises of
   an environmental constitution. The Constitutional Court was chosen,
   within the principal Colombian courts, because it is the authority
   responsible for the protection and examination of constitutional
   provisions' compliance and because it has the greatest social impact.
   After the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a strong tendency
   of this court to protect the environmental participation rights of
   communities and the property's ecological function.},

Abstract = {A new dimension of international trade has appeared in past decades with
   the awakening of South-South trade, mainly driven by China. The
   so-called ``Chinese move into Africa{''} phenomenon is one of the main
   characteristics of this economic mutation. This paper aims at exploring
   the determinants of the upsurge of bilateral trade between sub-Saharan
   Africa (SSA) and China but with a special focus on the role of
   institutions. To this regard, we applied a theoretically consistent
   structural gravity model to a worldwide database covering the period
   1996-2012. We built specific interaction variables to study how the
   sino-African trade is influenced by the institutional channel of African
   countries both measured by the political regime and the governance
   quality. The main results indicate that in the context of China-SSA
   trade flows, a democratic regime is pro-trade but surprisingly an
   improvement in control of corruption leads to deteriorate trade. More
   generally, institutional quality (except for control of corruption) is
   important to boost Chinese exports to SSA but does not seem to be a
   necessary requirement for African exports to China. Accordingly, in the
   extent that institutional reforms take time to operate, trading with
   China could be an interesting medium-run opportunity for SSA to pursue
   its growth and development process.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to shed some light on the real convergence process among
   EU economies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in
   comparison to the real convergence in 2008, when the last financial
   crisis erupted. According to entropy method results, the most pronounced
   difference between effects of the current pandemic and the global
   financial crisis are registered in the unemployment rate, while the
   difference in the current account balance and GDP per capita are much
   less noticeable. The results of the entropy method also suggest that the
   greatest difference among EU economies in 2020 is registered in the
   current account deficits; a slightly lower difference is registered in
   the unemployment rate, while the divergence in GDP is much less
   pronounced. To explain the results of the entropy method, a hierarchical
   cluster analysis is performed and three clusters are derived. Based on
   the identified characteristics of the derived clusters, some policy
   recommendations for overcoming the current crisis are defined.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze the relationship between
   sovereignty and the right to a healthy environment with the war that
   Colombia is waging against drug trafficking; war that involves the
   intervention of the United States and one of its most representative
   companies, Monsanto, producer of glyphosate (now Bayer). The case under
   study starts from the validity, with the Constitution of 1991, of a new
   national order marked by the sovereign power of the people and their
   right to decent living conditions, within which the guarantee of health
   and a natural habitat free from contamination. For this purpose, the
   results of recent studies demonstrating the damage suffered, both humans
   and the ecosystem, and its various manifestations are presented. Based
   on the qualitative method, serious alteration conditions were identified
   in aerial spraying areas; to conclude that the preservation of the
   environment involves not only acts of government, but also the will of
   the affected communities.},

Title = {Neoliberalism Incorporated: Early Neoliberal Involvement in the Postwar

Abstract = {Although recent studies have extensively traced the development of
   neoliberal ideas in international think-tanks since the late 1930s,
   scholars of early neoliberalism have paid far less attention to the
   translation of these ideas into policy. Current scholarship
   predominantly identifies the introduction of neoliberal policies with a
   paradigm shift among policymakers in the late 1970s and depicts the
   early neoliberal movement as an idea-centred and isolated phenomenon
   that was unable to put its ideas into practice. This article argues
   instead that early neoliberals employed an idea-centred approach to
   politics to establish a coalition of like-minded academics, journalists,
   politicians and policy officials. Focusing on the Netherlands, it
   demonstrates how this strategy brought neoliberals press coverage,
   influence within the Christian democratic parliamentary parties and
   acknowledgement among professional economists. On the one hand, their
   struggle to exert influence over policy matters contributed to the
   implementation of pro-market industrialization policies, which,
   ironically, were pursued by a coalition of social democrats and
   Christian democrats. On the other hand, it also compelled them to
   include Christian-democratic views in their political agenda, leading to
   a corporatist-neoliberal policy synthesis whose features exhibit
   remarkable similarities to German `ordoliberal' ideas.},

   Tunisia's Truth and Dignity Commission},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {94},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Tunisian revolution of 2011 moved from socio-economic to political
   concerns, and from the margins and periphery of the South and West of
   the country to the centre, Tunis, driven by the slogan of ``jobs,
   dignity and freedom{''}. The goal of this article is to understand the
   potential of using the spatially informed concept of marginalisation to
   reimagine transitional justice, using the ``victim zone{''} as a case
   study. The Truth and Dignity Commission's founding legislation tasked it
   with identifying victim zones that had ``suffered systematic
   marginalisation or exclusion{''} and proposing reparation for structural
   violations suffered. Empirical data collected from two disadvantaged
   regions of Tunisia are used to provide a bottom-up, victim-centred, look
   at structural and economic violence. The IVD has largely failed to-date
   to deliver on its promise in relation to collective reparations, but a
   combination of theory and empirical data provides a springboard for a
   discussion of how the margins could unsettle current transitional
   justice practice, both normatively and practically. The article
   concludes by outlining an unfinished business agenda for Tunisia and
   implications for future transitional justice. Specifically, it argues
   for a transitional justice from the margins that focuses on space as
   well as time, collectives as well as individuals, a normative plurality
   rather than a single universalised global framework, decentralised
   agency rather than centralised institutional primacy, and a new social
   contract (forms of participation and recognition) rather than the
   continuity of elite bargains.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the interaction and messaging tactics of
   political Twitter bots before an election. We analyzed the strategies of
   influential bots seeking to affect the immigration debate before the
   2018 U.S. midterm elections. Our findings reveal that the 10 most
   influential bots in our dataset all presented an anti-immigration
   viewpoint, and both posted original tweets and retweeted other bot
   accounts' tweets to give a false sense of authenticity and
   anti-immigration consensus. Bots' messages relied heavily on negative
   emotional appeals by spreading harassing language and disinformation
   likely intended to evoke fear toward immigrants. Such accounts also
   employed polarizing language to entrench political group identity and
   provoke partisanship. Our findings help to understand the interaction
   and messaging tactics employed by political bots and suggest potential
   strategies that may be employed to counter their effectiveness.},

Title = {The Political Strategy of Appealing to Religious Nationalism: Examining
   Motivations to Join Religious Organizations by Japanese LDP Politicians},

Abstract = {When the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) again took control after the
   2012 general election, Japan's ruling party politicians increasingly
   associated themselves with Shinto Seiji Renmei, a political organization
   that is affiliated with Shinto, the country's native religion. What are
   the motivations for joining such a group, considering Japan has
   institutional regulations regarding the separation of politics and
   religion, in addition to there being no sign of rising religiosity among
   the Japanese population? I explain this puzzle by focusing on
   politicians' electoral incentives in a changing environment of Japan's
   party politics. As the opposition became fragmented after 2012, the
   ruling party's candidates found it electorally advantageous to appeal to
   the core supporters rather than the centrist floating voters. An
   empirical analysis of an original dataset supports my argument. The
   findings suggest the changes in Japan's political landscape might affect
   the future strategies of LDP politicians, particularly regarding the
   coalition with Komeito. Overall, this study proposes that there is a
   need to pay closer attention to politicians' strategic use of religion
   in politics.},

Title = {The politicization and framing of migration in West Africa: transition

Abstract = {Migration was prominently set on West African political agendas with
   Europe's increasing pressure for cooperation since the 2000s.
   Notwithstanding, we have hardly any insights about how politicized
   migration is in that region, how West African policymakers frame
   migration and why. Relying on newspaper data, we analyse the
   politicization and framing of migration in the Gambia from 2009 to 2020.
   This small West African state with very high emigration to Europe is a
   good case study to verify the so-called `regime effect' in migration
   policymaking because it underwent a democratic transition in 2016. The
   analysis shows that the transition to democracy did not lead so much to
   a policy change, but to a change of migration politics on the most
   salient sub-issue: cooperation on forced return with migrant-receiving
   states. We show that democratization led to a clear multiplication of
   national and international claims-makers on this topic, polarizing
   policy positions for and against cooperation, and a diversification of
   justification frames. The paper shows how democratic policymakers in the
   Global South, differently from autocracies or Western democratic states,
   struggle with creative and diversifying justification frames to cater
   the needs of both international donors and electorates.},

Title = {Interest-rate setting and communication at the ECB in its first twenty
   years},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To examine the role of ECB communication at press conferences, we
   estimate non-linear empirical reaction functions for the ECB's monetary
   policy decisions during the first two decades of monetary union and
   augment them with communication indicators on the risks to price
   stability and to growth. Overall, we find that the ECB's risk
   assessments at press conferences provided reliable orientation to
   observers concerning future policy decisions. Communication about the
   risks to inflation and to growth was more relevant for explaining future
   policy changes than the staff projections themselves. We also show that
   the ECB responded to risks to price stability in line with its primary
   objective and that its reaction function evolved after the global
   financial crisis, when money (or credit) growth lost its significance as
   a driver of the policy response. Our findings add to the understanding
   of the ECB's reaction function and the role of communication therein.},

Abstract = {Legislative design was a critical question at the 1787 Constitutional
   Convention. The peculiar compromise that was struck-featuring
   proportional and republican elements-defies the logic of the
   Convention's majority rule. We investigate how in establishing the new
   national legislature, small state delegates were able to prevail over
   the large state majority and secure the Connecticut Compromise. We argue
   that the small state coalition's victory owes to their strategy at a
   critical juncture: the Gerry Committee. The Gerry Committee amplified
   the contours of the debate over legislative design and the careful
   curation of its participants precipitated a shift of structural and
   creative freedom allowing for the consideration of alternative
   solutions. The Committee produced an environment favorable to a
   compromise on legislative structure and power by manipulating the policy
   dimensions connecting representation, taxation, and slavery. Participant
   curation was essential in allowing political opponents-the small
   states-to overcome unfavorable conditions, maximize utility, and craft a
   proposal capable of approval by delegates and eventual constitutional
   ratification.},

Abstract = {Objective This study explored associations between television exposure
   and public support for restrictive immigration policies in Europe,
   distinguishing general television exposure from exposure to television
   news. We explored explanations of generalized social distrust and
   perceived ethnic threat and, moreover, acknowledged cross-national
   variation in asylum applicants. Methods We applied multi-level
   regression analyses using the European Social Survey (2014-2015),
   covering 19 countries (n = 29.161). Results General television exposure
   and support for restrictive immigration policies related positively,
   whereas exposure to television news related negatively to these policy
   preferences. Furthermore, both generalized social distrust and perceived
   ethnic threat mediated the links between both forms of exposure and
   these preferences. An increase in the number of asylum applicants
   strengthened the positive relationship between general television
   exposure and these policy preferences. Conclusions This study provides
   new insights into the role of individual and national factors for
   support for restrictive immigration policies from a contemporary and
   cross-national perspective.},

Title = {The Effect of Gain-versus-Loss Framing of Economic and Health Prospects
   of Different COVID-19 Interventions: An Experiment Integrating

Abstract = {A survey experiment was conducted that exposed Dutch citizens to
   different scenarios that either emphasized the gains or the losses
   regarding the number of victims or the economic damage caused by
   SARS-CoV-2. Replicating prospect theory in an ecologically valid crisis
   context, we found that gain frames promoted risk-aversive preferences,
   whereas loss frames increased support for risk-seeking alternatives. We
   further demonstrate the effect's conditionality: Framing effects are
   strongest for health compared to economic scenarios and most pronounced
   when the type of intervention entails the highest risk associated with
   the respective domain. Theoretically, we show that the strongest media
   effects occur as an interplay between emphasis and equivalence framing
   effects, which underlines the need for media effects research to
   integrate both framing elements rather than studying them separately.},

Title = {Climate change or what? Prognostic framing by Fridays for Future
   protesters},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Abstract = {Since August 2018, Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future have captured
   the attention of the world by mobilizing millions of young students as
   well as adults to join their climate strikes. The movement has stressed
   the urgency of global warming and urged politicians to listen to science
   and take action. The collective action framing has thus been broad and
   inclusive, but correspondingly vague in terms of its demands. It is
   therefore pertinent to explore what climate strikers believe should be
   done to address climate change. By analysing responses to an open survey
   question posed to participants in the climate strikes in March and
   September 2019 from Stockholm, Malmo, Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw, Florence
   and Brussels, this article uses a mixed-methods approach to investigate
   prognostic framing in the European climate movement. Distinguishing
   between two dimensions of projected change-its character and its main
   agents-this study re-conceptualizes the common distinction between
   institutionalist and anti-institutionalist approaches as a split between
   top-down and bottom-up as well as the system change and system
   development types of prognostic framing. While top-down change within
   the current system is identified as the most common prognostic frame,
   considerable numbers of survey respondents instead stress individual
   lifestyle changes. A bottom-up change of the system to address global
   warming is somewhat surprisingly more likely to be articulated by
   middle-aged respondents than by youths. The latter frame also receives
   disproportionate support from the most left-leaning participants, which
   demonstrates the continued relevance of the left-right dimension in
   green politics.},

Title = {Pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the spatial model with valence:
   existence and characterization},

Abstract = {Pure-strategy Nash equilibria almost never exist in spatial majority
   voting games when the number of positional dimensions is at least two,
   as the majority core is typically empty when more than one positional
   dimension is modeled. In the general setting of proper spatial voting
   games, we study the existence of equilibrium when one candidate has a
   valence advantage over the other. When we consider such games, a valence
   equilibrium can exist that is not in the core, and a point in the core
   need not be a valence equilibrium. In this paper, we characterize the
   entire set of valence equilibria for any proper spatial voting game. We
   complement the analysis by deriving a simple inequality that is both
   necessary and sufficient for the existence of a valence equilibrium. The
   inequality refers to the radius of a new concept, the b-yolk, and we
   prove that a b-yolk always exists in a spatial voting game.},

Abstract = {Objective We investigate the question: How should immigrants pursue
   policy in a system that privileges majority rule? Scholars suggest that
   opinion backlash impedes policy gains by marginalized groups. That is,
   pushing too hard for policy leads to backlash, a sharp and sustained
   negative reaction among citizens that delays these groups' ability to
   obtain their desired policy. Methods Examining immigration, we develop
   and test two plausible alternatives to backlash: opinion elite cues and
   opinion stability. We use experimental and observational data. Results
   We find no evidence of backlash. Instead, we find modest evidence
   attitudes move in the direction of the cues provided by party elites.
   Conclusion Immigrants and other marginalized groups should pursue rights
   without fear of opinion backlash.},

Title = {The metropolitanization of Israel's settlement policy: The colonization
   of the West Bank as a strategy of spatial restructuring},

Abstract = {Israel's West Bank settlements are a central point of contention in the
   dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Overall, however, their
   rapid proliferation has been generally understood through the lens of an
   ideologically centered approach that highlights, specifically, the
   centrality of the national religious settlers' movement. Against this
   background, the article focuses on the overlooked reality of large,
   state-sponsored suburban settlements - and in particular on the role of
   the Israeli Ministry of Housing in their establishment between the
   mid1970s and the early 1990s. Building on contributions in the field of
   political economy and political geography, we conceive the actions of
   the Ministry in the occupied West Bank as a result of a broader strategy
   of spatial restructuring. By considering both economic and political
   imperatives underlying this strategy, our analysis offers a more
   comprehensive assessment of the factors behind Israel's settlement
   policy. Drawing on a broad range of empirical sources, from archival
   material to in-depth interviews with Israeli planners, we argue that the
   proliferation of settlements has been largely the outcome of a process
   of metropolitanization - i.e. of the dynamics of urban development of
   Israel's main metropolitan centers and the adoption of a new,
   post-Keynesian policy paradigm based on market-oriented economic
   development. This process has constituted a major factor for the
   settlements' growth and, ultimately, in the emergence and naturalization
   of a new territorial configuration in the area of Israel/Palestine.},

Abstract = {This article aims to evaluate the impact of budget forecast
   manipulations on election results using a sample that covers all 308
   Portuguese municipalities over the period running from 1998 to 2017. The
   results reveal that incumbent mayors overestimate revenues and
   expenditures. Overstating the budget more on the revenue side, they end
   up with a deficit. We check if this opportunistic behaviour is
   electorally beneficial. The results provide little or no evidence that
   election-year manipulations of revenue forecasts affect the vote shares
   of the party of the incumbent mayor. On the other hand, the
   opportunistic management of total and capital expenditure forecasts pays
   off, which is consistent with previous results for Portugal indicating
   that increased total and, mainly, capital expenditures lead to higher
   vote shares.},

Abstract = {When states are targeted with sanctions, they may respond with
   alterations of their domestic economies meant to counter any negative
   effects of sanctions. In this article, we argue that these alterations
   tend to lead to increased state command of the economy and reduced
   economic freedom, as sanctions create opportunities and incentives that
   encourage target states and firms within them to pursue increased state
   control of the economy. These declines in economic freedom may come
   about through a number of causal mechanisms, several of which will be
   elaborated upon in this article. We use large-N empirical analysis of
   all aspects of the Fraser Institute's Index of Economic Freedom and find
   that sanctions associate with reductions in most components of economic
   freedom.},

Title = {Bodies as urban infrastructure: Gender, intimate infrastructures and
   slow infrastructural violence},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Drawing from deep longitudinal and ethnographic work, this article
   interrogates a set of key relationships between bodies, gender and
   infrastructure in the context of understanding cities such as Bharatpur
   and Dhangadhi in Nepal as well as Delhi, India. This article seeks to
   make two contributions. First, utilizing feminist political geography
   approaches, we examine bodies as infrastructure, referring to how the
   social and material work of the body helps to build, develop and
   maintain cities through gendered infrastructures in the everyday. We
   show conceptualizing bodies as infrastructure reveals important and
   intimate dimensions of the everyday politics and social and material
   forms that enable critical resources to flow and integral networks be
   built in cities. Second, we demonstrate from our comparative case
   studies the ways that gendered ``slow infrastructural violence{''}
   accrues through patterns of infrastructural invisibility. Particular
   bodies act as urban infrastructure in everyday and unremarkable ways,
   shaping the uneven social and political consequences of embodied
   infrastructural configurations. We specifically examine slow violence
   and informal financial infrastructure in Bharatpur and the provisioning
   of health in Dhangadhi followed by the exploration of slow violence and
   fragmented water in Delhi. This article thus raises a simultaneous call
   for theoretical engagement with the socio-materiality of infrastructure
   and the body, an increased regard for the multiplicity of urban
   infrastructures, and an interrogation of gender and infrastructural
   politics in cities where more people will be living in the future and
   where politics and infrastructure are being actively created.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a theoretical model for analysis of the imperfect
   observability of central bank preferences by the private sector on the
   decisions taken by the monetary authority, and therefore, on the
   inflation rate. It examines, in particular, the connection which, in the
   presence of a time-inconsistency problem, arises between the
   observability of the monetary institution's goals and its equilibrium
   strategies. The model yields innovative results from the technical and
   economic points of view. From the technical point of view, it is
   possible to identify the conditions on the model's parameters under
   which a pure separating equilibrium arises, and the conditions under
   that there instead exists a ``hybrid{''} equilibrium in which some types
   of Central Bankers adopt separating strategies whilst others adopt
   pooling strategies. From an economic point of view, the paper shows a
   number of relations that arise, in equilibrium, between the degree of
   observability and transparency of the Central Banker's goals and the
   inflation rate set by the Central Banker.},

Title = {Political influence, central bank independence and inflation in Africa:
   A comparative analysis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper develops a new de facto measure of central bank independence
   (CBI) based on two recent measures of the turnover rates of central bank
   governors introduced by Vuletin and Zhu (2011), complemented with
   measures of alliance with the government in power, captured by prior
   executive appointment, tribe proximity, and political party affiliation.
   Using 1980-2009 data from 13 countries from the CFA zone (a currency
   union) and 18 non-CFA countries, the new index is used to 1) examine
   whether CBI can help achieve price stability in Africa and 2) show how
   CBI affects African countries that are part of a monetary union. We find
   that higher turnover rates lead to higher inflation. Our results are
   robust to the decomposition of the turnover rates into premature
   removals and ally replacements. Furthermore, we find that for CFA zone
   countries, central bank autonomy has no effect on inflation and instead
   inflation is driven by other variables such as the fixed exchange rate
   regime or commodity price shocks.},

Abstract = {Personal data protection is one of the important areas of the EU's
   operation and the general public is especially aware of the General Data
   Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, personal data protection has been
   an issue in the EU for a long time. The Court of Justice of the European
   Union (CJEU) plays a major role in personal data protection as their
   function is to interpret EU law and thus also EU legislation related to
   personal data protection. Until now, research papers have tackled
   specific issues related to interpreting EU legislation or analyses of
   specific decisions made by the CJEU. However, no comprehensive empirical
   legal study has been published so far which would evaluate the
   decision-making of the CJEU in the area of personal data protection
   using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Therefore,
   no analysis has been carried out to determine how many decisions of the
   CJEU have been related to personal data protection, how their number has
   increased, or which participants and from which areas have participated
   in the proceedings. The results of the analysis presented here can be
   used as a basis for studying the future development of the CJEU's
   decision-making in the area of personal data protection in relation to
   digitization and especially to the COVID-19 pandemic, which undoubtedly
   has contributed to a significant increase in online communication,
   posing new challenges towards a more efficient personal data protection
   in the online world.},

Abstract = {Objective As labor markets in recent decades have become increasingly
   volatile and precarious, more workers are susceptible to working
   conditions threatening their economic security. COVID-19 has further
   laid bare such economic insecurity from holding a precarious job. We
   examined the association between precarious employment and the
   probability of losing income or a job during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods
   A multivariate regression analysis was conducted using a cross-sectional
   data set collected in May 2020 in the United States. Results Our results
   confirm a strong positive association between precarious employment and
   losing work or income. Specifically, holding part-time work in the
   service sector, and feeling disempowered in the workplace, receiving low
   material rewards, having few benefits, and experiencing obstacles in
   exercising rights all significantly doubled the probability of losing
   income or jobs. Conclusion Our analysis underscores the increasing
   vulnerability faced by our workforce and how a public health crisis
   magnifies the dire consequences of a precarious job.},

Abstract = {Objective Prevailing theories posit some party activists are amateurs,
   driven primarily by purposive benefits, while other activists are
   professionals, motivated mostly by material benefits. The decline of
   patronage and the rise of polarization suggest re-examining the
   relevancy of this distinction. Methods The study uses data from a 2019
   survey of 1,060 local party chairs in the United States, covering 49
   states. Results Most respondents are motivated by purposive benefits,
   while career motivations are relatively rare. Those who do derive
   material benefits are only slightly more centrist than their peers and
   are no more pragmatic and no less likely to derive purposive benefits. A
   substantial segment of local chairs are interested in seeking elective
   office, but the motivations of these individuals with ambitions
   connected to party activism are dominated by purposive benefits as much
   as those of the unambitious. Conclusion The study demonstrates the
   professional-amateur typology no longer accurately characterizes local
   party activists.},

Abstract = {Monetary respondent incentives are a means to counteract the trend
   toward declining response rates. This article summarizes the results of
   a series of experiments conducted in the past decade in the German
   General Social Survey. We found that prepaid monetary incentives led to
   a higher increase in response than promised incentives. There was no
   evidence that either promised or prepaid incentives had a systematic
   effect on sample composition. The incentives helped to reduce fieldwork
   efforts. Thus, the costs of incentives can-at least partially-be offset
   by a reduction in the number of contact attempts required to achieve a
   certain number of completed interviews. Our findings are highly credible
   due to the replicative design of the experiments.},

Abstract = {Objective While the aim of COVID-19 policies is to suppress the
   pandemic, many fear that the burden of the restrictions will fall more
   heavily on less privileged groups. We show one potential mechanism for
   COVID-19 responses to increase inequality by examining the intersection
   of business restrictions and business political connections. Methods We
   fielded an online survey of 2735 business employees and managers in
   Ukraine, Egypt, and Venezuela over the summer of 2020 to collect data on
   companies' closures due to COVID-19 and nuanced information about their
   political connections. Findings We show that businesses with political
   connections to government officials were significantly less likely to
   shut down as a result of COVID-19 policies. This finding suggests that
   measures designed to mitigate COVID-19 are ineffective in countries with
   a weak rule of law if politically connected firms are able to circumvent
   restrictions by leveraging political connections to receive preferential
   treatment. In addition, politically connected firms are no more
   likely-and sometimes even less likely-to engage in social-distancing
   policies to mitigate the pandemic despite the fact that they are more
   likely to remain open.},

Abstract = {Objective The literature onadolescent consumption behavior asserts that
   environmental features affect buying impulsiveness of the urban youth in
   Korea. This research assesses this assertion by examining adolescents'
   buying impulsiveness through the integration of mediating and moderating
   effects that exert influence on them. Method We used a structural
   equation model to evaluate the relationships between all constructs and
   the measurement errors of multi-indicators, and to determine whether the
   proposed relationships are supported by the data. Results School as an
   environmental feature did not universally influence adolescents'
   materialistic values, as its effect in this respect was instead
   moderated by students' level of exposure to mass media. When a high
   level of such exposure was present, school had a substantial impact on
   the presence and growth of materialistic values. In terms of another
   environmental feature, the influence of students' peers significantly
   increased their buying impulsiveness, while the influence of parents
   moderately decreased it. Conclusion This study contributes to the
   elaboration of a more comprehensive causal model of adolescents' buying
   impulsiveness.},

Abstract = {Objective This paper studies the direct and indirect impacts of
   political regimes on corruption. Whereas the interplay of government is
   fundamental to corrupt acts, the present research sheds new light by
   showing the direct and indirect influences of dimensions of government
   structure on corruption. Methods We employ two different estimation
   techniques. First, we use OLS regressions, with year and regional
   dummies. Second, we employ mediation analysis to account for the
   intermediate role of government size in the relation between government
   structure and corruption in order to gauge the direct and indirect
   influences on corruption Results Results show that government structure,
   across various dimensions of authoritarian and nonauthoritarian regimes,
   significantly impacted cross-national corruption. In particular, a
   nation's stock of democracy and parliamentary systems lowered
   corruption, while executive tenure and dimensions of authoritarianism
   added to corruption. On the other hand, the size of the legislature did
   not matter when it came to corruption. However, the direct influences of
   these government structure variables are mitigated or reinforced when
   the intermediate role of government size is considered in a mediation
   analysis. Conclusions The breakdown into the direct and indirect effects
   on corruption is a novel insight of this work, with useful policy
   implications.},

Title = {The ``costs{''} of voting: The effects of vote-by-mail on election
   administration finance in Colorado},

Abstract = {Objective In this article,I ask whether the adoption of vote-by-mail
   (VBM) has resulted in the promised cost reductions. Additionally, I
   examine the overall determinants of election administration expenditures
   after the implementation of VBM. Methods Using Colorado as a case study,
   I use county level expenditures to determine the effects of
   institutional change on election administration finance, as well as
   other institutional and socio-demographic determinants on costs. Results
   I find that adopting all-VBM elections significantly reduced
   expenditures. Additionally, I find that after VBM was implemented, the
   primary institutional determinants of expenditures are the proportion of
   mail-in ballots received, as well as the number of poll-workers, and
   early voting sites. Finally, I find that socio-demographic
   characteristics are predictive of expenditures for election
   administration. Counties with higher income spent less per voter in
   federal elections. Counties with higher proportions of Latinx
   voting-aged populations spent less per voter, even when controlling for
   turnout. Conclusion The results strongly indicate that moving to all-VBM
   elections can help cash-strapped counties save money. However,
   conversion to VBM may not guarantee that expenditures will be spent
   equitably.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine how political party preference and politically
   active social media use associate with social media behaviors - namely,
   conformist, provocative, and protective - in the context of the current
   political sphere in Finland. In our empirical analysis, we use a
   nationally representative dataset collected from 3,724 Finnish citizens
   in 2018. Our research confirms the assumption that there are notable
   differences in the social media behaviors of the supporters of different
   political parties. Additionally, our research shows that politically
   active social media use increases the occurrence for all three
   aforementioned behaviors. The study's results also confirm that major
   differences in online behavior exist among the new identity parties'
   supporters, who rely heavily on post-materialist and neoconservative
   political values.},

Abstract = {Kurdish women fighters of the Women's Protection Unit, YPJ (Yekineyen
   Parastine Jin) received considerable attention in Western Europe and the
   United States. They made the headlines of mainstream newspapers and
   magazines. The emergence of an all-women, secular military force in the
   Middle East initiated a multi-layered process of conditional recognition
   of the Kurdish struggle - a `recognition' in the sense of wide media
   coverage, but `conditional' since it sought to divorce the feminist
   approach from its very specific political narrative and then reconnect
   it with Western liberalism. This paper critically delves into questions
   of a gendered geopolitics that portrays the Kurdish (feminist) struggle
   in the US popular discourses while silencing the voices of women and
   ignoring its historical roots and development. Based on an analysis of
   articles published in The Washington Post, New York Times, and Newsweek
   about the struggle for Kobane, we discuss the ways in which geopolitics,
   Orientalism and gender are interrelated in reports about this struggle.
   One of our main conclusions is that not despite, but rather through, the
   portrayal of Kurdish women fighters as heroines-even as angels-the idea
   of the Middle East was reproduced as a geography of fear, backwardness,
   and violence. The images of Kurdish women fighters may have
   superficially appeared to suggest a recognition of their struggle, this
   is a recognition that works through the presentation of images
   (portrait) at the expense of silencing the voices of the actors engaged
   in a struggle for a project that envisages a non-statist democracy.
   Although the portrayal of this struggle in Western media, in which the
   image of struggling women is disconnected from their politics, does not
   contribute to a recognition of their struggle, the women's enunciation
   of their struggle in historical and political terms pushes the door for
   the audibility of Kurdish women's voices.},

Abstract = {This text aims to balance some of the elements identified as defining
   and shared features of the different liberal political cultures, from a
   view based on political elites, with the understanding voters maintained
   of their condition and the meaning they gave to the vote. To achieve
   this goal the text will examine electoral protests, petitions for
   inclusion in the electoral census and other documentation written by
   voters during the consolidation of liberalism in Spain (1837-1868). From
   a conceptual analysis of the discourses and a cultural view based on the
   voice of the voters, the prevailing vision of liberal politics will be
   revised. The main conclusions show that despite their ideological
   differences most voters understood the vote as a right, and that they
   used electoral requests as a means of political participation.},

Title = {Temporal bordering in the space of the camp: Producing and contesting
   abandonment in Skaramagas and Elaionas camps in Athens},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the temporalities of camps and the ways in which
   abandonment is produced within them through the deployment of temporal
   bordering practices. It presents empirical ethnographic evidence,
   gathered between January and June 2017, from Skaramagas and Elaionas
   camps in Athens. Although intended as temporary humanitarian solutions,
   many migrants have remained in them for long periods, stuck in a state
   of temporariness. Camps have been studied extensively through the lens
   of biopolitics as spaces of abandonment and abjectification. More
   recently, a growing body of literature is highlighting the everyday
   micro-politics and tactics of belonging that take place within them.
   Drawing on the latter, I shed light on the temporal aspects of border
   control involved in camps, arguing that camps provide a temporal, rather
   than only spatial, technology that governs encamped migrants through the
   administration of their time. Thus, the camp governs the critical moment
   between reception and in/exclusion from the polity. Yet, as I show,
   within this condition of semipermanence and semi-presence, camp
   residents, through the practice of everyday life, being present and
   visible, create places and give new meanings to existing ones. If the
   border is enacted through the imposed temporalities of the camp, then
   its subversion can be found in these everyday place-making tactics.
   Looking into these micro-practices, this paper contributes to the above
   debates by exploring camps as temporal technologies of control.},

Title = {Faith no more? The divergence of political trust between urban and rural
   Europe},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Events such as Brexit and the Gilet Jaunes protests have highlighted the
   spatial nature of populism. In particular, there has been increasing
   political divergence between urban and rural areas, with rural areas
   apparently having lost faith in national governments. We investigate
   this divergence using data on over 125,000 EU citizens from the European
   Social Survey from 2008 to 2018. We show that people in rural areas have
   lower political trust than urban or peri-urban residents, with this
   difference clear for six different forms of political institutions,
   including politicians, political parties, and national parliaments.
   There has been divergence of political trust between urban and rural
   Europe since 2008, although this is primarily driven by Southern Europe.
   While these results can partly be explained by demographic differences
   between cities and the countryside, divergent economic experiences,
   differences in values, and perceptions that public services are less
   effective outside of urban areas, there is a residual `rural effect'
   beyond this. We argue that the polarisation of urban-rural political
   trust has important implications for the functioning of European
   democracies.},

Abstract = {This research examines how race moderates the association between social
   media news consumption and political participation. Through an analysis
   of Pew Research Center survey data, this study finds that social
   networking sites (SNS) are crucial for racial minorities' political
   participation. Racial minorities showed a higher level of SNS usage for
   news consumption, and Black people exhibited significantly higher levels
   of online political participation than White people, especially when SNS
   news consumption was at a low frequency. Yet the association between SNS
   news use and online participation was stronger for White people than
   Black people. In contrast, this research did not find a significant
   racial gap in offline voting engagement nor extra democratic benefits of
   SNS news consumption for racial minorities.},

Title = {Scripting climate futures: The geographical assumptions of climate
   planning},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {88},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC), the global governing apparatus of climate planning, has
   privileged the sovereignty of territorial states. Contemporary political
   geographical scholarship has since called into question the coherency of
   the state as a unitary entity and as the sole legitimate arbiter of
   international politics. This article extends these contributions to
   planetary climate change adaptation. Through discourse analysis and the
   multi-scalar institutional and political history of climate planning,
   this article examines how normative discursive parameters enact
   prevailing political dynamics that script material futures. Drawing on
   recent climate planning reports of Palestine and Israel, this article
   investigates how state discourses operate within an asymmetric
   geopolitical context where issues of territoriality, sovereignty, and
   statecraft remain fractured and contested. Climate planning in
   Israel/Palestine exposes two key institutional constraints of climate
   governance. First, technical-managerial principles prescribe ahistorical
   adaptation measures that inadequately address inherently political
   constraints. Second, the elision of politicaleconomic and
   historical-cultural contingencies in favor of a universalizing
   geophysical representation of climate change elides the systemic
   production of differentiated vulnerability. Consequential of an
   anachronistic politics of recognition within the UNFCCC, the conditions
   of climate governance may ultimately embolden the asymmetric status quo.
   I conclude by highlighting the spatial manifestations (both material and
   symbolic) of Israeli sovereign violence and the chronic indeterminacy of
   Palestinian territoriality produced by discursive climate futures.},

Abstract = {The Westphalian concept of sovereignty frames international relations
   and law. Since the 2007 UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous
   Peoples, the notion of Indigenous sovereignty has also entered
   international political debate. In this article, we examine the
   underlying premise of Westphalian and Indigenous sovereignties. A
   scoping review of the literature reveals that Westphalian sovereignty is
   a Eurocentric concept implicated in the colonialisation of Indigenous
   peoples in settler societies. Conversely, Indigenous sovereignty is a
   broader idea that involves social and cultural aspects, recognises the
   interdependencies between political actors and relationships to the
   land, and acknowledges the contextualised nature of sovereignty. We
   suggest that the two conceptions of sovereignty cannot be reconciled
   with each other. However, in a shifting political terrain, Indigenous
   sovereignty poses a critical challenge to the Eurocentric definition of
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {With the significant disconnect between the collective aim of limiting
   warming to well below 2 degrees C and the current means proposed to
   achieve such an aim, the goal of this paper is to offer a moral
   assessment of prominent alternatives to current international climate
   policy. To do so, we'll outline five different policy routes that could
   potentially bring the means and goal in line. Those five policy routes
   are: (1) exceed 2 degrees C; (2) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C
   by economic de-growth; (3) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C by
   traditional mitigation only; (4) limit warming to less than 2 degrees C
   by traditional mitigation and widespread deployment of Negative
   Emissions Technologies (NETs); and (5) limit warming to less than 2
   degrees C by traditional mitigation, NETs, and Solar Radiation
   Management as a fallback. In assessing these five policy routes, we rely
   primarily upon two moral considerations: the avoidance of catastrophic
   climate change and the right to sustainable development. We'll conclude
   that we should continue to aim at the two-degree target, and that to get
   there we should use aggressive mitigation, pursue the deployment of
   NETs, and continue to research SRM.},

Abstract = {Migrants who reach EU asylum camps face various forms of spatialised
   violence that are bolstered by or produced within these geopolitical
   protracted spaces of waiting. Segregated from society, migrants
   experience processes of displacement, alienation and vulnerability as
   their legal status restricts their mobility and postpones employment or
   education opportunities. They are simultaneously suspended in a state of
   continuous disruption as they move through a series of camps while
   waiting for a decision on their applications. In remonstration, some
   migrants develop advocacy networks within and across camps in an attempt
   to challenge the hierarchical control of the everyday spaces and
   politics that migrants encounter in camps. Drawing on original
   fieldwork, this paper interrogates the intersection of the spatial
   production of geopolitical violence in camps and migrant agency within
   these distinctive political spaces. I argue that a state-centred
   examination of spaces of violence and migrant agency fails to attend to
   embodied and emotional landscapes when problematising the geographies of
   camps and those waiting in interim zones of confinement. In contrast,
   this examination of the embodied migrant experiences and advocacy
   networks brings the geopolitics of human and affective matter to the
   forefront. In this way, the article highlights migrant agency in
   response to their lived experience and the embodied geopolitical
   violence of control, categorisation and exclusion that is produced in
   the various spatialities of asylum seeking.},

   complete workflow of information processing, starting with sound
   recording in the Plenary Hall and ending with its publication in text
   format on the home page of the Riigikogu. Another digital innovation is
   the possibility to hold the plenary sittings so that the members of the
   Riigikogu do not have to be physically present in the room where the
   sitting takes place, and they can participate with the help of

Abstract = {This article describes and discusses how normative journalistic roles
   are formulated across Europe. The material was obtained from the
   2012-2016 wave of the Worlds of Journalism Study, a comparative study
   designed to assess the state of journalism throughout the world. The
   advantage of this study over similar undertakings in the past is that we
   did not confront journalists with ready-made statements but invited them
   to tell us, in their own words, what they thought the major roles of
   journalists in their countries ought to be. Open responses of more than
   10,200 journalists from twenty-seven European countries yielded 12,860
   references. Results show that the most important roles refer to the
   domain of political life, especially the informational-instructive and
   the critical-monitorial functions-a finding that is consistent across
   the twenty-seven countries investigated. Beyond this shared global
   vision, it is, however, possible to point out some national
   specificities, keeping in mind that even if the core of the normative
   roles remains somewhat universal, a detailed comparison of those roles
   in their cultural context allows us to grasp some differences in their
   hierarchy and their meaning.},

Title = {What constitutes a constitutional amendment culture?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why are some constitutions amended frequently and others hardly at all?
   An obvious candidate determinant is constitutional rigidity, i.e., the
   size and number of procedural barriers to amendment. Given some demand
   for amendment, greater rigidity implies a smaller supply. However,
   measures of rigidity often do not correlate significantly (or even with
   the predicted sign) with amendment rates. Ginsburg and Melton (2015)
   argue that amendment culture ? ?shared attitudes about the desirability
   of amendment? ? is a more important determinant of amendment rates. We
   study up to 128 constitutional episodes from 54 countries and estimate
   relationships between amendment rates and Hofstede cultural indices.
   Cultures that are more individualistic and less prone to uncertainty

Abstract = {This paper examines whether central bank communication stabilises euro
   area inflation expectations through the information and news channel. A
   novelty of the study is its use of data from Google Analytics on ECB
   website traffic as proxy for visitors' attention to its communication.
   We conduct several econometric tests with daily data to measure the
   impact of ECB communication on the information demand of the public and
   ultimately on inflation expectations. Overall, this study shows that
   website attention, as captured by search volumes of visitors, influences
   euro area inflation expectations. We find that increased website
   attention contributes to narrowing the gap between market-based
   forecasts and (the mean of) longer-term professional inflation
   expectations. Our findings add to the theoretical evidence on the
   existence of an information and news channel.},

Abstract = {Supported by UK and Irish membership of the European Union (EU), the
   1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement's post-sovereignist compromise helped
   to diminish the contested politics of the border in Ireland. However, by
   altering the status of the border, Brexit aroused and fomented
   politically charged divisions in Northern Ireland. We explore the
   confluence of four consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland. Firstly,
   we detail how Brexit highlights the inadequacies and dysfunction of the
   UK's territorial architecture. Second, we examine the specific
   structural, institutional and relational weaknesses of Northern
   Ireland's devolved system. Third, we explain how Brexit further weakened
   the scaffolding that supports Northern Ireland's devolved settlement.
   And fourth, we explore why Brexit has prompted profound reconsideration
   of the UK's existing territorial set-up. Brexit's challenge to the
   status quo in Northern Ireland, and by extension the UK's constitutional
   and territorial integrity, is linked not just to internal political
   dynamics in Northern Ireland, but also to the ambiguity of the existing
   asymmetrical UK devolution settlement, its lack of embeddedness within
   the UK constitutional order and the absence of binding cultural
   narratives. Finally, we extend this analysis to posit that Brexit has
   revived the `Irish question' and stirred a potentially destabilizing
   debate about Irish unity.},

Title = {Rights and health versus rights to health: Bringing Indigenous Peoples `
   legal rights into the spaces of health care services},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The political-legal discourse of Indigenous rights continues to be
   separated from discussions of health care services in geographic
   scholarship, due to the ways in which political-legal, settler-colonial
   definitions of rights fail to take Indigenous understandings into
   account, as well as a distrust on the part of scholars of the limited
   and contingent notion of ``rights.{''} While Indigenous rights,
   inherently tied in Canada to recognition by the settler colonial state,
   have limited application in achieving social justice or decolonization
   for Indigenous peoples, we argue that Indigenous rights can be used as a
   complementary discourse to Indigenous resurgence, within broader
   discourses of Indigenous justice, to lend legal and political weight to
   arguments for cultural safety and human rights in health care. We draw
   on a study conducted with 50 Indigenous community members and 15 health
   services professionals in the northern city of Prince George, Canada, to
   elucidate how Indigenous peoples' experiences in health care settings
   may be improved by giving attention to rights discourse and removing the
   geographic and identity-based limitations of Indigenous rights to health
   care in Canada.},

Abstract = {The internet has been praised as a tool that would increase political
   participation and enhance dialogue between politicians and the public.
   In fact, the widespread use of social media has turned the Internet into
   a valuable communication channel for both individuals and organizations.
   Notably, it presented many opportunities for politicians and political
   parties to reach their constituencies. However, studies on politicians'
   social media behaviors reported that they were using social media for
   broadcasting official political positions and self-promotion. In
   addition, the social media has become a tool to extend traditional
   politics into the cyberspace where interaction and exchange between
   rival political groups are rare and not very productive. As a result,
   ideological homophily was reported as the most crucial predictor of
   network formation on social media for politicians. This study explored
   that finding by analyzing Twitter friendships and retweeting networks of
   Turkish politicians. It found that political interests were more
   influential in politicians' social media networks than ideological
   homophily.},

Abstract = {In the European Union right-wing and left-wing populist parties are
   increasingly becoming stronger. Meanwhile in Central and Eastern Europe
   autocracies are emerging and becoming stabilized. Italy and Hungary are
   two notable examples of these processes. Italy is the only country in
   Western Europe where a coalition of purely populist parties won an
   election, while Hungary has the most mature autocracy in the European
   Union. By using survey methodology, we examined the preferences of
   Hungarian and Italian students regarding the values of liberal
   democracy. We seek answers to the questions whether there are any
   significant differences between the proportion of Hungarian students and
   Italian students who identify themselves with the values of liberal
   democracy and which of these values of liberal democracy they consider
   to be protected values. Based on our results, we claim that students
   from both countries are more likely to support liberal democratic values
   than to support either right-wing or left-wing populist values, even if
   the distributions of the two groups differ significantly. We found that
   Italian students adhere more strongly to liberal democratic values,
   while Hungarians are more open to left-wing and right-wing populism. Our
   results confirm that in Hungary, because of the values that many people
   hold, conditions are conducive for establishing a sustainable autocracy,
   while in Italy, the demand for such a system is much weaker.},

Abstract = {A certain social-political geography recurs across European and North
   American societies: As post-industrialization and mechanization of
   agriculture have disrupted economies, rural and nonmetropolitan areas
   are aging and declining in population, leading to widening political and
   cultural gaps between metropolitan and rural communities. Yet political
   communication research tends to focus on national or cross-national
   levels, often emphasizing networked digital media and an implicitly
   global information order. We contend that geographic place still
   provides a powerful grounding for individuals' lifeworld experiences,
   identities, and orientations to political communications and politics.
   Focusing on the U.S. state of Wisconsin, and presenting data gathered in
   2018, this study demonstrates significant, though often small,
   differences between geographic locations in terms of their patterns of
   media consumption, political talk, and anti-elite attitudes.
   Importantly, television news continues to play a major role in citizens'
   repertoires across locations, suggesting we must continue to pay
   attention to this broadcast medium. Residents of more metropolitan
   communities consume significantly more national and international news
   from prestige sources such as the New York Times, and their talk
   networks are more cleanly sorted by partisanship. Running against common
   stereotypes of news media use, residents of small towns and rural areas
   consume no more conservative media than other citizens, even without
   controlling for partisanship. Our theoretical model and empirical
   results call for further attention to the intersections of place and
   politics in understanding news consumption behaviors and the meanings
   citizens draw from media content.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008/9 social movements
   reminiscent of eco-emancipatory movements of the 1980s powerfully
   repoliticised the post-political order of neoliberalism. Additionally,
   and more recently, right-wing populist movements, Fridays for Future or
   political mobilisations related to the COVID-19 pandemic have
   substantially refashioned both the understanding of post-politics and
   the patterns of its repoliticisation. This article introduces a special
   issue on Movements and Activism beyond Post-politics. In light of these
   recent shifts we revisit the notion of post-politics, identify key
   characteristics of contemporary forms of repoliticisation, zoom in on
   academic debates about prefigurative and transformative politics and -
   following a preview of the contributions collated in the special issue -
   explore what the ongoing reconfiguration of public discourse may imply
   for further research into social movement activism beyond post-politics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the development and comparison of competition and
   concentration in the banking and insurance sector in the Czech Republic
   during the 2007-2019 period using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HH
   index). In the empirical section we calculate the degree of
   concentration and indexes separately for the banking and insurance
   markets. where the main variable in relation to banks is the balance
   sheet and this variable is the gross written premium in relation to
   insurance companies. Subsequently, we compare the two examined sectors
   including the analysis of their long-term equilibrium. The result of
   this research confirms the determined hypotheses, whereas the oligopolic
   structure of both markets, which falls over time and aims towards a
   competitive market but does not achieve this goal during the monitored
   period. Throughout examination, the insurance market demonstrates higher
   HH index values and therefore lower competitiveness compared to the
   banking market.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the causes of the growing popularity of
   the illiberal right, taking the Polish political party Law and Justice
   as an example. The adopted analytical approach combines insights derived
   from the work of Karl Polanyi and the tradition of historical
   institutionalism. The victory of Law and Justice in the 2015 Polish
   parliamentary elections is argued to constitute a critical juncture that
   initiated a fundamental break with the liberal order. Following Polanyi,
   we argue that the seeds of the recent anti-liberal counter-revolution
   can be found in the malfunctioning of the Polish economic order built
   during the period of transition. However, Law and Justice has managed to
   make use of the critical juncture arising from social discontent and has
   used it instrumentally to dismantle liberal constitutionalism and the
   rule of law.},

Abstract = {Based on the case of a sentence that ordered the government to build a
   towpath along a river in Buenos Aires, this article examines the
   socio-legal controversies aroused between a judge and the public
   defenders who represented the riverside's affected population. We shall
   find that the former, as he conducts the implementation of public
   policies, lessened the protection of social rights while the latter
   aimed at creating a conflict to make those rights the centre of the
   lawsuit. This work, based on a qualitative design that included in-depth
   interviews and document analyses, allowed examining the features of
   judicial activism in practice.},

Abstract = {The initial optimism on the revival of civic activism in Turkey
   following the Gezi protests in 2013 was short-lived. The deteriorating
   legal and political environment has considerably narrowed the civic
   space for civil society activity. However, the mass mobilizations in
   2017 and 2019 showed not only the ongoing willingness but also the
   activist groups' ongoing capacity to collectively defy, resist and
   contend. This article focuses on this capacity which I term as the
   activist capital. More specifically, this article analyses post-Gezi
   activists' ability to adapt to deteriorating conditions and to retain
   the activist capital during abeyance. This article argues that activist
   capital is necessary to understand how activist groups sustain their
   movement in the post-Gezi environment in Turkey. By combining it with
   the concept of activist capital as a variable, this article enhances the
   abeyance theory and helps us better interpret movement continuity in
   repressive political environments. This article also shows how the
   activist groups act strategically to retain their activist capital.},

Abstract = {While the number of U.S. residents who speak non-English languages at
   home is on the rise, little is known about the sociopolitical
   implications of exposure to minority languages among multilingual
   speakers in the United States. This study analyzes whether exposure to
   Spanish, a U.S. minority language, impacts perceptions of linked fate
   among bilingual Latinos, and if so, whether the consumption of ethnic
   media amplifies this effect. Through a population-based survey
   experiment among bilingual Latinos, this study finds that Latinos who
   are exposed to content in Spanish are more likely to report in-group
   linked fate than their counterparts exposed to the same message in
   English. Moreover, these effects are stronger among consumers of
   Spanish-language news. This study contributes to our understanding of
   the role of minority languages and ethnic media on pan-ethnic identities
   and highlights the importance of the growing linguistic diversity in the
   United States.},

Abstract = {Through an investigation of authoritarian encounters in Russia, Belarus,
   and Ukraine, this paper takes seriously the challenges of making
   geopolitical sense of contextualised micro moments. Working in a minor
   key, the paper offers three contributions. First, it advances a minor
   theory, micropolitical sensibility that interrogates the co-constitution
   of intimate and geopolitical scales. Second, it proposes a loose
   ethnographic framework to guide the analysis of ordinary moments, link
   them outside of the immediate, and make fuller sense of the
   geopolitical: rupture, digestion, connection, and representation. Third,
   it aspires to destabilise regional container thinking and Orientalising
   tendencies through a focus on authoritarian practices rather than
   authoritarian states. Overall, the paper foregrounds a minoritarian
   reading of the micro-dynamics of authoritarian encounter in order to
   enrich the conversation on the constitution of the geopolitical, while
   also offering an intimate and interconnected methodology that encourages
   critical, safe, and ethical research under authoritarian conditions.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on political Islam suggests that support for early Islamist
   movements came from literate merchants, government officials, and
   professionals who lacked political representation. We test these claims
   with a unique tranche of microlevel data drawn from a Muslim Brotherhood
   petition campaign in interwar Egypt. Matching the occupations of over
   2,500 Brotherhood supporters to contemporaneous census data, we show
   that Egyptians employed in commerce, public administration, and the
   professions were more likely to sign the movement's petitions. The
   movement's supporters were also overwhelmingly literate. Contrary to
   expectations, the early Brotherhood also attracted support from
   Egyptians employed in agriculture, albeit less than we would expect
   given the prevalence of agrarian workers in the population. A case study
   tracing Muslim Brotherhood branch formation and petition activism in a
   Nile Delta village illustrates how literate, socially mobile agrarian
   families were key to the propagation of the movement in rural areas.},

Abstract = {In recent years, computers have been used to generate ensembles of
   districting plans: collections of large numbers of electoral maps that
   are used to assess a proposed map in the context of valid alternatives.
   Ensemble-based outlier analysis has played a central role in recent
   redistricting disputes, especially regarding partisan gerrymandering.
   Until now, methods for generating these ensembles have enforced
   districting rules that are relatively simple to assess, such as
   population equality, but have not contended with more complex ones, such
   as the prohibitions against racial gerrymandering and minority vote
   dilution that flow from the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act
   (VRA). We take up the task of building ensembles of plans that respect
   those legal constraints. Rather than relying on demographic data alone,
   our method uses precinct-level returns from a large collection of recent
   primary and general elections. With this electoral history, we build
   effectiveness scores that identify districts where members of minority
   groups have had realistic opportunities to nominate and elect their
   preferred candidates. In a case study of Texas congressional districts,
   we find that detailed election data is indispensable to assessing a
   map's effectiveness for minority voters. Purely demographic targets,
   such as demanding some specific number of majority-minority districts,
   not only raise constitutional concerns but also are inadequate proxies
   for empirical effectiveness. Beyond the primary task of building
   VRA-conscious ensembles for comparison, we also repurpose the same
   algorithmic search methods to find plans that dramatically increase
   minority electoral opportunities. In Texas, for example, the current
   enacted 36-district congressional plan has perhaps 11 to 13 districts
   that are effective for Latino voters, Black voters, or both. We find
   that better mapmaking could raise that number to at least 16 without
   sacrificing traditional principles such as contiguity and compactness.
   This would nearly eliminate the historic underrepresentation of both
   groups throughout the state.},

Abstract = {Seminars, long under-studied in the history of economic thought, are now
   considered as worthy historical objects. This article contributes to
   this growing trend by studying a series of seminars entitled ``Seminar
   on Trust and Social Change{''} held at King's College Cambridge from
   1985 to 1986. Organised by sociologist Diego Gambetta, this seminar
   acted as a genuine interface for scientific exchanges and allowed two
   parallel research programs to exchange methods and objects so as to form
   a interdisciplinary program on the notion of trust.},

Abstract = {Objectives This article responds to an understudied question on how does
   marital status make a difference in terms of voter turnout among young
   people in the Muslim world. Methods The article draws on the 2010 Muslim
   Youth Survey and focus on 1127 respondents aged between 15 and 25 in
   Indonesia. Using binominal logistic regression analysis, it seeks to
   examine how marital status affects Indonesian young people's voting
   behaviour in three types of elections held in 2009: legislative,
   presidential, and regional. Results The finding confirms that married
   young individuals are more likely to vote than those who are not
   married. However, the marriage gap only exists in the legislative and
   presidential elections as the impact of marital status diminishes in
   regional elections. Conclusion This paper contributes to the literature
   by examining how the marriage gap in politics does not only occur in
   post-industrialized and developed countries. Also, regional election
   systematically prevents young voters to participate as the ballot sheets
   are only available in respective jurisdiction.},

Abstract = {Objective I argue that an autocracy's oil export discourages democracies
   from employing foreign policies fostering democracy in the autocracy
   because three characteristics of oil trade-the importance of oil as a
   primary energy source, the international oil market's exporter-favored
   structure, and the price inelasticity of supply of and demand for
   petroleum-increase costs of such policies. Thus, an autocracy's oil
   export hinders democratization by reducing both domestic and external
   democratizing pressures. Methods To measure the effect of oil export on
   direct external democratizing pressures, I gather the dyad-level oil
   trade ties using numerous oil trade datasets, and calculate each state's
   oil export leverage using closeness centrality in weighted networks.
   Using this measure, I test the effect of oil export on the likelihood of
   democratization. Results Empirical results support that as an
   autocracy's oil export leverage increases, the autocracy's likelihood of
   democratization should decrease.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between social media use, disease
   risk perception, social and political trust, and out-group stereotyping
   and prejudice during a social upheaval. Analyses of primary data
   collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease
   risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice
   against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news
   were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who
   engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive
   social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice.
   Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower
   stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network
   characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social
   trust, and prejudice were observed.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 arose during the presidential primary
   process and spring elections for states across the U.S. One of the
   consequences of the pandemic on election administration was the closure
   of polling locations due to resource constraints and public health
   concerns. We aim to measure the extent to which disparities in electoral
   access and participation arose given polling place closures during the
   April 7, 2020, Wisconsin spring election. We run a spatial probit
   analysis on the probability of poll closures given population density
   and nonwhite populations of a given area using poll coordinate data
   provided by the Wisconsin Electoral Commission. We follow up to take
   advantage of the exogenous nature of poll closures to measure the impact
   of closure costs within the counties of Milwaukee and Dane via a
   multilevel logit analysis of turnout by mode. We find that the pandemic
   led to a series of poll closures that systematically impacted racial
   minorities and areas of high population density. Further, these poll
   closure costs as measured in increased distance to and size of polls are
   associated with reduced voter turnout, especially within Milwaukee
   County. We conclude that disparate access to polling places and costs of
   poll closures present challenges that must be overcome for purposes of
   election legitimacy and social cohesion.},

Abstract = {Objective Large, federated voluntary associations of the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries produced detailed reports of national meetings that
   included comprehensive data on state-level membership. Though used in
   previous scholarship, the veracity of these data has never been
   evaluated. Methods We test 16 associations' state-level membership data,
   generally between 1880 and 1920, using Benford's Law, a mathematical
   principle used to discern whether data are potentially
   problematic-through error, fraud, or other reasons-and require further
   investigation. Results Our initial analyses reveal that these data
   deviate statistically from Benford's predictions. Further investigation,
   however, finds that these differences are not substantively significant;
   an aggregate measure of all associations shows close conformity to the
   Newcomb-Benford distribution. Conclusion The data presented in voluntary
   associations' annual reports are likely trustworthy. These findings have
   important implications for future use of these data, other association
   data, and the role of associations in promoting civil society.},

Abstract = {An extensive literature has examined the economic effects of non-violent
   political instability events. Nonetheless, the issue of whether
   economies react differently over time to such events remains largely
   unexplored. Using synthetic control methodology, which constructs a
   counterfactual in the absence of political instability, we estimate the
   output effect of 38 regime crises in the period 1970-2011. A crucial
   factor is whether crises are accompanied by mass civil protest. In the
   crises accompanied by mass civil protest, there is typically an
   immediate fall in output which is never recovered in the subsequent five
   years. In crises unaccompanied by protest, there are usually no
   significant output effects. It is unclear, however, whether mass civil
   protest causes the greater fall in output or is simply an indicator of a
   more severe political crisis.},

Abstract = {Purpose Human capital flight from developing countries to developed
   nations has been rising and giving concerns to governments and scholars
   alike. This paper aims to explore the impact migration from Nigeria has
   on economic output growth by focusing on the migration rate,
   remittances, population growth and secondary school enrolment. This has
   not received adequate attention in the literature, as many papers have
   primarily focused on the impact of remittances on economic growth.
   Design/methodology/approach Leveraging on the macro-level approach to
   migration, remittances and the economy, this research considers the
   nexus among the human capital flight and output growth variables by
   using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method of analysis for
   time series data between 1986 and 2018. Findings The net migration rate
   from Nigeria was found from the empirical analysis to be more
   disadvantageous for the economy, given its negative relationship with
   economic growth despite the large volume of foreign incomes
   (remittances). It also shows that secondary school enrolment positively
   and significantly impacted the Nigerian growth rate in the long run.
   Originality/value This research has widened the use of variables by
   combining net migration rate, remittances from abroad, population growth
   rate and secondary school enrolment to obtain a more robust outcome with
   implications for research and practice.},

Abstract = {Military spouses are situated at the junction of the military and
   civilian worlds. They provide necessary support to military strategic
   and operational objectives and are also expected to perform a
   traditional spousal role of the `good' military wife. This article
   demonstrates the existence of strong military partner archetypes which
   guide military community norms and expectations of spousal behaviour. In
   14 qualitative interviews and five focus groups with Australian military
   partners, participants revealed many different, yet firm, sentiments
   related to identity, including fierce independence; a sense of
   belonging; self-reliance; a desire to help others; belief in fairness
   and pragmatism. The archetypes outlined in this article shape how
   partners see their role, and how they interact with other non-military
   partners and the military organization. This research delivers insights
   into optimizing military partner services to better support spouses
   through deployment, relocation and other military experiences.},

Abstract = {Local and environmental governance is crucial for contending with the
   complex problems of land-use systems and socio-ecological conflicts that
   bedevil progress toward sustainable development. The community-based
   governance (CBG) framework is a practical instrument designed to
   identify collective problems, source the appropriate institutions and
   articulate joint solutions. It uses community perspectives to construct
   local and environmental governance models. Through a literature review,
   two expert workshops and 37 applied questionnaires, a bottom-up CBG
   model that could enhance environmental and local governance in a
   post-conflict era for two Colombian administrative departments is
   developed. Strengthening law enforcement, supporting sustainable
   land-use systems and promoting education are integral to a
   participatory-led approach to socio-ecological conflict prevention and
   resolution. The results are instructive for other communities and
   regions facing persistent conflict.},

Title = {International rivers as border infrastructures: En/forcing borders in
   South Asia},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rivers have long been convenient yet troublesome borders. Inherently
   itinerant, rivers routinely defy cartographic depictions of borders as
   static, territorially bounded formations. Such dynamism poses material
   and conceptual challenges to state regulatory activities, resulting in
   increasingly heterodox attempts to fix waterbodies through various
   securitizing mechanisms. I examine the dialectical relationship between
   rivers and borders through the concept of the river-border complex. I
   ask how the Ganges River shapes the form and function of the
   Indo-Bangladeshi border and how, in turn, bordering practices in India
   regulate flows along the river, which comprises 129 km of India's border
   with Bangladesh. Drawing on archival records, in-person interviews, and
   river data, I find that the border and efforts to secure it mediate many
   flows along the river. The study corroborates previous work within
   critical border studies that securitizing cross-border flows has the
   perverse effect of generating greater insecurity in adjoining countries.
   Crucially, historical analysis of sediment, information, and human flows
   reveals how international rivers also determine patterns and processes
   of circulation and thereby warrant reconceptualization as border
   infrastructures, rather than as merely being subject to them.},

Abstract = {When the International Energy Agency (IEA) was established out of the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1974,
   Australia was not among its founding members. Indeed, it was opposed to
   its formation and even contemplated voting in the OECD to block its
   establishment. A single negative vote under the ``mutual agreement{''}
   rule would have done so. This paper, based on archival research,
   explores the reasons for this course of action and shows that the
   decision was linked to the resource nationalism at the time of Minister
   Rex Connor and his fear that supporting it might jeopardise his attempts
   to raise non-equity finance in the Middle East. This article shows that
   this previously unanalysed decision was connected to what became known
   as the ``Loans Affair{''} that brought about Connor's demise and
   contributed to the downfall of the Whitlam Government.},

   Journalists in the Twittersphere},

Abstract = {Research has provided few findings on the patterns of communication and
   interaction between political and media actors in social media and how
   these interactions have evolved. The present study analyzes how
   journalists registered in the German Federal Press Conference interact
   with members of the German Bundestag (member of parliament) on Twitter
   and what type of content they exchange with each other. Based on two
   time periods (2016, 2020), the communicative practices and the patterns
   of interactions are examined. New insights into the conversational
   structure are generated through a combination of content and network
   analysis. The results indicate a trend in the use of Twitter among the
   actors as a political opinion medium. While the dissemination of
   opinions among politicians remains stable, journalists use Twitter
   interactions more to express a subjective and critical view and less for
   news coverage over time. Furthermore, the analysis notes that
   journalists generally comment in negative terms on the parties, except
   for the Greens. To some extent, the results indicate that the usual
   journalistic norms of objectivity and balance do not apply for
   interactions in the Twittersphere. To evaluate whether this pattern also
   applies to other countries, more comparative investigations in the
   domain of media-politics interactions on Twitter are needed.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The more that health care expenditures are financed by general taxation,
   the greater the discretion governments are likely to exercise when
   timing increases in health care expenditures. Votemaximising governments
   time increases in health care expenditures to occur in economic upturns,
   when voters are not as aware of the required increase in taxation. In
   recessions, they have an incentive to sustain expenditures on health
   care by diverting expenditures from other public expenditure programmes
   that voters perceive as low priority. In this way, government pursuit of
   a political agenda is likely to exert a systematic influence on the
   cyclicality of government expenditure. Predictions are tested with
   reference to the cyclicality of government health expenditures, for a
   sample of OECD countries from 2000 to 2012.},

Volume = {68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Identification of the causal effect that foreign aid has on the quality
   of institutions in recipient countries has been elusive in the aid
   effectiveness literature. The main reason is that aid is endogenous with
   respect to the development of institutions. Our paper examines the
   impact of foreign aid on economic freedom in the recipient countries at
   a disaggregated level using an innovative identifying strategy. To do
   so, we use recently innovated instruments for aid, exploiting the long
   lags between loan approval and disbursements by official creditors to
   developing countries. Using plausibly exogenous variations in predicted
   loan disbursements as instruments for actual aid, we find that foreign
   aid has a significant positive effect on the quality of economic
   institutions in recipient countries. The results are robust to
   alternative specifications and samples. By establishing the existence of
   a strong link between aid and the quality of economic institutions, we
   identify the main channel through which aid affects economic growth and
   development.},

Title = {Neoliberalising the divided city},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper examines the relation between ethno-nationalism and
   neoliberalism in urban space. Contrary to common views in urban studies,
   it argues that the `ethno-nationally divided city' and the `neoliberal
   city' are not antithetical, but that neoliberal nationalism is a new
   modality of urban conflict in a globalised world, which reshapes the
   relation between the local and the global and draws new urban
   geopolitics. By investigating practices of nation-branding in a divided
   city, this paper bridges different theoretical fields to shed light on
   an aspect of urban conflict that has largely been ignored by the
   literature on nationalism and urban divisions. It also complements
   existing research on neoliberal nationalism by emphasising the spatial
   and material aspects of nation-branding, and by showing how it can be
   used by competing ethno-national leaders to mobilise their communities
   and extend their control at the national and urban levels. By
   highlighting processes common to neoliberal and divided cities, this
   paper draws on recent calls within urban geopolitics to rethink current
   theoretical categories and labels attributed to cities. It develops this
   analysis by examining contemporary neoliberal urban policies in Skopje,
   Macedonia, which have become a new battlefield where interethnic
   conflicts unfold.},

Title = {Limits to climate action-Narratives of bioenergy with carbon capture and
   storage},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {88},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has
   been awarded a key role in climate mitigation scenarios explored by
   integrated assessment models and referenced in reports by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Because a majority of
   scenarios limiting global warming to 2 degrees C or 1,5 degrees C
   include vast deployment of BECCS, a critical discussion has emerged
   among experts about the moral implications of thus introducing an
   unproven technology into the policy realm.
   In this paper, we analyse this discussion as it has played out between
   2013 and 2019, with a focus on how expert narratives are constructed in
   the mass media about the possibilities for decarbonisation within the
   current political-economic order. We find there are almost no narratives
   that support massive deployment of BECCS, and that all narratives
   presuppose limits to decarbonisation imposed by the current
   political-economic system. The perception of such limits lead some to
   argue, through deterministic and apolitical narratives, for the
   necessity of negative emissions technologies, while others argue instead
   that ``degrowth{''} is the only solution. Thus, there is a distinct lack
   of positive narratives about how capitalism can bring about
   decarbonisation.},

Abstract = {In this article, I ask two questions: Under what circumstances are
   voters most likely to leave the polling place line? Who is most likely
   to leave the polling place line? I present findings from a field
   observation study in which field researchers observed polling place
   operations at precincts across the country during the 2016 and 2018
   elections. I find that the number of people in line, voter
   identification laws, and the racial composition of the precinct have an
   effect on rates of reneging, though the effects are conditional on the
   type of election. Voters are more likely to leave the check-in line when
   there are a higher number of people in line. Additionally, voters in
   majority-Black precincts are most likely to leave the check-in line
   before voting in presidential and midterm elections. Voter ID laws tend
   to reduce the incidence of reneging, but the effects are conditional on
   the type of election and demographic composition of the precinct.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found that the gender of children-particularly, having
   daughters-has a discernible effect on parents' attitudinal and
   behavioral support for the empowerment of women. In this article, we
   explore how the gender of children affects the gender attitudes of
   parents. Using data from the 2016 American National Election Study
   (ANES) survey, we estimate the effects of children's gender on parents'
   feminist self-identification, support for more women representatives,
   and attitudes toward traditional gender roles, both in general and
   separately for men and women. Surprisingly, we find that sons-and not
   daughters-have a systematic negative effect on feminist
   self-identification and support for electing more women, as well as a
   positive effect on support for traditional gender roles. The effects of
   sons on feminist self-identification and traditional gender roles are
   observed for both men and women, while the effects of sons on support
   for more women representatives are limited to women. It appears that
   having a son decreases support for feminist and egalitarian gender
   attitudes in both men and women to varying degrees across a variety of
   dimensions.},

   One's Voting Behavior For or Against Trump in 2020},
Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Christian nationalist ideology was among the strongest predictors of
   Americans voting for Trump in 2016 and remained a strong predictor of
   intent to vote for him prior to the 2020 election. This study uses
   national data to examine whether Christian nationalism could potentially
   convert the previously-unconverted to supporting Trump or, conversely,
   prevent apostatizing from Trump. Among Americans who did not vote for
   Trump in 2016, Christian nationalism increased the likelihood that they
   intended to vote for Trump in 2020, but only those who earlier did not
   vote at all or voted third party. Conversely, among Americans who did
   vote for Trump in 2016, Christian nationalism reduced the likelihood
   that they planned on voting for a Democratic or third party candidate.
   Christian nationalism thus potentially inclined Americans who previously
   did not vote for Trump in 2016 to vote his way in 2020 and inoculated
   previous Trump-voters from considering other candidates in 2020.},

Abstract = {The policy innovation literature does not mention any systemic analysis
   of sexual freedom laws. Sexual freedom, since the sexual revolution of
   the 1960s, has been increasing over the past few decades in the United
   States at the state level and hence is an appropriate area to study in
   terms of innovativeness. Data collected from 1960 to 2010 show that
   variables such as Ideology, Income, Religious and Racial
   fractionalization are important for sexual freedom innovation. In this
   article, I also innovate in how I calculate the sexual freedom
   innovativeness score that was necessitated because of the way sexual
   freedom laws were coded.},

Abstract = {Do citizens under authoritarian rule trust government information? To
   answer this question, I compared citizen statements and movement
   trajectories from smartphone social media communication in real-time
   with precise timestamps and locations in response to the government's
   press releases during the Kunming railway station attack in southwestern
   China in 2014. I find that while outward engagement with government
   information may increase as the government releases more information,
   citizen trust in such information, in fact, diminishes, even when the
   information itself is straightforward and factual. In other words, an
   authoritarian government's efforts to disseminate information comes with
   a cost - its credibility.},

Abstract = {The concept of territorial governance has been promoted by the European
   Commission as a central element of European Regional Policy. This
   article examines the key dimensions of territorial governance, arguing
   that it is distinct but complementary to multilevel governance as it
   focuses on the mobilization of regional actor groups and the integration
   of indigenous knowledge into policymaking processes. It further explores
   whether there is merit in understanding Smart Specialisation processes
   as a territorial governance model, using examples of the development and
   implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategies from across four
   Nordic regions. The article finds that Smart Specialisation can be
   considered a territorial governance approach because it promotes
   bottom-up policymaking that is driven by local knowledge. By empowering
   the sub-national level, a territorial governance lens may help mitigate
   regional disparities and bring European Union regional policymaking
   closer to citizens. In doing so, territorial governance can help address
   some of the accountability and legitimacy gaps that have caused widening
   discontent with the European project at regional and local levels.},

Abstract = {We investigate a heterogeneous Ising model in the context of tax evasion
   dynamics, where different types of agents are parameterised via local
   temperatures and magnetic fields. Our work focuses on the dynamic
   behavioural change of agents after an audit, which either corresponds to
   a temporal reduction or enhancement of compliance, also known under the
   terms of `bomb crater effect' and `target effect', respectively. We
   analyse this effect for different types of agents: endogenously
   non-compliant types; agents that have a tendency to copy (non-)
   compliant behaviour from their social environment; ethical agents with
   strong endogenous moral attitudes; and random types that show large
   fluctuations between compliant and noncompliant behaviour. Each type
   influences overall tax evasion differently and our model predicts that,
   interestingly, increasing the audit probability can have the
   counter-intuitive effect of increasing tax evasion under certain
   circumstances. We analyse audit strategies that can suppress this
   effect, and thus contribute to the burgeoning literature on the actual
   impact of tax audits.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the impact of public pension expenditures and
   pension funds' assets as well as its paid-out benefits on macroeconomic
   volatility. We use panel data for 35 OECD countries for the period
   1980-2018 and apply a set of state-of-the-art econometric estimators.
   Our results suggest a smoothing effect of public pension expenditures on
   per capita consumption growth volatility and overall macroeconomic
   volatility. We however do not find such effects coming from pension
   funds' paid-out benefits. In contrast, the effect of pension funds'
   assets depends crucially on the level of economic development: there is
   a dampening effect on per capita investment growth volatility in less
   developed countries; while a volatility-boosting effect in most
   developed countries.},

Title = {Trade in trash: A political economy approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We study how the opportunity to trade in trash might influence the
   equilibrium outcome when the tax on the externality is determined by a
   political economy process. In our model, individ-uals have heterogeneous
   preferences for environmental quality, and there is a wastage of real
   resources when funds are transferred from the pressure groups to the
   politicians. When hard-core environmentalists and capitalists are
   organized interest groups while moderate environmental-ists are not
   organized, we find that the politically chosen tax on the externality is
   below the optimal Pigouvian level. The opportunity to export waste in
   unlimited quantities, but at a price, is not the environmentalists'
   panacea and does not eliminate political social tension and subop-timal
   results.},

Abstract = {Objectives This article seeks to understand the economic, mental health,
   and political impacts on American parents in the era of Covid-19.
   Methods We draw on survey data from a diverse national sample collected
   in September 2020 and employ multivariate analysis to explore how
   Covid-19 has uniquely affected the attitudes and life experiences of
   American parents.
   Results We find that Covid-19 has been unusually burdensome for parents
   as they are more likely to have experienced negative physical and mental
   health outcomes and suffer more negative financial impacts. Despite the
   challenges parents face, they also remain cautious about in-person
   school and vaccinations. Although mothers have been the focus of much
   news coverage, we find that both mothers and fathers have been similarly
   and negatively impacted by Covid-19.
   Conclusion American parents are suffering at distinctively high levels
   during this pandemic. In order to recover, policymakers will need to
   target outreach and support tailored to the needs and issues facing
   parents.},
