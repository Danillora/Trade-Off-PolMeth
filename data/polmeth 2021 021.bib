Abstract = {The emotional cycle of deployment theorized by Logan and adapted by
   Pincus, House, Christenson, and Alder is often applied by academics and
   military support agencies to define, explain, and provide advice on the
   experiences and possible emotional reactions of military families during
   phases of deployment. Interviews with army partners showed that
   spatiotemporal experiences and perspectives are more complex than those
   afforded by the emotional cycle of deployment. This article argues that
   applying the concept of liminality uncovers some of this complexity,
   illuminating the in-between times experienced during deployments that
   are otherwise hidden. Army partners move through and between deployments
   and deployment phases haunted by specters of past and future
   deployments. By disrupting seemingly chronological and discrete
   spatiotemporal narratives, which often frame research on military
   families and deployment, this article demonstrates how army partners
   move through and between deployments and deployment stages negotiating
   past and future deployments. It shows how they continuously adapt and
   evolve practices while negotiating interpreted pasts and imagined
   futures in pursuit of becoming ``ideal.{''}},

Title = {Securing Anticipatory Geographies: Finland's Arctic Strategy and the
   Geopolitics of International Competitiveness},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of Finland's Arctic strategy, providing
   a perspective on contemporary `Arctic geopolitics' outside the dominant
   emphasis on the territorial politics of the Arctic Ocean coastal states.
   Concurrently, this serves as an empirical framework for interpreting the
   contextual de- and re-territorialising manifestations of geopolitical
   state strategies that are increasingly about securing competitive
   advantages, rather than exerting or extending territorial control over
   resources. By deploying the notion of anticipatory geographies this
   paper shows that Finland's Arctic strategy documents have produced two
   intertwined promotional visions that are predicated on the discourses of
   international competitiveness and which relate Finland to the Arctic
   region. These are 1) Finland as a key provider of solutions to problems
   in Arctic development and 2) Finland as an attractive territorial node
   in `Arctic flows'. These anticipatory geographies are facilitated in
   practice through the political consolidation of `Arctic' markets for
   Finnish exports and through infrastructure projects purportedly
   enhancing the position of Finland within various `economic flows'.
   Together, these notions illuminate the geopolitical dimension of
   attempts to secure competitive advantages and how this relates to the
   processes of state spatial transformation through de- and
   re-territorialisation, especially beyond the recently much emphasised
   context of city-regionalism.},

Abstract = {This text introduces the symposium on Fredric Jameson's Allegory and
   Ideology (2019), the second volume in his six-part The Poetics of Social
   Forms. It frames the debate with a brief exploration of some of the
   figures and problems of allegory that appear across Jameson's oeuvre,
   and surveys some of the Marxist conceptualisations of allegory that have
   shaped Jameson's approach, as it straddles allegories of the commodity
   and allegories of utopia. The musical investigation of the nexus of
   allegory and affect, and the presentation of political allegory as
   primarily concerned with the disjunction between (national and
   international) levels are also touched upon as salient dimensions of
   Jameson's theorising.},

Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {572-589},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This paper examines maritime politics across the Indo/Asia-Pacific
   during the 2010s by drawing on notions of geopolitics as discursive
   practice through which various actors shape understandings and
   trajectories of international politics. It first discusses the
   consequence of the idea that maritime issues in `the region' are of
   `strategic importance', which is used to justify the discursive and
   material engagement of both regional and extra-regional powers. It then
   identifies three broad framings or narratives of maritime politics in
   the Indo/Asia-Pacific over the last decade: strategic competition,
   regional order and challenges to a `rules-based system', and
   collaborative governance, and discusses how discursive contestation is
   further displayed in recent debates over the concept of `Indo-Pacific'.
   This analysis demonstrates a powerful role for discourse in the maritime
   politics of the Indo/Asia-Pacific, as the ambiguities inherent in
   institutions of maritime politics and questions of `sovereignty' over
   maritime space are discursively manipulated into representations which
   serve various political purposes and statist agendas. The conclusion
   places this in the context of some recent literature on China and
   critical geopolitics.},

   secondary schools in Santa Fe, Argentina},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper offers a new perspective on debates about young people and
   critical geopolitics by placing attention on war veterans ? actors
   rarely considered when thinking about how young people learn about
   geopolitics, the nation and memories of past conflict. It does so
   through the analysis of the voices of Malvinas War veterans (officers
   and conscripts), young people and teachers in public and private
   secondary schools in the city of Santa Fe, Argentina. Political
   geographers working in school settings have often turned to textbooks
   and/or the perspectives of educators when looking to grasp how
   geopolitical issues are presented to young people. Yet the presence of
   those with first-hand testimony of war does something markedly different
   to the affective and emotional registers through which geopolitics is
   embodied and referenced. The paper, then, critically considers what the
   veterans? presence and testimonies do to the ways that geopolitics is
   discussed and interrogated within secondary schools. Such attention can
   shed light on how young people learn about memories of Argentina?s
   recent past and the protagonists involved, highlighting the societal
   tensions and sensitivities that continue to characterise narratives
   associated with the military and the Malvinas War specifically.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the question of whether migrants pay a rent
   premium for apartments of comparable quality and neighborhood
   characteristics. We use a two-step selection-correction model augmented
   by a control function to account for nonrandom neighborhood choice. The
   estimation sample is a uniquely assembled panel comprising the
   Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), information on household and apartment
   characteristics, as well as georeferenced data describing neighborhood
   quality. Our estimates reveal that people with migration backgrounds are
   not penalized in the German local rental market in terms of higher
   rental payments.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {2},
Pages = {920-938},

Abstract = {Objective. To explore the political impact of overt resistance to
   judicial rulings. Existing approaches to answering this question rely on
   a framework that overlooks important components of how resistance
   resonates in the modern era. Methods. Focusing on the Supreme Court's
   ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges and resistance by local county clerks, we
   model the relationship between resistance and public opinion. We
   demonstrate that disobedience affected the media's framing of same-sex
   marriage, changing it from an issue framed primarily around equal rights
   to one in which alternative, anti-same-sex marriage frames proliferated.
   We then use these frames to design an externally valid survey
   experiment, which we administer to a national sample. Results. We find
   that resistance framing depresses support for same-sex marriage and
   increases support for defying the Court. Conclusion. The findings
   suggest that political resistance to the judiciary continues to resonate
   in the modern era, although not in the ways that many assume.},

   political-electoral rights and the rise of the Mexican security state},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article demonstrates how the promotion of Indigenous women's
   political-electoral rights in Mexico has furthered a conservative agenda
   of state securitization. To do so, it presents a discourse analysis of
   national media reports focused on the story of Eufrosina Cruz, a Zapotec
   woman who became the figurehead for state-led initiatives to promote
   Indigenous women's rights. It argues that a colonial rescue narrative
   constructed through Cruz's figure helped generate new hegemonic
   discourses of gendered indigeneity that portrayed Indigenous peoples'
   alternative political practices and spaces as anti-democratic and
   illegal. In an era where advancements in party democracy were linked to
   processes of state securitization, these categorizations helped justify
   new forms of state intervention into Indigenous peoples' lives. By
   exploring how rights initiatives were discursively constructed through
   racialized, spatialized and gendered constructions of indigeneity, this
   article contributes to a critical geography of indigeneity within
   political geography.},

Abstract = {The aftermaths of the 2008 subprime crisis have modified financing
   channels of French local governments and led to regulation changes.
   Using a unique panel of the 96 French Metropolitan Departments covering
   13 years between 2005 and 2017, this paper investigates the determinants
   of Departments' borrowing using a spatial panel approach. Our estimates
   of a fixed-effects Spatial Durbin Model show that spatial determinants
   contribute to explain Departments' financing decisions. The study
   exhibits the existence of a spatial multiplier effect that may influence
   the systemic risk of bankruptcy for French Department. In this context,
   the recent profound reshaping of the local financing sector should be
   considered with care paying attention to spatial interactions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to fill the geographical gap in the literature
   about the militarization of COVID-19 through a comparative exploration
   of how the pandemic was handled in militarized ways in Hungary, Poland,
   and Slovakia. Drawing from official government and military statements,
   media articles, and expert interviews with defense intellectuals, we
   examine two interconnected areas - that of discourse and that of
   military domestic assistance. By viewing the developments through the
   lens of militarization and military-society relations scholarship, we
   argue that rather than serving as a `portal' for civilian resilience,
   the pandemic constituted an unprecedented `return of the troops' to
   Visegrad states and societies in terms of its size, scope, and duration,
   thus strengthening the pressure for re-militarization in the region that
   has been recorded in the last decade. The paper presents a number of
   analytical findings: first, it identifies the emerging gap between
   right-wing populist rhetoric that relied on warspeak and the
   human-centered communication of the armed forces; second, it reveals
   that military domestic assistance functioned as a military `band aid' on
   systemic vulnerabilities, as well as incidentally converged with
   illiberal patterns of governance; third, it shows how the pandemic aided
   re-militarizing pressures, resulting in a significant boost to the
   defense sector, a positive public opinion about the armed forces, and
   military-society relations.},

Abstract = {{[}Rockingham] far exceeded all other statesmen in the art of drawing
   together, without the seduction of self-interest, the concurrence and
   co-operation of various dispositions and abilities of men, whom he
   assimilated to his character, and associated in his labours; for it was
   his aim through life to convert party connexion, and personal
   friendship, (which others had rendered subservient only to temporary
   views, and the purposes of ambition) into a lasting depository for his
   principles; that their energy should not depend upon his life, nor
   fluctuate with the intrigues of a court, or with capricious fashions
   among the people; but that by securing a succession in support of his
   maxims, the British constitution might be preserved, according to its
   true genius, on antient foundations, and institutions of tried utility.

Title = {``Keep withstanding{''} : Territory in the body, home and market in
   Xinjiang, China},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geographic literature has explored how territorialization occurs by
   multiple actors in material and symbolic spaces, especially in the home
   and body. Building on the important research in feminist geography
   concerning the body as territory, important questions remain: How do
   Uyghurs in China respond to state territory in their everyday lives? How
   does fear, pleasure, and mistrust constitute the social relations of
   territory? How do people experience and navigate state dispossession of
   territory? I use long-term ethnographic fieldwork to study these
   questions. China is a strong, authoritarian state with a monopoly on
   power and seemingly unlimited surveillance and policing capabilities.
   Uyghurs explored survival strategies that constituted social relations
   of territory as a node in overlapping networks in Xinjiang. My main
   argument is that despite a strong government presence, embodied
   Indigenous practices enabled survivance for the Uyghur people. People
   escaped the stress of government surveillance and policing by turning to
   material and symbolic modes of constituting embodied territory.},

Abstract = {Bureaucrats are frequently conceptualized as agents of Congress, with
   much focus placed on their expertise as policy implementers or
   evaluators. That same expertise, though, allows bureaucrats to supply
   Congress with information throughout the policy process. Bureaucrats are
   just one of the many actors that compete to supply Congress with
   information to define problems and develop solutions. Congressional
   committees must prioritize all available information, deciding what to
   attend and what to ignore. I argue that bureaucrats are more likely to
   testify at hearings when there is (1) limited availability of
   alternative information sources, (2) the information they hold is
   necessary for achieving committee goals or tasks (ex. agency oversight),
   and (3) the information they have can alleviate diverse committee
   workloads. Using a new dataset of witnesses testifying at congressional
   committee hearings, I find that the prioritization of bureaucrats as
   witnesses is explainable in terms of policy area, committee type, and
   committee agenda.},

Abstract = {Within a multiparty civil war involving domestic rivalries and regional
   antagonisms, the Kurdish-led PYD-YPG rebel movement managed to
   consolidate its political-military power in northeastern Syria. Using
   the analytical framework of Political Opportunity Structures (POS), we
   describe how, through its ability to maintain organizational cohesion
   and establish its own governance structures, and by forging alliances
   with domestic and foreign actors, it became the hegemonic power in the
   territory. Whereas it initially relied on coercive consolidation against
   its main Kurdish rivals, to secure local and international support
   against the significant threat posed by the Islamic State it had to
   shift to cooperative and cooptation strategies of power consolidation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the progress of the agenda committed to tackle the
   fragmentation of the UN system to better understand the process of
   institutional change in International Organizations. Focusing on changes
   undergone by the UN's country-level presence, the case study of the
   voluntary implementation of Delivering as One initiative (DaO) in
   Mozambique and Vietnam demonstrates how common plans, joint programs and
   pooled funds have promoted better divisions of labor and settled
   divergences among UN entities. This has fostered the national ownership
   of UN country-level activities and developed the nexus of
   humanitarian-development agendas. Pilot countries and donors resorted to
   selective incentives for the engagement of UN bureaucracies, who,
   especially at headquarters, remained resistant to reforms. Reform was
   subject to incentives and constraints that were introduced and
   manifested unevenly across spaces and over time. It lost momentum both
   in Mozambique and Vietnam following the pilot phase, when donors'
   engagement faltered, but had more enduring effects in the latter, where
   the government's greater capacity to engage in favor of reforms
   supported the compliance of UN country offices. This indicates the
   United Nations Country Teams (UNCT) consolidation amid institutional
   changes based on layering institutional innovations alongside extant
   structures, overcoming conflicts of loyalties.},

Abstract = {Federalism and the associated multi-level polity-structure have been
   frequently blamed for delaying the implementation of European Union (EU)
   directives. However, this verdict is incomplete as only a few studies
   open the ``black box{''} of federalism to analyse the involvement of
   subnational parliaments and executives or second chambers in policy
   implementation. This article fills this gap and explains the
   transposition delay on the level of each individual implementation
   measure. Our novel data set covers about 850 directives and the
   corresponding 1,950 implementation measures between 1990 and 2018 in
   Germany. Using logistic regression models, we find that involving the
   subnational authorities substantially delays transposition. Subnational
   measures are three times more likely to be delayed than national ones.
   The effect of the veto power of a second chamber remains inconclusive.
   Our findings highlight the challenges federalism poses for the
   multi-level implementation of EU policies and have implications for the
   broader literature on compliance with public policies.},

Title = {Negative Shocks and Political Parties' Territorial Demands: The
   Institutional Roots of Party Competition},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Why do political parties set an extreme or a more moderate position on
   the territorial dimension? Despite previous works have paid recent
   interest on the dynamics of the political competition on the territorial
   dimension, we know much less about the factors that lead to a
   centrifugal or a centripetal party competition on the same dimension. In
   this article, we offer a new way of understanding it: we argue that
   parties' policy position on the decentralization continuum not only
   depends on the level of territorial decentralization, but also on the
   credibility of the institutional agreement established through the
   country's constitutional rigidity. If the original territorial pact does
   not guarantee that the majority group will have its ``hands tied{''} so
   that it does not reverse the territorial agreement, political parties
   will have incentives to adopt more extreme positions on the territorial
   dimension. We test this argument with a dataset covering around 460
   political parties clustered in 28 European countries from 1999 to 2019
   and by exploiting the fact that the 2008 economic crisis unleashed a
   shock on the territorial design. Our results confirm our expectations.
   We show that both the federal deal and the credibility of the
   institutional arrangement through constitutional rigidity are necessary
   conditions to appease parties' demands on the territorial dimension. Our
   results have important implications for our understanding of how
   institutions shape political competition along the territorial
   dimension.},

Abstract = {In 2017, the European Medicines Agency staged the first effort at
   democratic innovation within transnational European Union institutions
   directly influencing the transnational regulation of medicines.
   Alongside its public consultation on epilepsy drug Valproate, European
   Medicines Agency included a public hearing involving representatives of
   patients and testimony from those directly affected by the medicines.
   Using this critical case study, the article argues from a deliberative
   democratic perspective that although the hearing in many ways exhibited
   the traditional shortcomings of elite-driven deliberation, it also
   demonstrated unexpected and surprising deliberative qualities. Based on
   new quantitative analysis of the hearing using the Discourse Quality
   Index, and qualitative observation of over 4 hours of footage, the
   article argues European Medicines Agency's hearing facilitated equitable
   access and influence of patients and members of the public who had
   previously been excluded from decision making on drug distribution.
   These findings provide important new evidence of the deliberative
   democratic value of public hearings.},

Abstract = {Enfranchisement of emigrant citizens living outside their home states
   has been a notable trend in recent decades. While emigrant voting rights
   are viewed by some as an important part of the wave of suffrage reforms
   that began in the 1970s, for others they are a contested development
   that rupture the essence of democracy by breaking the link between
   citizenship and residence. This article connects insights from the
   emigrant voting literature with historical institutionalism to argue
   that the longstanding avoidance of emigrant enfranchisement in the
   Republic of Ireland was overcome during the Great Recession because of
   an economic imperative, the need for greater investment from the
   emigrant community. Diaspora campaigners explicitly linked economic
   engagement with political rights and the pathway to the policy reform
   was set. The government gave a commitment in 2017 to hold a referendum
   to implement the emigrant franchise reform and it is scheduled for 2022,
   having been initially delayed by the Covid 19 pandemic.},

Title = {International vs. area? The disciplinary-politics of knowledge-exchange
   between IR and Area Studies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {451-482},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Within the political-economy of the social sciences, Area Studies (AS)
   is supposed to supply contextually-informed knowledge on (non-Western)
   areas to the other social sciences, in exchange for theory to guide
   further empirical investigations. Based on this assumption, there are
   regular calls for greater engagement with AS to counteract the
   shortcomings of International Relations' (IR) knowledge-base on many
   areas, perspectives, and practices of the international. However, there
   has been little work empirically detailing knowledge-exchange practices
   between IR and AS, so it remains an open question if the relationship
   functions as an exchange of `international' theory-for-'area' empirics.
   This paper provides a macro-sociological analysis of the practices of
   IR-AS knowledge-exchange. By focusing on citation practice, it moves
   beyond accounts that treat the two disciplines as `black boxes', to
   trace which parts of the `dividing discipline' of IR are active in
   exchanging knowledge with which `area' scholarships. Hence, it asks: Are
   there `area' blindspots in IR's knowledge-production? And, what type of
   IR theory is exported to AS? This analysis informs an assessment of
   whether AS represents a significant resource for IR in its efforts to,
   one, better inform its knowledge-production about `other' areas of the
   international, and two, assert its disciplinary-relevance within the
   academy.},

Abstract = {The decline in the share of bank credit to non-financial firms since the
   1990s, relative to credit for real estate and financial asset markets,
   has raised concerns over economic growth and financial stability and
   sparked renewed interest in credit policies, instruments and
   institutions. We examine their theoretical case and post-war use, and
   trace their demise during the wider market-oriented policy
   reconfiguration from the 1980s. Notably, this included home ownership
   polices favouring mortgage markets. We then examine the empirical
   relationship between credit policy and credit allocation in the
   1973-2005 period for 17 advanced economies. Taking account of
   co-integration, we present evidence that the decline of credit policies
   is significantly associated with a lower share of lending to
   non-financial firms. It may be worth revisiting the potential of credit
   policies to support adequate financing for goals such as innovation,
   industrial development and the transition to a low-carbon economy.},

Abstract = {The Rohingya crisis of Myanmar is a longstanding geopolitical
   predicament that has remained unresolved for 42 years, since 1978. Many
   of the stateless, and now stranded, Rohingya have been driven out of
   Myanmar to take refuge in other countries or forced to live in
   internally displaced persons (IDP) camps within the state of Rakhine.
   ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) attacks became an automatic excuse
   for genocidal activities against Rohingyas at the hands of the Myanmar
   government. ARSA attacks and communal violence in Rakhine both served
   the Myanmar government's objective, providing justification for acts of
   violent retaliation. This paper examines root causes of Rohingya exile
   and displacement. The researcher collected data from 20 expert
   participants in Bangladesh and 71 displaced Rohingya victims living in
   the Kutupalong Rohingya Refugee Camp within Bangladesh. These data
   indicate the interaction of various factors, including historical legacy
   of conflict, religious dissension, racism, lack of social integration of
   Rohingyas into the mainstream Burmese community, geo-economic factors,
   discriminatory state policy and conflict politics of ARSA, all of which
   contribute to what has become the Rohingya crisis. The paper discusses
   theoretical and practical implications of these interacting influences.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, collaboration has flourished in the public
   administration and policy fields as a rational means to solve complex
   issues and improve public service performance. Through a meta-analysis
   of 26 studies with 251 effect sizes, this investigation provides novel
   perspectives for understanding the effects of different collaborative
   partnerships on performance. To test these mechanisms, we applied
   various social science theories, such as institutional theory, resource
   dependence theory, a resource-based view, and transaction cost theories.
   Our findings indicate that the overall effect of collaborative
   performance is positive and significant. Moreover, meta-regression
   results show that public-public collaboration results in better
   performance than public-nonprofit or public-business collaboration,
   while involving all three entity types in collaborative efforts yields
   similar outcomes to public-public collaboration. Several implications of
   these findings are outlined for researchers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {Multiple actors involved in the provision of e-participation initiatives
   add to the complexity of organizational design and blur accountability
   and ownership relations. This study addresses the following research
   questions: How are different organizations and their units involved in
   the supply of e-participation initiatives? How does the multiplicity of
   actors affect cross-boundary collaboration, ownership, and
   accountability relations in the implementation of e-participation
   initiatives? The empirical analysis is based on comparative case studies
   on e-participation platforms in seven European countries. The case
   studies indicate that cross-organizational issues-ownership and
   accountability, in particular-have often been insufficiently addressed
   during the development of e-participation initiatives. Ambiguous
   ownership and diffused accountability are particularly challenging in
   the cases of multilevel governance and in ``bottom-up{''}
   e-participation initiatives. The ``distance{''} between the unit
   responsible for the administration of an e-participation initiative and
   the decision-makers appears to be a critical factor for the functioning
   of the platforms.},

Title = {Does Insurgent Selective Punishment Deter Collaboration? Evidence from
   the Drone War in Pakistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {297-326},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Scholars of civil wars have long argued that non-state actors can use
   selective punishment to reduce collaboration with state adversaries.
   However, there is little systematic evidence confirming this claim, nor
   investigation into the mechanisms at play. In this paper, we provide
   such evidence from the drone war in Pakistan. Militants in Pakistan's
   tribal areas engaged in a brutal counterespionage campaign with the aim
   of reducing collaboration with the United States. Our analysis combines
   a novel dataset of collaborator killings with data on drone strike
   outcomes. We find that strikes killed half as many militant leaders and
   fighters following collaborator killings and that this suppressive
   effect likely works by deterring spying in the future. Beyond providing
   an empirical confirmation of the selective punishment hypothesis, our
   paper suggests an unacknowledged vulnerability of the drone program to
   reprisals against local allies and collaborators that limits its
   effectiveness as a long-term tool of counterterrorism.},

Abstract = {Informal workers in Africa are very often portrayed as primarily
   self-employed entrepreneurs and unemployed individuals largely excluded
   from capitalism, and thus insulated from class analysis and class
   dynamics. Drawing on a case study of informal workers in Sierra Leone,
   the article challenges this dominant understanding, arguing that
   informal workers experience the reality of class relations and that
   their material lives are shaped by, and help to shape, broader dynamics
   of capital accumulation. The research applies a holistic class analysis
   rooted in Marxist and feminist thought, arguing for an understanding of
   informal workers, including even small-scale `self-employed'
   individuals, as workers exploited by, and opposed to the interests of,
   capital. In so doing, it challenges the simple understandings of working
   class as existing only and exclusively through formalised wage work, in
   favour of a more complex and inductive understanding of the reality of
   global capitalism, highlighting the relevance of class, value and
   exploitation to the lived reality of informal workers in Africa.},

Abstract = {Drones have been widely used by public authorities during the COVID-19
   pandemic for pandemic-related problems. As an innovative tool with a
   wide range of potentialities, they have been deemed suitable for an
   exceptional situation marked by the persistence of social distance. Yet,
   the turn to new technology to solve complex problems is a political
   decision that has broad societal implications, especially in the context
   of declared states of emergency. In the article we argue that the
   extensive use of drones by national authorities during the COVID-19
   pandemic has generated a new socio-technical assemblage of actors,
   technologies and practices. Building on the three main uses of drones as
   responses to specific pandemic-related challenges (disinfection,
   delivery, and surveillance), we analyse the actors and the practices
   involved in this new socio-technical assemblage. From the empirical
   material, we explore potential effects of drone uses on key issues such
   as the technology regulatory processes, public acceptance, and security
   and safety concerns.},

Abstract = {A group of Brazilian writers-Ruy Mauro Marini, Theotonio dos Santos, and
   Vania Bambirra-met in Brasilia in the 1960s and 1970s and produced,
   predominantly in exile, theories about the reality of Latin America and
   the periphery. In the 1980s, with the amnesty, the group returned to
   Brazil and confronted a hostile atmosphere in the academy. Analysis of
   these writers' trajectories based on the academic self-reports they
   produced in the 1990s for admission or reentry into Brazilian
   universities addresses their views of the 1964 coup, exile, and the
   return to Brazil after the amnesty, the identity assigned to the group,
   and the controversy over the authorship of dependency theory. Um grupo

   retornou ao Brasil e foi hostilizado na academia. Um analisis da
   trajetoria dos autores a partir de seus memoriais academicos elaborados
   nos anos 1990 para ingresso ou reingresso nas universidades brasileiras
   abordam as visoes a respeito do golpe de 1964, o exilio e o retorno

   leadership and the painful lessons of the war with Georgia in 2008.
   Russia had to conduct an throughout and painful restructuring of the
   military institutions and the defense industrial complex in order to be
   able to meet the ambitious goals of its' rearmament program. The result
   was significant growth in the Russian military capabilities by the
   middle of the decade.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to our understanding of Islamist extremism by
   examining the relationship between early educational interests and ideas
   associated with Islamist-jihadist ideology. The article uses data
   collected through the Islam in Australia survey and specifically
   compares STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with
   HSS (humanities and social science) fields of educational interest in
   relation to respondents' identification with political Islamist and
   militant typologies, identification with Islam as a political system,
   understandings of jihad and views on the caliphate as an Islamic
   religious obligation. The article found Muslim Australians who expressed
   an interest in STEM fields at high school were more likely than those
   interested in HSS to: 1) identify with the political Islamist and
   militant typology; 2) believe Islam advocates a political system; 3)
   believe establishing a caliphate is a religious obligation; and 4)
   define jihad as defensive and offensive rather than as defensive only.
   As discussed in the article, these findings support those of other
   research), which have identified an overrepresentation of STEM and an
   underrepresentation of HSS among Islamist-jihadists. This article adds
   weight to the assertion that the mindset of Islamist-jihadists, may be
   present prior to undertaking tertiary education and may predispose some
   to support extremist ideologies. This paper finds that an
   Islamist-jihadist ideological orientation has a relationship with the
   STEM fields broadly and Islamic studies specifically during adolescence.},

Abstract = {Government outsourcing to third-party vendors is widespread and intended
   to strengthen the organizational incentive to deliver public services
   more efficiently. However, it is unclear how outsourcing influences the
   public workforce, and little is known about the effect on employees who
   change from working for the government to working for the vendor
   receiving the outsourcing contract. In this article, we theoretically
   argue that the introduction of competition and private ownership in
   public service delivery may have negative consequences for employees'
   remuneration, employment, and health outcomes. We assess these arguments
   using unique individual-level register data of 1,478 Danish relatively
   low-skilled employees who changed job from public to private employment
   due to government outsourcing. Using a difference-in-difference (DiD)
   approach, we estimate the effect on employees' remuneration, employment
   and income transfers, and use of health services compared to an exact
   matched control group of public employees who did not experience
   outsourcing. Our findings suggest that outsourcing significantly
   decreased employee remuneration and employment and increased public
   income transfers, while the effect on health services use was marginal
   and transitory. Potential mechanisms explaining these findings include
   the vendor's incentive to reduce the workforce and increase
   productivity, the stress of changing jobs, and poorer person-environment
   fit. The results suggest that outsourcing has high costs for employees,
   some of which are passed on to the government itself through increased
   expenditure for public income transfers. We propose pathways for further
   theoretical and empirical research on employee consequences of
   government outsourcing.},

Abstract = {As climate movements are growing around the world, so too is a
   postapocalyptic form of environmentalism. While apocalyptic
   environmentalism warns of future catastrophe in case of inaction, its
   postapocalyptic sibling assumes that catastrophe is already here or
   unavoidable. Here I explore the overlooked strategic implications of
   postapocalyptic narratives in climate change movements. I present data
   from a qualitative study of climate activism in five European cities:
   Malmo, Hamburg, Antwerp, Bristol, and Manchester, based on ethnographic
   observations and 46 qualitative interviews. I argue that postapocalyptic
   narratives are indeed widely present but are, following the logics of
   appropriateness, habit and affect, kept out of strategizing; in turn,
   this enables a continued focus on climate mitigation. Debates about the
   need for strategies to adapt to present or unavoidable climate
   disruptions tend to be foreclosed, though exceptions like the
   co-creation of local adaptation measures are discussed.},

Abstract = {Current research on transnational knowledge transfer has a strong bias
   toward (often conditionality-based) advice originating in the core OECD
   world and focuses nearly exclusively on the link from a source to a
   target of knowledge transfer. This contribution provides a broader and
   more nuanced picture by looking at the reverse logic of non-OECD
   countries proactively searching abroad for policy advice and assessing
   this advice based on their own requirements. Based on the role of
   conditionality and on the attitude of the recipient country toward
   cooperation with foreign sources of advice, five demand-side strategies
   in transnational policy-related knowledge transfer are distinguished,
   each of which is analyzed utilizing the example of health reform. The
   results highlight systematic differences in the attitude toward and
   employment of foreign advice.},

Abstract = {The policy studies literature is divided on how information processing
   takes place in policy processes. Punctuated equilibrium theory claims
   that policymakers tend to process information disproportionately, giving
   more weight to some incoming signals than to others. By contrast,
   thermostatic models of policymaking argue that policymakers respond in a
   more proportionate way. In this paper, we analyse information processing
   in the adoption of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) under the European
   Union's (EU) Common Fisheries Policy. Based on a novel measure for the
   proportionality of information processing, it shows that over time TACs
   have become more closely aligned with incoming signals about fish
   stocks. This development can be explained through a combination of
   changing discourses around fisheries conservation and institutional
   adjustments in EU fisheries policy. This analysis has implications for
   the debate between punctuated equilibrium and thermostatic models of
   policymaking and our understanding of the effectiveness of EU fisheries
   policies.},

Abstract = {What explains the design of international institutions? Existing
   research has largely neglected how experience in cooperation in one set
   of international institutions impacts on design choices made by states
   in other globally-oriented institutions. We contribute to this evolving
   debate by analyzing spillovers in experience in international trade. We
   argue that countries' track record of interaction in multilateral trade
   disputes affects the design of their preferential trade agreements
   (PTAs). If a country participates in a complaint against a prospective
   PTA partner at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the challenge in
   Geneva alerts the defendant's import-competing industries with respect
   to potential challenges under the planned PTA. As a result, these
   industries exert pressure on their government to preserve leeway under
   the future treaty, leading to increased flexibility and a lower level of
   enforcement in the PTA. We find support for our hypotheses in an
   empirical analysis of 347 PTAs concluded post 1990.},

Abstract = {Although an increasing volume of research has identified several
   negative sociopolitical attitudes as correlates of conspiracy theories,
   to date it remains unclear whether belief in conspiracy theories is
   necessarily in conflict with support for democratic governance. In this
   contribution, we integrate previous findings suggesting inconsistent
   relationships between belief in conspiracy theories and support for
   democratic governance. Study 1 (N = 300) shows that belief in conspiracy
   theories is associated with decreased support for representative
   democracy but increased support for direct democracy. Study 2 (N = 270)
   replicated these findings and revealed that these relationships were
   mediated by political cynicism and feelings of powerlessness. In Study 3
   (N = 298), we experimentally show that a system with direct democracy
   (as compared with representative democracy) empowered participants and
   therefore decreased belief in conspiracy theories. Contrary to the
   common notion that conspiracy theories are associated with decreased
   support for democracy, these findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs
   are associated with a preference for direct over representative
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The present scholarship on cross-boundary organizations of local
   governments often splinters its focus and investigates narrow species of
   organizations with specific powers or unique policy domains. However,
   many organizations share common governance structures and mechanisms.
   Investigating these commonalities from a broader perspective permits
   stronger cross-pollination of knowledge and sharpens generalizable
   theories of governance and administration. In this article, I first
   provide easily and unambiguously measurable criteria capturing a genus I
   term Regional Public Sector Organizations (RPSOs). These criteria rely
   on a rescaled common definition of International Governmental
   Organizations (IGOs). In the United States, this broad genus includes
   many species of public authorities, regional councils, and
   policy-specific organizations. Terminology may differ in other nations,
   but the underlying idea sustains. The second contribution is five
   research questions largely inspired by IGO scholarship. Considering the
   parallels of RPSOs to IGOs can chart a rigorous, empirical path toward
   more coherent theoretical conversations on regional governance.},

Abstract = {Drawing from case studies from the Estonian biotechnology sector, we
   demonstrate that a focus on the classic formal approach to technology
   transfer does not fully capture the dynamics and challenges of
   technology transfer in a peripheral context. We focus on biotechnology
   because this is an area where entrepreneurial orientation of knowledge
   institutions and formal models of technology transfer are highly
   visible. Our case studies show that the knowledge generation and the
   diffusion contexts of peripheral economies can create barriers to
   technology transfer that conventional policy approaches do not address.},

Abstract = {The article aims to open the black box of the asylum determination
   process, focusing on asylum adjudication in courts and on actors
   implementing this specific policy frame: asylum judges. To assess the
   peculiarities of the Italian adjudication model and how judges
   concretely behave in shaping policy, we rely on the Street Level
   Bureaucracy (SLB) framework. The SLB perspective allows us to study the
   implementation of asylum adjudication from a bottom-up perspective,
   focusing on judges and their margin of discretion in processing asylum
   claims. This exploratory study aims to verify the proposed theoretical
   framework and to understand if courts and judges adopt a SLB behaviour,
   the reasons why they adopt such a behaviour and the scope of their
   discretion.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new social scientific understanding of the
   relationship between households and finance. We call it financial
   oikonomization. Financial oikonomization signals a specific research
   problem and a distinctive analytical approach to this problem. The
   problem is how households are financially administered and governed. The
   approach is pragmatist and descriptive. It is oriented to the how, to
   the study of the problems and practices of those directly involved with
   administrating and governing households' financial flows. On the basis
   of an extensive review of recent research, we distinguish seven
   operations of financial oikonomization, seven distinct problems-with
   their own practices, sites and techniques, but all oriented to the
   financial administration and government of households. We call these
   operations: budgeting, juggling, evaluating, attaching, educating,
   publicizing and infrastructuring.},

Abstract = {Numerous institutions, such as the police, public schools, legislatures,
   and the courts face criticism for a lack of diversity and
   representation. According to various political theorists, the lack of
   representation of marginalized groups in public institutions worsens
   citizen attitudes. In response, some advocate for increasing passive
   representation within public institutions. However, different schools of
   thought exist about whether increasing representation of minorities is a
   zero-sum game and worsens attitudes of historical majorities. We
   generate and test two hypotheses from these competing perspectives. We
   employ data from a national survey of students' attitudes toward the
   fairness of school discipline using measures that match the different
   mechanisms found in theory. We find evidence that passive representation
   for African Americans predicts perceptions of fairness and corresponds
   to improved, rather than worsened, attitudes for whites. This supports
   the arguments of Mosher, and others, that increasing the representation
   of groups enhances legitimacy among the polity as a whole and is not
   zero-sum.},

Abstract = {Beger, Morgan, and Ward (BM\&W) call into question the results of our
   article on forecasting civil wars. They claim that our
   theoretically-informed model of conflict escalation under-performs more
   mechanical, inductive alternatives. This claim is false. BM\&W's
   critiques are misguided or inconsequential, and their conclusions hinge
   on a minor technical question regarding receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves: should the curves be smoothed, or should
   empirical curves be used? BM\&W assert that empirical curves should be
   used and all of their conclusions depend on this subjective modeling
   choice. We extend our original analysis to show that our
   theoretically-informed model performs as well as or better than more
   atheoretical alternatives across a range of performance metrics and
   robustness specifications. As in our original article, we conclude by
   encouraging conflict forecasters to treat the value added of theory not
   as an assumption, but rather as a hypothesis to test.},

Abstract = {In this article we conceptualise the public inquiry as a procedural tool
   and address the question of what makes a public inquiry an effective
   policy instrument. The issue of control is central to our arguments. In
   our conceptual work, we use control as a means of introducing the
   concept of the `catalytic procedural tool' to better capture the
   variance in autonomy, location and function that can be associated with
   different inquiries. In our evaluative work, we use control as a means
   of analysing the effectiveness of an inquiry as a procedural tool, which
   centres on a capacity to build legitimacy and prospectively influence
   the implementation and institutionalisation of recommendations. We
   conclude by claiming that there is value in thinking about control as a
   means of understanding policy instruments because it can deliver
   insights into their effects once they leave the design table and enter a
   variety of technical, political and social environments.},

Abstract = {Individual amendments at the committee stage offer Members of the
   European Parliament (MEPs) a valuable tool to change legislation, prior
   to its passage at the plenary stage. And until a recent rule change,
   they were also one of the last meaningful ways for MEPs to self-select
   into the EP legislative process. Applying theories of legislative
   organization, internal positions, and differences in national
   institutional background, we use novel data to examine why MEPs proposed
   amendments to select EP committees during a one-year period between
   October 2015 and 2016. Our findings address a remaining gap on the
   individual determinants for legislative behavior in the EP, while also
   highlighting the effects of uneven prestige and contestation found in
   the EP committee system.},

Abstract = {The resource curse literature shows that natural resources, particularly
   oil, help regime or leadership survival, but it also suggests that
   resource-rich countries are prone to civil wars or political
   instability. This article argues that the ownership structure of the oil
   sector matters and influences leadership survival. Specifically, foreign
   ownership of the oil sector raises leaders' survival prospect and leads
   to more military interventions aimed to help the leader. Using data on
   oil ownership and leaders from 1962 to 2006 across 120 developing
   countries, this article finds that foreign involvement in the oil sector
   has a negative effect on leadership turnover. Countries with deeper
   foreign involvement in the oil sector are also more likely to experience
   military interventions on the side of the leaders. In other words,
   leaders of oil-producing countries do receive political support when
   they cooperate with and serve as `petro-friends' to foreign powers.},

Title = {Conspiratorial medievalism: History and hyperagency in the far-right
   Knights Templar security imaginary},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Imagery associated with the Knights Templar appears in the public
   discourse and symbolism of many white supremacist and white nationalist
   groups. The 2011 Norwegian mass murderer cited the Templars in his
   manifesto, as did the 2019 New Zealand shooter. Templar crosses were on
   display at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, North
   Carolina. To understand the security imaginary behind these racialised
   medievalisms and their contemporary animation within right-wing
   extremism, this article develops the concept of `conspiratorial
   medievalism'. The Knights Templar imaginary blends a specific,
   racialised, and romanticised vision of history with the grammar of
   conspiracy theory. This is characterised by (a) a belief in the
   racialised decline and victimisation of a `righteous' White Christendom;
   (b) a sense of threat posed by racialised Others and betrayal by
   insiders; and (c) an anachronistic view of near-omnipotent individual
   agency. Significantly, conspiratorial medievalism demonstrates an
   aspiration to not merely combat `undue' agency of racialised Others, but
   to reclaim and perform extreme agency themselves. Agency is cast in the
   idiom of medieval chivalry and framed as the moral obligation of
   righteous White men. Although Knights Templar imagery may appear
   superficial, this article finds it is an important justificatory and
   enabling discourse for racist violence.},

Abstract = {Historical-materialist policy analysis (HMPA) aims at analyzing how
   specific policies are formulated against the background of essentially
   competing and contradictory interests of different social forces. It
   examines how, if at all, these policies contribute to societal
   reproduction and the regulation of social contradictions and crisis
   tendencies. This article provides a concise introduction to HMPA as well
   as to the key theoretical concepts and perspectives underpinning its
   policy concept. Against this background, it further elaborates on how to
   operationalize HMPA for empirical research, drawing on but also going
   beyond the three-step process of context-, actors- and process-analysis
   suggested by the Research Group `State Project Europe'. In this way, we
   seek to enhance the analytical and methodological repertoire of
   historical materialist political science, and at the same time open up
   new analytical perspectives within the comprehensive field of critical
   policy analysis.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss if existing political and economic institutions
   can ensure sustainable futures. We do so by combining a global outlook
   with more specifically examining the situation in China. Present
   institutions foster growth, they are however weak at motivating actions
   that keep economies within an environmentally safe and socially just
   space. We especially note the challenges that strong focus on growth
   combined with ex post environmental regulations create for natural
   systems with tipping-points. In this situation, there is a need to
   change institutions to ensure strong emphasis on long-term
   sustainability as opposed to short term economic surplus. Regarding
   political decision-making, we discuss ways to break short-termism
   through strengthening public deliberation as well as formalizing
   political responsibility for the future. Regarding economic
   institutions, we emphasize the need to widen the goals of firms
   including responsibilities for environmental qualities. The latter may
   demand changes in ownership structures.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The incentive for international agencies to promote `local'
   peacebuilding is commonly premised on the hope that micro-level
   interventions can nourish grassroots activism and participatory
   citizenship. Tracing reconciliation processes across Iraq following the
   defeat of ISIL provides a window through which to view the transactional
   relationships between `national' and `local' forms of politics, conflict
   and peace in post-Ba'athist Iraq. This paper focuses on the example of
   Yathrib, Salah al-Din province, where over ninety per cent of residents
   were displaced in 2014, and an estimated eighty-five per cent
   subsequently returned following peace negotiations. The paper uses
   qualitative interview findings to demonstrate on the one hand that
   seemingly `local' tribal solutions are built into national-level `peace
   strategies', while on the other, state capture and power politics is
   infused into the management of apparently parochial disputes. While
   these observations are not an indictment of international efforts to
   intervene at the subnational level, they serve to thoroughly
   `de-romanticise' the local.},

Abstract = {In the face of current globalization, local governments have responded
   with an increasing process of internationalization. The most common
   explanations for this phenomenon come from International Relations and
   International Law theories and range from contributing to local economic
   development and improving social services to becoming involved in
   international policies. However, an alternative and understudied
   explanation for the internationalization of local governments is the
   leadership mayors, either based on the institutional model or on their
   personal characteristics. Thus, based on the theoretical models of
   International Relations, International Law, and mayors' leadership, and
   based on a theoretical review, it is shown that the development of local
   government internationalization policies cannot be analyzed in its full
   dimension without considering the mayor's leadership styles. The main
   theoretical contribution of this article is to conceive the mayor's
   leadership as a robust explanation for the development of
   internationalization policies by local governments, distancing itself
   from the traditional and not very explanatory theoretical lines of the
   phenomenon: globalization and the institutional system.},

Abstract = {Race is central to economic life, but race is not central to economic
   sociology. We argue that economic sociologists should treat racism as a
   constitutive, structuring force, analytically co-equal with capitalism,
   patriarchy and nationalism. Our article has three aims. First, we
   document how canonical and award-winning works of economic sociology do
   not discuss race and racism, and do not engage with the contemporary
   sociology of race. Second, we identify six key insights from the
   sociology of race and suggest how they could influence economic
   sociology: the emergence of race out of racism, an understanding of
   racism as structural, the role of whiteness, the intersections between
   racism and other systems of oppression, the ideology of colorblind
   racism and the fundamental connections between racism and capitalism.
   Third, we conclude by discussing recent research that bridges the two
   subfields and lays the groundwork for an understanding of `racialized
   markets' and `racialized economies'.},

Abstract = {A chronic problem for democratic governments is generating legitimacy
   for policy decisions that go against substantial groups of citizens'
   legitimate interests. The primary means of achieving this aim involve
   the arrangements through which policy decisions are made. Whereas
   research in the field has tended to focus on the arrangements leading up
   to a decision, this paper draws attention to developments after a formal
   policy decision has been made. We theorize that the formal decision
   constitutes a focal event that motivates affected individuals to update
   their beliefs about the decision. We identify four types of potential
   legitimacy-enhancing post-decision arrangements: how the decision is
   announced; how it is publicly explained; whether the process allows for
   post-decision voice; and whether decision-makers take actions to
   mitigate its negative consequences. The results from two survey
   experiments with large samples of Swedish adults addressing the case of
   school closures suggest that post-decision procedures have
   legitimacy-enhancing potential and that this effect is not dependent on
   the pre-decision process.},

Abstract = {Political parties learn from foreign incumbents, that is, parties abroad
   that won office. But does the scope of this cross-national policy
   diffusion vary with the party family that generates those incumbents?
   The authors argue that party family conditions transnational policy
   learning when it makes information on the positions of sister parties
   more readily available and relevant. Both conditions apply to social
   democratic parties. Unlike other party families, social democrats have
   faced major competitive challenges since the 1970s and they exhibit
   exceptionally strong transnational organizations-factors, the authors
   contend, that uniquely facilitate cross-national policy learning from
   successful parties within the family. The authors analyze parties'
   policy positions using spatial methods and find that social democratic
   parties are indeed exceptional because they emulate one another across
   borders more than do Christian democratic and conservative parties.
   These findings have important implications for our understanding of
   political representation and of social democratic parties' election
   strategies over the past forty years.},

Abstract = {Responses to COVID-19 across the globe are immensely varied and often
   perplexing. Policy levers, from mask wearing and social distancing to
   lockdowns and school closures, have been adopted and avoided with equal
   conviction by decisions makers who believe their measures are
   appropriate. In some contexts, the global pandemic has been treated with
   due seriousness by governments and political leaders while in others it
   has been downplayed to such an extent that it has been framed as a hoax.
   Every response to the pandemic has produced seemingly zero-sum debates
   and disputes over the veracity of knowledge bases, while uncertainty
   reigns as one of the few constants in decision making arenas. While it
   may be tempting to gravitate to the view that this unimaginable crisis
   is beyond the capacity of policy scholars to understand, this
   introductory article sets the scene for dispelling such a notion. It
   highlights how a number of core policy issues and perspectives,
   including the politics of problem framing, the limits of an
   evidence-based approach, and the nature of the public sector, can help
   bring analytical insights to this unprecedented crisis.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the effect of government partisanship on
   fiscal policy outputs during the three international economic crises of
   1981-1984, 1990-1994 and 2008-2013. Encompassing 19-23 advanced
   democracies, the statistical analysis suggests that partisan effects
   have increased over time and are characterized, in the two last crises,
   by a ``new asymmetry{''} whereby left governments pursued more
   contractionary fiscal policies than non-left governments over the course
   of the business cycle. Furthermore, it attributes left governments'
   endorsement of austere fiscal policies to the constraining effects of
   financial markets in the context of high/surging debt. This is supported
   by qualitative analysis of select government responses to the Global
   Financial Crisis, shedding new light on the new austerity that started
   in the early 2010s. The ideological mix with political partisanship
   during hard times surely is confusing to ordinary citizens. The article
   cautiously points to a neglected yet important international economic
   origin of our political discontents.},

Abstract = {Can country leaders improve citizens' ethnic outgroup views by changing
   ethnic representation in government? Years of pressure from the
   international community calling for leaders to make particularly their
   cabinets more ethnically representative seems to suggest that ethnic
   representation-conceptualized as descriptive and substantive
   representation and ministerial cooperation-is key to improving citizens'
   outgroup views. I argue that increasing ethnic representation influences
   majority and minority citizens differently; minority citizens' outgroup
   views will become more favorable, while majority citizens' views will
   worsen. Using a pre-registered vignette experiment with ethnic Albanians
   and Macedonians in North Macedonia, I show that ethnic representation
   does not provide the improvements in outgroup relations that many have
   hoped. Both groups' affect toward and perceptions of the cabinet change
   somewhat, but increasing ethnic representation does not improve overall
   outgroup attitudes. These results suggest that ethnic representation
   alone does not lead to more productive interethnic relationships.},

Abstract = {Research on public opinion and crisis behavior has focused largely on
   pressures felt by leaders who have initiated a crisis, not on leaders in
   target states responding to adversary provocation. Our survey experiment
   involving 1,823 respondents in Punjab, Pakistan, finds public support
   for escalating rather than de-escalating in response to such
   provocation. It shows how public pressures can encourage conflict even
   in instances where a leader has engaged in no prior effort to generate
   audience costs following crisis onset. Survey respondents were more
   likely to support escalatory decisions if they were made by a military,
   rather than civilian, leader, although we do not find that military
   leaders receive more support in de-escalatory decisions. Finally, while
   we demonstrate that leaders can mitigate the costs of de-escalating by
   highlighting the dangers of conflict, they still incur opportunity costs
   in foregone public support when they opt to de-escalate rather than
   escalate a crisis.},

Abstract = {Public service-motivated individuals have a greater concern for the
   delivery of public services and for the societal consequence of
   collective inaction, seeing themselves play a pivotal role in upholding
   public goods. Such self-efficacy and perceived importance of public
   service jointly motivate individuals to commit to sacrificing for the
   common good. Using an incentivized laboratory experiment with 126
   undergraduate and graduate students at a university in the Netherlands,
   we explore the association between self-reported public service
   motivation (PSM) and voluntary self-sacrifice under different task
   characteristics and social contexts in a Volunteer's Dilemma game. We
   find that risk-taking and intergroup competition negatively moderate the
   positive effect of PSM on volunteering. The risky situation may reduce
   an individual's self-efficacy in making meaningful sacrifice, and
   intergroup competition may divert attention away from the concern for
   society at large to the outcome of the competition, compromising the
   positive effect of PSM on the likelihood to self-sacrifice for the
   common good.},

Abstract = {The aim here was to identify and analyze the political rationale behind
   the persistent veil of secrecy maintained by the Polish political elite
   with regard to CIA-run prisons located on Polish territory between 2002
   and 2004, in the context of the US-led extraordinary rendition program.
   To do this, the author offers a brief chronological overview of relevant
   events, before analyzing the factors contributing to the secrecy
   surrounding Poland's participation in the CIA ``black sites.{''} This
   article argues that raison d'etat constituted the supreme, and most
   uncompromising, political justification for the action taken, endorsed
   by the Polish political elite. Moreover, the paper examines official
   statements from the Polish authorities and presents conclusions from
   recent in-depth interviews given by key political decision-makers who
   were in office at the time the events took place.},

Abstract = {Should British authorities provide the traditionally nomadic Gypsy
   Travellers with caravan sites so that they may conserve an itinerant way
   of life? This article addresses the question from a distinctively moral
   perspective. It shows that public site provision is not supported by the
   influential minority rights theory of Kymlicka, but can be justified
   with an argument from expropriatory compensation. This affirms that
   nineteenth and twentieth century legal reforms have expropriated Gypsy
   Travellers of their historic rights to temporarily halt in various
   locations and that public caravan sites are an appropriate way to effect
   the compensation that such an expropriation requires.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine Brazil's international activism and ascent to
   the status of rising state during the presidencies of Luiz Inacio Lula
   da Silva (2003-2010) and his chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff
   (2011-2014). We focus on the dissemination of social policies under an
   innovative model of development that reflected the political and
   economic context of a developing country. We argue that this activism
   was framed in terms of Brazil's socio-economic and cultural
   peculiarities, whereby these were treated not as obstacles but as
   positive contributions to developing states' attempts to reform global
   governance structures. We argue that this reflects an alternative form
   of foreign policy politicisation in which the social dilemmas,
   particularities and contradictions of the Brazilian experience are
   incorporated in the foreign policy agenda to leverage its international
   stature as a rising state. We explain how Brazil's international
   cooperation through transferring its public policies and development
   models (policies for fighting hunger and poverty, agrarian development
   and income generation) to its Southern partners has been discursively
   articulated as representing Brazil's normative potential to contribute
   to political and institutional solutions, and rebuild norms and
   standards that affect the distribution of international power and
   wealth.},

Abstract = {Organized popular women in Medellin, Colombia, have exerted lasting
   influence on the city's women's movement by centering a gender-class
   approach to women's issues and thus contributing to long-standing forms
   of popular feminism in Latin America. The work of the grassroots Red de
   Mujeres Populares and the nongovernmental organization Corporacion Vamos
   Mujer in positioning the right to water as a key demand on the city's
   feminist agenda draws upon a legacy of socialist feminisms. These
   organizations' praxis demonstrates that the struggle for water is
   political and embodies a critique of care work within the capitalist
   structure articulated from a gender and class consciousness. Popular
   women reclaim their identity as political agents of their own making,
   underscoring their active role as women whose lives are defined by
   political acumen rather than scarcity.},

Abstract = {While we have increasing knowledge of causes and effects of municipal
   corporatization, we know relatively little about governance of
   municipally owned corporations (MOCs). The literature has pointed to
   various governance problems that can occur when MOCs are owned by
   multiple municipalities. We conduct six case studies into Dutch jointly
   owned MOCs to understand governance problems that occur in these MOCs
   and coordination mechanisms used to overcome these problems. We find
   various governance problems, including free-riding and duplication in
   governance and lobbying of MOCs. We also find coordination mechanisms in
   place that help bridge differences in interests between municipalities,
   wherein local civil services play a particularly large role. The result
   is a level of consensus and stewardship in MOCs, regardless of context.
   However, this is undermined by interventions of municipal councils of
   individual municipal owners in private-law MOCs, and the conflict of
   interest of the municipal executive board as both principal and agent in
   public-law MOCs.},

Abstract = {European elections have been described as second-order phenomena for
   voters, the media, but also parties. Yet, since 2009, there exists
   evidence that not only voters, but also political parties assign
   increasing significance to European elections. While initially `issue
   entrepreneurs' were held responsible for this development, the latest
   campaigns have raised the question of whether mainstream parties are
   finally also campaigning on European issues. In this article, we examine
   European Union (EU) salience in the 2019 European Parliament (EP)
   campaigns of government and opposition parties and the predictors of
   their strategic behaviours. We test the relevance of factors derived
   from the selective emphasis and the co-orientation approach within an
   integrated model of strategic campaign communication based on expert
   evaluations of 191 parties in 28 EU member states. Results show that the
   traditional expectation that government parties silence EU issues does
   not hold anymore; instead, the average EU salience of government and
   opposition parties is similar on the national level. The strongest
   predictors for a party's decision to campaign on EU issues are the
   co-orientation towards the campaign agendas of competing parties, and
   party's EU position.},

Abstract = {This article examines China's rapid and large-scale renewable energy
   expansion and the challenge it presents to orthodox approaches to
   sustainable energy diffusion that emphasise soft interventions and
   stakeholder participation. We show that China eschewed participatory
   modes of energy governance and pursued a centrally steered, hard
   interventionist strategy adapted to its non-democratic regime. We
   observe that China's approach provides an alternative blueprint for
   development that is potentially attractive to some audiences. Drawing on
   recent soft power debates, we argue that China's hard interventionist
   mode of governance in the renewables sector has the potential to enhance
   Chinese soft power both domestically and abroad.},

Abstract = {Populist parties are on the rise. But what happens when they are in
   government? In order to grasp the effect of populist parties in
   government systematically, the paper includes all 28 EU member states in
   an analysis which estimates the effect of populist parties in power on
   the increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results show that
   depending on their ideological orientation populist government
   participation is clearly associated with increasing GHG emissions.
   Furthermore, the analysis shows that the effect is quick. This is above
   all true for right-wing populist parties in government. Furthermore, the
   analysis shows that populist parties have different impacts in various
   regions of the EU. While right-wing populist governments are associated
   with an increase of GHG emissions in North Western and Eastern Europe,
   left-wing populist governments in Southern Europe have the opposite
   effect.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right parties (PRRPs) not only seek to influence public
   policies with (re-)distributive implications to attract voters; they
   also try to reshape economic governance to weaken their opponents. We
   develop a theoretical model suggesting that the institutional reform
   strategies of PRRPs depend in large part on the degree of Social
   democratic party-union ties. When organizational ties between
   centre-left parties and trade unions are strong, PRRPs are protagonists
   of attacks on institutional union power and unite with centre-right
   parties in alternating long-term power relationships. By contrast, when
   Social democratic party-union ties are weak, PRRPs turn into consenters
   to the centre-right's institutional reform proposals and act in
   accordance with short-term electoral and coalitional concerns. We
   research our argument in two primary case studies of Austria and
   Denmark, and control for alternative explanations with reviews of the
   institutional reform agendas pursued by radical right parties in Sweden
   and Germany.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between hybrid regimes and civil
   society. It examines the extant debate between `neo-Tocquevilleans' and
   their opponents over whether or not a robust civil society portends
   democratic transition and consolidation. It demonstrates the limits of
   these two models by arguing that civil society in hybrid regimes can in
   fact agitate against the state, advocate for democratic freedoms and
   achieve significant political reforms even when these do not lead to
   broader democratization. To demonstrate, this article documents the case
   of the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions through 15 years of complex Iraqi
   politics, from the 2003 US-led intervention and during the incumbency of
   Prime Minister's Maliki (2006-2014) and Abadi (2014-2018). By analysing
   primary materials produced by and about the Iraqi Federation of Oil
   Unions, it finds that this case holds important lessons for those
   seeking to understand the complex interface between civil society and
   the state in hybrid regimes.},

Abstract = {Some political economists explain the apparent downplaying of the
   importance of economic issues in political events such as Brexit with
   reference to the growing anger or despair people on low incomes feel
   about the economy. This `everyday political economy' article draws on an
   ethnographic study conducted between 2016 and 2018 with residents of an
   English city to explore what people think about the phenomenon of the
   economy. It reveals significant differences in how interested high- and
   low-income participants are in the economy and its role as a bedrock for
   welfare. Low-income participants are more negative about the economy,
   particularly contesting politicians' claims that it is distinct from the
   human sphere, when they view it as controlled by the rich. However,
   reasoning is based on post-2008 crisis economic conditions, and any lack
   of interest in the economy may be more calculative and temporary than is
   often assumed.},

Title = {Patterns of European bioeconomy policy. Insights from a cross-case study

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {The concept of the bioeconomy has risen to great popularity with
   governments around the world as a new paradigm for a sustainable
   economy. However, it is still highly contentious what the bioeconomy
   actually is or should be, which results in a certain vagueness of
   bioeconomy policy strategies. European bioeconomy policy is a prime
   example of this. Despite two dedicated bioeconomy strategies, it appears
   to be highly fragmented and heterogeneous when it comes to concrete
   political processes and measures. Against this backdrop, we aim to find
   patterns of European bioeconomy policy by applying the political
   process-inherent dynamics approach (PIDA) to the three sub-areas of
   bioplastics, biofuels and bioenergy. Aggregating the respective results,
   the overarching pattern of European bioeconomy policy is rather shaped
   by the interplay of specific problem structures, institutional
   frameworks and actor constellations in its policy sub-areas than by the
   ambiguous umbrella concept of the bioeconomy.},

Abstract = {This debate piece explores the possible consequences for Nigeria in the
   event that she signs up to the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)
   between the European Union (EU) and the other Economic Community of West
   African States (ECOWAS) member states). It argues that in a global
   firmament driven by economic conflict, the struggle for resources and
   realist economic nationalism - and with cut-throat competition as the
   norm in international political economy - it will amount to folly for
   the nation to embrace a partnership whose ramifications are at best
   murky. The author thus questions whether the EPA signed by ECOWAS with
   the EU will be favourable to the Nigerian people.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the role that language and language education can play in
   peace-building, this paper examines everyday practice through the lens
   of linguistic ethnography. It investigates Greek Cypriot teenagers
   learning Turkish, the language of the (former) enemy, and it asks: how
   were the Turkish language's associations with violent conflict handled
   in the practices and institutional organisation of schooling, and how
   far and in what ways can we say that the Turkish lessons contributed to
   peace-building? Our findings address the institutional structures and
   routines of secondary schooling, pedagogic and interactional practices
   in class, and the links between school and home. The paper concludes
   with a discussion of what this study might contribute to the notion of
   `de-securitisation' and to research on `hybrid' and `everyday peace'.},

Abstract = {Tactical repertoires of mobilization and repression play an essential
   role in understanding dynamics of political violence, yet existing
   quantitative approaches focus primarily on intensities or counts of
   repressive actions. We focus instead on the diversity of repression, and
   demonstrate a novel method of measuring repertoires of state repression
   using event data. We show that more repressive states are likely to
   employ more diverse repertoires of repression, rather than specializing
   narrowly in particularly coercive tactics. We demonstrate that,
   globally, repertoires of state repression are growing less diverse over
   time. Finally, in the Online appendix, we model repertoires of
   repression across countries and over time, finding evidence of broader
   repertoires during protest and civil war, but narrower under democratic
   regimes and international human rights treaties.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump was the President of the United States from January 2017 to
   January 2021. During that time, except for the period since spring 2020
   when the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on economic activity, the US
   economy has been doing very well according to key indicators like the
   unemployment rate and GDP growth. Does Trump deserve credit for the
   booming economy? To address this question, we develop a counterfactual
   scenario for how the US economy would have evolved without Trump - we
   let a matching algorithm determine which combination of other economies
   best resembles the pre-election path of the US economy. We then compare
   the performance of the US economy during Trump's Presidency to this
   synthetic ``doppelganger{''}. There is little evidence for a Trump
   effect.},

Abstract = {Governance researchers are increasingly interested in how co-creation
   can contribute to promoting public value in contemporary liberal
   democracies. While many have already argued for the potential benefits
   of employing co-creation in government strategies aiming to enhance
   public value, few have considered the implications of such a strategy
   for public leadership. Drawing on recent strands of theory on leadership
   and management, we specify how public leaders can use co-creation as a
   tool to achieve policy goals, and we illustrate this specification by
   showing how politicians and public and non-profit managers perform the
   public leadership of co-created public value in Gentofte, Denmark and
   Minneapolis.St Paul, USA. The main proposition is that this kind of
   public leadership does not only involve a strategic effort to engage,
   inspire and mobilise actors with relevant governance assets - including
   legitimacy, authority and capabilities - but also to align their
   understandings of what is valuable for the public.},

Title = {Different Pasts for Different Political Folk: Political Orientation
   Predicts Collective Nostalgia Content},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Collective nostalgia is a bittersweet emotion that reflects sentimental
   longing for valued aspects of the past of one's group. Given that
   conservatism is typically associated with a general desire to preserve
   the societal status quo or return society to its traditional way of
   being, nostalgia has been theorized to be characteristic of those on the
   political right (i.e., conservatives). In the current work, we proposed
   and tested the hypothesis that collective nostalgia is experienced by
   both conservatives and liberals, but the content of their nostalgizing
   differs. Across three studies in three socio-political contexts-United
   States (Study 1, MTurk, N = 352), Canada (Study 2, student sample, N =
   154), and England (Study 3, online panel, N = 2,345)-we found that both
   conservatives and liberals experienced collective nostalgia for a more
   homogenous and open society. However, conservatives experienced more
   homogeneity-focused collective nostalgia, whereas liberals experienced
   more openness-focused collective nostalgia. Replicating previous
   findings, homogeneity-focused nostalgia emerged as a positive, whereas
   openness-focused nostalgia emerged as a negative, predictor of
   intergroup attitudes. The results have both theoretical and practical
   significance for understanding political attitudes and behaviors. To the
   point, variance in the conservative and liberal political agendas is, in
   part, a function of a difference in their respective predisposition to
   nostalgize about and thus desire the return of a particular aspect of
   the in-group's past.},

Abstract = {Higher educational attainment levels are associated with better public
   health outcomes, lower levels of income inequality, more participation
   in democratic instructions, and safer communities. Promoting education
   in war-torn societies can have an immediate impact in mitigating
   violence and play a significant role in preventing conflict recurrence.
   This study investigates UN peacekeeping missions' role in this process,
   positing that UN deployments to locations experiencing armed conflict
   lead to higher levels of educational attainment by increasing local
   stability, incentivizing individuals to return to school while also
   making renewed investment worthwhile. Testing this logic using new data
   on local-level educational attainment across Africa from 2000 to 2014,
   this study finds that conflict zones where the UN maintained
   peacekeeping deployments saw an increase in educational attainment when
   compared to those that did not, a finding corroborated by coarsened
   exact matching. Maintaining a modest number of UN forces is shown to
   increase female attainment by at least 4.89 percent and reduce gender
   disparity by 5.13 percent, revealing the critical role UN peacekeeping
   plays in restoring education in the shadow of political violence.},

Abstract = {The mantra of `take back control' has become a staple of eurosceptics
   across the European Union. At the centre of the slogan's message is a
   call to arms against the (perceived) challenge that EU membership
   represents for national sovereignty. In this paper, we theorize that
   supranational decisions taken by the European Court of Justice can
   increase `polity scepticism' - increased opposition to the EU and
   decreased satisfaction with national democracy - by cueing citizens
   regarding the effects of EU integration on the perception of diluted
   sovereignty. Empirically, we leverage quasi-experimental evidence to
   support our theory, establishing that ECJ rulings have a significant
   causal effect on euroscepticism and dissatisfaction with democracy. The
   implications of our findings suggest that EU institutions seeking to
   ensure compliance with the rule of law and EU norms should proceed with
   caution. Interventionist action may backfire by increasing scrutiny of
   the EU's legitimacy and undermining polity support.},

Abstract = {The concept of `young radicals' is gaining ground in a context of
   generalized discontent - often, this is due to the fact that young
   people engage increasingly in unconventional forms of political
   activism. Much less is known about young people holding radical
   political attitudes. This article advances our understanding of those
   young people who place themselves on the extremes of the ideological
   scale and investigates how those with radical right attitudes differ
   from those with radical left ones. Drawing on a survey that gathers data
   from nine European countries, with a sample of young people aged 18-35,
   we test those factors that have been used to explain why people use
   violent repertoires of action: social background, gender, political
   values, and prior experience in protest activism. The results relate
   `radicalness' to experienced economic difficulties and the more
   contentious political activism. The difference between the young
   `radicals' in right and left are, however, defined by gender and
   adherence to authoritarian values.},

Title = {Online Hate and Zeitgeist of Fear: A Five-Country Longitudinal Analysis

Abstract = {Acts of terror lead to both a rise of an extended sense of fear that
   goes beyond the physical location of the attacks and to increased
   expressions of online hate. In this longitudinal study, we analyzed
   dynamics between the exposure to online hate and the fear of terrorism
   after the Paris attacks in November 13, 2015. We hypothesized that
   exposure to online hate is connected to a perceived Zeitgeist of fear
   (i.e., collective fear). In turn, the perceived Zeitgeist of fear is
   related to higher personal fear of terrorism both immediately after the
   attacks and a year later. Hypotheses were tested using path modeling and
   panel data (N = 2325) from Norway, Finland, Spain, France, and the
   United States a few weeks after the Paris attacks in November 2015 and
   again a year later in January 2017. With the exception of Norway,
   exposure to online hate had a positive association with the perceived
   Zeitgeist of fear in all our samples. The Zeitgeist of fear was
   correlated with higher personal fear of terrorism immediately after the
   attacks and one year later. We conclude that online hate content can
   contribute to the extended sense of fear after the terrorist attacks by
   skewing perceptions of social climate.},

Abstract = {Do survey participants in conflict zones respond differently if they
   have been interviewed before? Academic and policy interest in postwar
   political opinion has increased tremendously. One unexpected consequence
   of this surge of survey research is a growing probability that
   individuals will be interviewed multiple times. However, if
   participating in one survey causes respondents to change their attitudes
   or behavior, their subsequent survey responses may be biased in
   comparison to the rest of the sample population. Our article aims to
   investigate such `survey participation effects' in conflict contexts. We
   draw on original survey data collected in the eastern Democratic
   Republic of Congo (DRC). In our representative sample, 18\% of
   respondents report that they have been interviewed before. Multivariate
   analyses demonstrate that their stated attitudes on social relations,
   political institutions, gender norms, and wartime victimization differ
   substantively from the responses of first-time interviewees. Moreover,
   our analyses indicate that experienced respondents have specific
   response styles - in particular, a tendency to support extreme response
   options. While substantive bias in multivariate analyses seems to be
   rather rare, our findings indicate that researchers should be aware of
   the footprints of data collection efforts in areas frequently targeted
   by household and opinion surveys.},

Abstract = {Affective polarization has increased substantially in the United States
   and countries of Europe over the last decades and the ramifications of
   the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to drastically reinforce such
   polarization. I investigate the degree and dynamic of affective
   polarization during the COVID-19 pandemic through a two-wave panel
   survey with a vignette experiment in Germany fielded in April/May and
   July/August 2020. I 1) compare the findings to a previous study from
   2017, and 2) assess how economic distress due to the crisis changes
   perceptions of other partisans. Results show that the public today
   experiences slightly stronger polarization between AfD voters and
   supporters of other parties. Yet, higher economic distress decreases the
   negative sentiment of voters of other parties towards AfD supporters. I
   argue that experiencing economic distress increases the awareness of
   political debate and the responsiveness to government decisions. Thus,
   in times of broad cross-party consensus, this can translate into public
   opinion so that it makes people less hostile towards other partisans.},

Title = {Global Risks and Governance Capacities. Keys for the Implementation of
   the 2030 Agenda},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Ibero-America faces the challenge of developing effective strategies to
   facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of
   the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the public sphere. This
   involves the implementation of policies that integrate the efforts of
   public administrations around common strategic frameworks, generate
   models of collaboration among the multiple actors involved in
   decision-making processes and reduce the institutional barriers that
   traditionally affect the implementation of public politics. This
   document aims to address the impact of environmental changes, especially
   global risks, on the strategies promoted in Ibero-America for the 2030
   Agenda implementation. It is based on a theoretical framework that
   addresses policy implementation frameworks in the Administration and the
   problems they usually face to ensure their success, focusing the
   analysis on two key variables: the environment and the governance
   capacities. It is concluded that the strategies implemented by
   governments inexorably subjected to the tensions derived from global
   risks. These are events or situations that, untimely, can cause damages
   and affect the course of public action. The COVID-19 pandemic,
   considered a critical juncture, was a milestone in this regard. However,
   governments have not incorporated into their strategies sufficiently
   solid institutional mechanisms to ensure risk management, the adoption
   of measures to mitigate its effects and the establishment of channels
   for citizen participation that promote more open and dynamic processes.
   Public organizations cannot manage in isolation or unilaterally the
   magnitude of environmental changes and especially the impact of global
   risks on the 2030 Agenda implementation and the achievement of the SDGs.
   To this end, they must develop new governance models to support risk
   management tasks, through the configuration of networks and
   institutional mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of knowledge and
   strategic resources.},

Volume = {48},

Pages = {123-136},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In Karim Ainouz's debut feature film Madame Sata (2002), the protagonist
   yearns to be a cross-dressing performer. Based on the historical figure
   Joao Francisco dos Santos, the protagonist is black, poor, gay, and a
   criminal in the Brazil of the 1930s. An examination of his body as a
   nexus of these factors and the film's portrayal of it in the context of
   queer theory, film history, and social discourses of gender, race, and
   class and in cinematic terms demonstrates that, while he is able to
   express his fluid gender identity temporarily through performance, the
   protagonist is unable to escape his social position as regulated by the
   intersectionality of his gender identity with other factors.
   En el primer largometraje de Karim Ainouz, Madame Sata (2002), el
   protagonista anhela ser un artista travesti. Basado en la figura
   historica de Joao Francisco dos Santos, dicho protagonista es negro,
   pobre, homosexual y criminal en el Brasil de la decada de 1930. El
   articulo analiza su cuerpo como nexo entre estos factores y la manera en
   que es representado en la pelicula a partir de una perspectiva teorica
   queer, de la historia del cine y los discursos sociales de genero, raza
   y clase, asi como de la tecnica cinematografica. Si por un lado el
   personaje es capaz de expresar su fluida identidad de genero
   temporalmente a traves de la interpretacion, por otro es incapaz de
   escapar su posicion social, la cual esta regulada por la
   interseccionalidad entre su identidad de genero y otros factores.},

Abstract = {2019 was the second hottest year on record, with enhanced ice melts, sea
   level rises, heatwaves, droughts, and unprecedented large-scale
   wildfires of record intensity. Here I chart a new research agenda for
   understanding the interconnections between human behaviour,
   environmental disasters, and governing a more disaster-prone world. I
   argue that sovereign states' technological responses to environmental
   disasters as risks to be reduced systemically ignores human
   contributions to environmental hazards and vulnerabilities. Using a
   constructivist analysis, I analyse states' understandings of, and
   capacity to respond to, cascading environmental disasters at multiple
   scales according to what they collectively see, what they know, and how
   they act in terms of emergency preparedness and planning. Revealing the
   inadequacies of sovereign states' understanding of what constitutes
   environmental disasters absent their role in them, brings us closer to
   better governing cascading environmental disasters in the 21(st)
   Century.},

Abstract = {What can we learn about the `international' through the `transnational'?
   This article investigates transnational spaces and practices in the
   context of international law and their transformative influence on our
   understanding of the international. I argue that the relationship
   between the transnational and the international is not dichotomous, but
   an expression of the shifting location of power and authority in social
   relations across scales. The article contributes to this special issue
   by tracing dynamics of actualisation and reification of the
   international in various literatures. Reviewing uses of the
   `transnational' in law and International Relations, I first show how the
   concept was used to unsettle the reason of state that defines both
   disciplines. The second part explores the relationship of the
   transnational and international through Bourdieusian studies of
   international law, in which the transnational is used as a strategic
   space for action generative of new legal practices and a social space in
   which actors who hold various capitals participate in shaping
   international law. Finally, I analyse how international political
   sociology has unsettled both the transnational and the international
   through the image of transversal lines cutting across these spaces.},

Abstract = {While many citizens are indifferent about the EU, most MEPs are
   invisible in national politics and European Parliament elections are not
   fought based on parliamentary activity records, some legislators still
   pursue territorial interests or foster constituency linkages. What
   explains such behavior? Drawing on written questions data from the 6th
   and the 7th terms of the European Parliament (EP) this article shows
   that despite the virtual absence of an electoral connection in EP
   elections, electoral system features, and electoral marginality
   influence the MEPs' engagement in geographical representation.
   Electorally marginal MEPs ask more questions on regional and national
   topics as do MEPs elected from STV systems. There is no evidence for a
   differential effect of district magnitude depending on ballot structure.},

Abstract = {This article assesses Germany's role in the integration of EU police
   cooperation as a `core state power' from its beginnings in the 1970s up
   to today. Relying on a mix of methods including archival research and
   expert interviews, it demonstrates how Germany has contributed to
   expanding the scope of EU policing and institutionalising the European
   Police Office Europol. Between kick-starting initial cooperation and the
   creation of Europol, German police and political elites pushed for a
   holistic European approach on internal security long before other member
   states. As of the 2000s, German political elites increasingly preferred
   cooperation of avant-garde groups of member states to deepen integration
   and became more hesitant in view of supranational advocacy post-Lisbon
   Treaty. However, the continued lobbying of police practitioners and the
   `angst' of a wider public in the wake of terrorist attacks has ensured a
   quite stable German preference for a strong Europol and more
   integration.},

   chairs and reviewers in completing reviews of terrorism studies ethics
   proposals, in as objective a manner as possible. The framework consists
   of a series of yes/no questions for chairs and reviewers to answer
   before completing their reviews. These questions are divided into six
   different sections: participant's right's, safety and vulnerability;
   informed consent; confidentiality and anonymity; researcher's right's,
   safety and vulnerability; data storage and security-sensitive materials;
   and the ethical review process. This framework was developed as a result
   of critical analysis of the literature in terrorism research and
   analogous fields.},

Abstract = {Expanded homeownership in Johannesburg's townships offered the prospect
   of post-apartheid formal inclusion. Yet allocation of title to former
   rental homes has been characterized by a profound lack of normative
   consensus regarding ownership or inheritance. In bitter disputes over
   houses, appeals to law jostle and interweave with claims in a customary
   register. In much regional scholarship, normative pluralism provides a
   point of departure for understanding disagreement of this kind. This
   article proposes an alternative perspective by examining how dissensus
   is mediated and given shape by a legal-administrative process. Law
   becomes inchoate in layers of bureaucratic encounter, while contested
   claims to custom are sharpened at the interface with bureaucracy. In
   South Africa, taking administration as a starting point reveals the long
   shadows of apartheid in concrete experiences of the law, in extra-legal
   understandings, and in the very terms of contestation among kin.
   Illuminating the little-explored topic of urban property inheritance,
   the perspective has broader implications for understanding inequality.
   Inclusion through homeownership is a form of `adverse incorporation'
   marked by official opacity, diffidence regarding the law, stratifying

Abstract = {In the English School, the relationship between international and world
   society has recently received increasing attention - conceptually and
   empirically. Adding to this developing literature, we study how world
   societal actors not only serve as normative counterpoints to
   international society or function as norm-entrepreneurs, but decisively
   contribute to its reproduction. Going beyond the common preoccupation
   with actor types, we focus on practices that are performed on the
   international stage. We examine the role which world sport events,
   especially FIFA's World Cup and the infrastructure of football, play for
   international society. Building on Wight, we conceptualize world sport
   events as a (world societal actor driven) derivative primary institution
   of international society, which is embedded within the particularly
   hybrid master primary institution of sites and festivals. We find that
   world sport events allow for the ludic and festive reproduction of key
   primary institutions (like sovereignty, territoriality, and
   nationalism), while they highlight how members of international society
   compete on the basis of shared norms and values. Naturalizing world
   order as international order, they make international society
   emotionally experienceable as feasible and desirable at a global level.
   In performing world sport events, world societal actors uphold rather
   than challenge international society.},

   Collective Problem-Solving},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article investigates the practical form of citizen engagement that
   occurs in collective problem-solving efforts such as civic enterprises,
   grassroots initiatives and self-help groups. Drawing on extensive
   empirical evidence from diverse policy fields, it articulates the
   distinct experimental and disruptive policy work that citizens enact in
   these citizens' governance spaces and challenges dominant
   interpretations which view them as either (i) a testament to the
   capacity of citizens to effectively solve complex public problems or
   (ii) a symptom of advanced neoliberalism where states off-load complex
   problems onto citizens. The article moves beyond this dualism to
   consider the motivations, challenges, available resources and distinct
   democratic work enacted by citizens in these spaces of bottom-up
   governance. Citizens' governance spaces, the article concludes, offer
   important lessons - both in terms of potential benefits and risks - for
   the project of deepening the quality and reach of citizen participation
   in modern systems of democracy.},

Title = {The Recognition Dilemma: Negotiating Identity in the Israeli-Palestinian
   Conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {122-135},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {During five years of US-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
   (2009-2014), Israeli PM Netanyahu repeatedly demanded that Palestinians
   recognize Israel as a Jewish state as part of any final status
   agreement. Simultaneously, a chorus of Israeli political and military
   elites consistently challenged this negotiating posture as a threat to
   the state's very identity. What explains these competing positions on
   recognition's absence and necessity? Considerable attention in IR has
   recently focused on the lengths states go to correct acts of
   misrecognition, out of a genuine need for recognition, and the
   self-certainty recognition provides in a socially uncertain world. This
   structural and intrinsic model neglects, however, the powerful role
   agents can play in constructing, or avoiding, recognition conflict.
   Political considerations can cause recognition, and its absence, to
   matter more than it otherwise should, just as they can cause others to
   view recognition campaigns as vulnerable and ontologically harmful
   pursuits. This article proposes both an instrumental model of
   recognition and a theory on the recognition dilemma needed to explain
   these competing attitudes. In doing so, it shifts attention away from
   social structure, and relations, in order to take domestic processes
   seriously as a forum for both the construction and contestation of
   recognition politics.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on causes of violent extremism in Kazakhstan by
   looking at the violent attacks on law-enforcement bodies in 2011 and
   2016 in Aqtobe, Almaty, and Atyrau. Drawing on interviews with the
   convicted extremists, we argue that criminal youth subculture,
   grievances, the Salafi-jihadist ideology, and propaganda in the Internet
   have promoted extremist violence in Kazakhstan. We also make a brief
   comparative analysis of European jihadists and violent extremists in

Abstract = {The increasing competition between China and the United States in the
   South China Sea necessitates that some important issues be resolved.
   What are China and the US fighting over? What is causing the two sides
   to increasingly diverge on this issue since 2009? This article attempts
   to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the three major factors-third
   parties, disputes over maritime rules, and power competition-to clarify
   the main mechanisms they have played in this competition since 2009, to
   assess the relationship among the factors, and to explore basic trends
   in the long-term China-US competition over the South China Sea. The main
   findings are that third-party factors, disputes over maritime rules, and
   power competition, respectively, have the most powerful explanatory
   power in 2009-2012, 2013-2016, and 2017 to 2020, and that the current
   China-US stalemate in the South China Sea is the result of the long-term
   China-US interactions over these three factors, which have different
   importance rankings in different periods.},

Title = {Human security of urban migrant populations affected by length of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {It is widely suggested that migration is a key mechanism linking climate
   change to violent conflict, particularly through migration increasing
   the risks of conflict in urban destinations. Yet climate change also
   creates new forms of insecurity through distress migration, immobility
   and vulnerability that are prevalent in urban destination locations.
   Here we examine the extent and nature of human security in migration
   destinations and test whether insecurity is affected by length of
   residence and environmental hazards. The study develops an index measure
   of human security at the individual level to include environmental and
   climate-related hazards as well as sources of well-being, fear of crime
   and violence, and mental health outcomes. It examines the elements of
   human security that explain the prevalence of insecurity among recent
   and established migrants in low-income urban neighbourhoods. The study
   reports on data collected in Chattogram in Bangladesh through a survey
   of migrants (N = 447) and from qualitative data derived using photo
   elicitation techniques with cohorts of city planners and migrants. The
   results show that environmental hazards represent an increasing source
   of perceived insecurity to migrant populations over time, with
   longer-term migrants perceiving greater insecurity than more recent
   arrivals, suggesting lack of upward social mobility in low-income slums.
   Ill-health, fear of eviction, and harassment and violence are key
   elements of how insecurity is experienced, and these are exacerbated by
   environmental hazards such as flooding. The study expands the concept of
   security to encompass central elements of personal risk and well-being
   and outlines the implications for climate change.},

Abstract = {In response to Karsten Friis' critique of the special issue When War
   Becomes Daily Life, this reply outlines a brief conceptual, empirical
   and normative clarification of the special issue's use of the concept,
   military activism. Conceptually, the reply points out that military
   activism is already a frequently used concept in the academic literature
   on Scandinavian countries increased engagement in international military
   operations after the Cold War. Empirically, it is correct that this
   development has not been linear, and arguably, Denmark and Norway's
   military activism was (even more) pronounced, when the war in
   Afghanistan was at its zenith. However, both countries continue to be
   engaged particularly in NATO, and significantly, direct battles on the
   ground are increasingly outsourced to local actors to less privileged
   local and international combatants. The reply points out, that Friis's
   claim that military activism is a concealed critique of Denmark and
   Norway's military engagement, is based on a misunderstanding. On the
   contrary, activism as a concept derives from the Danish foreign policy
   debate, where the term is used to connote a series of positive
   attributes associated with being active (Pedersen \& Ringsmose, 2017).
   Considering the depoliticisation of Denmark and -Norway's military
   activism we welcome further academic and policy discussions about this
   important issue.},

Abstract = {This paper reclaims the concept of solidarity for democratic theory. It
   does this by proposing a theory of solidarity as social involvement that
   is construed through the integration of three better known conceptions
   of solidarity that have played an influential role in the political
   thought of the last two centuries. The paper begins by explaining why
   solidarity should receive more sustained attention from political
   theorists with an interest in democracy, and proceeds by presenting two
   indispensability arguments. Section three outlines the three rival
   conceptions of solidarity and contends that whilst individually
   incomplete, each provides an important insight, so that a fuller and
   more satisfying conception of solidarity can be developed by weaving
   together some features of these three conceptions. This task is
   undertaken in section four, which introduces the theory of solidarity as
   social involvement, defining solidarity in terms of acting-for and
   acting-with. Section five briefly discusses some of its potential
   implications for democratic theory, before bringing the article to a
   close.},

Title = {Integrative Aspects of Non-verbal Cultural Communication in Europe. Case
   Study - Pantomime},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {137-155},
Abstract = {This article touches on the integrative aspects of non-verbal cultural
   communication as exemplified by diverse pantomime genres in modern
   Europe. The starting point being the characteristic features of this
   form of art, as well as its genesis and functions in the Eastern and
   Western parts of the globe. Festivals, which have been rapidly
   developing in the world of pantomime and street art since the beginning
   of the 1970s, play an exceptional role in European cultural exchange.
   They are, however, generally ephemeral projects, often placed besides
   institutionalised mainstream culture, with no aspirations to become part
   of the EFA for example. Non-verbal cultural communication in Europe is
   still poorly integrated and yet maintains a remarkable diversity of
   genres and multi- colour forms. Such decentralisation is also the source
   of its strength manifested by its ease in reaching an incredibly diverse
   audience, the ability to obtain feedback from mass audiences, its
   expansiveness (taking up various spaces), its flexible approach in its
   quest for answers - but at the same time respecting the rudiments of the
   rich, native European tradition of popular culture. It seems that EU
   institutions nowadays notice the significant role of this type of
   intercultural communication, as evidenced by,for example, the
   Commissioner Gabriel's statement regarding a meeting with EFA
   representatives on 22(nd) June 2021. The European Union has no
   harmonisation competences in the area of culture, but rather solely
   complementary and supporting functions with regards to Member States'
   activities - one can count on EU sectoral support funds from the
   Creative Europe Programme. The subsidisation of festival, confrontation,
   and meeting movements related to non-verbal cultural exchange can take
   place (and does take place) through regions, local governments, or
   cultural institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the series of Polish-German Round Table meetings on
   supporting members of the German minority in Poland and the Poles in
   Germany which took place during 2010-2019. The course and results of
   these talks can be interpreted as a clash of kin-state policies that
   treat these groups as a `foreign' extension of the nation and emphasise
   the need to care for them. They carry interesting conclusions regarding:
   the role of minority groups themselves as non-state entities influencing
   and shaping kin-state policies; and the tension surrounding the use of
   the terms `national minority' and `immigrant community'.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the five mistakes
   made by political leaders in Asian countries in combating corruption.
   These mistakes constitute the cycle of failure which must be broken for
   Asian countries to succeed in fighting corruption.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on the comparative
   evaluation of the effectiveness of the anti-corruption measures adopted
   by various Asian countries.
   Findings - The cycle of failure in combating corruption in Asian
   countries arises from their governments' reliance on corrupt political
   leaders and the police, and multiple anti-corruption agencies as attack
   dogs or paper tigers.
   Originality/value - This paper would be of interest to those
   policymakers, anti-corruption practitioners, and scholars, who are
   concerned with enhancing the effectiveness of anti-corruption strategies
   in their countries by breaking the cycle of failure.},

Abstract = {In the communist Eastern Bloc nations between 1956 and 1991, there was
   virtually no effort to recruit volunteers. All the armies of the Warsaw
   Treaty Organization (WTO) were conscript armies, and the vast majority
   of men aged 20-24 served in the armed forces whether they wanted to or
   not. Despite the obligatory nature of service, the WTO regimes all
   sought to gain youths' willing compliance and to minimize draft evasion
   by inculcating within them support for military service through
   indoctrination by the communist parties, the various young communist
   leagues, the national education systems, the respective militaries, and
   dedicated pre-induction military training organisations. The superiority
   of the socialist system, the threat of capitalist aggression, and the
   unity of the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the
   Eastern Bloc were prominent themes of pre-induction indoctrination.
   Above all, military service was portrayed as fulfilment of their civic
   duty. More than just for national defence, the pre-service preparation
   and active service were intended to generate loyalty to the idea of
   socialism, subordination to the one-party state, and acceptance of the
   need to maintain the Soviet bloc. All WTO nations failed to achieve this
   goal.},

Abstract = {Wars are decided in the cognitive domain. This hypothesis is supported
   by this article on the war on terrorism and its strategic narrative. The
   analysis emphasizes how the physical warfighting is inextricably linked
   to the strategic narratives of the war. Special consideration is given
   here to the master narrative establishing the war on terror. How was
   this narrative constructed? How did it develop over time? What replaced
   it, and what actors were crucial in retiring the phrase `war on terror'?
   Two key actors in this respect were ISIL and President Barack Obama.
   ISIL eclipsed Al Qaida as the world's most feared and infamous terror
   group. Whereas Obama systematically avoided using the phrase `war on
   terror' altogether. A war that is never mentioned by the USA's
   Commander-in-Chief is no longer an operational military concept.
   Equipped with the targeted killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, Obama
   brought closure to the national trauma of 9/11. Because the war on
   terrorism was always George W. Bush's war. He left behind two large
   scale ground wars with little prospect of success in either of them. He
   did provide a temporary change of fortune in Iraq with `the Surge' of
   fresh troops in 2007. But these gains were soon enough erased as ISIL
   grew and developed into a pseudo-state in northern Iraq and Syria.},

Title = {Burden-sharing Debates in NATO and Danish Defence Policy},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {132-154},
Abstract = {Denmark has consistently been among the countries in NATO that spend the
   lowest share of GDP on defence. This article explores how American and
   Danish decision-makers have articulated Danish defence policy in
   relation to the ongoing burden-sharing debate in NATO and the Alliance's
   most recent burden-sharing debate, which took place in the late 1970s
   and first half of the 1980s. The article argues that there is continuity
   in the arguments put forward by the United States in attempts to
   influence Danish defence policy and by Danish actors to justify why
   Denmark does not live up to NATO's burden-sharing guidelines. In the
   burden-sharing debates American actors thus consistently try to
   influence Danish defence policy by pointing out that the policy is an
   expression of a lack of solidarity, that fulfilment of the objectives is
   in Danish self-interest, and by creating uncertainty about the prospect
   of American reinforcements. Danish actors, on the other hand, use
   existing defence agreements as a bulwark against short-term changes and
   argue that not meeting the burden-sharing objectives is acceptable. A
   consequence of not meeting the guidelines may result in Denmark losing
   its position as part of the good company in NATO. In times where force
   contributions to international operations are in less demand this is
   even more likely.},

Abstract = {The decline of civic engagement has been an issue for several EU Member
   States. To promote civic engagement, digital tools have been perceived
   as one of the possible solutions both at the EU and national levels.
   Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that has intensified
   digitalisation in many forms and sectors, the issue of digital solutions
   for civic engagement has regained its relevance and topicality. In the
   last decade, Latvia has been among other EU Member States in which civic
   engagement has become a concerning and long-term challenge. For
   instance, as opposed to Estonia, voter turnout in the most recent
   national and European parliamentary elections has gradually declined in
   Latvia. There are also limited digital possibilities through which
   Latvian society can participate and influence the political agenda
   daily. Therefore, this article provides an overview of the provisions
   and guidelines at the EU level to address the issue of civic engagement
   by promoting digital democracy tools. Secondly, it analyses what digital
   tools exist in Latvia to promote civic engagement. Thirdly, by comparing
   the digital civic engagement solutions implemented in Estonia and
   Latvia, the lessons learned are drawn. Finally, using data from
   quantitative (polls) studies (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic),
   the article provides recommendations for Latvia in the context of
   I-voting.},

Abstract = {Although substantive agreement exists on the role of climate variability
   and food scarcity in increasing violence, a limited number of studies
   have investigated how food resources affect violent conflict. This
   article explores the complex linkages between climate variability,
   agricultural production and conflict onset, by focusing on the spatial
   distribution of crop production in a cross-country setting. We
   hypothesize that spatial differences in crop production within countries
   are a relevant factor in shaping the impact of climate variability on
   conflict in agriculturally -dependent countries. To test this
   hypothesis, we rely on high-resolution global gridded data on the local
   yield of four main crops for the period 1982-2015 and aggregate the
   grid-cell information on crop production to compute an empirical
   indicator of the spatial concentration of agricultural production within
   countries. Our results show that the negative impacts of climate
   variability lead to an increase in the spatial concentration of
   agricultural production within countries. In turn, the combined effect
   of climate extremes and crop production concentration increases the
   predicted probability of conflict onset by up to 14\% in agriculturally
   dependent countries.},

   Media Visibility across Political Systems},

Abstract = {A growing body of studies analyzes interest groups' media visibility.
   Yet little is known about how the drivers of media access may vary
   across different interest group systems. This article focuses on two
   major mechanisms through which organizations can gain media visibility:
   media management efforts and the newsworthiness of elite actors. We
   hypothesize that media effort explains interest groups' media access
   more strongly in competitive, pluralist interest group systems and that
   insider (i.e. ``elite{''}) status does so more strongly in hierarchical,
   corporatist systems. We analyze surveys and media data on interest
   groups in the pluralist United Kingdom, the moderately corporatist
   Denmark, and the more strongly corporatist Finland. As hypothesized,
   media effort is most effective in the UK and weakest in Finland.
   However, we find only weak support for the insider status hypothesis:
   there is some evidence of the expected cross-country differences, but
   the effects are small and unrobust.},

Abstract = {China has prioritized quantum science and technology as a critical
   frontier for its national security and development. To date, Chinese
   research has already reached a leading position within the discipline,
   enabled by state support and funding, as well as the recruitment and
   cultivation of talent. The rapid advances on this front can provide a
   valuable illustration of the dynamics of China's evolving innovation
   ecosystem, including the increased prominence of leading technology
   companies, and even start-ups, as serious contenders. China's strategy
   of military-civil fusion, which aims to create a more integrated
   ecosystem in science and technology, can contribute to enabling progress
   in dual-use developments. This case study draws upon the shared
   framework for this special issue, which provides a method by which to
   consider the factors that enable defense innovation. Looking forward,
   these advances could prove consequential for the future strategic
   balance between China and the United States.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the composition of coalitions is key to
   understanding military operations, because it encompasses decisive
   intra-coalition dynamics such as great power and alliance politics,
   caveats and institutional constraints. The case study analysis, focused
   on NATO's war in Libya, relies on content analysis of national and NATO
   policy documents as well as interviews with policymakers and military
   officials. We find that, while great powers predictably shape how
   missions are designed and carried out, their precise influence is
   affected by factors that are inherent to a coalition's composition.},

Title = {Is abusive supervision always harmful toward creativity? Managing
   workplace stressors by promoting distributive and procedural justice},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {385-407},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to answer the question of how, why and when
   abusive supervision affects employee creativity. Drawing on the
   conservation of resources theory, this paper examines the direct and
   indirect (via psychological distress) effects of abusive supervision on
   employee creativity. It further investigates the boundary conditions
   imposed by employees' perceived distributive and procedural justice in
   the relationships between abusive supervision, psychological distress
   and employee creativity. Design/methodology/approach The study uses
   multi-sourced and time-lagged data collected in three waves from a
   survey of employees-supervisor dyads working in the Chinese
   manufacturing sector. In the first wave, the authors received data from
   347 employees on perceived abusive supervision and perceived
   distributive and procedural justice. In the second wave, 320 employees
   shared their perceptions of psychological distress at work. In the third
   wave, the authors received ratings for employee creativity from the
   direct supervisors of 300 employees. The data were analyzed using
   bootstrapped moderated mediation procedures. Findings The findings
   revealed a significant negative influence of abusive supervision on
   employee creativity both directly and indirectly in the presence of
   perceived psychological distress. However, distributive and procedural
   justice was found to mitigate the negative impact of abusive supervision
   on employee creativity. Practical implications Abusive supervision has
   adverse consequences for employees' creativity because it affects their
   psychological health. HR and top management should prioritize addressing
   abusive supervision first and foremost to boost employee creativity in
   the workplace. Managers should give employees opportunities for
   participation and foster a climate of fairness in the organization to
   mitigate the harmful consequences of abusive supervision.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
   first empirical study that examines the psychological distress-based
   mechanism in the relationship between abusive supervision and creativity
   while considering the interactive effects of distributive and procedural
   justice. It addresses an important research gap in the literature by
   proposing that organizational perceived distributive and procedural
   justice can mitigate the detrimental effects of abusive supervision.},

Abstract = {This article is to review the development of the LGBT+ movement in
   Czechia after 1989. The analytical section introduces three distinctive
   phases: (1) the movement's establishment and development during the
   1990s, (2) the period culminating (and declining) with the adoption of
   the Registered Partnership in 2006, and (3) the period characterised as
   a restructuring of the movement towards the goal of equal parental and
   marriage rights. The article analyses the development and changes in the
   organisational structure of the movement (according to {[}Cisar, Ondrej.
   2013. ``A Typology of Extra-Parliamentary Political Activism in
   Post-Communist Settings: The Case of the Czech Republic.{''} In
   Jacobsson and Saxonberg, 139-168]). It uncovers heterogeneity, mostly
   concentrated around short transitory moments in each phase which allow
   the establishment of short-term, often informal, self-organised
   organisations oriented less on transactional activism, typical for NGOs
   of the region and time period.},

Abstract = {Administrative procedures are intended to increase transparency and help
   agencies make better decisions. However, these requirements also
   increase agency workload. Understanding how public agencies satisfy
   procedural requirements is a critical facet of agency performance. This
   analysis focuses on the language used in Environmental Impact Statements
   (EISs) required by the US National Environmental Policy Act
   (NEPA)-specifically, the reuse of similar text within and between
   assessments. We synthesize theories of institutional isomorphism and
   bureaucratic coping to understand why text is reused, and consider the
   tradeoffs of this behavior. Using a national dataset of 1015 EISs
   published by 22 agencies from 2013 to 2020, we apply local document
   alignment (LDA) to measure how boilerplate language varies by agency,
   authors, project type, location, and consulting firm involvement. Latent
   order logistic and beta regression models applied to the LDA results
   show that text reuse primarily occurs where there is a clear substantive
   rationale for boilerplate language or where studies share authors or
   contract consulting firms. This indicates: (1) that agencies largely do
   not engage in pro forma compliance efforts; and (2) that while NEPA
   procedures are oriented around individual projects and decisions,
   cross-project learning and the narrowness-or breadth-of agencies'
   project portfolios shape analytical routines and the relative tradeoffs
   of boilerplate text in policy analysis. This article adds to our
   theoretical understanding of agencies' coping strategies in response to
   institutional pressures and makes a methodological contribution by
   demonstrating the application of text reuse measurement and information
   extraction methods in public administration research.},

Abstract = {The 2016 European Union referendum revealed fundamental divisions in
   British politics and society more broadly. It also raised key questions
   around representation and the role of Members of Parliament. Should they
   follow their own judgement or their constituents' preferences when the
   two are not aligned? This study uses data from the Representative Audit
   of Britain Survey to examine what parliamentary candidates believe the
   answer to this question should be. We find that most candidates expect
   Members of Parliament to prioritise their own views. This belief is
   particularly prevalent among incumbents and those who do not think of
   Members of Parliament as career politicians. We also find a gender
   effect as male candidates are more likely to think that Members of
   Parliament should prioritise their own views than female candidates.
   Interestingly, however, there is no evidence of a Brexit effect when we
   compare the views of 2015 and 2017 general election candidates.},

Abstract = {The development of Polish institutional sociology since the 1920s
   reflects the combined effects of domestic political and cultural
   factors, along with international interdependencies. Historical
   sociology shares in the vicissitudes of the whole discipline. Although
   historical sociology was only weakly institutionalized before 1989, some
   of the best sociological studies produced in Poland under socialism
   display the keen use of historical imagination, inspired both by the
   pre-1939 domestic tradition and by Marxist theory. This article examines
   the path of historical sociology in Poland after 1989 and the connection
   between the sociological uses of history and the experience of
   post-communist transformation. We posit that the social transformation
   experience and how it was addressed by social science directly translate
   into the use of history in Polish sociology after 1989. We argue that
   the role of historical sociology in Poland since the end of the 1990s
   was a function of the potential of the past as a symbolic resource in
   the growing interdependence between Poland and Western Europe. However,
   the post-1989 research agendas of historical sociology were forged
   according to the mode of responsiveness to political agendas predating
   1989. An overview of the development of Polish historical sociology
   demonstrates that the ahistorical transitological thinking after 1989
   has been challenged by critical agendas in historical sociology, but it
   was, in the first place, a reaction to the increased potential of the
   past as a symbolic resource in political debates. Thus, the rationale
   for the passage to the third wave of historical sociology was primarily
   political.},

Abstract = {In this article, we bridge and extend concepts from behavioral game
   theory and the Ecology of Games Theory of Polycentricity (EGT) to test
   possible mechanisms for conflict contagion across the array of actors
   and policy forums that constitute a polycentric governance system. We
   argue that actors who experience conflict in one forum will develop
   similar strategies in other forums, which then impacts the level of
   conflict exhibited in within-forum interactions. This behavioral
   spillover of conflict is a different mechanism than conflict that might
   be experienced when two forums are addressing the same policy issue(s),
   which may be characterized by higher or lower levels of conflict. We use
   survey data collected in the Tampa Bay (FL) and California Delta (CA)
   water governance systems to examine conflict contagion across forums.
   Using a series of spatial autoregressive models, we find evidence that
   co-membership networks serve as a conduit for conflict contagion among
   forums. Our results show that forum deliberations can be strongly
   impacted by interactions from other institutions and processes.
   Consistent with the idea of path dependence, ``new{''} forums are not
   necessarily independent of the forums they replace, but rather,
   preexisting levels of conflict and cooperation may constrain available
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The complexity and multi-level nature of climate change requires
   governance systems able to manage and resolve conflicts across multiple
   scales. Drawing on the theories of collaborative governance and conflict
   resolution, this paper proposes a theoretical framework to understand
   three types of conflicts likely to occur in a multi-level governance
   (MLG) network: conflict in problem framing, conflict in benefit sharing,
   and conflict in capacity building. Using the implementation of the clean
   development mechanism in China as a case study, the paper finds the
   three types of conflicts emerged between supranational and subnational
   levels. The finding further indicates the role that the Chinese national
   government played in resolving conflicts through reinterpreting
   international norms, aligning presumably conflicting goals, eliminating
   the difference in benefits sharing, and narrowing capacity gaps across
   levels. The evidence suggests an improved MLG should be dedicated to
   integrating local level interests in centrally dominated policy
   processes. This study contributes new knowledge on MLG by investigating
   the hierarchical relations among participants and how authority and
   power differentials can shape their interactions across levels.},

Abstract = {In recognition of gender inequities, more than 80 countries have applied
   a gender perspective to their budget process, initiatives referred to as
   gender-responsive budgeting (GRB). Research on GRB initiatives has
   focused on whether they reduce gender inequities. However, if it is to
   have a lasting effect, GRB must reform the budget process and become
   integral to government administrative routines. We examine the
   experiences of several countries with GRB initiatives and identify the
   key factors explaining implementation success or failure. We find that
   these factors are similar to those that explain the success of earlier
   budget reforms focused on efficiency and effectiveness. While the equity
   objective of GRB differentiates it from other budget reforms, these
   factors provide the context for understanding GRB initiatives. Although
   gender parity is just one dimension of social equity, the success of GRB
   initiatives shows that governments can use their budgets to meet social
   equity objectives.},

Abstract = {Recent health care reforms in England, combined with financial
   austerity, have accelerated both corporatization and commercialization
   in the English National Health Service (NHS) and this has encouraged
   greater public sector entrepreneurialism (PSE). We advance this argument
   by examining the meaning and experience of corporatization in this
   sector, illustrating our argument with qualitative data from a
   specialist hospital at the forefront of this trend. We demonstrate how
   the policy and practice of corporatization is entangled with increased
   commercialism and how this shapes more entrepreneurial conduct from
   staff. Framed in terms of the recursive relationship between
   organizational dynamics and individual behaviors, we focus empirically
   upon the shifting epistemic boundaries associated with increased
   corporatization, describing the dissonant effects of these shifts upon
   individuals, their attempts to compartmentalize, and the ethical
   dilemmas that result. Through this case we draw conclusions about the
   emerging impact of corporatization, commercialization, and public sector
   entrepreneurialism across public services.},

Abstract = {The partisan allocation of public funds has a long history in Australian
   politics. Using a unique dataset, which allows us to distinguish the
   merit-based component of the funding decision from the politically based
   component, we examine the 2018-2019 Australian sports grants scandal. We
   find that local funding allocations for sports infrastructure were
   directed disproportionately to win marginal electorates and to reward
   loyal supporters. However, contrary to our expectations, we find
   virtually no electoral impact of the grants: those electorates that
   received more sporting grant funding were no more likely to swing in
   favour of the government in the 2019 election than electorates that
   received no funding. A straw poll of members of the House of
   Representatives suggests one possible explanation as to why
   pork-barrelling persists: parliamentarians tend to overestimate its
   electoral impact.},

Abstract = {Why do some towns recover faster than others after intrastate conflict?
   Many important decisions about post-conflict recovery are made at the
   substate level, but little empirical work has investigated what causes
   differences in recovery outcomes within a country. This article suggests
   that proximity to ethno-religiously diverse neighbors slows a town's
   post-conflict recovery. A town has `diverse neighbors' if towns with
   different plurality ethno-religious groups are nearby. This hypothesis
   is tested by exploring variation in recovery speed among Iraqi towns
   after the 2014-17 Islamic State insurgency (ISIL). The article
   constructs 81-month panels of economic activity for 379 Iraqi
   settlements occupied by ISIL by using satellite-observed nighttime light
   emissions as a proxy for economic activity. The panels reveal large
   variation in post-conflict recovery among towns during the first year of
   peace. Village-level survey data are then used to construct a measure of
   neighbor diversity, which is combined with lighting-based recovery
   scores in spatial autoregression. The results show that greater neighbor
   diversity is robustly associated with slower settlement recovery. The
   neighbor diversity penalty cannot be fully explained by cleavages
   between groups `on opposite sides' of the conflict; proximity to
   out-group neighbors appears to slow recovery even between wartime
   allies. Several explanations are considered, and this article suggests
   that the types of post-liberation controllers that arise in diverse
   areas - which tend to be substate militias rather than the government -
   may be one important mechanism.},

Abstract = {The emerging consensus in the United States is that the real US
   objective in talks with North Korea should no longer be its
   denuclearisation. The superficially sensible conventional wisdom
   underlying this position is that Pyongyang learned from America's
   adventures in Iraq and Libya that only a nuclear deterrent precludes
   regime change, and that it would not relinquish something it worked so
   hard to attain at the negotiating table. These assumptions may still be
   wrong, and it would be a mistake to pre-emptively surrender an essential
   objective, especially given that doing so would incentivise Japan and
   South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. Washington should carefully
   explore the possibility that the North would give up its nuclear weapons
   if it could achieve political, economic and diplomatic integration into
   the international community and true normalisation of its relations with
   the US, and prepare for an arduous negotiating process.},

Abstract = {Education is widely known for its positive effect on conventional
   politics and nonviolent protest as well as its suppressive effect on
   violence. However, recent studies have connected education to violence
   through its effect on relative deprivation and frustration-aggression
   mechanisms. We address these divergent findings by presenting a theory
   of the conditional effect that education has on violence. To do so, we
   build on literature addressing education's positive association with
   political participation, such as voting and protests, and question how
   this relationship translates to contexts in which conventional and
   nonviolent channels are unlikely to be effective - specifically, in
   cases of politically excluded ethnic groups. We argue that education
   increases ethnic group members' resources and desire to address
   grievances. Yet, because the ethnic group is politically excluded,
   opportunities for conventional politics and nonviolent protest are
   limited. Educated ethnic group members are limited in political options,
   and are thus more likely to address their grievances through the support
   of rebel groups, increasing the probability of violence. Violence then
   occurs in localities where members of a politically excluded ethnic
   group are located and where those members have higher levels of
   education. Using geo-spatial data and statistical analysis, we
   demonstrate that education has divergent effects on violence in areas
   populated by politically excluded versus politically included ethnic
   groups in Africa and Central America. Areas with highly educated
   politically excluded ethnic group members are the most likely to
   experience violent events.},

Abstract = {Does war exposure increase popular support for state penetration or are
   changes in taxation and economic intervention primarily elite-driven?
   Existing research rests mainly at the macro level and is therefore
   unable to distinguish between the two mechanisms. In this paper, we
   employ a natural experiment to investigate whether direct war exposure
   affects popular preferences for state penetration in the post-war
   period. We use accidental bombardments of Swiss municipalities during
   the Second World War as treatments to examine whether popular
   preferences expressed in direct democratic votes on tax policies and
   economic intervention in war-affected municipalities followed different
   trajectories in the post-war period compared to municipalities that were
   not the target of accidental bombardments. We show that war exposure
   increased popular support for state intervention into the economy, but
   we do not find an effect of accidental bombardments on popular support
   for more progressive taxes or the extension of fiscal capacity.},

Abstract = {In the last thirty years the debate in the field of public
   administration in Latin America has focused on how to introduce reforms
   in the public sector inspired by the New Public Management. Indeed, most
   public administrations have focused almost exclusively on introducing
   such type of reforms, ignoring a number of alternatives that have
   emerged in the academic debate. One of these alternatives is the public
   service motivation approach that analyzes how certain intrinsic factors,
   directly associated with the notion of public service, motivate the
   behavior of civil servants. This article aims to foster a Latin American
   debate on how to design and implement human resource policies based on
   the theory of public service motivation. Based on a non-probabilistic
   sample with 172 responses, this work identifies a number of public
   service motivation factors among Chilean civil servants. The findings
   show that attraction to public policies, commitment to the general
   interest, and compassion are as powerful factors as love for money. At
   the same time, the results show that self-sacrifice does not motivate
   Chilean civil servants. Based on these findings, a discussion on public
   service motivation as a useful approach for redesigning human resources
   policies is presented.},

Abstract = {In 2010 the Human Rights Quarterly published findings of a 2008 study,
   revealing that victims of human trafficking are very often detained in
   public and private shelters following their trafficking experience, for
   months or even years. This article documents progress made in the decade
   since that initial study was conducted. Using desk and field-based
   research across three study countries (Malaysia, the Philippines and
   Thailand) it canvasses efforts made and challenges faced to secure free
   movement of victims. The reasons offered to rationalize the ongoing
   detention of trafficked victims in shelters are interrogated, and
   recommendations are offered towards ending that practice.},

Title = {The effects of conflict type and conflict expression intensity on
   conflict management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {245-272},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to add to the current knowledge about conflict
   management by examining the relationships between conflict type,
   conflict expression intensity and the use of the conflict management
   approach. Design/methodology/approach The authors test theory-based
   hypotheses using a field study of new product development teams in an
   interdisciplinary Masters program (Study 1) and an experimental vignette
   study (Study 2). Findings Results show that people are more likely to
   respond to task conflict and conflicts expressed with less intensity
   using collectivistic conflict management approaches (i.e.
   problem-solving, compromising and yielding), and to relationship
   conflicts and conflicts expressed with higher intensity through forcing,
   an individualistic conflict management approach. Information acquisition
   and negative emotions experienced by team members mediate these
   relationships. Practical implications Knowing how the characteristics of
   the conflict (type and expression intensity) affect conflict management,
   managers can counteract the tendency to use dysfunctional, forcing
   conflict management approaches in response to high intensity conflicts,
   as well as to relationship conflicts and support the tendency to use
   collectivistic conflict management approaches in response to low
   intensity conflict, as well as task conflicts. Originality/value The
   authors examine an alternative to the prevailing view that conflict
   management serves as a moderator of the relationship between conflict
   and team outcomes. The research shows that conflict type and intensity
   of conflict expression influence the conflict management approach as a
   result of the information and emotion they evoke. The authors open
   avenues for future research on the complex and intriguing relationships
   between conflict characteristics and the conflict management approach.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between competition and corruption
   in the presence of enhanced telecommunications infrastructure. We use
   firm-level aggregate data provided by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys
   and collected between 2006 and 2018. Our fixed-effects results are
   two-fold. First, the number of competing firms increases corruption in
   developing countries. This result is consistent with the previous
   literature on the competition-corruption nexus. Second, corruption
   decreases as the number of competing firms increases in countries with
   better information and communication technology endowment. Our results
   are robust to controlling for endogeneity via the two-step, feasible
   efficient generalized method of moments and suggest that e-governance
   may help to reduce firm-level corruption in a competitive environment.
   Given the negative impact of corruption on investment and growth,
   developing countries should aim at adopting and using more
   telecommunications infrastructure, along with the traditional approaches
   of combatting corruption that are based on enforcing rules of law or
   building stronger institutions, just to name a few, to boost investment
   and economic growth.},

Abstract = {How does the receipt of remittances shape recipients' attitudes towards
   taxation? We argue that remittances are likely to reduce support for the
   fiscal contract of taxes in exchange for public services because
   recipients rely less on the national economy and the state for their
   well-being. Remittance recipients can use the money sent by friends or
   family overseas to obtain public services in the private market instead
   of, or in addition to, tax-funded welfare services. In doing so,
   remittance recipients become detached from the national political
   community and develop a transactional relationship with the state
   whereby they pay licence fees, taxes and bribes to protect investment
   goods procured with remittances, making them less willing to support
   general taxation and more likely to approve of tax evasion and
   avoidance. We find strong support for our theory in analysis of survey
   data from Africa and Latin America. Our article contributes to knowledge
   of the micro-foundations of the fiscal contract and the
   political-economic effects of emigration and remittances on migrants'
   homelands.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a case study of Barnet, an outer borough of London (UK), this
   article discusses the challenges that activists face in making sense of
   local government in the neoliberal era. With the aim of making things
   more `direct', `open', and `streamlined,' the borough's council decided
   in 2008 to outsource the bulk of its services in two large contracts to
   the professional service firm Capita Plc. However, contrary to the image
   of institutional transparency presented, this article demonstrates that
   the large-scale outsourcing of services has contributed to the emergence
   of complex contractualized governance arrangements that raise new
   problems of legibility. Drawing from the methodological insights of
   Institutional Ethnography, I investigate how generating knowledge about
   such arrangements has posed a problem for local residents and community
   groups who have sought to understand the relationships under which their
   services are designed, financed, and delivered. Through infrastructures
   of dissent, I explore how local residents have developed strategies for
   investigating service arrangements, interrogating claims to value and
   efficiency, and exposing institutional blindspots in service provision.
   The article concludes by discussing the epistemological problems posed
   by neoliberal governance arrangements today, and how they raise
   challenges for those who confront them.},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: I present in this work some political and epistemic
   contributions of Jose Carlos Mariategui to construct Latin American
   knowledge that contributes to the conformation of theories configured
   from the popular praxis of struggle for life, especially the indigenous
   one. Methodology: Based on the bibliographic analysis of this author and
   authors who work on Mariategui, I seek to point out key elements of
   fruitful concepts by this author: heroic creation, Indo-American
   socialism, elements of practical socialism. I analyze the meaning of
   heroic creativity first and then its foundation in popular praxis,
   mainly indigenous. Conclusion: I dedicate a final section to some
   challenges for reflecting on Marxism from our popular realities and
   worldviews. Originality: I conclude by highlighting, from Amauta's
   contribution, the importance of the Marxist contribution in the
   construction of revolutionary knowledge in our region, understanding it
   as necessary but not sufficient for this task.},

Abstract = {In the context of international water catchment areas and their relation
   of co-dependency and negotiation on the border between Mexico and the
   United States, water resource management and distribution is a
   fundamental part of the social construction of space. The proposal to
   open a brew- cry with U.S. capital has given rise to a significant
   protest movement. Following a consultation that resulted in a rejection
   of the project, the situation has been framed as part of a federal
   government policy hostile to investment. However, the process is more
   complex, and observing it from the perspective of the relationship
   between the international water catchment area and the region helps to
   understand the impact of a relationship built up over a long period.},

   sources upon which they rely. To address these challenges, and to
   increase the diversity of available human rights measures more
   generally, this study provides the first quantitative effort to measure
   human rights abuses from textual records of citizen-government
   interactions. Using a dataset encompassing over 1.5 million
   access-to-information (ATI) requests made to the Mexican federal
   government from June 2003 onward, supervised classification is used to
   identify the subset of these requests that pertain to human rights
   abuses of various types. The results from this supervised machine
   learning exercise are validated against (i) gold standard ATI requests
   pertaining to past human rights abuses in Mexico and (ii) several
   accepted external measures of sub-national and sub-annual human rights
   abuses. In doing so, we demonstrate that the measurement of human rights
   abuses from citizen-submitted ATI request texts can provide measures of
   human rights abuse that exhibit both high validity and notable
   spatio-temporal specificity, relative to existent human rights datasets
   and variables.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine how and when task and process
   conflicts relate to relationship conflict by detailing the mediating
   role of negative emotions and the moderating effect of emotional
   intelligence. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected
   from 462 employees working in different organizations in Pakistan.
   Findings The results revealed that individuals engaged in task and
   process conflicts are more likely to feel negative emotions toward
   others and consequently are more likely to engage in relationship
   conflict in the workplace. This mediated relationship of task and
   process conflicts with relationship conflict via negative emotions is
   lower when employees are more emotionally intelligent. Practical
   implications This study pinpointed a key mechanism, negative emotions,
   by which task and process conflicts lead to relationship conflict.
   Emotionally intelligent individuals are better at regulating their
   negative emotions; therefore, emotional intelligence training can be an
   effective tool for minimizing employees' negative emotions during task
   and process conflicts, which can help reduce relationship conflict.
   Originality/value By examining the mediating role of negative emotions
   and the moderating effect of emotional intelligence, this study adds to
   the previous research by detailing how and when task and process
   conflicts lead to relationship conflict.},

Abstract = {Social movements often become spaces for learning, although this type of
   learning has been overlooked by activists and scholars alike. Analysing
   the case of the collapsed Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF), the article
   submits that the APF was not only an organisation that challenged
   privatisation, but also a learning space for activists from middle-class
   and working-class backgrounds. Non-formal educational platforms, such as
   political education workshops, organisational and practical skill
   training sessions, and campaigns, organised by the APF and its partner
   organisations, were instrumental in transferring skills to
   community-based activists. After the demise of the APF, its activists
   applied the skills and competences they had acquired to continue
   advancing social and economic justice in other organisations.
   Furthermore, community-based activists educated middle-class activists
   about the conditions of working-class communities and the challenges of
   building working-class movements in post-apartheid South Africa.},

Abstract = {Who bears responsibility when social media platforms are used to incite
   genocide? Although courts and scholarship have recognized the role of
   mass media in past mass atrocities, social media poses a unique
   challenge. Its transnational nature, with companies and infrastructure
   often located in different jurisdictions from where the crimes are
   committed, makes determining responsibility challenging. This article
   argues that the prohibition of genocide obligates home states-those in
   which companies are headquartered-to act in such cases. In particular,
   home states may be obligated to restrict social media access in the
   state in question and are permitted to do so under the laws of state
   responsibility. Finally, the article discusses how possible domestic or
   international arrangements may be used to realize these obligations and
   the relative merits of each. A discussion of Myanmar demonstrates how
   these domestic and international options may function and emphasizes the
   urgency of the question.},

Abstract = {In Nigeria, the threat posed by climate change is leading policymakers
   and the media to frame climate change as a security threat that warrants
   support for adaptive actions. We draw upon securitization theory to
   examine how security narratives affect climate change adaptation. Using
   primary and secondary data, we find that although securitization
   arguments are easily identified in climate change policies and action
   plans in Nigeria, the implications of securitization for adaptation
   policy and practice are harder to discern. We find that adaptation is
   not as urgent a policy as would be expected from the logic of
   securitization. The transformation of security framing into urgent
   adaptation actions appears difficult because there are no urgent
   adaptation measures. We also find that people's level of vulnerability
   and adaptation to climate change is a function of deeper socio-political
   dynamics and processes that defy the political theatre of
   securitization.},

Abstract = {The special relationship between the United States and Israel has been
   built on three pillars: shared strategic interests, the resonance of
   Israel in American political culture and the influence of the pro-Israel
   lobby. While the strategic pillar has been the most controversial, as
   many in Washington have viewed Israel as a strategic liability, the
   dramatic improvement in relations between Israel and America's Gulf Arab
   partners has diminished this concern. But the once strong cultural and
   domestic political pillars are now under strain. In the wake of a sharp
   decline in sympathy for Israel within the Democratic Party, bipartisan
   support for Israel is now in doubt. The new Israeli government has the
   potential to arrest and reverse this decline. Without progress towards a
   two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, however, the
   challenge will remain.},

Abstract = {The contributions to this Forum on Ritual and Authority in World
   Politics examine the role that ritual performances play in the
   constitution of positions of authority and the maintenance of relations
   of authority in historical and contemporary international relations. The
   Forum takes as its point of departure three related observations: (i)
   that recent years have witnessed a remarkable upsurge of interest in
   ritual as a recurring feature of international practice, but (ii) that
   this recent interest in ritual has not extended, thus far, to the study
   of international authority, (iii) in spite of political anthropologists'
   long-standing claim that the performance of ritual is absolutely crucial
   to the production of authority. The performance of ritual grounds, makes
   tangible and enhances various forms of authority, including forms of
   international authority, historical and contemporary. The contributions
   to this Forum demonstrate the veracity of that claim in five different
   empirical contexts-Byzantine diplomacy, early modern cross-cultural
   encounters, British imperialism in India, military lawyering in
   America's armed forces, and the casting of ballots in Crimea and the
   US-and attempt also to explain precisely how it is that ritual served to
   undergird and stabilise authority in these various instances.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on elite purges in dictatorships claims that the
   risk of coups to replace dictators is the main cause of the dictator's
   choice of purge strategy. Why then do elite purges occur even in
   well-established dictatorships with a consistently low risk of coups?
   This article argues that elite purges in consolidated dictatorships have
   a different purpose and logic. Dictators, who have consolidated their
   position, seek to maximize the efficiency of rule by making the elite
   obedient through purges. For this purpose, dictators carefully select
   the purge target by considering various factors. To test this theory,
   the article examines the pattern of elite purges in North Korea based on
   an original individual-level dataset, which contains the personal
   background of 367 North Korean elites and their purge records between
   1948 and 2019. The result of survival analysis shows that the purge risk
   of the elite is not significantly associated with their military
   background but is associated with the characteristics of the institution
   to which the individual elite member belongs. Other individual factors,
   including the elite's educational background, the experience of studying
   abroad, and the career path, are also significantly related to the
   probability of being purged. The finding suggests that coup-proofing is
   not the only purpose of elite purges but that ensuring the leader's
   political superiority is another purpose of elite purges in consolidated
   dictatorships.},

Abstract = {A puzzle of BRICS is why countries such as India and China work together
   within the group despite facing consistently difficult bilateral border
   tensions. This contribution argues that the multilateral logic of BRICS
   gives its members a chance to cooperate. As emerging powers, BRICS
   members need to adopt a collective approach to enhance their voices in
   the global governance system. Existing evidence shows that China and
   India have managed to separate their bilateral frictions from their
   collective actions within BRICS. This contribution examines the stakes
   of China and India's BRICS engagement. Since China and India are the
   most promising emerging powers in global governance, their partnership
   will determine the BRICS' depth and the length. Since China has dealt
   with the pandemic better than other BRICS members, it has become
   stronger which might increase the disparity of power within BRICS.
   Following the multilateral logic it may help India to cooperate with a
   stronger China in the post-COVID-19 era.},

Abstract = {This article discusses whether BRICS, a leading global governance
   mechanism, can revive multilateralism, international law and interstate
   cooperation while providing stability at the global, regional and
   bilateral level. BRICS has created opportunities for addressing three
   core themes: politics and security; economics and finance; and
   humanitarian cooperation. It has evolved into an entity of like-mined
   countries, which connects people through vertical and horizontal ties,
   delivers impactful projects and builds friendships. BRICS
   interconnectedness keeps the group intact from issues such as
   China-India border conflict that could potentially disrupt BRICS unity.
   Moreover, the group was not designed to serve as a mediating body and
   clearly avoids being drawn into internal BRICS conflicts. To reach its
   full potential, BRICS must continue to expand the scale of cooperation
   in mutually beneficial issue areas and serve as a platform for
   cooperative projects for its citizens.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes attempt to control the circulation of political
   information. Scholars have identified many mechanisms through which
   actors can use broadcast and digital media to challenge or sustain
   authoritarian rule. However, while contemporary media environments are
   characterised by the integration of older and newer forms of
   communication, little is known about how authoritarian regimes use
   different media simultaneously to shape citizens' perceptions. In order
   to address this issue, this study relies on focus groups and
   investigates Russian TV viewers' cross-media repertoires and their
   reception of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It argues that some citizens
   evaluate state-aligned television narratives as more credible when they
   are reinforced by similar narratives in digital media. Citizens'
   reactions to this synchronisation are predicated on their type of media
   use. For not very active news consumers, the reliance on digital media
   can verify the regime's narratives in television news. Others can escape
   the synchronisation effect by actively searching online for additional
   information or not using digital media for news. These findings show how
   authoritarian regimes can utilise the advantages of hybrid media systems
   to shape citizens' perceptions and specify the conditions under which
   citizens can escape the effects of the regime's simultaneous use of
   different media.},

Abstract = {Wage regulation in South Africa's clothing industry has pushed low-wage
   producers to restructure themselves as partnerships between former
   employers, now intermediaries, and worker cooperatives. The
   proliferation of employer-initiated cooperatives in the clothing sector
   reflects and poses challenges to South Africa's system of
   industrial-level bargaining, to unionisation, and to the government's
   unevenly implemented strategy of using minimum wages to force
   enterprises to `upgrade' and become less labour intensive. Through
   circumventing wage regulation and institutionalising a less adversarial
   approach to the management of labour, worker cooperatives represent a
   model for low-wage labour-intensive manufacturing that disrupts
   government rhetoric and policymaking.},

Abstract = {The Sino-U.S. relations tumbled during the Trump Administration. The
   talk of decoupling permeated the decision-making circle in Washington
   D.C. Many factors have contributed to the free fall. The roles Congress
   has played are undoubtedly one of them. Based on the new
   institutionalist approach, this study provides three analyses of recent
   China-related legislative activities. First, the historical analysis of
   legislative data illustrates a surge in congressional activism on
   China-related legislative activities. Second, the content analysis
   reveals some of the triggers in the deterioration of bilateral relations
   in recent years. Third, the political analysis of the critical
   congressional players and the structures and procedures Congress created
   provides some insight into the domestic and political logic of the
   congressional crusade against China. Finally, the paper ends with
   assessing the impact of the surge in Congressional activism on the new
   Biden Administration.},

Abstract = {Few public policies have been as consequential or divisive as
   affirmative action. Proponents have argued for the need for equity and
   the redress of past and present discrimination, whereas opponents enlist
   claims over individual liberty and merit. Scholars have examined support
   to affirmative action, asking to what extent citizens' support is shaped
   by their political ideology, interest, prejudice, or some combination
   thereof. Much work to date has focused on the United States, where
   disentangling theoretical explanations has proved challenging. We turn
   our attention to an understudied but important case: Brazil. Brazil has
   implemented a broad form of affirmative action for admission to federal
   universities that include consideration of the applicant's education,
   income, and race. Adopting both a conventional question and a list
   experiment embedded in a face-to-face survey among a nationally
   representative sample of adult Brazilians, we find that public support
   for affirmative action suffers from social desirability bias, and in our
   subsequent regression analysis, that attitudes about affirmative action
   are structured especially by individuals' interests.},

Title = {Polarized we trade? Intraparty polarization and US trade policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {Research indicates that polarization has led to an increasing dispersion
   between moderate and more extreme voters within both parties. Intraparty
   polarization supposedly affects the nature of interparty competition as
   it creates political space for new political realignments and the rise
   of anti-establishment candidates. This article examines the extent and
   impact of intraparty polarization in Congress on US trade policy.
   Specifically, the article examines whether (and which) trade policy
   preferences are distributed within and between both parties, as well as
   how intraparty polarization has influenced the outcome of US trade
   negotiations. It is theorized that intraparty polarization causes
   crosscutting legislative coalitions around specific trade policies and
   political realignments around ideological factions, with consequences
   for the outcome of trade negotiations. By relying on a unique dataset of
   congressional letters and co-sponsorship legislation, the article first
   derives trade policy preferences from members of Congress and computes
   their ideological means. Two contemporary cases of US trade policy are
   examined: The Transpacific Partnership Agreement and the
   US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Via a structured-focused comparison of both
   cases, the paper finally assesses under which combinations of
   preference-based and ideology-based intraparty polarization Congress
   manages to ratify trade agreements. Findings suggest that both parties
   are intrinsically polarized between free trade and fair trade
   preferences yet show variance in their degree of ideology-based
   intraparty polarization. These findings contribute to existing work on
   bipartisanship as well as factions in the foreign policy realm, as it
   shows under which circumstances legislators can build crosscutting
   coalitions around foreign policies.},

Abstract = {On 1 December 2016, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon apologized for
   the cholera epidemic in Haiti, an illness Nepalese peacekeepers brought
   with them upon arrival in Haiti. After years of silence and denial from
   the UN, the UN finally established a ``New Approach to Cholera in
   Haiti,{''} promising material assistance and support to the victims
   through a ``victim-centered approach.{''} Based on fieldwork conducted
   in March 2017 in the communities most affected by the cholera outbreak,
   this article brings forward the victims' views on the specific form the
   material assistance package should take. This article links this
   discussion with the literature on socioeconomic dimension of reparation
   in transitional justice, discussing the collective and the individual
   approaches to reparation and the victims' preference for the latter.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Abstract = {The necessity for public sector actors to manage multiple
   accountabilities in their work has been linked to a number of problems
   and failures, yet we lack an understanding of how multiple
   accountabilities affect the decision-making behavior of civil servants.
   Here we argue that the main issue is not only the existence of multiple
   forums as such but the presence of conflicting demands between multiple
   forums or within a single forum. Drawing on sociopsychological research,
   we develop hypotheses regarding two types of behavioral strategies
   (high-effort and low-effort) to cope with accountability pressures. We
   test this using a realistic vignette experiment on a sample of 270 Dutch
   regulators. Results show that both the multiplicity of forums and the
   conflict of demands affect the likelihood that regulators seek help and
   procrastinate. The main issue is the conflicting demands that have a
   stronger effect on behavior than forum multiplicity.},

Title = {Building empires litorally in the South China Sea: artificial islands
   and contesting definitions of imperialism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {687-706},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As scholars interested in theories of empire our investigation focuses
   on the physical construction of islands as a means, both literally and
   litorally, of empire-building. In traditional academic discourse on
   imperialism, empires are often described as large states invading
   foreign territory. The presumption is that this territory exists and is
   ready to be occupied. Our work instead examines the possibility of
   states physically creating new territory in order to establish or expand
   their empires. We focus upon an initiative by China, the world's most
   populous country and a growing super-power ``seeking a regional and
   global role{''} (Mitter in modern China: a very short introduction. OUP:
   2008: 2), to develop a land reclamation campaign for the construction of
   ``massive air bases{''} (Hayton 2016) on at least seven previously
   uninhabited rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands in the South China
   Sea.},

Title = {The rhetoric of inaction: failing to fail forward in the EU's rule of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1611-1629},

Abstract = {In the EU, political crises often serve as catalysts for policymaking
   and `failing forward'. Yet as a breakdown of the rule of law has swept
   some member states, EU institutions have repeatedly failed to react. We
   argue that this outcome is partly tied to how political elites
   strategically mobilize rhetoric to legitimate stasis during crises.
   Building on theories of rhetorical action and discursive
   institutionalism, we rectify their bias for change and draw on Albert
   Hirschman's work to theorize `rhetorics of inaction': A coordinative
   discourse wielded by national and supranational actors to reconcile
   divergent preferences and justify stasis by appealing to the very
   policies and values threatened by crisis. We specify the conditions
   under which rhetorics of inaction are most likely to pervade EU
   policymaking and illustrate the theory's explanatory purchase in a case
   study of the EU's (non-)responses to the constitutional breakdowns of
   Hungary and Poland. By tracing the discursive interactions between EU
   and government policymakers, we demonstrate that populist and partisan
   affronts on the EU conceal far more sophisticated and obstructive
   argumentative strategies behind-the-scenes. We conclude that rhetorical
   politics are central to understanding the EU's failure to respond to
   crises and elaborate avenues for future research.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Volume = {120},
Number = {480},
Pages = {391-415},

Abstract = {Urban renewal is central to `world-class' city aspirations on the
   African continent: demolitions and evictions exemplify the power of the
   state to restructure urban space, prioritizing elite forms of
   accumulation and enforcing aesthetic norms of cleanliness, order and
   modernity. The ubiquity of world-class city-making has been taken by
   urban studies scholars as evidence of African leaders' converging on a
   unitary aspirational urban imaginary. This article contends that the
   concept of world class should instead be understood as a key terrain on
   which African governments' distinctive and diverse ideational ambitions
   are expressed. In Oyo State, southwest Nigeria, vernacular political
   traditions-in this case Yoruba cultural nationalism centred on the ideas
   of Obafemi Awolowo-were deployed by the state governor to legitimize
   urban renewal. Drawing on the Yoruba notion that elitism can be
   `generalized', the cultivation of globalized urban forms was not only a
   project of becoming ever more homogenously `international' but a
   historically grounded aspiration to become ever more essentially Yoruba.
   Thus, beyond commonalities across the discourses used to legitimize
   neoliberal urban development-world class, international and global-these
   universal sounding imaginaries may at the same time express much more
   particularistic political projects.},

Abstract = {Despite great interest in the importance of ``narrative{''} to the
   global jihadi movement, research on actual examples of jihadi
   storytelling has been very limited to date. In this paper, I discuss the
   phenomenon of jihadi storytelling, specifically in digital contexts,
   focusing on the case study of one storyteller in particular: ``Najm
   al-Din Azad{''}, a Saudi jihadist who tweeted and blogged a collection
   of ``Tales of the Heroism of the Mujahidin{''} while participating in
   the Syrian civil war.},

Title = {Accountability and Affective Styles in Administrative Reporting: The
   Case of UNRWA, 1951-2020},

Abstract = {This contribution theorizes on the emergence of affective styles in the
   accountability reporting of public agencies. Under conditions of
   multiple accountability towards heterogeneous stakeholders, public
   agencies are expected to make increased use of sentiment in their
   reporting. Agencies' differentiated modulation of positive and negative
   sentiment results in four ideal-typical affective styles: technocratic,
   political, alarming, and self-praising. The plausibility of this
   framework is demonstrated for the case of a major international public
   agency, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
   Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which serves several million
   Palestine refugees. We conduct a dictionary-based sentiment analysis of
   UNRWA annual reports published between 1951 and 2020, a corpus of 1.47
   million words. Additional evidence from interviews with UNRWA officials
   and diplomats is also considered. Over time, the agency's use of
   sentiment has increased in response to diversifying stakeholders and its
   affective style of reporting has changed repeatedly. Contrary to
   established theoretical expectations, multiple accountability not only
   increases positive reporting and self-praise. Rather, with increasing
   levels of negativity, the alarming and political styles of communication
   have played a much stronger role. These findings demonstrate that
   agencies' chief goal in accountability reporting is not simply to elicit
   positive assessments from their respective accountability forums through
   self-praising language. Agencies may also aim to achieve ``negativity
   congruence{''} with accountability forums by increasing negative
   sentiment, thus compelling stakeholders to acknowledge the operational
   challenges agencies face.},

Title = {Defending Civic Space: Successful Resistance Against NGO Laws in Kenya

Abstract = {Since the turn of the century, an increasing number of governments
   around the world has introduced or tightened restrictions on civil
   society organizations (CSOs). Attempts by local CSOs and external actors
   to counter this trend of shrinking civic spaces have been mostly
   unsuccessful. In a few notable cases, however, civic space restrictions
   have been reversed or even prevented from being adopted in the first
   place. Focusing on resistance to so-called NGO laws, this paper explores
   the strategies, causal mechanisms and scope conditions that help explain
   the successful defense of civic space. In a first step, the paper
   develops a theoretical framework by drawing on research on the diffusion
   and promotion of international norms, civic resistance and social
   movements. Second, it looks at two cases - Kenya (2013) and Kyrgyzstan
   (2013-2016) - in which governmental attempts to impose legal
   restrictions on foreign-funded NGOs were effectively aborted. The
   analysis finds that successful resistance in both cases was based on
   domestic campaigns organized by broad alliances of local CSOs, which
   were able to draw on preexisting mobilizing structures and put forward a
   socioeconomic narrative to lobby against civic space restrictions. In
   Kyrgyzstan, but not in Kenya, external actors also played a significant
   role.},

Abstract = {Mutualism is reviving again in several countries, replying to state and
   market failure with an alternative, social insurance setup. We study
   participation in such new mutuals with a focus on embeddedness. We
   distinguish group-level embeddedness (network structure) and individual
   embeddedness (the type and quantity of ties to other group members) and
   study how these relate to members' commitment to mutuals and their trust
   in the commitment of others. We show that group-level embeddedness
   primarily affects trust, while individual embeddedness more strongly
   associates with commitment. We reveal these dynamics for mutuals of
   different ages using a unique multilevel dataset on the motivations,
   beliefs and social relations of more than 5000 members of 230 small
   Dutch mutuals. Our results highlight the importance of thinking
   critically about the levels at which social embeddedness plays a role,
   as the dynamics are more subtle and not all means of embeddedness are
   equally fruitful.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 outbreaks forced governments into epic policy choices
   conciliating democratic legitimacy and science-based policies. We
   examine how pervasive crises like this pandemic shape public discourses,
   proposing two ideal-types that discourse may tend toward. One is
   pluralism, which includes authoritative voices that represent viable
   alternative policies and credible reasons for them. The opposite is
   monotony, where authoritative voices offer credible reasons for one
   policy option only. Two crucial cases for monotony are analysed, where
   news media represents public discourse. In initial COVID-19 responses,
   Denmark pursued hard lockdown while neighbouring Sweden enacted
   voluntary distancing. Pluralism in public discourses could be advantaged
   while solutions remained uncertain and social and economic disruptions
   high, in polities with mature democratic and scientific institutions.
   The empirical analyses show that Denmark's elected leaders and Sweden's
   leading health scientists publicly represented their respective national
   responses. Yet in sampled public discourses on highly disruptive
   policies on school closures and crowding limits, both leaderships
   focused on justifying national choices rather than elucidating options.
   In turn, other sources skewed toward justifications for national
   policies rather than attention to alternatives. We suggest finally that
   such skews toward discourse monotony create risks to democratic
   legitimacy and long-term response efficacy.},

Abstract = {This paper develops an analytical framework to explain how regional
   organizations engage institutional strategies in regional role location
   process. It argues that ASEAN employed institutionalization as a role
   bargaining tool in relations with China and other great powers in ASEAN
   Defense Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus) between 2007 and 2019. The
   shifts in ASEAN approach to institutionalization were triggered by
   modifications in China's role claims, yet the choice of particular
   institutional responses reflected ASEAN's own role conception and
   expectations for appropriate role enactment for itself and for China. By
   manipulating the institutional processes of ADMM Plus ASEAN successfully
   sustained its foreign policy roles as a `central actor' and `security
   promoter' as well as discouraged China from consolidating the
   undesirable for ASEAN role of regional `co-leader' within ADMM Plus.},

Abstract = {Explaining the transformation of the state and the dynamics of
   democratic governance is a focal topic of scholarship. A key component
   is depoliticization research, which considers depoliticization to be the
   key element in the logic of delegation among many polities, and uses it
   as an analytical tool to examine the nature of `anti-politics,'
   particularly within liberal democracies. Despite this, it has not been
   used to explain political change in Japan, an enormous industrial power
   and liberal democracy. This article redresses the issue by incorporating
   the country's international relations into the analysis. By employing a
   multi-level analysis of depoliticization in Japan, the article builds
   abridge between both research fields, depoliticization research and
   international relations theory, and contributes an innovate approach to
   depoliticization which provides a means to implement a deeper policy
   analysis and interpretation of the changes in Japanese governance and

Title = {COVID-19: A Political Virus? VOX's Populist Discourse in Times of Crisis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Spain has been one of the hardest hit countries by the COVID-19
   pandemic, and this crisis presented a window of opportunity for VOX, as
   it has for other far right parties, to raise its visibility as
   opposition force. This paper investigates whether the discourse of VOX
   has evolved during the pandemic and affected the political dynamics in
   Spain. This article proposes a new multidimensional strategy to measure
   the degree of populism in political communications, via quantitative and
   qualitative content analysis. It dissects the parliamentary speeches of
   the leader of VOX, Santiago Abascal, in the debates for the approval and
   extension of the ``state of alarm{''} to fight against COVID-19 between
   March and June 2020. In order to assess the changes and relative
   intensity of populist features in Abascal's parliamentary speeches we
   compared them with his speech during Pedro Sanchez's investiture session
   as the Spanish President of the Government, in January 2020, and VOX's
   latest political manifestos-2019 European and Spanish General
   Elections-, as well as with speeches of the representatives of the five
   main parties and coalitions during the COVID-19 debates in the Spanish
   Congress.Our paper shows that populists' discourses are
   context-dependent and that their performances are not only shaped by
   crisis but also constitutive of crisis. The density of populist
   references in Abascal's speeches grew steadily during the period
   analysed. Morality and antagonism overshadowed sovereignty and society
   as key populist attributes, and the tone of the discourse became
   increasingly hyperbolic. Moreover, Abascal's discursive performances had
   a sort of contagion effect in other parties in the parliamentary
   sessions studied. People's Party (Partido Popular-PP) leader Pablo
   Casado chose to follow VOX and harshly criticized the government,
   meanwhile the discourses of the speakers of Together We Can (Unidas
   Podemos-UP) and Catalan Republican Left (Esquerra Republicana de
   Catalunya-ERC), adopted a demonizing rhetoric against VOX and PP also
   grounded on a populist logic of articulation. This polarizing dynamic
   between competing Manichean discourses contributed to reinforce the
   sense of crisis by adding a political dimension to the already existing
   health and economic problems.},

Abstract = {Although 1980s popular feminisms were crucially concerned with the
   (gendered) class interests of women from the popular sectors, the
   concerns of racialized women were generally obscured. In the context of
   the new millennium, contemporary forms of self-identified popular
   feminisms such as the World March of Women are broader, cross-class, and
   multiscale coalitions that create new challenges for representation in
   decision-making beyond the local. These contemporary coalitions also aim
   for greater systemic change, explicitly embracing anticapitalism and
   feminism, but have generally maintained the primary gender-class focus
   of earlier popular feminisms, hindering their attention to antiracism
   and sexual identities. Embora os feminismos populares da decada de 1980
   estivessem extremamente preocupados com os interesses de classe (de
   genero) das mulheres dos setores populares, as preocupacoes das mulheres
   racializadas eram geralmente ofuscadas. No contexto do novo milenio, as
   formas contemporaneas de feminismos populares auto identificados, como a
   Marcha Mundial das Mulheres, sao coalizoes mais amplas, entre classes e
   multiescala, que criam novos desafios para a representacao no processo
   de tomada de decisoes alem do local. Essas coalizoes contemporaneas tem
   tambem como objetivo uma maior mudanca sistemica, abracando
   explicitamente o anticapitalismo e feminismo, mas de uma forma geral,
   mantiveram como foco primario os feminismos populares de genero e classe
   anteriores que impediram a devida atencao no que se refere ao
   antirracismo e identidades sexuais.},

Abstract = {The Earth's orbital space is increasingly threatened by debris. It is
   frequently described as a common-pool resource vulnerable to a `tragedy
   of the commons' scenario. Scholars have suggested ambitious policy
   proposals to tackle the tragedy of space debris and assure the
   sustainability of the Earth's orbits. Their proposals can be classified
   into three categories: hierarchical regulations, economic incentives and
   property rights. All three categories require some form of central
   coordination. However, there might be an alternative approach to the
   problem and other potential solutions. Elinor Ostrom suggested that
   decentralized, polycentric systems are appropriate for governing
   common-pool resources. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a polycentric
   form of governance can encourage a more sustainable use of the Earth's
   orbits.},

Title = {Modi looks West? Assessing change and continuity in India's Middle East
   policy since 2014},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {59},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Various observers have emphasized a recalibration of India's stance
   towards the Middle East under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These
   accounts have generally highlighted Modi's public overtures toward
   Israel, including an unprecedented 2017 visit, as public signs of a
   break with India's traditional pro-Arab and pro-Palestine approach.
   Others have interpreted Modi's successive visits to the United Arab
   Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, and Oman as indicators of a new
   outreach to all relevant actors in the region. However, has this
   diplomatic balancing among regional stakeholders signalled a substantial
   foreign policy change? Can this apparent policy shift be attributed to
   the personal preferences of Modi? Or Can India's fluctuating Middle-East
   policy be explained by a wider number of fluid international and
   regional opportunities and constraints? Alternatively, can factors such
   as ideological and religious politics at the national and regional
   levels also help account for changes (or the absence thereof) in India's
   Middle-East policy? Building on foreign policy scholarship, this paper
   offers to derive theoretical understandings and expectations about
   Modi's role in (re)shaping this regional policy in order to
   problematizes the conventional understanding of Modi's engagement with
   the Middle East as a sign of substantial foreign policy change.},

Title = {Why National Ministries Consider the Policy Advice of International
   Bureaucracies: Survey Evidence from 106 Countries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scholars of international relations and public administration widely
   assume that international bureaucracies, in their role as policy
   advisors, directly influence countries' domestic policies. Yet, this is
   not true across the board. Why do some countries closely consider the
   advice of international bureaucracies while others do not? This article
   argues that international bureaucracies' standing as sources of
   expertise is crucial. We tested this argument using data from a unique
   survey that measured prevalent practices of advice utilization in
   thematically specialized policy units of national ministries in a
   representative sample of more than a hundred countries. Our findings
   show that ministries' perceptions of international bureaucracies'
   expertise, that is, specialized and reliable knowledge, are the key
   factor. International bureaucracies influence national ministries
   directly and without the support of other actors that may also have an
   interest in the international bureaucracies' policy advice. Our analysis
   also demonstrates that the effects of alternative means of influence,
   such as third-party pressure and coercion, are themselves partly
   dependent on international bureaucracies' reputation as experts. The
   findings presented in this article reinforce the emphasis on expertise
   as a source of international bureaucracies' influence, and provide a
   crucial test of its importance.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the societal cracks resulting from decade-long neoliberal policies
   becoming increasingly visible in many countries, capitalism as the most
   suitable institutional system to produce material wealth, environmental
   sustainability and social stability has come under growing attack. This
   contribution examines what the growing army of recent heterodox scholars
   in economics and business have to say on what one could call `inclusive
   capitalism'. This concerns both the flaws in current capitalist systems
   and the behavioral assumptions that underpin it, as well as the possible
   institutional fixes they propose. I first sketch the background of the
   crisis surrounding capitalism, delve into its conceptual foundations and
   offer a working definition. I subsequently examine what social and
   environmental inclusion refer to and use Kate Raworth's
   conceptualization of the doughnut economy as a point of departure to
   explore what `inclusive capitalism' may imply. I also identify
   requirements for its implementation in institutional practices. It
   appears that `purpose' rather than utility maximization or profit
   maximization is what novel economists and business scholars perceive as
   the key driver in `stakeholder-oriented capitalism' or the `economics of
   mutuality'. Their claim is that at the end of the day this is not only a
   moral imperative for companies but also more beneficial for them in
   terms of long-term profitability. Moreover, they see a far more
   important role for government in shaping markets and leading the way
   into a more inclusive future than it is currently fulfilling. I argue
   that it is time for scholars in the field of public policy to take heed
   of these new theoretical developments in neighboring disciplines and
   respond to them.},

Abstract = {Global governance is transnationally administered. Today, global
   governance is no longer dominated by just states or even international
   organizations. It is an increasingly populated arena in which multiple
   actors have global policy power and transnational administrative
   influence. Each impacts a nation-state's assumed administrative
   sovereignty. Global policy and its transnational administration may be
   decentralized, devolved, dispersed, and/or delegated away from exclusive
   state control. This reconfiguration of administrative sovereignty is
   explored via five case studies: Convention on International Trade of
   Endangered Species, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
   Numbers, the Inspection Panel of the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda
   Gates Foundation, and the World Social Forum. The resulting heuristic
   showcases a diversity of transnational administrative acts, articulates
   their ``institutional center{''}, and provides opportunities for further
   public administration research.},

Title = {Sanctions and Third-party Compliance with US Foreign Policy Preferences:
   An Analysis of Dual-use Trade},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1820-1846},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ostensibly bilateral US foreign policy actions, such as sanctions, can
   influence third-party compliance with US policy preferences. US
   sanctions simultaneously signal US preferences and demonstrate leverage,
   which can motivate third parties to avoid or change proscribed behavior
   proactively. Empirical testing of this strategic behavior typically is
   difficult given that it predicts non-events in a noisy signaling
   environment. However, I argue that the global trade of dual-use
   commodities-those with both civilian and military purposes-is a
   phenomenon where we can observe this process systematically. I isolate
   US sanctions that provide relevant context both by stigmatizing the
   target and signaling that third-party dual-use exports to the target
   would directly undermine US policy goals. Using newly-coded bilateral
   data spanning the post-Cold War period, I find evidence that relevant US
   sanctions are associated with lower third-party dual-use exports to
   US-sanctioned states. My findings have implications for scholars and
   policy-makers, suggesting a broad yet shrouded ability of sanctions to
   advance US foreign policy goals.},

Title = {Challenging Climate Strikers' Youthfulness: The Evolution of the
   Generational Gap in Environmental Attitudes Since 1999},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {In 2019, youth took to the street to express their fears and ambitions
   in relation to climate change. Alongside, many adult and senior citizens
   expressed their solidarity. While the media present environmental issues
   as being generationally dividing, we know little about potential
   differences between generations in terms of environmental attitudes. In
   this paper, we analyze data collected in the framework of street
   demonstrations in Switzerland and longitudinal data collected in the
   Swiss population. Our analyses of survey data on climate strike
   demonstrators in Switzerland show that while the early demonstrations
   attracted mostly youth, the age composition of climate strike
   demonstrators became more diverse over time increasingly including
   members of different generations. Furthermore, we explore how age
   differences evolved over the last 20 years using the Swiss Household
   Panel data. Our analyses show that the share of individuals who favor
   the environment over the economy is greater among younger generations
   and that the climate strike generation stands out with the largest share
   of pro-environmental attitudes. However, all generations have moved in
   parallel over the last twenty years following a non-linear but generally
   upward trend illustrating that the political context affects all
   generations. Overall, our analyses contribute to understanding
   incremental changes in public attitudes in the environmental area and
   the role played by generational renewal in these regards.},

Abstract = {President Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in
   2013. In total capital, China is now the largest investor in
   least-developed countries and in developing Asia, and the fifth-largest
   investor in Africa. Motivated by concerns about the climate change
   consequences of China's overseas investments, this paper identifies and
   evaluates Chinese policies governing China's overseas investments and
   analyzes how those policies influence environmental outcomes in
   recipient countries. Policies governing domestic investments are
   analyzed in order to clarify inconsistencies between domestic and
   overseas policies. Key findings are that the Chinese government's
   environmental policies governing domestic investments are more stringent
   than those governing overseas investments. Chinese environmental
   overseas investment policies are mostly voluntary in nature so long as
   firms comply with host country regulations. Disclosure and transparency
   of information about China's investments is opaque. Even if there is a
   failure to comply with host country regulations, there do not appear to
   be serious enforcement consequences. Finally, China encourages overseas
   investments in clean energy as well as exploration and development of
   higher carbon industries and fails to specifically restrict or prohibit
   investment in carbon-intensive and fossil fuel industries in its
   overseas investments, revealing a discrepancy between policy for
   domestic and overseas investment.},

Title = {Examining the Left-Right Divide Through the Lens of a Global Crisis:
   Ideological Differences and Their Implications for Responses to the
   COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 disease pandemic is one of the most pressing global health
   issues of our time. Nevertheless, responses to the pandemic exhibit a
   stark ideological divide, with political conservatives (versus
   liberals/progressives) expressing less concern about the virus and less
   behavioral compliance with efforts to combat it. Drawing from decades of
   research on the psychological underpinnings of ideology, in four studies
   (total N = 4441) we examine the factors that contribute to the
   ideological gap in pandemic response-across domains including
   personality (e.g., empathic concern), attitudes (e.g., trust in
   science), information (e.g., COVID-19 knowledge), vulnerability (e.g.,
   preexisting medical conditions), demographics (e.g., education, income)
   and environment (e.g., local COVID-19 infection rates). This work
   provides insight into the most proximal drivers of this ideological
   divide and also helps fill a long-standing theoretical and empirical gap
   regarding how these various ideological differences shape responses to
   complex real-world sociopolitical events. Among our key findings are the
   central role of attitude- and belief-related factors (e.g., trust in
   science and trust in Trump)-and the relatively weaker influence of
   several domain-general personality factors (empathic concern, disgust
   sensitivity, conspiratorial ideation). We conclude by considering
   possible explanations for these findings and their broader implications
   for our understanding of political ideology.
   Evidence for Practice
   Stark ideological differences exist across a wide range of attitudinal
   and behavioral indices of pandemic response, with more conservative
   individuals reliably exhibiting less concern about the virus. These
   findings illustrate the extent to which the pandemic has become
   politicized.
   A range of factors contribute to this ideological gap in pandemic
   response, but some are substantially more important than others.
   Several factors that have received attention in public and academic
   discourse about the pandemic appear to contribute little, if at all, to
   the ideological divide. These include news following, scientific
   literacy, perceived social norms, and knowledge about the virus.
   The most critical factors appear to be trust in scientists and trust in
   Trump, which further highlights the politicization of COVID-19 and,
   importantly, the antagonistic nature of these two beliefs. Efforts to
   change and, especially, disentangle these two attitudes have the
   potential to be effective interventions.},

Abstract = {The global trading regime is characterized by the co-existence of
   bilateral and multilateral politics. In this article, we offer a
   political economy explanation for this regime complex, by tracing public
   actors' institutional choices back to political incentives for economic
   sectors and the firms active within them. First, we argue that product
   differentiation creates mixed motives on the part of firms, which in
   turn leads to a preference for the segmentation of markets, and thus
   bilateralism. Second, we contend that among these firms, multinational
   corporations (MNCs) are particularly well-positioned to exert influence
   over policy decisions in multiple international fora, both bilateral and
   multilateral. This provides incentives for multinationals to push
   governments to create and sustain regime complexes in the form of nested
   regimes. We show how these expectations are largely born out in an
   empirical test for six different economic sectors.},

Abstract = {This essay tests competing scholarly approaches to territorial
   withdrawal in two cases seldom scrutinised by theorists: the Israeli
   exits from the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon. The dominant framing of
   these cases as `unilateral' suggests Israel withdrew without bargaining
   with actors in the international system. These cases therefore
   apparently illustrate the primacy of domestic politics in facilitating
   or precluding withdrawal. Yet, this essay delineates often-overlooked
   causal paths emanating from: (1) violent Israeli bargaining with the
   enemy and (2) diplomatic Israeli bargaining with third parties. Hence,
   this essay demonstrates withdrawal is dependent on bargaining with
   external actors, even in `unilateral' cases.},

Abstract = {This paper studies frontline workers' experienced compassion towards
   clients. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, it develops a
   measurement scale for compassion towards clients. Second, it
   investigates how compassion affects frontline workers and theorizes that
   compassion may lead to burnout, partly because frontline workers believe
   that by working overtime to help clients (i.e., coping) adequate
   services can be provided. Using Structural Equation Modelling (n = 849),
   this study develops and validates a measurement scale for compassion
   towards clients with two underlying dimensions: empathic concern and
   compassionate motivation. These dimensions have opposite effects on a
   frontline worker's burnout: while compassionate motivation is negatively
   related to burnout, empathic concern is positively related to burnout
   and this effect can be explained because frontline workers work overtime
   to help clients. The implications for behavioural public policy and
   administration are discussed.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, there has been a massive increase in research
   examining terror and extremist-related violence. Few have considered the
   extent to which these same groups may engage in attacks against digital
   infrastructure and the Internet, whether through hacking or other
   methods. The absence of empirical evidence calls to question the nature
   and dynamics of cyberattacks performed by extremists and ideologically
   motivated actors. This study attempted to address this gap in the
   literature through a qualitative investigation of 26 attacks performed
   by far-left groups against targets in the UK, US, and Canada from 2000
   to 2015. This data was compared to physical attacks documented in the
   Extremist Crime Database during the same period. The findings
   demonstrated that there was an increase in cyberattacks during a period
   of decreased physical violence by far-left groups. Additionally, there
   was some parity in the targets of far-left groups on- and off-line, with
   similar motivations to cause harm to or embarrass businesses, government
   organizations, and individuals. The implications of this study for our
   understanding of terror and future research were discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {Customary institutions have taken a lead in providing justice and peace
   services following conflict in Uganda, taking on governance roles
   despite being relegated to only cultural status. This has been
   particularly prevalent in remote areas where government services are
   lacking, and where customary institutions remain both familiar and
   accessible. While this has some positive effects, it also has long term
   negative normative and political implications, which may contribute to
   uneven service delivery, increasing fragmentation of the state and
   impunity from the state's responsibility to address serious crimes. This
   paper considers the role of customary institutions in delivering peace
   and justice in the aftermath of small-scale conflict. It argues that
   indigenous institutions can be enablers of impunity and that there is a
   need for a more inclusive and integrated framework in which the state
   works with indigenous structures to ensure service gaps are filled in a
   cohesive and sustainable manner.},

Abstract = {This article examines how Tunisian CSOs positioned themselves vis-a-vis
   the State and each other on transitional justice (TJ) since 2011. CSOs
   are divided over religion, their status under Ben Ali, TJ preferences,
   geographical location, and their access to and willingness to engage
   international experts and donors. In a country with a strong State,
   rather than `letting the state off the hook', CSOs engage in creative
   protagonism to pressure the State to deliver on justice and compete over
   control of the State to achieve their policy goals. Groups that
   represent secular, youth perspectives outside of Tunis, in particular,
   feel excluded. Nonetheless, having failed to coopt the State, most CSOs
   continue to desire government-led action on TJ. Theoretically, the
   article calls for a more thoughtful dissection of the CSO category and a
   questioning of the divide between CSOs and the State that existing
   research often at least implicitly assumes to exist.},

Abstract = {WTO jurisprudence on what constitutes a `public body' has provoked one
   of the most controversial debates on the legitimacy and integrity of the
   WTO dispute settlement system and the WTO in general. Dispute settlement
   panels and the Appellate Body disagree on the interpretation and
   application of the public body concept, especially when applied to
   Chinese SOEs. In fact, the interpretation of `public body' in the WTO
   Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures tackles a more
   fundamental question of whether the WTO system can handle the state
   capitalism of China and other non-market economies within the framework
   of global trade rules that are primarily designed to deal with free
   market economies. The fate of the WTO system critically hinges on how
   legal interpretation of `public body' can address structural differences
   of members' economic systems. Addressing this challenge requires WTO
   members to implement long overdue legal and institutional reforms.},

Abstract = {Autonomy arrangements short of secession have been popular among
   international actors as a solution to deadly self-determination
   conflicts. However, the number of peace agreements incorporating
   autonomy, while clearly eliminating the possibility of secession, is
   limited in practice. According to the literature, this is because: (1)
   ethnic rebels are too weak militarily to extract substantial concessions
   from national governments; and (2) because the governmental offer of
   autonomy is not credible to rebels. Drawing upon the single case study
   of Aceh, this research examines how warring parties overcome these two
   obstacles and successfully settle ethnonational conflicts through
   autonomy. First, although ethnonational conflicts do not tend to be
   costly over a single year, they often last for decades, and the
   accumulation of this cost over years can be substantial. In light of
   this long-term cost, national governments have incentives to offer
   substantial concessions to stop the conflict from persisting
   indefinitely. Second, rebels could sign the agreement if they perceive
   that their autonomy is internationally guaranteed in the long term. It
   is imperative for international policy makers to consider these points
   when they try to help resolve ethnonational conflicts through autonomy.},

Abstract = {Despite the diffusion of the paradigm of central bank independence,
   there is still meaningful variation in the operating missions of central
   banks both across countries and over time. Through a detailed
   qualitative case study, this article develops the concept of the
   operating mission of the central bank and applies it to the case of the
   Hungarian National Bank (MNB) to provide a more complete understanding
   of mission shift. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of policy
   agency, as the central bank governors moulded the operating mission of
   the central bank, even in the face of dominant international norms.},

Abstract = {In an era of New Public Management reforms, public sector policies often
   create a mismatch between social and economic values that can lead to
   public policy alienation-professionals' feelings of disconnection from
   public policies. Policy alienation can create unrest among public
   professionals and carry several negative repercussions for their
   wellbeing and work-related attitudes. The negative repercussions of
   policy alienation are likely to inhibit public service delivery.
   However, existing research on policy alienation and its consequences for
   street-level bureaucrats' wellbeing is scarce. Thus, it is unknown how
   policymakers can curb policy disconnect and counter its negative
   implications. To contribute to both general policy alienation theory and
   practice, our study hypothesized that the two dimensions of general
   policy meaninglessness-client meaninglessness and societal
   meaninglessness-are negatively related to street-level bureaucrats'
   psychological wellbeing. We hypothesize this negative relationship is
   due to alienative commitment. A timelagged survey data collected from
   401 public professionals and analyzed using structural equation modeling
   supported our hypothesized relationships. The present study extends the
   nomological networks of the antecedents and consequences of alienative
   commitment and offers important implications that can help policymakers
   counter the issues related to public professionals' alienative
   commitment and psychological wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Collaborative governance is believed to lead to more innovative
   solutions to complex problems in public services. This article analyses
   whether this hypothesis applies in the case of decentralisation of
   labour market policy to regional networks of various actors in the
   Netherlands. We first develop a theoretical argument that integrates
   theories of collaborative governance with theories of innovation,
   distinguishing between a wide and a small option for innovation in
   relation to the structure, process and output/outcome of collaborative
   governance. Our findings show that, despite a variety of partnerships
   and ambitions across the regions, new and bold solutions to complex
   problems are scarce. In particular, wide innovation, which creates
   public value beyond the existing policy frameworks and services, is
   limited in practice. The article advances the theory by specifying
   barriers and conditions for network innovation in the public sector, and
   provides some suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {While a large body of scholarship has analysed the nature and
   dysfunction of Australian climate policy over the past generation, there
   has been little examination of how the Australian state has reorganised
   itself institutionally to create and execute climate policy. Filling
   this gap, I explore the evolution of federal climate institutions since
   the early 1990s, describing how they have fared in the midst of
   Australia's highly polarized political debate around climate, as well as
   how they have facilitated and constrained Canberra's ability to develop
   effective climate strategies.},

Abstract = {Years after the formal end of two devastating wars, the Congo's eastern
   Kivu provinces meander in a limbo of contested politics, deep-seated
   insecurity and armed mobilisation. Through the prism of the artisanal
   mining sector, which is currently undergoing significant regulatory
   transformation, this article studies the convoluted networks of
   political and economic order that underpin (in)security. Investigating
   the links between violence, reform and patronage, it asks how
   powerbrokers adapt to changing logics of conflict and resource
   extraction amid transnational reform that aims at `conflict-free'
   mineral sourcing. Revisiting the notion of patronage, the article argues
   that political and economic order are socio-spatially entwined and
   demonstrates how a certain type of stakeholder - known collectively as
   incontournables - commands multiple loyalties across entangled networks
   of mineral exploitation and trade that extend far into the political,
   economic and military spheres of authority.},

Abstract = {The Terms of Reference (TOR) of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission
   on Human Rights (AICHR) include a provision to allow the body to evolve
   by review every five years. There were huge expectations from civil
   society that this process would rectify the lack of a protection mandate
   for human rights. I argue that the TOR review should not be seen as the
   only way to enable AICHR to evolve. AICHR's evolution can also be
   accelerated through the development and implementation of its work plans
   and projects. Furthermore, the ability of AICHR's country
   Representatives to recognise political opportunities and to creatively
   interpret AICHR's TOR have significantly strengthened AICHR's ability to
   promote and protect human rights in the last ten years. Accordingly,
   this paper examines AICHR's scope and power as stated in its
   (unreviewed) TOR and the five-year work plans to promote and protect
   human rights in the region from 2009 to 2019. This paper applies
   qualitative data collection combining desk research, interviews with key
   actors, and my own experiences as a human rights activist advocating for
   human rights in ASEAN since 2008 and as the Representative of Indonesia
   to AICHR for 2019-2021.},

Abstract = {The pandemic of COVID-19 struck the world in early 2020. China, which is
   regarded as the source of the new disease was also the first one to
   overcome it. After controlling the outbreak domestically, China started
   conducting public diplomacy offensive, which we will call `coronavirus
   diplomacy.' Its main focus is put on assisting other countries that are
   still struggling with high numbers of infections and many difficulties,
   such as shortages in medical equipment or medical staff. This article
   aims to review public diplomacy activities undertaken by China in
   conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. The goal is to
   determine what messages the Chinese government has been sending through
   those activities. The investigation was qualitative and the main
   research method employed is content analysis. The authors analyzed
   statements of China's representatives in search of the messages that
   were supposed to be communicated.},

Abstract = {Empirical studies that use the multiple streams approach often examine
   cases of reactive policymaking in response to ``focusing events{''},
   rather than proactive policymakers who seek to broker or construct
   problems that their preferred solution might address. Drawing on
   publicly-available debates about reforms to fire and rescue services in
   seven areas of England, we show how individuals within small policy
   subsystems may construct problems to try and convince others to support
   their preferred policy solution. By straddling all three streams and
   acting as endogenous policy entrepreneurs, policymakers and problem
   brokers simultaneously, we highlight how these actors can exert
   substantial influence over policymaking processes - although consensus
   within the political stream about the existence of a genuine problem is
   still a key factor in facilitating change. These insights allow us to
   introduce a more obvious power dimension and greater predictive capacity
   into the multiple streams approach.},

Abstract = {Do regional human rights courts influence respect for rights? Beyond
   providing remedy for individual human rights abuse, case outcomes help
   frame potential social mobilization by setting standards and raising the
   rights consciousness of civil society actors. The expectation of
   mobilization can increase the government's costs of flouting the court's
   rulings. We argue that an enabling domestic environment characterized by
   two features increases government expectation of mobilization following
   regional court litigation. First, a robust civil society creates strong
   horizontal ties between potential mobilizing groups. Second, a national
   human rights institution (NHRI) creates vertical ties that both transfer
   information down from the court to civil society; and transfer demands
   up from civil society to political elites in position to make stronger
   human rights policy. Using data for all Council of Europe countries from
   1980 to 2012, we find European Court of Human Rights litigation
   associated with higher respect for rights in an enabling domestic
   environment characterized by strong civil society and the presence of a
   NHRI.},

Title = {The Increasing Representativeness of International Organizations'
   Secretariats: Evidence from the United Nations System, 1997-2015},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-209},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although international organizations (IOs) and their secretariats play
   important roles in international politics, we know surprisingly little
   about their staffing composition and the factors that shape it. What
   accounts for the national composition of the secretariats of IOs? We
   theorize that the national composition of international secretariats is
   shaped by three factors: the desire by powerful states for institutional
   control, a commonly shared interest in a secretariat's functional
   effectiveness, and, increasingly, a need for secretariats to be seen as
   legitimate by being representative of the global population. Building on
   recent constructivist literature, we argue that IOs face increasing
   normative pressure to be representative in their staffing patterns.
   Using panel regression, we assess our argument with a new dataset
   covering states' representation in the secretariats of thirty-five
   United Nations system bodies from 1997 to 2015. The results indicate
   that while functional effectiveness plays a significant and stable role,
   international secretariats have become increasingly representative of
   the global population. Moreover, this has come primarily at the expense
   of the over-representation of powerful states. This shift from power to
   representation is particularly strong in large IOs with high political
   and societal visibility. When it comes to IO secretariats,
   representativeness (increasingly) matters.},

Abstract = {Argentina's neoconservative backlash (2015-2019) has rather
   paradoxically been marked by an unprecedented entanglement of ongoing
   memory struggles and a recent feminist awakening. A critical reading of
   this entwining traces the queer reworking of dictatorship trauma during
   the Kirchnerist administrations (2003-2015) and explores the way the
   post-2015 cycle nurtured a feminist irruption that contested
   long-standing forms of patriarchy. The feminist movement Ni Una Menos
   has transitioned from victimization to joy. Albertina Carri's
   lesbian-porn fictional film Las hijas del fuego (2018) can be read as an
   expression of a novel amalgam of disappearance, sexuality, and politics.
   The spirit of contagion radiated by the film sheds light on the
   ``revolution of the daughters{''} now taking place in the streets.
   La reaccion neoconservadora de Argentina (2015-2019) se ha visto
   paradojicamente marcada por una vinculacion sin precedentes entre las
   luchas de memoria en curso y un reciente despertar feminista. Una
   lectura critica entrelaza una reelaboracion queer del trauma de la
   dictadura durante las administraciones kirchneristas (2003-2015) a la
   vez que explora la forma en que el ciclo post-2015 alimento una
   irrupcion feminista impugno viejas formas del patriarcado. El movimiento
   feminista Ni Una Menos ha pasado de la victimizacion a la alegria. La
   ficcion pornografica lesbica Las hijas del fuego (2018), de Albertina
   Carri, se puede leer como la expresion de una nueva amalgama de
   desaparicion, sexualidad y politica. El espiritu de contagio irradiado
   por la pelicula arroja luz sobre la ``revolucion de las hijas{''} que
   tiene lugar en las calles.},

Abstract = {This response to my critics discusses four claims that are central for A
   Theory of Global Governance. The first claim is that observing a high
   level of conflict and contestation in world politics is not proof of the
   unimportance of global governance, since many of the current conflicts
   and contestations are about international institutions. The second claim
   is that the 1990s saw a rise of trans- and international authority
   beyond the nation-state that is essential for the rise of a global
   political system. Third, a global system of loosely coupled spheres of
   authority relies on `critical deference' (reflexive authority) but also
   contains numerous elements of coercion. And fourth, a technocratic
   legitimation of intrusive international authorities cannot build on
   emotions or a sense of belonging. This deficit creates a political
   opportunity structure that allows for the rise of a myriad of
   dissenters. The relative importance of them depends on the availability
   of resources for mobilization and not on the quality of reasons for
   resistance.},

Abstract = {The EUTF aims to address the `root causes of migration' by providing
   development assistance to countries of origin and transit. While it is
   allegedly based on scientific evidence, scholarly consensus suggests
   that development assistance is ill-suited to address irregular migration
   - which is something that some of the actors who designed the EUTF were
   aware of. We advance a new framework for understanding the emergence and
   success of pseudo-causal narratives (i.e., narratives relying on
   unproven and/or disproven causal claims) in EU policymaking. Using frame
   analysis, we argue that the pseudo-causal `root causes' narrative was
   adopted against better evidence because it was plausible, compelling and
   had been used in EU external migration policies before. Faced with the
   salience of migration and the urgency to act in late 2015, and due to
   the absence of any clear ideas of what other measures could work, EU
   actors adopted this narrative to demonstrate that they were actively
   responding to the `crisis'. The narrative met little contestation, since
   it met the concerns of both those who were keen to stop migration and
   those who wanted to preserve the core of previous EU development policy.},

Abstract = {In the context of the 2004 Enlargement, several EU governments reformed
   their social legislation to restrict the access to benefits of
   job-seeking or inactive EU citizens. Many of these restrictions were in
   tension with the case-law of the European Court of Justice, but when it
   came to judge their compatibility with EU law, the ECJ was more lenient
   than many anticipated. This article analyses this shift in ECJ case-law
   by looking at the dialogue between the Court and national authorities
   against the backdrop of EU legislative reform. It demonstrates that
   Member States contributed to the evolution of case-law by `pushing the
   boundaries' of EU law both domestically and before the Court. It shows
   in particular how closely the arguments presented before the Court by
   national judiciaries or governments correlate with the new
   interpretations adopted by the Court itself. This is illustrated with
   empirical evidence from the UK and Germany.},

Abstract = {How did China construct effective crisis governance systems to cope with
   a transboundary crisis like COVID-19? By integrating policy regime and
   campaign theories, this article constructs an analytical framework - the
   campaign-style crisis governance regime - to answer this question. The
   COVID-19 crisis was reconceived as a people's war in order to prompt
   idea-sharing within the regime. The decision-making and coordination
   capacity of crisis management was enhanced by the establishment of
   top-down leading groups/headquarters and complex horizontal/vertical and
   formal/informal institutional arrangements. By aligning the interests of
   stakeholders through a variety of mechanisms, the supply of materials
   and human resources and the level of cooperation were significantly
   improved. China's campaign-style crisis regime is embedded in the
   nation's political-administrative structures. This article also
   discusses the theoretical and empirical implications of Chinese-style
   response in the end.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to a critical methodological discussion that has
   direct ramifications for policy studies: how computational methods can
   be concretely incorporated into existing processes of textual analysis
   and interpretation without compromising scientific integrity. We focus
   on the computational method of topic modeling and investigate how it
   interacts with two larger families of qualitative methods: content and
   classification methods characterized by interest in words as
   communication units and discourse and representation methods
   characterized by interest in the meaning of communicative acts. Based on
   analysis of recent academic publications that have used topic modeling
   for textual analysis, our findings show that different mixed-method
   research designs are appropriate when combining topic modeling with the
   two groups of methods. Our main concluding argument is that topic
   modeling enables scholars to apply policy theories and concepts to much
   larger sets of data. That said, the use of computational methods
   requires genuine understanding of these techniques to obtain
   substantially meaningful results. We encourage policy scholars to
   reflect carefully on methodological issues, and offer a simple heuristic
   to help identify and address critical points when designing a study
   using topic modeling.},

Abstract = {Fueled by the politics of xenophobia and national security, the United
   States immigration enforcement system has expanded and strengthened in
   recent decades, resulting in more abuses of Mexican migrants by United
   States officials during apprehension, detention, and deportation. We
   find that the geography of United States enforcement operations and the
   social characteristics of the Mexican consular districts in which
   migrants report these abuses determine when and where the Mexican state
   assists Mexican nationals who are targets of abuse. Our findings
   illustrate the limits of sending-state engagement in safeguarding the
   rights of its diaspora in an age of migration control.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Context: Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic will require most Americans to
   vaccinate against the virus. Unfortunately, previous research suggests
   that many Americans plan to refuse a vaccine; thereby jeopardizing
   collective immunity. We investigate the effectiveness of three different
   health communication frames hypothesized to increase vaccine intention;
   emphasizing either 1) personal health risks, 2) economic costs, or 3)
   collective public health consequences of not vaccinating.Methods: In a
   large (N = 7,064) and demographically representative survey experiment,
   we randomly assigned respondents to read pro-vaccine communication
   materials featuring one of the frames listed above. We also randomly
   varied the message source (ordinary people vs. medical experts) and
   availability of information designed the ``pre-bunk{''} potential
   misinformation about expedited clinical trial safety.Findings: We find
   that messages emphasizing the personal health risks and collective
   health consequences of not vaccinating significantly increase Americans'
   intentions to vaccinate. These effects are similar in magnitude
   irrespective of message source, and the inclusion of pre-bunking
   information. Surprisingly, economic cost frames have no discernible
   effect on vaccine intention. Additionally, despite sharp partisan
   polarization in public vaccination intentions, we find that these
   effects are no different for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents
   alike.Conclusion: Health communicators hoping to encourage vaccination
   may be effective by appealing to the use personal and collective health
   risks of not vaccinating.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's intervention in Ukraine in 2014, debates about its
   behaviour and intentions have increased significantly in the West. This
   article examines Russia's strategic interests in its historically
   peaceful Nordic neighbourhood. It identifies and applies the classic
   strategy terms ends, ways and means in a 100-year perspective and asks
   if Russia's military and political goals in the Nordic region have
   changed after 2014. Despite increased tensions and a more aggressive
   Russian rhetoric and behaviour, Russian strategic goals in the region
   are characterised by an evolving continuity and a reluctant acceptance
   of the current military-political status quo.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {250-261},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In most contemporary civil wars, governments collude with non-state
   militias as part of their counterinsurgent strategy. However,
   governments also restrict the capabilities of their militia allies
   despite the adverse consequences this may have on their overall
   counterinsurgent capabilities. Why do governments contain their militia
   allies while also fighting a rebellion? I argue that variation in
   militia containment during a civil war is the outcome of a bargaining
   process over future bargaining power between security or profit-seeking
   militias and states with time-inconsistent preferences. Strong states
   and states facing weak rebellions cannot credibly commit to not
   suppressing their militias, and militias with sufficient capabilities to
   act independently cannot credibly commit to not betraying the state.
   States with limited political reach and those facing strong rebellions,
   however, must retain militia support, which opens a ``window of
   opportunity{''} for militias to augment their independent capabilities
   and future bargaining power. Using new data on pro-government militia
   containment and case illustrations of the Janjaweed in Sudan and Civil
   Defense Patrols in Guatemala, I find evidence consistent with these
   claims. Future work must continue to incorporate the agency of militias
   when studying armed politics, since these bargaining interactions
   constitute a fundamental yet undertheorized characteristic of war-torn
   states.},

   Atmospheric Nuclear Weapon Tests: A Case Study of UK and US Test

Abstract = {Between 1957 and 1962, the UK and USA conducted 33 atmospheric nuclear
   weapons test detonations at or close to Malden and Kiritimati
   (Christmas) Islands (total yield 31 megatons), formerly British colonial
   territories in the central Pacific region, now part of the Republic of
   Kiribati. Some 40,000 British, Fijian, New Zealand and US civilian and
   military personnel participated in the test program and 500 i-Kiribati
   civilians lived on Kiritimati at the time. This article reviews
   humanitarian and environmental consequences of the UK and US nuclear
   weapons testing programs in Kiribati, as well as the policy measures
   that have addressed them. The authors contend that policy interventions
   to date have not adequately addressed the needs and rights of test
   survivors, nor ongoing environmental concerns. They argue that the
   victim assistance and environmental remediation obligations in the 2017
   Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons offer an important new
   opportunity for addressing the consequences of nuclear detonations in
   Kiribati, by focusing policy attention and constituting a new field of
   development assistance.},

Abstract = {To develop an effective and responsive global policy framework for
   addressing the humanitarian and environmental consequences of nuclear
   weapons, survivors and communities affected by nuclear weapons use and
   testing, and their perspectives and expertise on what is needed, must be
   included. Testimony from survivors was crucial to the global effort for
   the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Articles 6 and
   7 will require states joining the TPNW to provide assistance (such as
   medical and psychological support, and social and economic inclusion) to
   the victims of nuclear weapons use and testing, and to take measures
   towards remediating environments that are still affected (See Bolton \&
   Minor and Docherty's contributions in this Special Section for further
   details). Going forward, policy development on the implementation of
   Articles 6 and 7 of the TPNW should be guided by the priorities that
   affected communities identify.},

Abstract = {Scholars, commentators and Chinese policymakers point to air pollution
   as a possible challenge to the popular standing of the Communist Party
   of China's rule. However, the question of whether air pollution is
   systematically linked with Chinese citizens' attitudes toward
   authorities has not been studied for the country as a whole, during the
   past decade's surge in attention to environmental problems. Analyzing
   high-quality, nationally representative survey data in combination with
   satellite-based PM2.5 estimates, this research finds that citizens who
   perceive local air to be of bad quality have lower probability than
   others for expressing trust in county and provincial governments. Air
   pollution did not make a significant difference to probability for
   trusting central government. The study contributes to hierarchical trust
   literature and identifies differential trust dynamics for observed and
   perceived air pollution and over time, across Mainland China's
   population.},

Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that policies for a more sustainable society
   require narratives outside the status quo. This contribution studies the
   EU's environmental policy narrative of a circular economy (CE), which
   many consider promising in this respect. The results demonstrate that
   the CE narrative was created to transform EU policy discourses `from
   within' but eventually perpetuated the established discourse of
   ecological modernization. This perpetuation resulted from specific
   strategic practices used to create the CE narrative, which (1) concealed
   conflict, (2) strengthened the agency of incumbents, and (3) excluded
   alternative voices. The analysis uses empirical evidence from 28
   interviews with key stakeholders, 84 policy documents and participant
   observation data at the European Union (EU) level. The results suggest
   that the development of narratives outside the status quo depends on
   strategic practices that address (future) conflicts and offer new agency
   to change agents as well as transition strategies to incumbents.},

Abstract = {How do populists conduct foreign policy? The existing literature on
   populism focuses mainly on domestic patterns, and until recently the
   foreign dimension of populism has been largely overlooked. This paper
   aims to fill theoretical and empirical lacunae by mapping patterns of
   change and continuity in the formulation of geopolitical and economic
   international policy among Latin-American populist governments. Striving
   to conduct a systematic comparative analysis, this paper explores three
   waves of populist foreign policies in Latin America (classic,
   neoliberal, and progressive). While it is difficult to highlight a
   unified phenomenon, the findings reveal that several `unifying' elements
   indeed exist: they are manifest in the tendency of such governments to
   jointly (re)construct transnational solidarities for legitimation
   purposes and to adopt economic foreign policies with a pragmatic bent.
   Moreover, in opposition to the two first waves of populist governments,
   the most recent wave has embraced personalist styles, emotional public
   diplomacy, and clientelist techniques with support networks abroad, thus
   actively projecting the domestic patterns of populism to the regional
   and global levels in an attempt to leverage both domestic and
   international legitimacy. This study offers critical lessons for IR
   scholarship's increasing engagement with populism, contributing to the
   lively debate regarding the rise of populist trends across the globe.},

Abstract = {While the EU's impact on member and non-member states has been well
   researched, we have much less understanding of how Europeanization
   processes give way to de-Europeanization, a widespread phenomenon of the
   past decade. This paper unpacks and explores the hidden phases and modes
   of de-Europeanization. I argue that the models of gradual institutional
   change in historical institutionalism, namely `layering', `conversion'
   and `drift', operate in different phases of de-Europeanization in a
   sequential mode. I explore this argument empirically in the domain of
   regional development policy in Turkey, the longest-standing candidate
   country. The empirical analysis shows that the mode of `layering', which
   involves the addition of new rules without upsetting the existing
   arrangements, during Europeanization unleashed a subsequent mode of
   `conversion', in which new rules were upheld but exploited in
   implementation. This phase was then followed by `drift', in which new
   rules have become irrelevant in the midst of changing circumstances.},

Abstract = {For the first time, Mexican democracy has a president in power who
   defines his government as ``post-neoliberal.{''} In this article I
   explain how Mexico is facing the paradox of a turn to the left as
   drastic as it is impotent. By far, the government of Andres Manuel Lopez
   Obrador is the most powerful seen to date by Mexico's young democracy;
   however, it is nowhere near to dismantling neoliberalism. Here I propose
   that we facing a failed progressivism, and conclude that it makes no
   sense to conceive of this government as ``left-wing.{''}},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the duties of local government
   units under the legal conditions related to access to the ICT network in
   Poland. Establishing public-private partnerships in the
   telecommunications sector, which is a field closely tied with
   cybersecurity, seems inevitable and necessary. The need to cooperate is
   the consequence of the development of information and communication
   technologies, which leads to their increasingly wide application in all
   aspects of social life. The tasks of local government involving network
   access have become key to the process of broadband network development.
   That is why public funding becomes particularly important in its
   absence, justified by the need to provide conditions for internet access
   as a human right. This has become especially topical as we face the
   challenges of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {As opposed to authors who strive to justify the right of access to
   public passenger transport services of citizens predominantly on the
   principles of justice deriving from social ethics, the authors of this
   article justify the right of such access on the human rights to mobility
   and equality before the law, as the rights based on international legal
   acts, whereas the principles of fairness are used to upgrade the human
   right to equality and prohibition of discrimination Based on the rights
   to mobility and equality before the law, the authors justify an
   obligation of democratic states to introduce a law to provide for people
   an adequate access to public passenger transport services at the
   interurban and urban level. The theoretical findings established herein
   will serve as a basis to evaluate legal regulations in the selected
   states (the Republic of Slovenia and the Republic of Croatia), and
   create proposals to change the same.},

Abstract = {The subject of the article are the issues concerning the enactment by
   local self-government bodies in Poland of a special category of acts of
   local law, i.e. public order regulations. Public order regulations
   belong to the sources of universally binding law in Poland. Not only
   government administration bodies, but also local self-government may
   adopt them. By means of public order regulations, such values as: life,
   health, property of citizens, environment, public order, peace and
   public security are protected. The status of public order regulations in
   the Polish legal order, which are bodies of local self-government units
   to protect the life or health of citizens and to ensure public order,
   peace and security, is not the subject to clear legislation or consent
   among scholars in the field and in relevant case-law. Therefore, the aim
   of the article is to determine the legal status of local law acts in the
   form of public order regulations in Poland and to define their role in
   the performance of tasks in the field of public security by local
   self-government. The author refers also to relevant legal solutions
   applicable in other member states of the Visegrad Group. The main thesis
   of the article is a statement that acts of local law in the form of
   public order regulations are a desirable manifestation of the law-making
   decentralisation of the state, which is necessary for the effective
   performance of tasks in the field of public security by local
   self-government bodies.},

Abstract = {This thesis is a critical analysis of the constitutional and legal order
   of the Republic of North Macedonia, following the chronological process
   dating from the gaining of the county's independence, through the armed
   conflict in 2001 that brought constitutional changes, to today. The
   first decade after the breakup of Yugoslavia was crucial for the North
   Macedonian state and its citizens. The writing/creation of the
   constitution of the new, independent state was not an easy process and
   it did not pass peacefully nor did it pass without any problems. The
   complex social process and relations have initiated the need for
   amendments to the Constitution, which, since its adoption in 1991 until
   today, has been changed 32 times in order to adapt to new, emerging
   situations and to give constitutional and legal responses to the
   inherent challenges. Of course, proper changes also occurred in the
   political system itself as a result of numerous factors, which have more
   or less influenced its character and shape.},

Abstract = {Relating to academic debates on the emergence of moral panics over
   homosexuality in several parts of Africa, this article examines rumours
   on homosexuality as a political issue that connects colonial pasts and
   postcolonial struggles in Cameroon. We link current struggles over
   homosexuality to broader debates about the question of Cameroon's
   decolonization from France. The article focuses on the figure of Dr
   Louis Paul Aujoulat, a French colonial official in Cameroon who played a
   crucial role in the country's decolonization in the 1950s. Aujoulat died
   in 1972, but recently, he made a `return' in rumours and public debates
   in a new role: he is now accused of having `sodomized' the emergent new
   elite of Cameroon, thus introducing homosexuality; moreover, he is
   linked to Freemasonry and occult initiation rites. Our aim was to show
   how a particular decolonization trajectory-very rocky in the case of
   Cameroon-is related to the present-day moral panic about a supposed
   proliferation of homosexuality. Freemasonry and its special history on
   the African continent-notably its role in maintaining the coherence of
   Francafrique between France and its former colonies-is a severely
   understudied topic. Its linkages to same-sex practices and illicit
   enrichment give the Cameroonian case a wider relevance. We argue that
   the new rumours on Dr Aujoulat define him as a key figure in linking
   Freemasonry, homosexuality and illicit enrichment to present-day issues
   of state governance, citizenship and elite misrule in Cameroon.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of natural resource conflict has gained prominence in
   academic and policy literature, but ongoing discussions have not
   significantly addressed some critical issues that affect the dynamics of
   the conflict and peacebuilding efforts. This article draws on
   semi-structured interviews and archival survey to investigate the
   dilemmas involved in addressing protracted farmer-herder conflicts in
   Agogo, Ashanti region, arguably the most notorious case in Ghana. It
   examines why attempts to sustainably address the clashes mostly produce
   unsuccessful results, which reflects in recurrences of the conflict. The
   article argues that a web of domestic and regional politics embedded in
   hurting identity contentions bedevils the peacemaking process. Following
   the conclusion, the author recommends some steps to address the most
   critical dilemmas of the conflict resolution and peacebuilding exercise,
   including a focus on social integration; fair, capable and inclusive
   local institutions; public education on regional agreements and strong
   engagements of the civil society.},

Abstract = {Does internal migration following natural hazards increase the
   likelihood of protests in migrant-receiving areas? To address the
   question, this study first looks at the extent to which experiencing
   different forms of natural hazards contributes to a household's decision
   to leave their district of residence. In a second step, the article
   explores whether that internal migration flow increases the number of
   protest events in migrant-hosting districts. In doing so, it contributes
   to the existing debate on the extent to which natural hazards impact the
   likelihood of social contention, and the role of migration as a linking
   pathway in that relationship. The impact of climate-related shocks may
   erode household assets and therefore adaptive capacity in ways that can
   eventually influence decisions to migrate to larger urban centres.
   Although migrants are agents of economical and technological change,
   urban environments may impose challenges to recently arrived migrants
   and their host communities, affecting the motivations and mobilization
   resources of urban social groups to protest. As a consequence, the
   probability of urban unrest in these locations is expected to increase.
   To test this, I use geo-referenced household-level data from Bangladesh
   for the period 2010-15, which records households' experiences of
   different forms of natural hazard and internal migration flows,
   available from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey. It combines
   this with data on protests, derived from the Armed Conflict Location and
   Event Data. Findings suggest that flood hazards in combination with loss
   of assets increase the likelihood of internal migration, but unlike
   other types of domestic mobility, hazard-related migration does not
   increase the frequency of protests in migrants' districts of
   destination.},

   This study addresses the following research question: is Rio de Janeiro
   an important case for expanding the concept of hybrid governance in

   considered a space of hybrid governance, but also a dynamic hub with
   constant violence outbreaks with local and global impact.},

Abstract = {Behavioural public policy has spread internationally over recent years.
   Worldwide, expert units are translating insights from behavioural
   sciences into policy interventions. Yet, behavioural expert networks are
   a puzzling case. They seem to oscillate between two modes of collective
   action: as an epistemic community, they are based on the consensual
   belief that biases in behaviour pose a problem for policymaking. As an
   instrument constituency, they bring together a diversity of actors,
   unified not by consensual beliefs about problems but by practices of
   promoting behavioural instruments as solutions. Drawing on a review of
   literature, this article provides a systematic analysis of the relation
   between epistemic communities and instrument constituencies. It argues
   that there has been an `agency shift' from one mode to the other. The
   implications are that experts should be aware of the fact that the
   instruments they are proposing might develop a political life of their
   own.},

Abstract = {To understand the dominant narratives described in this book, they need
   to be situated within the context of Myanmar's modern history and the
   ways different political actors - whether independence leaders, colonial
   administrators, military leaders or activists - have narrated that
   history. This is not an attempt to construct a unitary history of
   Myanmar, but rather to locate and uncover struggles over the meaning of
   democracy during these different periods and how they shape contemporary
   political uses of the word `democracy' amongst the networks of activists
   and democratic leaders that I studied. The third chapter explores the
   example of contrasting meanings of democracy between British colonial
   administrators and the Thakin independence leaders in the late colonial
   period in Burma.},

Abstract = {Habit is among the most influential explanations for why people vote.
   Scholars have addressed the impact of individual disruptions to habitual
   voting, but analyses including several life events are rare. We combine
   two panel surveys, conducted in the UK during 1991-2017, to examine the
   impact of unemployment, retirement, changes in partnership status,
   moving and disability on voting. We distinguish between habitual voters,
   occasional voters and habitual non-voters. For all voter groups, turnout
   declines with divorce. For other life events, the impacts diverge across
   the voter groups. Overall, the findings suggest that social connections
   are the strongest underlying mechanisms explaining the changes. Although
   the results support the voting habit thesis, they also suggest that
   previous research has overstated the persistence of voting habits. The
   results revise some of the canonical findings by demonstrating that the
   impact of life events differs across people with different voting habits
   and across different life events.},

Abstract = {Anti-immigrant claims are seen as key to the success of populist radical
   right parties (PRRPs) in parliamentary opposition. Yet migrant
   integration policies adopted by PRRPs in executive power are still a
   blind spot in research. Some scholars assess their policy impact as weak
   and attribute this to a lack of robust policy suggestions, others point
   to their taming by mainstream coalition partners and by government
   responsibility. Recently though, PRRPs have found more favourable
   political opportunities in the increased salience of migration and a
   rightward shift of centre-right parties. Drawing on policy documents
   from the Austrian coalition government of the radical right Austrian
   Freedom Party and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (2017-2019),
   this paper investigates policy designs and constraints in the area of
   migrant integration. Our study points out the impact of PRRPs in
   government on integration policy through strengthening regulatory
   instruments, weakening distributive instruments and using organizational
   instruments to centralize policy implementation at the expense of NGOs.
   Yet this approach not only alters the substance of policy designs, the
   radical right also imprints a populist mode of confrontational and
   accelerated policy-making. Against these changes, taming is left to
   political and especially institutional constraints at national and
   international levels.},

Abstract = {Using contemporary theories on Status Quo and Revisionist actors, the
   study provides an alternative explanation to the Israeli-Hamas conflict.
   Israel is a status quo actor that enjoys high values in terms of
   economic and military power. It has low value in terms of brokerage in
   international institutions. Hamas is a radical revisionist actor that
   follows other radical revisionist Islamic actors. However, it fails on
   both axes to change its equation with Israel. This situation encourages
   a split within Hamas, between radical revisionists and positionalist
   revisionists who emphasize compromises with Israel to improve the
   economy in Gaza and local military capacity.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The study analyzes the beginning of the Albanian student movement of
   December 1990 from a historical-sociological and comparative
   perspective. This historical interpretation of various sources
   (newspaper articles, activists' memoirs, interviews, and archival
   documents) draws its theoretical arguments from social movement studies,
   student activism, and the sociology of higher education. The study
   offers a complex explanation of the role of the movement during the
   country's democratic transition by also looking at similar cases.
   Considerations of the broader international and local implications, the
   role of the university, the academic staff, and the student organization
   all are accounted for. After tracing the repertoires of strategies and
   content of the movement to the Albanian Cultural Revolution of the
   1960s, the study argues that student activism benefitted from the
   structural opportunities provided by changes introduced in higher
   education during the historical sequence of late Socialism.},

Abstract = {Purpose Past research on team conflict has often conceptualized it as a
   collective phenomenon whereby members of the same team perceive similar
   levels of conflict. However, similarity in perspectives can more often
   be the exception than the norm. As such, the purpose of this paper is to
   examine the effects of relationship conflict (RC) asymmetry on
   information elaboration and team performance. Additionally, I introduce
   a new construct: perception of team RC asymmetry and propose that it
   strengthens the positive effects of RC asymmetry.
   Design/methodology/approach A total of 181 MBA students comprising 52
   teams participated in the research. Students worked together for the
   duration of the semester to complete a team project that comprised 45\%
   of their final grade. Surveys were administered at three points in time
   with performance measured at the end and other focal variables measured
   at the midpoint. Regression analyses and the PROCESS macro were used to
   examine a first stage moderated mediation model. Findings Results showed
   that RC asymmetry increased elaboration, which, in turn, improved team
   performance. The link between RC asymmetry and elaboration was moderated
   by the perception of team RC asymmetry. Originality/value The present
   research shows that to have a fuller understanding of RC one must
   consider the level of dispersion experienced by team members. Taking
   this approach has uncovered a way in which RC can actually benefit teams
   instead of lead to destructive outcomes.},

Abstract = {Government agencies around the world struggle to retain frontline
   workers, as high job demands and low job resources contribute to
   persistently high rates of employee burnout. Although four decades of
   research have documented the predictors and potential costs of frontline
   worker burnout, we have limited causal evidence on strategies that
   reduce it. In this article, we report on a multicity field experiment (n
   = 536) aimed at increasing perceived social support and affirming
   belonging among 911 dispatchers. We find that a 6-week intervention that
   prompts dispatchers to share advice anonymously and asynchronously with
   their peers in other cities reduces burnout by 8 points (0.4 standard
   deviations) and cuts resignations by more than half (3.4 percentage
   points) 4 months after the intervention ended. We provide supporting
   evidence that the intervention operates by increasing perceived social
   support and belonging in an online laboratory experiment (n = 497).
   These findings suggest that low-cost belonging affirmation techniques
   can reduce frontline worker burnout and help agencies retain workers,
   saving a mid-sized city at least \$400,000 in personnel costs.},

Abstract = {A critical study of public policy involving the 2016-2017 reforms of
   higher education in Cuba points to the hazards of the pragmatic approach
   to this policy evidenced in numerous educational indicators and official
   discourse. Although such features are still far from possessing a
   neoliberal imprint, uncontrolled pragmatism could lead to a neoliberal
   trend in Cuban educational policy. Various indicators show the slow
   mutation of educational policy, increasingly measured and understood as
   an economic policy (in its fiscal aspects) rather than as a social one.
   Un estudio critico de las politicas publicas ligadas a las reformas
   cubanas a la educacion superior de (2016-2017) muestra los peligros del
   enfoque pragmatico tomado por este proceso, los cuales se hacen evidente
   en numerosos indicadores educativos y discursos oficiales. Aunque aun no
   podemos hablar de una impronta neoliberal, el pragmatismo descontrolado
   podria conducir a la politica educativa cubana en dicha direccion.
   Diversos indicadores muestran la lenta mutacion de la politica
   educativa, la cual se mide y entiende cada vez mas como una politica
   economica (en sus aspectos fiscales) que social.},

Abstract = {An initiative is needed to break the logjam in the international
   negotiations to reform taxation of multinational enterprises (MNEs). The
   explosion of profit shifting observed since the 1990s has resulted in
   hundreds of billions of dollars of tax revenues being lost around the
   world each year - but reform efforts have thus far failed to deliver
   measurable progress on the primary agreed goal of better aligning MNEs'
   taxable profits with the location of their real economic activity. More
   recently, countries have committed also to ensure that MNEs' global
   profits are subject to a minimum effective tax rate, but international
   agreement depends on designing an approach that can gain wide support.
   Our proposal for a minimum effective tax rate (METR) could be applied to
   MNEs by any countries that choose to do so, whether they are home to
   MNEs, host of MNEs, or both. The METR would be compatible with existing
   tax treaties, but being non-discriminatory it also complies with other
   international obligations and could be introduced unilaterally. Economic
   modelling shows the METR would deliver major revenue gains for
   participating countries, and adoption would also contribute to, rather
   than impede, momentum for a more comprehensive multilateral agreement.},

Title = {Income Inequality and Global Political Polarization: The Economic Origin
   of Political Polarization in the World},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {375-398},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Both income inequality and political polarization have increased
   dramatically in much of the world over the past few decades. One might
   wonder how these two phenomena correlate with each other. Are there any
   striking similarities in the correlated patterns of income inequality
   and polarization across the globe? More importantly, how can improved
   equality in income distribution contribute to mitigate political
   polarization? Although the potential polarizing effects of income
   inequality is a growing concern, the evidence provided by the existing
   literature, however, has been mixed and incomplete. This research seeks
   to address the shortcomings of the current scholarship by using the
   repeated cross-sectional data from six waves of the World Values Survey
   from 1990 to 2020, to investigate whether and how widened income
   inequality and growing political polarization are linked globally. The
   findings indicate that there is a positive and statistically significant
   cross-country association between levels of income inequality and
   political polarization. The results remain robust to different
   specifications. This research has the potential for advancing the study
   of linkages between income inequality and its political consequences.},

Abstract = {This article examines the institutional rationale of China's Belt and
   Road Initiative for Sino-Latin American interregionalism and global
   multilateralism. Applying Pedersen's ideational-institutional realism
   approach and research on interregionalism, we provide a more nuanced
   analysis than mainstream realist theorising dominating research on
   China's foreign policies. We argue that China's interregional relations
   with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) entail a cooperative strategy
   to counter US hegemony in its own `backyard'. At a cognitive level, we
   show that the worldviews of Chinese foreign policy elites are informed
   by the tenets of realism. At an institutional level, interregionalism
   serves as a soft balancing device. In the power dimension, China uses
   cooperative relations with LAC to create soft power, enhancing access to
   raw materials, and promoting Chinese values, worldviews, and policies to
   the region. Hence, China-LAC interregionalism qualifies as `diminished
   multilateralism', a pragmatic variant of multilateralism that favours
   particularistic interests while hampering collective problem solving.},

Abstract = {The weakness of American global leadership underscores the primacy of
   domestic politics. The same forces are at work in Europe and elsewhere.
   The result is progressive world disorder as national governments turn
   away from multilateral institutions and partnerships to satisfy powerful
   domestic constituencies. This shift comes at a cost in terms of
   effective policymaking at home and abroad at a time when effective
   international cooperation has never been more important. The challenges
   to be faced, from climate change to globalisation, can only be tackled
   in concert. If American and European policymakers are to lead these
   efforts, they must first rebuild domestic support for multilateral
   cooperation. Strong domestic agendas, such as the European Union's `Next
   Generation EU', are a step in the right direction, but they need to be
   married to a clear conception of the national interest in promoting
   world order.},

Title = {Networks of order in East Asia: Beyond hegemonic theories of the Liberal
   International Order},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {China's rise is widely regarded as constituting a challenge to the
   Liberal International Order built in the aftermath of WWII and expanded
   after the end of the Cold War. This paper assesses the state of the
   liberal order as it is manifested in East Asia's regional order today.
   It presents two main arguments. Empirically, by analysing international
   trade in the region over the last four decades, I find that China has
   already assumed a central position in the region's trade structure.
   China's economic ascent is also increasingly evident in the region's
   institutional architecture. Theoretically, I propose an `autonomous
   conception of international order' as a theoretical framework through
   which to understand these developments. In contrast to much of the
   existing literature, this approach theorises the liberal order
   independently of US hegemony. By doing so, it (a) makes a distinction
   between China's geopolitical ambitions and its supposed revisionism of
   the rules and norms of the liberal order; (b) posits the liberal order
   as an independent factor in the strategic environment of smaller- and
   medium-sized states in the region; and (c) elucidates the increasingly
   ambivalent policies of the US towards the liberal order. Viewed through
   this framework, I argue that China's rise challenges US's regional
   hegemony, but has, so far, not resulted in revisions to the rules-based,
   liberal order.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how the administrative-bureaucratic or staff
   support structures available to Members of the European Parliament
   (Secretariat officials, political group advisors and parliamentary
   assistants) changed in response to the formal development of the
   European Parliament into a legislature or parliamentarisation. Providing
   a temporal perspective, the aim is to explain bureaucratisation (as the
   processes whereby non-elected officials carry out elected
   representatives' duties and tasks) as it presents in the EP today. Based
   on interviews and other data, findings show that while changes to
   administrative-bureaucratic structures have not always been timely to
   EP's parliamentarisation, they strengthened the EP's administrative
   capacity incrementally. Arguing that administrative and political
   structures develop differently at given moments and infringe upon
   another, the article discusses the consequences of staff support for
   democracy. The analysis shows that the diversity of administrative
   structures is a source for maintaining democratic control in parliament
   and limiting bureaucratisation.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the long-term development of crisis management on
   the central level in China. Drawing on archival and interview data, it
   describes and analyzes how governance capacity and the formal structure
   of crisis management have changed, but also how culturally based
   legitimacy has altered over the past seventy years. These processes of
   change are divided into three phases, punctuated by institutional shifts
   in the history of crisis management institutions, whereby both vertical
   and horizontal coordination have become stronger over time. Crisis
   management in China is a legacy of traditional disaster management. In
   this respect it is different from the West, where crisis management has
   its origins in civil defense. We argue that each reform element is
   blended with traditional practices in an ever more complex combination,
   producing hybrid reform patterns. We conclude that centralization and a
   government-centered approach in the institutional history can explain
   the high short-term mobilization capacity and the challenges of
   communication in Chinese crisis management.},

Abstract = {The dawn of the Sino-US peer competition has broken, denoting a new
   status quo of instability as Beijing and Washington vie for influence.
   As leader of the rules-based international order (RIO), Washington under
   the Trump administration nevertheless adopted an ``America first{''}
   posture, which triggered a transatlantic discord. Simultaneously,
   Beijing, having signalled discontent with existing settlements, has
   sought to alter international arrangements to cement its leadership
   role. Europe has been identified as a significant theatre for the
   emerging competition, with Germany and the UK recognized as essential
   target states for Beijing's efforts, yet are simultaneously major
   stakeholders in the US-led RIO. As such, this article sets out to
   operationalize a European narrative of hedging. The article poses the
   questions, how does the transatlantic discord and Beijing's leadership
   ambitions impact the hedging strategies of Germany and the UK, and why
   do such coping behaviors differ in various indices? Utilizing key
   signals from policy practitioners, policy elites' rhetoric and national
   strategies, it is contended that while the UK is struggling to formulate
   a coherent foreign policy and now finds itself aligned with US foreign
   policy narratives, Germany is unlikely to signal its wishes to become
   strategically independent, if the US and EU foreign policy imperatives
   accord with Berlin's political and economic interests. These two case
   studies reveal that both European powers are decidedly wary about
   Beijing's signals and intentions, and are likely to retain closer
   alignment with Washington, foregoing strategic independence and
   illustrating the temporary nature of the transatlantic discord. Both
   will not, however, wish to relinquish Beijing, so long as attractive
   economic benefits can be attained, resulting in an inexplicit strategic
   hedge.},

Abstract = {The declining political engagement of youth is a concern in many
   European democracies. However, young people are also spearheading
   protest movements cross-nationally. While there has been research on
   political inequalities between generations or inter-generational
   differences, research looking at differences within youth itself, or
   inequalities between young people from different social backgrounds,
   particularly from a cross-national perspective, is rare. In this
   article, we aim to fill this gap in the literature. Using survey data
   from 2018 on young people aged 18-34 years, we analyse how social class
   background differentiates groups of young people in their political
   engagement and activism across nine European countries. We look at
   social differentiation by social class background for both political
   participation in a wide variety of political activities including
   conventional, unconventional, community and online forms of political
   participation, and at attitudes linked to broader political engagement,
   to paint a detailed picture of extant inequalities amongst young people
   from a cross-national perspective. The results clearly show that major
   class inequalities exist in political participation and broader
   political engagement among young people across Europe today.},

Abstract = {There is a long-running disagreement about how regime type affects a
   country's ability to project resolve. Specifically, there is an open
   question about whether being a democracy helps or hurts a country's
   reputation for resolve. I consider this question by directly estimating
   a state's reputation for resolve using a unified theoretical and
   statistical approach. To be precise, I derive an empirical model from a
   dynamic game of continuous-time bargaining where each side fights in
   order to build a reputation for resolve. I then fit this model using
   data on the duration and termination of civil conflicts between 1946 and
   2009. I find that while governments tend to have stronger reputations
   for resolve than the rebels they face, democracies are seen as much less
   likely to be resolved both prior to and during conflict than their
   autocratic counterparts. Likewise, democracies are more likely to end a
   conflict by making a policy change in favor of the rebels than
   autocracies. Despite these differences, both democracies and autocracies
   experience a discrete increase in their reputations for resolve once
   conflict begins, with democracies receiving a much larger boost. As
   such, these findings contrast with a large literature on democratic
   credibility theory, while simultaneously providing evidence consistent
   with some of the logic behind democratic credibility theory.},

Abstract = {Most literature on special elections has focused on first-past-the-post
   contests and on the performance of governments. Turnout, candidates, and
   how the electoral system impacts the result have received less
   attention. This contribution fills these voids by exploring special
   elections in Ireland, elections conducted under the alternative vote
   system. Taking a multifaceted approach, it investigates the correlates
   of turnout, the impact of candidates and the decisive effect of lower
   preferences, while also testing multiple explanations of government
   performance. I find Irish special elections live up to the by-election
   truisms of lower turnout and government loss. Government performance is
   associated with national economic conditions. By-election victory is
   more likely among candidates with familial lineage and former members of
   parliament. Where they come into play, one in five candidates owe their
   victory to lower preferences.},

Abstract = {Polarization in society may hold consequences beyond the undermining of
   social cohesion. Here we provide the first evidence highlighting the
   power of perceived moral polarization in society to drive support for
   strong leaders. Across two studies and four samples drawn from the
   United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States (N = 1,664), we found
   evidence linking perceived moral polarization with perceived anomie in
   society (defined as the perceived breakdown of social fabric and
   leadership) and with the rise in support for leaders with both a
   conservative/authoritarian and progressive/democratic style.
   Specifically, via the perceived breakdown in social fabric, heightened
   moral polarization predicted increased support for
   conservative/authoritarian style strong leaders, and via the perceived
   breakdown of leadership, increased support for progressive/democratic
   style strong leaders. Experimentally, using a fictionalized society
   paradigm, we then established causal links between moral polarization
   and the desire to elect conservative/authoritarian and
   progressive/democratic strong leaders. The current research is the first
   to identify the potential political consequences of heightened perceived
   moral polarization in two-party liberal democracies and contributes to
   the growing body of research highlighting the role of societal factors
   in driving support for strong leaders.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the phenomenon of conflating the European Court
   of Human Rights with the European Court of Justice and European Union in
   British political and media discourse. Scholars of the European Court of
   Human Rights and Euroscepticism often acknowledge conflation, but rarely
   specify the forms it takes or its specific effects on British
   perceptions of the legitimacy of European institutions. This article
   identifies three main forms of conflation: muddled conflation, ambiguous
   conflation, and deliberate conflation. It shows that conflation can be
   both a symptom of deeper Eurosceptic disregard for the roles and
   purposes of distinct European institutions, and a deliberate rhetorical
   tool, intended to weaken the legitimacy of separate institutions by
   tying criticisms of one to the other. The article demonstrates that
   conflating the different Europes contributes to the persistence of
   Strasbourgsceptic narratives in the British political sphere by
   exacerbating pre-existing concerns and providing additional
   opportunities to raise them in public.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Emotions affect how we think and behave and should be better
   incorporated into theories and frameworks of the policy process. Most
   research on emotions in the policy process relies on a dimensional model
   of emotions. However, over the past 20 years, research has found that
   dimensional approaches are limited compared to using categories of
   emotions. This article discusses theories of emotion, focusing on the
   theory of constructed emotion, and how emotion is studied in politics
   and policy. It then discusses the characteristics of enthusiasm, anger
   and fear, as well as the effects these emotions have on attention and
   information processing, risk perception, judgement and persuasion, and
   political participation and group behaviour. The article concludes by
   exploring how these emotions can be used by theories and frameworks of
   the policy process to better understand how emotions have an impact on
   attention to public problems, judging target populations and characters,
   and mobilise advocacy coalitions.},

Abstract = {Environmental movements play an increasingly pivotal role in societal
   responses to pressing issues, such as climate change. These movements
   are often multi-scalar, spanning locations, ideological orientations,
   organisational types, and tactics. We investigate how the UK's
   anti-fracking movement manages the tension between the necessary
   convergence of collective actions and this divergence of scale. Based on
   a frame analysis of press releases, position papers, websites, blogs and
   20 semi-structured interviews, the paper shows how heterogeneous
   environmental movement actors, with diverse framings of fracking,
   utilised three convergence processes - funnelling, expanding and
   familiarising - making connections vertically, horizontally and
   contextually. These processes created a `web' of resistance that held
   the environmental movement together while maintaining diversity. Our
   paper contributes to the environmental movement literature by explaining
   how movements overcome divergence without establishing homogeneity. This
   is important in understanding how environmental movements can expand
   their role within a broader constituency in opposing environmental
   destruction.},

Abstract = {Economic growth is a key point of macroeconomic policy and is the
   subject of constant attention and debate by professional public and
   policy makers. Theoretical and empirical research indicates differences
   in the level and direction of determinants' influence on the growth
   rate. The main goal of our article is to construct a model of economic
   growth determinants in South-East European countries. We used an
   unbalanced panel of 12 selected SEE countries over the period 2006-2019.
   Our empirical findings have shown that the most robust results can be
   obtained using a two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) model with
   dummy variable. In our dynamic model, we found that trade openness and
   gross fixed capital formation have a positive impact on economic growth,
   while government expenditures negatively determine economic growth.
   Gross fixed capital formation has the greatest positive impact on
   economic growth, while government expenditure has the greatest negative
   impact.},

Title = {Localisation in the Context of UK Government Engagement With the
   Humanitarian Reform Agenda},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Localisation is a key element of the humanitarian reform agenda.
   However, there are continuing debates regarding its form and emphasis,
   linked to understandings of the local, the role of the state and the
   implications for interpretation of humanitarian principles of
   ``de-internationalised{''} humanitarian response. This paper considers
   UK engagement with the localisation agenda, particularly through
   examination of the policies and programmes of the Department for
   International Development (DFID). The UK was a major contributor to
   dialogue on localisation at the World Humanitarian Summit of 2016 and
   has subsequently shown strong support for Grand Bargain commitments and
   implementation of a larger proportion of programmes involving cash
   transfers. Overall, however, advance on this agenda has been limited.
   The paper notes three major areas of constraint. First, logistical
   concerns have frequently been noted, particularly with respect to tasks
   such as procurement and financial monitoring. This has limited the
   engagement of many local actors lacking organisational capacity in these
   areas. Second, conceptual ambiguity has also played a significant role.
   Localisation is poorly theorised, and the roles, functions and
   capacities-beyond procurement of supplies and emergency technical
   assistance-that local actors may be able to fulfil far more effectively
   than international ones are not frequently addressed. Narrowly framed
   understandings of principles such as independence and impartiality, for
   instance, appear to severely limit confidence in engaging with local
   religious actors. Third, political considerations appear to have
   increasingly limited the space for more radical interpretations of the
   implications of localisation. Successive UK Secretaries of State for
   International Development have defended the commitment to a fixed
   proportion of Gross National Income (GNI) for development assistance
   based on strong public support for UK aid expenditure to reflect
   national interests and values. In this context, there are few clear
   political incentives to cede power over decision-making regarding UK
   Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) to national and local actors in a
   manner required for fundamental localisation of humanitarian response.
   Even where there is a clear potential UK interest-for example,
   bolstering capacity of local actors in contexts vulnerable to
   humanitarian emergency to avert more costly emergency response-the
   public perception of capacity strengthening (compared to life-saving
   humanitarian actions) mitigates against such moves in a climate of
   contested public spending. The establishment of a merged Foreign
   Commonwealth and Development Office in 2020 signals the likelihood of a
   reframing of localisation. While some advancement in terms of some
   logistical and conceptual barriers may be anticipated, issues of both
   national interest and public perceptions of national interest seem
   likely to continue to constrain a more radical implementation of
   localisation, particularly with current suspension of the commitment to
   spend 0.7\% of GNI on ODA.},

Abstract = {This article provides an original analysis of the crisis in
   transatlantic relations during the Trump presidency by drawing on two
   theories of trust: Hoffman's work on trusting interstate relationships,
   focused on decision-makers' policies, and Keating and Ruzicka's work on
   hedging strategies. Hoffman conceptualizes interstate trust as when the
   trustees are expected to ``do what is right{''} because of shared norms
   and values; we compare this fiduciary or moralistic approach with the
   predictive approach, which considers trust a strategic and rational
   choice made by state leaders with material interests and gains in mind.
   Applying this theoretical framework, we examine the impact of Trump's
   ``America First{''} foreign policy on transatlantic relations, showing
   that there has been a pronounced shift from the fiduciary to the
   predictive form of trust, a development that challenges the very essence
   of transatlantic relations. Moreover, we also discuss the hedging
   initiatives adopted by the European allies in order to cope with this
   crisis of trust. The article concludes that in spite of periodic crises
   in the past, Trump's approach to allies and to transatlantic relations
   created a crisis of trust unlike any seen before, one which will not be
   overcome merely by a change of US president.},

Abstract = {Terrorism research has gained much traction since the 9/11 attacks, but
   some sub genres of terrorism, such as right-wing terrorism, have
   remained under-studied areas. Unsurprisingly data sources to study these
   phenomena are scarce and frequently face unique data collection
   obstacles. This paper explores five major, social-scientific terrorism
   databases in regards to data on right-wing terrorist events. The paper
   also provides an in-depth examination of the utilization of criminal
   legal proceedings to research right-wing terrorist acts. Lastly, legal
   case databases are introduced and discussed to show the lack of
   available court information and case proceedings in regards to
   right-wing terrorism.},

   developmental trajectory of growth models, the instabilities and
   dysfunctionalities of these models, and how growth comes to be
   distributed differently across models. Through analysis of capital
   investment patterns and labour market characteristics, it reveals the
   importance of the `politics of productivity', embedded in state
   institutions, which shapes the nature and distribution of economic
   growth. The article outlines a new framework for growth models analysis
   that `brings the supply-side back in' for a more holistic approach to
   the political economy of capitalist growth (and non-growth). It argues
   this is critical for understanding patterns of political economic
   development in the British model of capitalism and beyond.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences of
   nonnative speakers in conflictual situations with native speakers in the
   workplace. In three studies, the authors examine whether nonnative
   speakers experience stereotype threat in workplace conflict situations
   with native speakers, whether stereotype threat is associated with
   certain conflict managing behaviors (e.g. yielding and avoiding) and the
   relationship between stereotype threat, satisfaction with conflict
   outcomes and processes, and objective conflict outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach Studies 1 and 2 use critical incident recall
   methodology to examine nonnative speakers' conflict behaviors and
   satisfaction with conflict outcomes. In Study 3, data were collected
   from a face-to-face simulation with a random-assignment design. Findings
   Findings suggest that nonnative speakers indeed experience heightened
   stereotype threat when interacting with native speakers in conflict
   situations and the experience of stereotype threat leads to less
   satisfaction with conflict outcomes, perceptions of goal attainment, as
   well as worse objective conflict outcomes. Originality/value The current
   study is one of the first studies to document the effects of accent
   stereotype threat on conflict behaviors and outcomes. More broadly, it
   contributes to the conflict studies literature by offering new insight
   into the effects and implications of stereotype threat on workplace
   conflict behaviors and outcomes.},

Abstract = {India currently faces a security dilemma specifically because of the
   rise of China, Russia's strategic convergence with China, and the US's
   indeterminate Indo-Pacific policy stance. To overcome this dilemma,
   India's shift from non-alignment to strategic autonomy poses several
   questions about its future strategic orientation, notably: Will India
   enter into a formal alliance with the USA, will India continue to engage
   China, will India retain close historical relations with Russia or will
   it more robustly pursue its `Act East' policy? This article attempts a
   critical analysis of the different strategic options available to India
   and argues that while entering into a quasi-alliance with the USA, it
   will retain its strategic autonomy. India could simultaneously retain
   relations with Russia, China and the ASEAN. However, to the extent
   possible, its tendency will be to support a multipolar-Asia paradigm
   rather than a zero-sum alliance system to play a leading role in
   international fora.},

Abstract = {While Risse and Wollner make an important contribution to theorising
   global justice and trade, I identify certain concerns with their
   approach and suggest an alternative that addresses these. First, I query
   their emphasis on subjection to the trade regime as a morally salient
   feature, suggesting their argument trades on an ambiguity, and fails to
   connect the trade regime, as a trigger, with their preferred account of
   trade-justice-as-non-exploitation. Second, I examine their treatment of
   the WTO, how they understand international organisations as inheritors
   of states' obligations, and how far an organisation like the WTO can or
   should be self-consciously reoriented towards
   justice-asnon-exploitation. Third, I ask how their account is distinct
   from existing approaches, and whether it makes sense to apply the same
   conception of justice across diverse agents and institutions. I conclude
   by sketching an alternative approach, which makes the justification of
   states' policies to outsiders the central problem of trade justice.},

Abstract = {This paper offers an original theoretical framework for the study of
   insults in international relations (IR). Bringing into IR the two main
   theoretical approaches to aggravating language, slurs and dysphemisms,
   we conceptualize insults' disruptive impact on international
   interactions in a way that explains their logic, consequences, and
   risks. Specifically, we argue that insults constitute both at once
   tactical tools used by international actors to achieve their interests
   by disrupting an interaction and modifying the payoffs associated with
   it and linguistic artifacts constructing and sharpening self- and other
   identities. The components of our theoretical framework are illustrated
   with a wide range of empirical cases of international insults.},

Abstract = {Questions regarding the political significance of international
   relations (IR) and how scholarly practice relates to/constitutes a
   political practice appear newly resonant, but are longstanding concerns.
   This article utilizes the growing literature on temporality within
   international politics to analyze the political potential of these
   intellectual interventions and generate new ways of framing scholarly
   practice. We observe two trends within the field. First, IR as a
   discipline remains largely-although not exclusively-imagined as an
   English-language discipline generated by scholars in the Global North.
   Each area's political discourse is currently dominated by fears
   surrounding foundational political and institutional change due to the
   rise of racialized authoritarianism within these self-imagined
   democratic societies. Despite these purportedly dramatic developments,
   there has not been a similarly dramatic shift in the scholarly
   relationship with politics. Scholars continue to successfully intervene
   in their collective presents, but scholarship itself remains oriented
   toward enduring claims that accumulate knowledge and resist the
   possibility of ``failure.{''} This paper theorizes the temporality of
   critical intervention to better relate positively to the bodies that
   co-constitute our political present. Ultimately, this paper concludes by
   arguing for a reconsideration of contradiction and failure as frames for
   thinking scholarly practice in time.},

Abstract = {Central and Eastern Europe played an important role in British interwar
   international thought. This article contrasts the visions of the region
   found in three key texts written by British scholars in the interwar
   period. Two of these, Halford Mackinder's 1919 Democratic Ideals and
   Reality and E. H. Carr's 1939 Twenty Years' Crisis, share a common
   approach based on an abstract understanding of the nature of
   international order, even while they disagree on their prescriptions for
   Central and Eastern Europe. Starting from abstract principles, they then
   apply their findings to Central and Eastern Europe. By contrast, in her
   1938 Czechs and Germans Elizabeth Wiskemann works in the other
   direction. Through a detailed analysis of the politics of the Bohemian
   historic provinces she comes to conclusions that can be applied to ideas
   of world order. Wiskemann's detailed analysis and Mackinder's and Carr's
   more abstract proscriptions provided different viewpoints on the
   international relations of interwar Central Europe, although ultimately
   all three visions were overtaken by events.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between right-wing radicalism,
   right-wing extremism and fascism by comparing what can be seen as two
   contemporary expressions of the extra-parliamentary far right: the
   neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement and the Europe-wide Generation
   Identity. By analysing the temporal regimes and conceptions of history
   that underlie these two movements, the article highlights how, although
   they belong to different analytical categories (fascism/right-wing
   extremism and right-wing radicalism respectively), both ideologies
   express a vision of the need for a radical renewal of the status quo
   that shares some fundamental assumptions about the nature of history.
   Yet, they convey that historical vision in contrasting terms and
   mobilize different points of reference.},

Abstract = {Why do states participate in bilateral investment treaties (BITs)? In
   this article, I examine the role of indirect investment on BIT
   formation. Indirect investment flows are an important aspect of the
   global investment regime that are underexamined by research focused on
   direct flows only. Indirect flows play an important role in affecting
   incentives for BIT participation because firms channel investment
   through intermediary destinations to take advantage of existing BITs. I
   argue that governments are more likely to participate in BITs when
   states expect to access groups of capital exporting states through
   second order links. When selecting BIT partners, states evaluate
   expected indirect foreign direct investment (FDI) flows by considering
   characteristics of a potential partner's second order FDI partners.
   States are thus more likely to participate in BITs when expectations for
   indirect flows are high. I use a variety of analyses to demonstrate
   evidence in favor of my hypotheses. I find evidence that indirect flows
   affect the likelihood of BIT formation and increase dyadic FDI flows.
   This research provides a novel explanation for BIT formation and
   contributes to research on indirect capital flows, treaty shopping and
   BIT formation.},

Abstract = {How does political accountability in democracies affect leaders'
   incentives for international cooperation? We consider how term limits
   should affect international environmental agreement (IEA) participation.
   Pursuing environmental protection as a public good coincides with the
   political survival incentives of democratic leaders. Term limits
   decouple leaders' policy priorities from their political survival
   incentives, discouraging IEA participation. However, prioritization of
   environmental concerns increases with economic development. As such, the
   effect of term limits on IEA participation should be strongest in rich
   democracies. We test these arguments using data from the International
   Environmental Agreements Database from 1970 to 2011. Democratic leaders,
   particularly in rich democracies, sign fewer IEAs when freed from the
   reelection motive. We also consider the potential that term limits could
   favor IEA participation if doing so aligns with a leader's preferences.
   This potential should be greatest in poor democracies where citizens
   place less emphasis on environmental protection, though we find little
   evidence for this expectation. The findings have important implications
   for understanding the determinants of IEA participation and the
   political accountability-international cooperation relationship. Whereas
   some argue that electoral incentives that cause leaders to favor present
   over future concerns undermine environmental cooperation, our results
   suggest that political accountability in democracies can promote treaty
   participation.},

Abstract = {This study examines how individuals' exposure to ISIS-related propaganda
   affects public sympathy for ISIS. We examine the extent that each type
   of communication channel (e.g. online media, traditional offline media,
   and in-person interactions) affects an individual's perceptions of ISIS.
   We use a nationally representative sample (N = 1,609) from Turkey, which
   has played an important role during the rise and fall of ISIS with its
   unique geographical, social, and political position. The findings
   suggest a significant relationship between exposure to in-person
   propaganda and having sympathy for ISIS. However, this relationship does
   not exist for online and traditional media propaganda.},

Abstract = {Gender stereotypes continue to profoundly impact criminal law
   adjudication despite CEDAW's explicit requirement that state actors
   refrain from stereotyping and eradicate gender stereotypes. This
   comparative study of provocation jurisprudence from three Asian
   jurisdictions-India, Malaysia, and Singapore-employs a feminist lens to
   explore the negative and positive obligations of domestic criminal
   courts when dealing with gender stereotypes pursuant to CEDAW's
   transformative commitments. It argues that these courts should not only
   avoid gender stereotypes but also actively contest such stereotypes in
   judicial decisions by employing gender-informed explanations of harm,
   representing women in a dignified and rights-based manner, and adopting
   interpretations of the law that delegitimize stereotyping.},

Abstract = {`` Shadow reports{''} by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
   national human rights institutions (NHRIs) are commonplace within the
   international human rights treaty monitoring process. They became so for
   a simple reason: shadow reports improve the reporting process by
   providing useful information. This article contends that shadow reports
   from cities would do the same. Using the example of reports sent by the
   City of Berkeley, California, this article advocates for
   institutionalizing city shadow reporting because such reports can
   provide frontline information and help socialize cities into human
   rights compliance, even (and perhaps especially) when at odds with their
   national government.},

Title = {Localizing Global Solidarity: Humanitarian Aid in Lesvos},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {The so-called ``refugee crisis{''} in Lesvos, Greece provides a poignant
   example of situated, local suffering that has called for the
   coordination of global resources to provide relief. Some of the first to
   respond were local and international Citizen Initiatives for Global
   Solidarity (CIGS). While a growing role for CIGS has been interpreted as
   a call for more global involvement, arguments for the increased
   localization of relief efforts suggest the need for aid agents to
   maintain a reflexive awareness of the potential for an influx of outside
   assistance to disempower those most affected. We argue that barriers to
   implementing the localization of humanitarian aid can be better
   understood by positioning this localization alongside theories of global
   solidarity. This paper pairs theoretical contributions from the fields
   of moral and political philosophy with an analysis of interview material
   gathered in Lesvos between 2015 and 2019. Our goal is to use narratives
   of conflicting interests in Lesvos to explore conceptual distinctions
   concerning solidarity and emphasize the importance of the localization
   of global solidarity in humanitarian aid. We conclude that while global
   solidarity represents a demanding effort to identify with distant others
   and provide aid, the intensity and transformative potential of the
   process of ``making the crisis one's own{''} through solidary engagement
   can overshadow the importance of local ownership of crisis management.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine whether a deliberative mini-public can
   provide a trusted source of information in the context of a polarized
   referendum. Political polarization gives rise to selective distrust of
   those on the `other side'. The Citizens' Jury on Referendum Options in
   Korsholm, Finland, was organized in conjunction with a polarized
   referendum on a municipal merger. Our analysis is based on a field
   experiment measuring the effects of reading the jury's statement. We
   find that trust in all public actors was selective, that is, dependent
   on views on the merger, the Citizens' Jury being the only exception.
   Overall, reading the jury's statement increased trust in all public
   actors, including those perceived as being on the `other side'. With
   some caveats, our findings suggest that mini-publics can alleviate
   selective distrust in polarized contexts.},

Abstract = {There are striking differences between state buildings in Ghana and Cote
   d'Ivoire and in how citizens living in each country's capital city think
   and talk about them. In this article, we explore the degree to which
   these buildings illustrate very different ideas of statehood in West
   Africa. We draw on art theories from West Africa to argue that
   architectural aesthetics rest on juxtapositions of beauty and the
   sublime and we suggest ways these help establish state meaning. We then
   apply our aesthetic approach to citizens' evaluations of their state
   buildings in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire and illustrate how differently the
   approach plays out, in Ghana where the state emerges as acclimatized and
   relatively robust and in Cote d'Ivoire where the state emerges as
   idealized and fragile.},

   Ancient Athens},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {International relations often include orders of smaller powers led by
   major powers. Perhaps the most significant aspect of international order
   is whether the major power leader is restrained or nonrestrained.
   Restrained major powers respect smaller powers' preferences, eschew
   wielding power to impose their preferences, and avoid violating the
   smaller powers' sovereignties, often using binding institutions and
   rules. Nonrestrained major powers violate decision-making rules, seek to
   impose their preferences, and violate smaller powers' sovereignties
   using coercion and force. This article asks, what causes an order to
   evolve from restrained to nonrestrained? It argues that when a major
   power grows in strength relative to smaller power order members, the
   major power becomes more likely to abandon restraint, using coercion and
   force to impose its preferences on the order. Further, there is a
   snowball effect, as initial acts of nonrestraint undermine the
   credibility of the major power's commitment to restraint, encouraging
   smaller powers to exit the order, fueling further major power
   nonrestraint. The theory is tested on the fifth-century BCE Athenian
   order. Athens' transition from restraint to nonrestraint, what some call
   a transition from alliance to empire, supports the predictions of the
   theory. Neither ideology nor rent-seeking theories explain this
   transition.},

Abstract = {The war in Yemen has transformed the Iran-Houthi partnership. Iran has
   built significant influence in Yemen since 2015, but the Houthis are not
   a simple arm of its foreign policy: Iran has bandwagoned on Houthi
   successes as much as it has caused them. For Iran, supporting the
   Houthis is an appealing proposition: at a low cost, it has contributed
   to getting Saudi Arabia bogged down in a costly war. This article
   analyses the causes and consequences of the quantitative and qualitative
   shifts in Iran's support for the Houthis. After laying out the strategic
   rationale for the expansion of the partnership, it explains how this has
   represented an important victory for Iran and how these developments
   mirror other trends in the evolution of the constellation of revisionist
   actors Iran supports.},

Abstract = {This contribution presents a short overview on the impact of the Capitol
   Riots riots in Europe. Fear of a similar mass-mediated contagion was
   explicitly expressed by most of the European leaders. Echoes and
   acclamation for the riots in the U.S. were indeed heard on websites,
   QAnon-sites, and within circles of Trump supporters in Europe as well.
   An earlier storming of the German Reichstag (in 2020) was cited. In the
   Netherlands, the curfew riots of 24-25 January 2021 also were put into
   this context. Security agencies and officials in the U.K. and the
   Netherlands repeated this threat awareness in recent, formal threat
   assessments.},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: This article arises from a study of the history of
   the FARC-EP's Bloque Caribe. It seeks to broaden current explanations of
   the guerilla's territorial expansion by using elements that come from
   cultural analysis. We discuss some habits of thought about this
   expansion by examining its chronology and the political and artistic
   contributions of the Union Patriotica movement's cohort that joined the
   insurgent group. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review of the
   historical and documentary sources of the FARC-EP. We interviewed former
   guerrillas and local politicians between 2018 and 2020. Conclusions: The
   history of the FARC-EP's territorial expansion process must incorporate
   the guerrilla's II Conference decisions. Furthermore, the strong
   relationship between the ``political center{''} and the
   ``decentralized{''} groups of the insurgency allowed the ``cohort{''} of
   UP activists who joined the organization to strengthen the guerrilla
   with musical and radio projects. These projects were given a national
   diffusion by the FARC-EP's Secretariat that transformed them into
   central elements of the guerrilla's cultural policy. Originality: We
   offer a new reflection on the territorial expansion of the guerrillas in
   Colombia, including new questions about their time frame, motivations,
   and practices. We also suggest an interpretation of the encounters
   between the guerillas and regional societies that explores sociocultural
   elements. We focus on the complex interdependencies between the national
   and regional level of the guerrilla and how the organization
   appropriated elements of the regional culture -like vallenato- to
   accumulate symbolic power, cultural legitimacy and gain national
   relevance.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted
   international non-governmental organization (INGO) funding. We argue
   that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the
   operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do
   not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors.
   Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support
   for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in
   charitable organizations influence individuals' preferences to donate,
   especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market
   for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally
   representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly
   donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in
   shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social
   trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with
   host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or
   crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust
   prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or
   crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour
   NGOs' least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical
   implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic
   space.},

Abstract = {Across East Africa, mobile phones and tablets are increasingly sitting
   in the hands of community health workers, clinicians, managers and
   patients. They are being used for a widening range of functions from
   diagnostics to health insurance to treatment advice, generating hopes
   for new healthcare futures and establishing the region as an emerging
   hub of experimentation in digital health. Drawing on our on-going
   ethnographic and anthropological research in Kenya and Tanzania, this
   article explores the dynamic, varied, experimental, and increasingly
   financialised terrain of formal digital health projects. While
   innovation in digital health is a growing feature of healthcare across
   the globe, in East Africa it is entering into a region already long
   characterised by NGOised, fragmented and vertical healthcare systems and
   heavy dependence on foreign capital. This presents challenges to
   efforts, including the WHO's Universal Health Coverage agenda, to foster
   national and equitable public healthcare systems. In exploring these
   issues, we recognise the power, and often deleterious effects, of
   financial capital that foregrounds markets in global digital health, but
   we also open space for a (still critical) recognition of East
   African-led digital and data technology movements.},

Abstract = {Social accountability reforms emphasize expanding performance
   information disclosure and incorporating citizen feedback into
   performance evaluations of public organizations. However, social
   accountability scholarship has largely ignored possible discriminatory
   implications of performance information use despite calls for more
   social equity research. We look to bridge these two literatures, arguing
   that increasing exposure to performance information can actually
   activate racial bias in citizen feedback. Using two samples of White
   MTurk participants residing in the United States, we test this argument
   in a Negative Performance Information Study (n = 800) and a Positive
   Performance Information Study (n = 800). In the Negative Performance
   Information Study, we find increased exposure to negative performance
   information triggers more negative performance evaluations of public
   organizations led by Black public managers, but not White public
   managers, and strengthens preferences to fire Black public managers, but
   not White public managers. In the Positive Performance Information
   Study, we find increased exposure to positive performance information
   has no impact on performance evaluations of Black, nor White public
   managers but strengthens preferences to reappoint White, but not Black
   public managers. These findings suggest increasing exposure to
   performance information triggers racial bias in performance evaluations
   and preferences for holding public managers accountable.},

Abstract = {Public values (PV) are receiving growing attention in public
   administration research and scholars frequently stress the need for
   public leaders to commit to and promote PV to protect the public
   interest and build citizens' trust in government. However, the
   relationship between public leaders' commitment to PV and
   intra-organizational, behavioral outcomes has received much less
   theoretical and empirical attention.To help address this gap, we draw on
   the social identity theory of leadership to propose that leaders in
   street-level bureaucracies who are perceived to be committed to PV are
   also more likely to be perceived as charismatic leaders and that these
   leadership attributions will be associated with lower employee turnover,
   especially in more stressful work contexts. We test our hypotheses with
   ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression. Additional
   mediation tests were conducted with structural equation modeling. Based
   on a sample of 87 public organizations and 874 participants, our results
   reveal that perceived leader commitment to PV is positively associated
   with perceived charismatic leadership which, in turn, is associated with
   lower employee turnover in more stressful and demanding work
   environments. This study brings more publicness to public leadership
   studies and can inform public leaders on how to develop more engaging
   and inspirational forms of leadership with their constituencies.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite burgeoning interest in knowledge hiding (KH), there are
   still significant gaps in the understanding of the boundary conditions
   under which KH is more or less likely to occur. To address this research
   gap, the researchers examined abusive supervision as an interpersonal
   antecedent of KH. In addition, this paper aims to investigate the
   moderating roles of negative reciprocity beliefs (NRB) and moral
   disengagement (MD) in the relationship between abusive supervision and
   KH. Design/methodology/approach Two-wave data using a non-experimental
   face-to-face method was collected from 257 service employees in
   Pakistan, which supported the hypothesized model. Considering minimum
   sample size requirements (i.e. n = 208) in partial least squares
   structural equation modeling, the researchers analyzed a two-stage
   approach to test the measurement model and the structural model.
   Findings The study found that abusive supervision was positively related
   to evasive hiding and playing dumb but not associated with rationalized
   hiding. Further, the results confirm the moderating roles of NRB and MD.
   The positive relationships between abusive supervision and evasive
   hiding and playing dumb are intensified at high levels of NRB and MD.
   Originality/value Given the complicated nature of KH, this is one of the
   few efforts that outstretch the boundary conditions of KH.},

Abstract = {This essay considers secrets, spies and newspaper editors in the context
   of the Washington Post's relationship with the CIA. The associated
   relationships and thoughts of Ben Bradlee, long-serving editor of the
   Washington Post and one of America's most iconic journalists, are
   examined in detail. Bradlee spent much time reflecting on what the
   appropriate relationship between spies and the media should be and this
   is captured in his correspondence. This article argues that because the
   tensions between national security secrets and a free press were often
   negotiated informally though personal networks, this terrain is best
   analysed using ideas borrowed from social history. Editors were often
   wily mediators between Washington's twin worlds of secrecy and
   publicity. It also suggests that in considering the CIA and the press,
   we need to give a little less attention to intrepid reporters and more
   attention to editors and owners who exercised more power. Overall, this
   realm is one of human relationships, best viewed not through the prism
   of policy documents, but through private papers or interviews.},

Title = {The Dark Side of Transnational Mobility: Croatian Travel Writers in

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {924-947},

Abstract = {This article analyses the use of Europeanizing discourses in the travel
   writing of Croat visitors to the Third Reich. Situating these visits in
   the context of transnational exchanges in Hitler's new Europe and the
   war against the Soviet Union, it considers a number of specific case
   studies of travel between Croatia and Nazi Germany. It argues that the
   European discourse of writers, journalists, and youth activists in the
   Ustasha-led Independent State of Croatia served a number of specific
   purposes. First, they created a space of normality in an extremely
   violent state, providing an illusion of stability. By bringing the
   sights, sounds, and pleasures of travel to the near abroad back to
   Croatia in the form of books, magazine articles, and mobile film reels,
   they also gave citizens a glimpse of the good life, consumption, and
   materiality. As such, these travelogues and accounts of journeys
   overseas also aimed to persuade intellectuals and members of the
   cultural elite who did not support the Ustasha regime of the various
   material and professional ``club goods{''} that might accrue to them by
   becoming active supporters of the regime. Furthermore, they served to
   create an impression of mobility in a surveillance state in which even
   internal travel was extremely restricted. Finally, in depicting Nazi-led
   war in the East and the struggle against the ``East within{''}-in the
   form of the campaign of genocide against Serbs, Jews, Roma and so-called
   ``asocials{''}-to building European brotherhood, modernization, and
   becoming an essential member of the new Europe, they became a source of
   regime legitimation, thereby telling us important things about the
   subjectivity of both the state and ideological tourists in a time of
   terror, war, and occupation.},

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {This Symposium features research that engages an institutional analysis
   approach, called the Institutional Grammar. Institutional analysis is
   the study of rules, norms, and strategies (e.g., public policies,
   organizational bylaws, social conventions) that govern social systems
   and organizations. The Institutional Grammar is an approach for
   comprehensively capturing the design of institutions; in particular, for
   describing the language of directives that comprise them. We posit that
   the engagement of the Institutional Grammar in public administration
   research can advance understanding of institutional dynamics of
   administrative settings and behaviors by lending conceptual and
   methodological clarity on the definition and measurement of
   institutions. In support of this position, we (i) provide a brief
   commentary on institutional analysis in public administration research;
   (ii) offer a brief overview of the Institutional Grammar; and (iii)
   highlight how methodological innovations presented in the Symposium
   articles advance the Institutional Grammar, and present opportunities
   for advancing institutional analysis in administrative settings.},

Abstract = {While the presidency of Donald Trump has come to an end, the debate
   about its theoretical classification is in full swing. Some have argued
   that Trump's foreign policy stands in the tradition of Jacksonianism -
   one of the four schools of thought identified by Walter R. Mead. Others
   believe Trumpism (or, for that matter, Trumpianism) to constitute a
   school in its own right. This article suggests that Trump's foreign
   policy is both old and new in that it draws on Jacksonianism but
   combines it with Jeffersonianism - a combination unseen since, at least,
   the end of the Cold War. Examining the foreign policies of the five
   American post-Cold War presidents through the lens of Mead's four
   schools of thought, the article shows that Trump's
   Jacksonianism-Jeffersonianism contrasts sharply with the
   Wilsonianism-Hamiltonianism of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, but
   that it is only a partial departure from the Wilsonianism-Jacksonianism
   of George W. Bush and the Wilsonianism-Jeffersonianism of Barack Obama.
   What strikes many observers as odd about Trump's presidency, it is
   claimed, has less to do with the content than with the style of his
   foreign policy, which, again, can be explained by the unlikely coalition
   of Jacksonianism and Jeffersonianism the president embraced.},

Abstract = {Contradicting the existing refugee studies literature criticizing
   China's passive engagement in international refugee protection, China
   accepted as many as 300,000 Vietnamese refugees ((sic)侨) of Chinese
   descent in the wake of the Vietnam War and resettled them on state-owned
   farms in southern China. By focusing on Vietnamese refugees on a
   state-owned farm on the Leizhou Peninsula, South China, this study
   examines the (im)mobility experience of resettled Vietnamese refugees in
   China, through which the fluctuation of citizenship is reflected. This
   paper brings the ignored dimension of the state into the analysis of
   (im)mobility. While showing how the resettlement regime shapes the
   mobility and immobility experience of Vietnamese refugees in China, this
   study demonstrates their agency in relation to the desire for four
   statuses of mobility and immobility. Meanwhile, this paper demonstrates
   the fluctuation of citizenship of the group of resettled Vietnamese
   refugees over the past four decades. In doing so, it expands the scope
   of existing literature on migration and refugee studies to an
   understudied country of destination, China, and helps us better
   understand the complexity of refugees' experiences within broader
   socio-economic and politico-institutional changes.},

Abstract = {Building on Ernest Gellner's theory of the nation-state and drawing on
   insights from John Lukacs and George Kennan, this article contends that
   the major powers of the contemporary Indo-Pacific are characterized by
   conflicting nationalisms. Homogenizing nationalism seeks to form China-a
   former multiethnic empire-into a unitary nation-state. Budding fascism
   endeavors to transform India-founded as a secular state-into a Hindu
   nation in which there is little place for the `other.' And in the USA,
   truculent exceptionalism readily acknowledges that coexistence with
   China is no longer possible in the long run. All three powers have an
   alternative that they might embrace: toleration. But civility, in both
   domestic and international politics, is increasingly rare. The future of
   world order in the Indo-Pacific does not look bright.},

Abstract = {Empirical data have indicated that radical Islamists often interpret
   their everyday life as embedded in religion. Nonetheless, the research
   field has at times tended to downplay the religious dimensions of
   radicalization processes. This paper aims to reinstate religion in
   analyses of radicalization by introducing the theoretical approach of
   everyday religion. By utilizing this approach, the paper argues that
   when religion, in the minds of radical Islamists themselves, has an
   effect on everyday lives and practices, then religion plays a
   substantial role in their radicalization process. The potential of the
   approach is illustrated through an analysis of interviews with former
   converts to radical Islamism.},

Abstract = {Can ambitious climate policies in the European Green Deal succeed when
   faced with rising societal divisions between Europeans? This paper
   undertakes an empirical analysis using data from the European Social
   Survey to see whether the divisions between cosmopolitan and
   communitarian Europeans evident in other policy fields like migration
   are also found in relation to climate and energy. The results show that
   political ideology is most important determinant of individual
   attitudes, and that differences in attitudes between Eastern and Western
   Europe may be explained by energy security and economic development
   issues. The EU has maintained an ambitious policy since the mid-2010s,
   and with the Green Deal appears to be framing climate ambition in ways
   that the data suggests may reduce communitarian opposition, but not the
   differences between EU Member States resulting from security concerns.},

Abstract = {How do policing institutions affect the prospects for peace in
   post-conflict settings? We present a principal-agent theoretical
   framework to explain how the institutional design of policing affects
   the recurrence of civil conflict. We argue that the fragmentation of
   police forces can reignite conflict dynamics by impeding coordinated
   action, undermining information sharing, and enabling agents to pursue
   their own interests. We test these expectations with the Police Force
   Organization Dataset (PFOD) on police forces in over 100 developing
   states. Our empirical analyses show that increasing the number of
   distinct police forces is systematically associated with an increased
   risk of conflict recurrence in post-conflict states. We also find that a
   larger number of police forces is associated with more abuse against
   civilian populations in post-conflict states, setting the stage for new
   grievances that may undermine peace.},

Title = {The Local-National Gap in Intergroup Attitudes and Far-Right
   Underperformance in Local Elections},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {The far right typically performs worse in local elections than in
   national ones. We propose that a key reason for this underperformance is
   the difference in how intergroup attitudes manifest and are informed in
   local and national settings. We document the existence of a
   local-national gap in intergroup attitudes through survey experiments
   and open-ended survey questions that randomly vary whether
   study-participants are asked about the national or the local setting. In
   the first experiment, we find a substantial local-national gap, where
   the influx of refugees during the refugee crisis was seen as instigating
   changes in the national setting, but rarely locally. In the second
   experiment, we investigate the perceived amount and nature of public
   discussions about refugees and immigration. We again find a substantial
   local-national gap. Compared to discussions in the local setting, there
   is a perception of more discussion in the national setting, and the
   nature of those discussions are perceived as more heated, conflictual,
   and biased than local discussions. We also find a local-national gap in
   information sources about refugees and immigration in a final study. In
   local questions, native citizens are more likely to rely on everyday
   experiences and social networks. In national questions, they are more
   likely to rely on media representations. These local-national gaps are
   seen in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Importantly, we also find the
   gap among respondents who had an asylum seeker center established in
   their local community recently. The local-national gaps in intergroup
   attitudes revealed here can account for patterns in far-right electoral
   performance that so far have remained puzzling, and they deserve further
   attention in future research both in political science and social
   psychology.},

Abstract = {What is the legacy of war, violence, and displacement on altruism toward
   diverse populations suffering similar hardships today? Prior research
   suggests these hardships have the potential to increase empathy that can
   in turn motivate altruism across identity boundaries. We test this
   hypothesis using survey data collected in 2017 from over 2,000 Syrians
   living in rebel-held regions where many internally displaced persons
   (IDPs) sought refuge. We find that Syrians previously exposed to
   violence were more likely to host IDPs. Using a conjoint experiment to
   measure hosting preferences over different types of IDPs, we show that
   these individuals also preferred to host sick and vulnerable IDPs and
   outgroup IDPs from the Kurdish ethnic minority. However, they were less
   likely to host IDPs from the Christian minority, possibly due to their
   association with the government. These results suggest that empathy and
   politics both play an important role in shaping the relationship between
   violence, altruism, and intergroup behavior during conflict.},

Abstract = {This article theorises epistemologies of `space' in critical studies on
   terrorism, expanding the research agenda beyond the straitjacket of
   historicism and discourse-centrism. It traces two theoretical
   approaches: 1) rescaling terrorism as mundane, situated and private, and
   2) treating the `space' of terrorism as a liminal zone between
   potentiality and anticipatory space-making. This critical spatial lens
   offers new insights to CTS. In terms of securitisation, this perspective
   is attentive to the `space of securitisation', the dynamics of space, or
   space as a discursive process and a subject constitutive of
   securitisation. In the study of radicalisation, it can help us
   understand how space and the psychological interpretation of material
   conditions are co-constituted to shape the process of radicalisation.
   Finally, it also creates new possibilities for CTS practitioners to
   employ the embodied, embodying and sensory dimensions of violence,
   involving not only visual and material dimensions but also sound and
   hearing, to form an individualised form of resistance against state
   terrorism. This article attempts to systematically map the permutations
   of new theoretical and conceptual developments in the critical studies
   on the spatiality of terrorism.},

Abstract = {The global financial safety net (GFSN) has become a complex regime.
   Regional financial arrangements (RFAs) have emerged alongside
   established IMF structures. How relevant are RFAs and the IMF in moments
   of financial crisis? And more specifically: Do member countries resort
   to RFAs as complements or as substitutes to IMF lending? To answer these
   questions, we developed an original data-set on the GSFN use by the 61
   emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) that are members of
   existing RFAs between 1976 and 2018. We find that not only economic
   criteria such as lending volume, timeliness and conditionality drive
   patterns of complementarity and substitution in crisis finance, but that
   RFA governance structure and regional independence matters. The data
   show that borrower-dominated RFAs are used much more frequently than
   creditor-dominated RFAs. Moreover, RFAs which lack regional policy
   autonomy but are dependent on the IMF are not called upon - even if they
   have far superior volumes of potential lending capacity.},

Abstract = {Left-wing terrorism and extremism have received limited scholarly
   attention beyond a focus on large terrorist groups and violent campaigns
   between the 1970s and 1990s (e.g. German Red Army Faction, Italian Red
   Brigades, or Weather Underground in the United States). This article
   discusses the contribution of German research regarding disengagement
   from left-wing terrorism and extremism, as well as field experiences
   from Germany in the field of preventing and countering violent left-wing
   extremism. Significant research and prevention practice gaps severely
   limit knowledge in this regard. Available evidence mostly stems from
   highly structured and strategically operating groups from past decades.},

Abstract = {A common regulatory dilemma is determining how much trust authorities
   can place in people's self-reports, especially in contexts with an
   incentive to cheat. In such contexts, regulators are typically risk
   averse and do not readily confer trust, resulting in excessive
   requirements when applying for permits, licenses, etc. Studies in
   behavioral ethics have suggested that asking people to ex-ante pledge to
   behave ethically can reduce their level of dishonesty and noncompliance.
   However, pledges might also backfire by allowing more people to cheat
   with no real sanctions. Additionally, pledges' effects have almost
   always been studied in one-shot decision making without sanctions. We
   explore pledges' potential effects by manipulating whether pledges were
   accompanied by sanctions (fines) and testing their impact on sequential,
   repeated ethical decisions. We find that pledges can considerably and
   consistently reduce dishonesty, and this effect is not crowded out by
   the presence of fines. Furthermore, pledges also affect ``brazen
   liars{''} who cheat to a large extent and also those who score low on
   tendency to follow rules and norms. We conclude that pledges could be an
   effective tool for the behavioral regulation of dishonesty, to reduce
   regulatory burden, and to build a more trusting relationship between
   government and the public.},

Abstract = {Why do some firms pay more bribes than others? We extend the literature
   by examining the role of one crucial, but overlooked industry
   characteristic-fixed-asset intensity-in shaping firms' bribe payments.
   High fixed-asset intensity creates natural entry barriers, thereby
   resulting in market concentration and opportunities for monopoly rent
   extraction. High rents, in turn, increase the value of government
   officials' ``control rights{''} and thus their incentive to engage in
   predatory behavior. Firms in fixed-asset intensive industries therefore
   have strong incentives to pay bribes in exchange for de facto property
   rights. We further posit that strong enforcement of the law weakens this
   quid pro quo by providing security for property rights and increasing
   the risk for government officials' behaving corruptly. We find empirical
   support for our arguments based on data from a large firm survey in
   China. Our findings have important implications for governance and
   industrial regulations in developing countries.},

Title = {Exposure and Aversion to Human Transmissible Diseases Predict
   Conservative Ideological and Partisan Preferences},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {The objective prevalence of and subjective vulnerability to infectious
   diseases are associated with greater ingroup preference, conformity, and
   traditionalism. However, evidence directly testing the link between
   infectious diseases and political ideology and partisanship is lacking.
   Across four studies, including a large sample representative of the U.S.
   population (N > 12,000), we demonstrate that higher environmental levels
   of human transmissible diseases and avoidance of germs from human
   carriers predict conservative ideological and partisan preferences.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 848), we replicated this germ aversion
   finding and determined that these conservative preferences were
   primarily driven by avoidance of germs from outgroups (foreigners)
   rather than ingroups (locals). Moreover, socially conservative
   individuals expressed lower concerns of being susceptible to contracting
   infectious diseases during the pandemic and worried less about COVID-19.
   These effects were robust to individual-level and state-level controls.
   We discuss these findings in light of theory on parasite stress and the
   behavioral immune system and with regard to the political implications
   of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {As a part of the Strategy for modernization, customs administrations
   face a need for the introduction of new communication information
   technologies (ICTs) that builds on a long and successful European
   history on technology and innovation. Hence, apart from compliance of
   legislation that prescribes customs procedures, customs authorities face
   important decisions regarding design and implementation. In that
   context, this empirical research explores the extent to what
   digitalization of the Customs Administration of Serbia can improve the
   customs transit performances, in terms of enforcement of trading policy,
   without applying certain managerial tools, such as process thinking in
   lean innovation. The final data analysis of the research indicates that
   managing the organization through the functional units, rather than the
   processes, and without applying lean principles to the digital
   transformation initiative would not completely standardize the customs
   transit procedure.},

Abstract = {Studying the so-called refugee crisis in Germany, this article asks
   about the effectiveness of crisis management by a large number of local
   administrations, each acting upon the same crisis impulse of a high
   number of asylum seekers who entered the country in 2015 and 2016.
   Instead of theorizing the exact administrative design features fit for
   an effective crisis response, the focus is on the ability of
   administrations to adjust. We conceptualize such shifts in
   administrative practices as informal and temporary (latent) deviations
   from routine action along two dimensions of organizational behavior
   typically dominant in private and nonprofit sector organizations,
   respectively: internal flexibility and citizen participation
   (hybridity). Novel survey data from 235 out of 401 German district
   authorities are reported. We test the effects of different forms of
   latent hybridization on administrative effectiveness using regression
   modeling. Findings indicate that changes in administrative practices
   towards more flexible and participatory action had a positive impact on
   self-reported crisis management effectiveness. The effect of flexible
   action was especially pronounced in districts that were allocated higher
   shares of asylum seekers. These findings advance theory on crisis
   management and bottom-up implementation, highlighting the ability of
   local agencies to shift practices as a key explanatory factor for
   effective administrative action in exceptional situations.},

Abstract = {Participants may lose faith in collaborative governance processes if
   they do not perceive internal decision-making processes to be
   legitimate. Yet, understanding how to assess internal legitimacy and
   what network characteristics are associated with it has been an enduring
   challenge. In this article, we propose conceptualizing internal
   legitimacy as multi-vectored, contrasting input legitimacy-the degree of
   openness and access that participants experience in their attempt to
   offer voice-with throughput legitimacy-the quality of the
   decision-making process itself. Using data from a comparative case study
   of 18 different US Department of Housing and Urban Development
   (HUD)-mandated Continuums of Care, we assess this framework with a
   mixed-methods approach, combining thematic analysis of interview data (n
   = 145) with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to show (1)
   differences in how participants experience input and throughput
   legitimacy, (2) the nature of the relationship between input and
   throughput legitimacy, and (3) what specific network characteristics are
   associated with positive assessments of each. Our findings indicate that
   input and throughput legitimacy are distinct but related-throughput
   legitimacy is harder to achieve and dependent on positive assessments of
   input legitimacy. Some network characteristics, particularly large size
   and commissioner-style network management, pose challenges, but a focus
   on in-person engagement can help ameliorate them. We conclude that
   distinguishing between input and throughput legitimacy can help managers
   identify where and how to intervene in order to improve the legitimacy
   of decision-making processes in collaborative governance networks.Y},

Title = {Memory and the integration. The European parliament's 2019 resolution on
   European remembrance as a case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Abstract = {In September 2019, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that
   sparked controversy due to its equation of Nazism and Communism. The
   document made the USSR jointly responsible for the outbreak of the
   Second World War and accused the Russian government of whitewashing
   communist crimes and glorifying the Soviet totalitarian regime. This
   article presents the resolution as the latest expression of a broader
   discursive process that started with the accession process of the
   Central and Eastern European countries. To support this hypothesis, I
   examine the genealogy of the resolution, namely the documents that
   originally outlined the stances expressed by the latter, as well as the
   debates at the EU Parliament that preceded its adoption. This analysis
   highlights in particular two fundamental tendencies, i.e. the
   entanglement of history and memory characterising the recent discourse
   on European integration and the frequent identification of the Central
   and Eastern European member states as victims. In the final paragraphs,
   I suggest that the construction of a shared `historical memory' may
   represent a legitimising framework for the implementation of specific
   sets of political and economic ideas, but I also note that processes
   such as the one described in the article may ultimately damage the
   cohesion among the member states and the ability of the EU institutions
   to address relevant internal and external issues.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There are two rival conceptions of power in modern sociopolitical
   thought. According to one, all social power reduces to
   power-over-others. According to another, the core notion is
   power-to-effect-outcomes, to which even power-over reduces. This article
   defends seven theses. First, agential social power consists in a
   relation between agent and outcomes (power-to). Second, not all social
   power reduces to power-over and, third, the contrary view stems from
   conflating power-over with a distinct notion: power-despite-resistance.
   Fourth, the widespread assumption that social power presupposes the
   capacity to overcome resistance is false: social power includes the
   capacity to effect outcomes with others' assistance. Fifth, power-with
   can be exercised via joint intentional action, strategic coordination
   and non-strategic coordination. Sixth, agential social power is best
   analysed as a capacity to effect outcomes, with the assistance of
   others, despite the resistance of yet others. Seventh, power-over and
   power-with are not mutually exclusive: each can ground the other.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {258-276},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {One way of understanding calls for `multispecies justice' is to
   interpret them as utopian demands for a desirable future in which the
   structural anthropocentrism of conventional forms of morality, including
   environmental ethics, has been thoroughly abolished. I hope to clarify
   what kind of utopia multispecies justice might specifically entail.
   Mobilizing a conceptual framework developed by the science fiction
   author Octavia Butler, three potential plotlines for the utopia of
   multispecies justice are identified: the What-If, the If-Only and the
   If-This-Goes-On. Each of these engages the various tasks of utopianism
   in interestingly different ways. The key argument is that multispecies
   justice primarily raises a challenging What-If question: as a critical
   interrogation of how we should process and experience the world (and our
   place within it), its power derives from the `educated hope' to disrupt
   and reassemble outdated frameworks for making sense of the
   nature/culture divide.},

Abstract = {We find firm-level evidence that US banks receive preferential treatment
   in countries under IMF conditionality. We rely on investment location
   decisions to infer firms' expectations about future profits and find
   that US firms are approximately 53 percent more likely to acquire
   financial firms in countries under financial conditionality. IMF
   programs without financial conditionality and FDI in other sectors serve
   as placebo tests. Financial conditionality has weak effects on
   investment decisions by non-US firms, which implies a political-economy
   interpretation. Firm-level data indicate that the distinctive behavior
   of US firms is not due to advantages of scale or to a US-firm fixed
   effect, but to US influence in the IMF. Firms from other major IMF
   shareholders benefit as well, but the effects are much weaker. The
   effects are concentrated in the politically relevant firms that have
   local affiliates, which is consistent with the interpretation that firms
   lobby for preferential treatment.},

Abstract = {Services that are especially suited to being offered via online labor
   platforms, such as cleaning, driving and tutoring, are frequently
   performed in an informal way, especially in emerging-market countries.
   The informal economy is thus important for recruiting workers for labor
   platforms. Platform use, however, requires formal service provision,
   which workers in the informal economy often resist. Thus, labor
   platforms have to promote workers' transition from informal to formal
   service provision. While recent studies have hinted at labor platforms'
   fostering of formal economic activity, we know little about how such
   intermediation unfolds. We use a process lens and comprehensive
   qualitative data on labor platforms in Panama and Mexico to study how
   labor platforms steer workers to formal service provision. Detailing the
   interactive process of workers transitioning to formal service provision
   as triggered by labor platforms, we add to platform research and
   literature on intermediation between informal and formal economic
   activity.},

Title = {Speaking of hybrid warfare: Multiple narratives and differing expertise
   in the `hybrid warfare' debate in Czechia},

Abstract = {What do we speak of when we speak of `hybrid warfare', a notion that has
   become prominent in discussions of European security? The article shows
   that this question is difficult to answer, as the hybrid warfare
   discourse is not only vague, but also consists of multiple, and at times
   contradictory, narratives. While talking and writing about supposedly
   the same thing, participants in the hybrid warfare debate often suggest
   markedly different ideas about the precise nature and target of the
   threat, offer different responses and draw upon different expertise.
   Grounding our argument in critical scholarship on narratives, security
   knowledge and hybrid warfare, we build a framework for studying security
   narratives around the four elements of threat, threatened value,
   response and underlying knowledge. This framework is utilised in a case
   study of Czechia, a country that has played a pioneering and outsized
   role in European hybrid warfare debates. We identify three narratives of
   hybrid warfare - defence, counterinfluence and education - which present
   markedly different understandings of `hybrid warfare', and ways to
   defend against it. Our intervention hopes to contribute to disentangling
   the contradictions of the hybrid warfare discourse, itself a necessary
   precondition for both sound state policy and an informed public debate.},

   endangerment and conflict violence by combining insights from the fields
   of political science and linguistics. We develop a theoretical account
   of the manner in which the violence and disruption of community life
   jeopardizes the viability of communities that speak endangered
   languages. Our goals for this paper are to synthesize the contributions
   linguists and political scientists have made to the study of language
   endangerment and political violence; develop a theoretical account of
   language endangerment; and utilize statistical analysis to correlate
   factors related to political conflict and violence with language
   endangered communities. We test our theoretical model on language
   endangerment across the municipalities of Colombia and find support for
   our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Feminization of terror is a significant issue in the light of its
   etiology, scale, and effects. Moreover, it is a social problem that
   arose in psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, and politics.
   This article aims to analyze only a part of this complicated matter. The
   article has put an emphasis on the motives that drive women to take up
   such a risky and dangerous practice, as well as on the specifics of
   their activities in four organizations: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
   Eelam, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, Chechen Kavkazskiy

Abstract = {Are European Parliament (EP) elections used to pass judgement on the
   legislative behaviour of parties serving in the EP? Do Europeans give a
   bonus in EP elections to political parties whose members were highly
   active during the legislative term? The article will focus on the role
   of legislative activities in the eighth EP term (2014-2019) in informing
   the 2019 vote choice. The analysis combines the European Election
   Studies (EESs) 2019 Voter Study data with original legislative behaviour
   data, as well as with data on European electoral systems. The evidence
   points to productivity-based retrospective voting being a feature of the
   2019 elections. Furthermore, the analysis finds that this type of
   retrospective voting is stronger in countries where electoral rules
   encourage candidates to promote past legislative records in electoral
   campaigns, and particularly so for voters that paid attention to the EP
   campaign in such systems. This has significant implications for the
   retrospective voting and EU elections literatures, since it is evidence
   that the very demanding democratic desiderata of retrospection can be
   met in multi-level and supranational contexts as well.},

Abstract = {This article presents an update to the ViEWS political Violence
   Early-Warning System. This update introduces (1) a new infrastructure
   for training, evaluating, and weighting models that allows us to more
   optimally combine constituent models into ensembles, and (2) a number of
   new forecasting models that contribute to improve overall performance,
   in particular with respect to effectively classifying high- and low-risk
   cases. Our improved evaluation procedures allow us to develop models
   that specialize in either the immediate or the more distant future. We
   also present a formal, `retrospective' evaluation of how well ViEWS has
   done since we started publishing our forecasts from July 2018 up to
   December 2019. Our metrics show that ViEWS is performing well when
   compared to previous out-of-sample forecasts for the 2015-17 period.
   Finally, we present our new forecasts for the January 2020-December 2022
   period. We continue to predict a near-constant situation of conflict in
   Nigeria, Somalia, and DRC, but see some signs of decreased risk in
   Cameroon and Mozambique.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Norbert Elias's writing and sociology of emotion literature,
   this study proposes viewing neoliberalization as a ``civilizing
   process,{''} which is enabled by politics of shaming. By tracing two
   streams of protests triggered by neoliberal transformations-by farmers
   and schoolteachers-in the 1990s and how they were handled by the ruling
   elite publicly in the mass media, this article finds that, in post
   Soviet and neoliberal Latvia, in moments of tension between the state
   and society, rule occurred through a politics of shaming that utilized
   three instruments: the neoliberal ideology of a good citizen,
   essentializing language, and dividing language. This article contributes
   to the post-Soviet studies' scholarship, the growing body of scholarship
   that explores relationships between neoliberalization and emotions, as
   well as social movements literature.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As the so-called liberal international order has come under duress, the
   problem of `peaceful change' has reappeared on the agenda of
   International Relations (IR), mainly in a realist guise drawing upon
   E.H. Carr and Robert Gilpin's renditions of the problem. Making a
   conceptual archaeological intervention, this paper recovers
   long-neglected multidisciplinary debates on `peaceful change' taking
   place in the tumultuous interwar period. It concurs that peaceful change
   is an IR problem par excellence, central to academic debates in the
   burgeoning interwar discipline, but also a more complex conceptual
   figure than posterity portrays it. The paper explores the debates
   between negative and positive conceptions of peaceful change, between
   political, legal-institutional and communitarian mechanisms of peaceful
   change, and different policies of peaceful change, particularly its
   troubled relationship to appeasement. The paper concludes that the
   interwar debate on peaceful change, while highly embedded in its
   context, does offer IR an alternative and more aspirational perspective
   on the problem of power and order transitions.},

Abstract = {Many countries have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to
   stop unauthorized migration, but most evidence suggests that immigration
   enforcement policies do not effectively deter migrants. We draw on
   literature from social psychology, specifically the dual-system model of
   decision-making, which differentiates between judgments that are subject
   to considerations of risks and costs and judgments that are
   ``non-consequentialist.{''} Non-consequentialist decision-making is
   founded in moral intuition and rejects rational considerations of costs
   and benefits. This mental process would render the deterrence tools of
   the state powerless. We posit that some, but not all, forms of
   unauthorized migration will invoke non-consequentialist decision-making.
   When considering semi-legal strategies, which individuals may perceive
   as ``bending the law{''} rather than breaking it, aspiring migrants are
   likely to weigh the risks and costs of enforcement policies. Meanwhile,
   when considering fully illegal migration strategies, aspiring migrants
   will prioritize moral considerations for breaking the law rather than
   the consequences of breaking the law. We find evidence for our theory
   using original population-based list experiments along with focus groups
   of aspiring migrants in an origin country.},

Abstract = {Leadership turnover brings to office new leaders with private
   reputational incentives to bluff about their resolve, incentivizing both
   incumbents and their foreign rivals to take steps that increase the risk
   of war. Some leader changes, however, are more dangerous than others.
   The turnover trap arises when there is sufficient uncertainty about a
   new leader's resolve and expectations of future interactions, and
   whether those factors coincide depends on how new leaders come to power
   and the political system in which its turnover occurs. We expect that
   those instances of leader change most likely to generate turnover traps
   entail (1) democratic incumbents unconnected to their predecessor's
   support coalition and (2) autocratic incumbents that inherit their
   predecessors' coalitions. In a sample of strategic rivals from
   1918-2007, we find that the probability of dispute escalation declines
   over leaders' tenure, but only for the two types of turnover we identify
   as most dangerous.},

Abstract = {Attention to informal communication networks within public organizations
   has grown in recent decades. While research has documented the role of
   individual cognition and social structure in understanding information
   search in organizations, this article emphasizes the importance of
   formal hierarchy. We argue that the structural attributes of
   bureaucracies are too important to be neglected when modeling knowledge
   flows in public organizations. Empirically, we examine interpersonal
   information-seeking patterns among 143 employees in a small city
   government, using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). The results
   suggest that formal structure strongly shapes information search
   patterns while accounting for social network variables and
   individual-level perceptions. We find that formal status, permission
   pathways, and departmental membership all affect employees' information
   search. Understanding the effects of organizational structure on
   information search networks will offer opportunities to improve
   information flows in public organizations via design choices.},

Title = {Navigating NGO-Government Relations in Human Rights: New Archival
   Evidence from Amnesty International, 1961-1986},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {This research note unveils new archival evidence from Amnesty
   International's first twenty-five years (1961-1986) to shed light on the
   realization of international human rights as Amnesty balanced
   ``nonpolitical politics{''} through multifaceted government relations.
   The research draws from minutes and reports of eighty meetings of
   Amnesty's executive leadership and interviews from the 1983 to 1985
   Amnesty Oral History project, all collected from the International
   Institute of Social History. The records show that during this time
   Amnesty relied on government and foundation funding to exit a severe
   financial crisis. Amnesty also cultivated a private diplomatic network
   with governments for access and advocacy and conducted side bargains
   with closed countries for access and reforms. In one sense, the new
   evidence complicates the conventional wisdom that Amnesty was only
   financed from small, individual donors and stayed away from private
   government dealings. In another sense, the new data extend existing
   insights about INGO strategic action by revealing Amnesty's pragmatic
   trade-offs when maintaining arms-length relations with governments to
   better appreciate the organization's early challenges and
   accomplishments. The note ultimately contributes to scholarship on the
   strategic choices of INGOs and provides new data for future research on
   the agency of nonstate actors in global governance navigating complex
   government relations. Esta nota de investigacion presenta nueva
   evidencia documental de los primeros 25 anos de Amnistia Internacional
   (Amnesty International), de 1961 a 1986, para arrojar luz sobre el
   cumplimiento de las normas internacionales de derechos humanos mientras
   Amnistia balanceaba la ``politica no politica{''} mediante relaciones
   gubernamentales polifaceticas. La investigacion incorpora actas e
   informes de 80 reuniones del liderazgo ejecutivo de Amnistia y
   entrevistas de 1983 a 1985 del proyecto Historia Oral de Amnistia
   (Amnesty Oral History), recopiladas del Instituto Internacional de
   Historia Social. Los documentos muestran que, en ese momento, Amnistia
   necesito financiacion gubernamental y de fundaciones para salir de una
   crisis financiera grave. Amnistia tambien cultivo una red diplomatica
   privada con gobiernos a cambio de acceso y defensa, y tuvo negocios
   paralelos con paises cerrados a cambio de acceso y reformas. En un
   sentido, la nueva evidencia complica la sabiduria convencional de que
   Amnistia solo tuvo financiamiento de donantes pequenos e individuos y se
   mantuvo lejos de los negocios privados con gobiernos. En contraste, los
   nuevos datos amplian las percepciones existentes sobre la accion
   estrategica de organizaciones no gubernamentales internacionales (ONGI),
   revelando las concesiones pragmaticas de Amnistia al mantener relaciones
   independientes con gobiernos, y permiten apreciar mejor los desafios y
   logros iniciales de la organizacion. La nota, fundamentalmente,
   contribuye a la investigacion sobre las decisiones estrategicas de las
   ONGI y brinda nuevos datos para futuras investigaciones sobre la
   autonomia de los actores no estatales que navegan relaciones
   gubernamentales complejas en la gobernanza global.
   Cet expose de recherche devoile de nouvelles preuves issues des 25
   premieres annees d'archives d'Amnesty International (1961-1986) pour
   apporter un eclairage sur l'application des droits de l'Homme tandis
   qu'Amnesty equilibrait la << politique apolitique >> par le biais de
   relations gouvernementales a plusieurs facettes. Cette recherche
   s'appuie sur des minutes et rapports de 80 reunions de la haute
   direction d'Amnesty, ainsi que sur des entretiens qui ont eu lieu entre
   1983 et 1985 dans le cadre du projet Oral History (Histoire orale)
   d'Amnesty. Ces donnees ont toutes ete recueillies aupres de l'Institut
   International d'Histoire Sociale. Les archives montrent que durant cette
   periode, Amnesty a du compter sur le financement de gouvernements et de
   fondations pour sortir d'une grave crise financiere. Amnesty a egalement
   cultive un reseau diplomatique prive avec des gouvernements pour
   faciliter son acces et son plaidoyer dans le pays concerne tout en
   menant des negociations paralleles avec les pays fermes pour y favoriser
   son acces et les reformes. En un sens, les nouvelles preuves compliquent
   les idees recues selon lesquelles Amnesty ne serait financee que par de
   petits donateurs individuels et resterait a l'ecart des affaires
   gouvernementales privees. Mais en un autre sens, ces nouvelles donnees
   enrichissent les renseignements existants sur l'action strategique des
   organisations non gouvernementales internationales en revelant
   qu'Amnesty s'etait livree a des compromis pragmatiques en entretenant
   des relations avec les gouvernements tout en restant a distance. Ces
   renseignements nous permettent donc de mieux apprecier les premiers
   defis et accomplissements de l'organisation. En definitive, cet expose
   contribue aux etudes sur les choix strategiques des organisations non
   gouvernementales internationales et fournit de nouvelles donnees pour
   les recherches futures sur l'intervention des acteurs non etatiques dans
   la gouvernance mondiale tandis qu'ils naviguent dans des relations
   gouvernementales complexes.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author presents the evolution in the European Union
   of different borrowing models going through a path which starts out with
   a purely national model, passes through stages of hybrid (national and
   European) models, to reach the final stage, a purely European model. The
   European Union is being pushed, after the Sovereign Debt and the
   COVID-19 crises, to move from pure national borrowing models to new
   hybrid ones, starting with the proposals for the creation of Eurobonds
   and safe assets in the aftermath of the former crisis and evolving with
   this latter crisis to a European hybrid solution, notably with the
   package Next Generation EU. Here, European Commission borrowing capacity
   is fully recognised as a way to finance EU expenditures to be eventually
   backed up by new own tax resources. This decision is considered as an
   antechamber of a European fiscal federal solution.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Samir Amin's writings, this article proposes a contemporary
   form of dependency that manifests in the subordinate integration of
   developing countries into a financialised global economy. Using insights
   from the emergent financialisation literature, the article updates two
   themes in Amin's work: imperialist rent and the role of the peripheral
   state in perpetuating dependency in the global economy. In contemporary
   capitalism, imperialist rent is not limited to labour arbitrage but also
   includes financial arbitrage, and the peripheral state, rather than
   retreating, now actively manages the financial sphere. The article
   advances an updated understanding of dependency in the context of
   financialisation.},

Abstract = {The legitimacy of government agencies rests in part on the premise that
   public administrators use scientific evidence to make policy decisions.
   Yet, what happens when there is no consensus in the scientific
   evidence-i.e., when the science is in conflict? I theorize that
   scientific conflict yields greater policy change during administrative
   policymaking. I assess this claim using data from the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA). I identify policy change-what I refer to as
   ``policy development{''} in this article-between the FDA's draft and
   final rules with a novel text analysis measure of shifts in regulatory
   restrictions. I then go on to find that more policy development does
   occur with scientific conflict. Moreover, using corresponding survey
   data, I uncover suggestive evidence that one beneficiary of such
   conflict may be participating interest groups. Groups lobby harder-and
   attempt to change more of the rule-during conflict, while an in-survey
   experiment provides evidence of increased interest group influence on
   rule content when scientific conflict is high.},

Abstract = {Twelve of twenty-six war-winning coalitions since 1815 have seen at
   least two members go to war against one another after victory. What
   separates durable and fragile war-winning coalitions? To answer this
   question, we analyze a game-theoretic model of shifting intra-coalition
   power and collective deterrence. We show that (1) shifting power within
   war-winning coalitions can undermine commitments to the postwar
   settlement, but (2) revisionist threats from a powerful defeated side
   can enhance the credibility of commitments within the winning coalition,
   securing peace when intra-coalition war would otherwise be inevitable.
   We also recover these patterns in empirical models of the outbreak of
   war between former coalition partners: shifting power within a coalition
   is associated with increased probabilities of intra-coalition war, but
   only when the defeated side is not too powerful. A common enemy can thus
   preserve peace between former partners who would otherwise go to war
   over the terms of shared victory.},

Abstract = {Relationality has become a popular term for addressing diversity,
   complexity, interconnectedness, and planetary crisis in many academic
   fields, including international relations (IR). This article shows that
   fully embracing relationality calls for a distinct set of tools that are
   discernable in cosmopraxis, an ontological stance derived from Andean
   thinking that upholds interdependence and co-becoming,
   being-feeling-knowing-doing, and both-and logics as key principles of
   existence. Following a discussion of the ``relational turn{''} in
   academic debates within and beyond IR, we develop our understanding of
   deep relationality and explain how cosmopraxis works to awaken the
   relational sensibilities we deem key to broadening and invigorating the
   study of worldly affairs. Throughout the article, we make use of stories
   about weaving, a key metaphor of entanglement and interconnection, but
   also a concrete practice that embodies the principles of cosmopraxis to
   illustrate our main arguments.},

Abstract = {During recent years, the inclusion of former extremists in preventing
   and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) has increased internationally.
   This paper addresses the issue of the involvement of former extremists
   in school-based work to prevent violent extremism. It provides a media
   analysis of the content of 151 newspaper articles (published between
   2001 and 2019) regarding 133 lectures given by former extremists in
   German schools. The analysis shows that the lectures contain mostly
   movement- and biography-based narration and points to some critical
   aspects (e.g., detailed depictions of violence, insensitive language).
   Furthermore, the findings indicate that some former extremists engaging
   in PVE might not have completed the deradicalization process. Moreover,
   certain former extremists could have further motives for engaging in
   prevention work in schools, in addition to making amends for previous
   actions. Among them appears the need for a compensation mechanism or a
   platform to advertise their activities. Therefore, we emphasize the
   importance of a differentiated view of former extremists' role in PVE,
   especially when working with children and juveniles.},

Abstract = {The salience of the debate over Russian political interference in the
   USA has increased significantly during the Trump administration.
   However, there is no consensus over how to respond to the interference
   of this openly illiberal power. This paper argues that we need to
   reconceptualize our understanding of Russian influence to understand
   this high level of contestation. While the current understanding of
   Russian influence is characterized as a problem of unwanted information
   flows, we argue that we also need to take seriously the ideological
   influence that the Russia regime has in the USA-that the appeal of the
   Russian regime's conservative and populist ideology can help to explain
   this division. By taking ideological attraction seriously, we can
   explain why it is currently difficult for the USA to respond to this
   threat and why solutions to Russian interference based on the
   information flow models need to be reconsidered.},

Title = {The global economic cost of coronavirus pandemic: current and future
   implications},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {290-305},
Abstract = {Purpose - The global economy is plagued by an unprecedented shock that
   has devastated economic growth under the coronavirus pandemic. The
   prolonged movement control orders, social distancing, and lockdowns have
   triggered the global economic downturn, disrupted the demand and supply
   chains, reduced the pool of workforce, and caused many jobs loss. This
   paper aims to analyze the global economic cost of the coronavirus
   pandemic, and its current and future implications.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on contingency theory, this paper
   provides an in-depth analysis of the current situation on the global
   economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak and gives insights from an
   organizational perspective.
   Findings - This paper found that the world has witnessed far-ranging
   economic consequences due to the coronavirus pandemic in four aspects:
   (i) decline in personal consumption; (ii) decline in the investments and
   stock prices in capital market; (iii) decline in government spending in
   developmental projects and increase in new borrowing; and (iv) decline
   of exports of goods to international markets.
   Originality/value - The novelty lies in investigating the effects of the
   COVID-19 pandemic on micro and macroeconomic levels - the components of
   GDP, consumer behavior, business investments, government spending, and
   global exports. The paper suggests the need for urgent actions by the
   world leaders to oversee, anticipate, and manage the risks and cushion
   the economic consequences. It concludes that the flexibility and
   adaptability of leaders, effectiveness, workforce protection, efficient
   use of modern technology, including automation and artificial
   intelligence, would enhance the resilience of supply chains which will
   support organizations to sustain in this critical time.},

Abstract = {The field of climate and security has matured over the past 15 years,
   moving from the margins of academic research and policy discussion to
   become a more prominent concern for the international community. The
   practice of climate and security has a broad set of concerns extending
   beyond climate change and armed conflict. Different national
   governments, international organizations, and forums have sought to
   mainstream climate security concerns emphasizing a variety of
   challenges, including the risks to military bases, existential risks to
   low-lying island countries, resource competition, humanitarian
   emergencies, shocks to food security, migration, transboundary water
   management, and the risks of unintended consequences from climate
   policies. Despite greater awareness of these risks, the field still
   lacks good insights about what to do with these concerns, particularly
   in `fragile' states with low capacity and exclusive political
   institutions.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Pages = {818-834},
Abstract = {In counterinsurgencies, minority groups such as the Sunnis in Iraq are
   important elements of the ``population,{''} the social-political terrain
   where population-centric counterinsurgency is battled. Yet there has
   been little systematic analysis of minority groups in unconventional
   warfare and no investigation of the ways intervening forces, like the
   United States, have approached in-country allies in an effort to get
   host nations to address the strategic importance of minorities.
   Examining new data on alliance politics between the United States and
   local partners in Vietnam and Iraq, I find that while existing
   scholarship would suggest that in-country allies will resist U.S.
   pressure to engage with minority groups, local allies are surprisingly
   likely to comply, at least in part, in order to avoid U.S. unilateral
   engagement with local minorities and to influence the policies adopted.
   This process slowly undermines U.S. counterinsurgency efforts, speaking
   to the complexities of population-centric approaches and working through
   local proxies.},
