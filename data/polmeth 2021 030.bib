   National Defense and Canadian Armed Forces' public affairs publicity and
   recruitment practices in the twenty-first century. Giving a snapshot of
   the government offices, policies and personnel responsible for promoting
   military service to the public, it highlights some of the most
   significant paid and unpaid publicity events and recruitment campaigns
   they organised and promoted across a wide variety of media forms,
   including pop culture, news, television advertisements, and social media
   platforms. It also considers the role Canadian military promotion and
   recruitment play in militarising Canadian media and culture,
   constructing Canadian national identity, selling military service, and
   bringing about a collaborative relationship between the Canadian
   military and US social media platforms.},

Title = {Do External Threats Unite or Divide? Security Crises, Rivalries, and
   Polarization in American Foreign Policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {921-958},
Abstract = {A common explanation for the increasing polarization in contemporary
   American foreign policy is the absence of external threat. I identify
   two mechanisms through which threats could reduce polarization: by
   revealing information about an adversary that elicits a bipartisan
   response from policymakers (information mechanism) and by heightening
   the salience of national relative to partisan identity (identity
   mechanism). To evaluate the information mechanism, study 1 uses
   computational text analysis of congressional speeches to explore whether
   security threats reduce partisanship in attitudes toward foreign
   adversaries. To evaluate the identity mechanism, study 2 uses public
   opinion polls to assess whether threats reduce affective polarization
   among the public. Study 3 tests both mechanisms in a survey experiment
   that heightens a security threat from China. I find that the external
   threat hypothesis has limited ability to explain either polarization in
   US foreign policy or affective polarization among the American public.
   Instead, responses to external threats reflect the domestic political
   environment in which they are introduced. The findings cast doubt on
   predictions that new foreign threats will inherently create partisan
   unity.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2021},

Number = {3},
Pages = {240-256},
Abstract = {the Central Bank's Blind Spot The appointment in 2020 of a new head of
   the Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), has actualized a debate on
   tax havens, a growing concern following the international financial
   crisis of 2008. The article analyses the Norwegian central bank's
   approach to tax havens as it unfolded throughout the appointment process
   and illustrates traditional divisions in tax haven debates. The analysis
   builds on publicly available oral and written statements following the
   appointment, and relevant documents that inform the background of how
   tax and transparency became integrated in NBIM's work on ethics from
   2017. The central argument put forward here is that the central bank
   position represents a traditional defense of tax haven use, in which
   challenges a request by the Norwegian Parliament to subordinate
   companies' tax strategies to ethical guidelines. We show that this is
   justified with four identified aspects of the central bank's tax haven
   approach: a narrow definition of the tax haven phenomenon; an unclear
   attitude to aggressive tax planning; a downplay of negative consequences
   of tax havens; a narrow interpretation of its own responsibilities. The
   discussions illustrate the need to clarify the content and practical
   management of the Norwegian policy on tax and transparency, including
   tax havens.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to analyse the situation in Ukraine in the face of
   ongoing Russian aggression and increasing pressure from the Kremlin
   towards Eastern European states. The armed conflict taking place in
   Ukraine means that the geostrategic situation of Eastern Europe has
   changed. In this context, the Eastern Partnership, which was meant to be
   one of the key instruments shaping international relations with the
   states neighbouring the EU in the East, is quite often seen as an
   ineffective or even obsolete tool. There can be no doubt that the
   greatest problem for the Eastern Partnership is that the project is seen
   in geopolitical categories - thinking of the countries of the Eastern
   Partnership in the context of the necessity for them to choose between
   the European Union and Russia (listening to statements by the EU's
   political decision-makers, it can often seem that those states have no
   other option). The key research question is whether we will be dealing
   with an assertive EU policy in tandem with current US policy, or whether
   there will be another reset in relations between the West and the
   Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {Organizational reputation theory suggests reputational threats can
   induce public organizations to change their behavior. However, it offers
   few insights into how organizations in contexts of high audience
   heterogeneity prioritize between conflicting threats, or how they ensure
   reputation-seeking signals reach their intended audiences. This article
   seeks to close these knowledge gaps. It expects organizational threat
   prioritization to be shaped by the centrality of the threat to the
   organization's distinct reputation, and by differences in audiences'
   capacity to put pressure on the organization through mobilization.
   Moreover, it argues that public organizations strategically vary the
   observability and costliness of outgoing reputation-seeking signals in
   response to shifts in the balance of reputational threats they face. It
   finds support for these expectations in the context of the European
   Commission, a supranational organization operating in a context of high
   audience heterogeneity and severe reputational threats. The empirical
   analysis is based on the Bayesian longitudinal modeling and simulation
   of Commission decision-making and applies a novel dataset on fiscal rule
   enforcement in the European Union (EU). The findings have important
   implications for organizational reputation theory and call for a renewed
   focus on the mechanisms underlying audience-induced organizational
   behavior.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of institutional listening in
   deliberative democracy, focusing particularly on its contribution to the
   transmission process between the public sphere and formal institutions.
   We critique existing accounts of transmission for prioritizing voice
   over listening and for remaining constrained by an `aggregative logic'
   of the flow of ideas and voices in a democracy. We argue that formal
   institutions have a crucial role to play in ensuring transmission
   operates according to a more deliberative logic. To substantiate this
   argument, we focus on two recent examples of institutional listening in
   two different democracies: Australia's Royal Commission into
   Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and the United States'
   Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court
   nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. These cases show that institutional listening
   can take different forms; it can be purposefully designed or incidental,
   and it can contribute to the realization of deliberative democracy in
   various ways. Specifically, institutional listening can help enhance the
   credibility and visibility of minority groups and perspectives while
   also empowering these groups to better hold formal political
   institutions accountable. In these ways, institutional listening helps
   transmission operate according to a more deliberative logic.},

Abstract = {Prominent research holds that the use of weapons of mass destruction is
   taboo. But how strong are these norms? Investigating this question among
   the mass public, we argue that some citizens actually support taboo
   policies in private but are unwilling to express counter-normative
   opinions openly due to fear of social sanction. These insincere
   norm-holders are difficult to identify empirically because they are
   observationally equivalent to sincere norm-holders in direct-question
   surveys. To overcome this challenge, we use a list design, which allows
   survey respondents to indirectly express sensitive opinions. The results
   from three list experiments show that between 10\% and 17\% of Americans
   falsify their preferences over chemical weapons use when asked directly.
   In an extension, we explore our framework in the realm of nuclear
   weapons and elite behavior. Our findings advance a specific debate on
   the strength of weapons taboos, while our conceptualization of insincere
   norm-holders and methodological application have broader implications
   for how scholars might think about and measure norms in international
   politics.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the dominant view that China has risen, and that
   its economic ascent has created a restless empire poised to overturn the
   liberal international order. This author argues that China's deep
   integration into the global economy from the early 1990s onward, as
   necessitated by both Chinese domestic politics and America's grand
   strategy of drawing China out, has eventually set the country on a path
   of dependent development and has made China not a solid superpower
   candidate, but rather a fragile great power. It is ironic that it is the
   empire-sized country's entrapment in semi-peripheral development, rather
   than its economic-technological `rise', that has inevitably led to the
   return of great power rivalry and the coming of the new Cold War.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a long-term political ethnography of sites of global health
   governance, the paper makes methodological and substantive
   contributions. First of all, it shows that ethnography induces
   researchers to experience international organizations (IOs) and global
   governance as spatiotemporal phenomena. This experience overlaps with
   the lived realities of practitioners and spotlights aspects that are
   otherwise easily overlooked. Both practitioners and ethnographers have
   to be in specific spaces at particular times. This practical challenge
   illustrates that there are focal times and spaces, which are linked to
   the cyclical and sited character of global health governance. These
   focal times and spaces provide an important coordination mechanism and
   ease the general flow of knowledge - within IOs and between IOs and
   their environment. However, there is also the constant danger that they
   develop a self-referential life of their own and become disconnected
   from other processes. Similarly, not just researchers but also
   practitioners are struggling to develop a comprehensive understanding of
   IOs since they experience them only partially and in specific settings.
   Thus, a spatiotemporal account highlights both overlooked links and
   unexpected disconnections. The conclusion mentions that the current -
   COVID-19-induced - mainstreaming of digital technologies will impact the
   spatiotemporal dimension of global health governance.},

Abstract = {Left-right partisan conflict has been a key driver of welfare state
   expansion and retrenchment over time and across countries. Yet, we know
   very little about how left-right differences in party appeals vary
   across social policy domains. Why are some issues contentious while
   there is broad consensus on others? This paper starts from the simple
   premise that partisan conflict is a function of how popular a certain
   policy is. Based on this assumption, it argues that the left-right gap
   should be (1) larger for revenue-side issues than for expenditure-side
   issues, (2) larger for policies targeted at groups that are viewed as
   less deserving and (3) larger for more redistributive programs than less
   redistributive ones (e.g. means-tested versus earnings-related
   benefits). These expectations are tested on fine-grained policy data
   coded from 65 Austrian party manifestos issued between 1970 and 2017 (N
   = 18,219). The analysis strongly supports the revenue-expenditure
   hypothesis and the deservingness hypothesis, but not the redistribution
   hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The recent evolution of capitalism has shifted the ground on which
   developmentalism stood as a civilizing utopia in Latin America, making
   the neodevelopmentalism that inspired different nuances of progressivism
   in the twenty-first century an idea ``out of place.{''} Starting from
   this premise, the notions of progressivism as regression and containment
   as accelerating desocialization form the foundations of an
   interpretation of the Pink Tide that emphasizes the contradictions
   inherent in its own dynamics, which reinforced the neoliberal rationale.
   The attempt to govern social tensions through containment of the ongoing
   dissociative movement did not stop the regression of the structure of
   production and the intensification of a self-destructive social dynamic.
   Progressivism is revealed as a political rationale that is different
   from but not contradictory to its opponents in a reality in which
   capital governs as a totalizing extraparliamentary force. A evolucao
   recente do capitalismo modificou as bases materiais que davam sentido ao
   desenvolvimentismo como utopia civilizatoria na America Latina, tornando
   o neodesenvolvimentismo que inspirou diferentes nuances de progressismo
   no seculo XXI, uma ideia fora do lugar. A partir desta premissa, sao
   discutidas as nocoes de progressismo como regressao e de contencao como
   aceleracion de dissocializacion, como alicerces de uma interpretacao da
   onda progressista que enfatiza as contradicoes inerentes a sua propria
   dinamica que reforcou a razao neoliberal. A pretensao de governar as
   tensoes sociais por meio de politicas de contencao do movimento
   dissocializante em curso nao evitou a regressao da estrutura produtiva e
   o aprofundamento de uma dinamica social autofagica. O progressismo
   revela-se como uma racionalidade politica diferente, mas nao
   contraditoria em relacao aos seus opositores em uma realidade em que o
   capital se impoe como uma forca extra-parlamentar totalizante.},

Abstract = {The analysis of Theotonio dos Santos, a central reference of the Marxist
   theory of dependency, of the counterrevolutionary political processes in
   Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s, reflecting what he observes as an
   advance of fascistization, proposes the concept of a dependent fascism
   to characterize some of the military governments that materialized in
   the region. His writings on the subject are part of a wide range of
   debates that took place in Latin America during the 1970s, which focused
   on the context of political radicalization between revolution and
   counterrevolution, a tug-of-war that led to a consolidation of military
   coups. These writings express his position on both the political crisis
   that took place in Latin American countries at that time and the
   transformations of the political regime and the state itself. Efforts to
   renew these debates are anchored in the expectation that they may shed
   light on recent Latin American history. A analise de Theotonio dos
   Santos, referencia central da teoria Marxista da dependencia, sobre os
   processos politicos contrarrevolucionarios na America Latina nas decadas
   de 1960 e 1970, ao observar um avanco da fascistizacao, propoe o
   conceito de fascismo dependente para caracterizar alguns dos governos
   militares que se concretizaram na regiao. Seus escritos sobre o tema se
   inscrevem em um amplo campo de debates que tiveram lugar na America
   Latina durante a decada de 1970, os quais se debrucavam sobre o contexto
   de radicalizacao politica entre revolucao e contrarrevolucao, no qual a
   consolidacao de golpes militares estava imersa, e expressam o
   posicionamento do autor em relacao tanto a crise politica que teve lugar
   nos paises latino-americanos naquele entao, quanto as transformacoes do
   proprio regime politico e do Estado. O esforco de recuperar tal debate
   esta ancorado na expectativa de que tais reflexoes possam lancar luz
   sobre a historia recente latino-americana.},

Abstract = {Despite the rising academic scholarship on democracy, particularly the
   role played by social movements in entrenching democracy in Africa, few
   studies have explored the transformation of social movements after they
   have achieved (or come close to achieving) their stated goals. Using a
   case study of the Oodua Peoples Congress in Nigeria, this study argues
   that social movements in Africa lack the capacity to transform and often
   become partisan or disintegrate. The study concludes that the unique
   characteristics of African politics, coupled with the inability of
   social movements to maintain public support after initial gains,
   eventually weaken the movements.},

Title = {A Comparative Analysis of Selection Criteria of Candidates in Belgium},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {The literature on candidate selection has focussed extensively on the
   degree of inclusiveness and decentralization of the selectorate, as part
   of the debate on intra-party democracy. However, much less attention has
   been paid to the degree of openness of candidacies, or selection
   criteria within parties. Yet parties have a lot of leeway in how they
   design selection criteria internally. Which guidelines do parties follow
   when making the crucial choice on which candidates to select for
   elections? This paper investigates selection criteria from two
   perspectives: the formal rules set by parties that restrict the
   candidate's pool and the (informal) preferences of selectors that shape
   who gets selected. We aim first at contrasting the degree of party
   institutionalization and parties' formal rules in candidate selection
   and so, we shed light on whether parties formalise their candidacy
   requirements and candidate selection processes to the same extent as
   other party activities. Second, the paper investigates the role of the
   selectorates, and how selectorate's characteristics matter for the kind
   of (informal) selection criteria, be they intended at maximizing
   offices, votes or policies. Drawing on party statutes coded in the
   Political Party Database (PPDB) and 23 in-depth interviews with
   selectors, we study three francophone Belgian parties that differ both
   in terms of inclusiveness of the selectorate who has the final say on
   candidate selection and in terms of degree of centralisation, and in
   terms of party institutionalisation: the green party (Ecolo), the
   socialist party (PS), and the liberal party (MR). Our comparative
   analysis of parties, selection criteria provides new insights into the
   secret garden of politics and highlights in particular the major impact
   of parties, degree of centralization.},

Abstract = {Understanding how public organizations prioritize goals is crucial in
   studying goal-setting in the public sector. However, the extant
   literature has mostly adopted a sole-goal perspective and neglected the
   influences of the interplay among multiple goals. This article extends
   the literature by going beyond the sole-goal perspective and adopting a
   multigoal perspective to further explore the complexities in public
   organizations' goal prioritization when facing multiple conflicting
   goals. Drawing on the theoretical perspectives of performance
   information use and interorganizational interactions, the main arguments
   of this study are twofold. First, an organization's prioritization of a
   particular goal will be positively associated with the performance gap
   in its conflicting goal. Second, organizations tend to adopt a
   differentiation strategy in the prioritization of multiple conflicting
   goals. Empirical findings based on the investigation of Chinese
   city-level governments' prioritization of environmental goals when
   confronting conflict between environmental protection and economic
   development goals support our arguments.},

Abstract = {This study assesses what causes American states to assume the authority
   to administer federal environmental programs within their borders,
   rather than leave implementation to the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Some observers have argued that interstate competition for mobile
   capital may motivate states to seek this authority so that they may
   reduce the regulatory burdens imposed on industrial polluters. Other
   scholars highlight the importance of intrastate political and economic
   factors or vertical influences emanating from federal officials. I argue
   that the relative importance of each of these classes of explanations
   will vary across environmental policy arenas, depending on the amount of
   implementation discretion that federal programs provide to state
   agencies. Results from event history analyses of two major environmental
   programs are generally, though not entirely, consistent with this
   theory.},

Abstract = {Religion has become increasingly contentious in recent years.
   Faith-based discrimination, hostility and violence seem to have
   increased worldwide. But how can faith lead to conflict? In this
   article, we test the impact of two important dimensions of religion that
   have been neglected in previous research: the belief in `one true
   religion' and perceptions of threats by other religious groups. Putting
   these two potential drivers to the test, we conducted a representative
   survey experiment with 972 respondents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
   Results show that one of the tested dimensions, perceptions of threats
   by others, increases the support to use violence to defend one's own
   group. This is particularly the case for religiously intolerant
   respondents with characteristics such as pre-existing threat
   perceptions, unfavorable views on intermarriage, or belief in the
   superiority of their own faith. In contrast, we find relatively weak
   evidence that the prime of `one true religion' increases the readiness
   to use violence. Our findings have important implications for policy: We
   conclude that appeals by leaders to threats by others and intolerance
   toward other faiths can contribute to more conflict. Political and
   religious leaders should refrain from capitalizing on such notions and
   should promote tolerance towards other faiths instead.},

Abstract = {In the past decade a series of events including the outbreak of the
   Syrian war, drought and tireless insurgencies in sub-Saharan Africa
   triggered the largest wave of displacement ever seen through and around
   the Mediterranean. The majority of those bound to Europe through the
   Mediterranean are smuggled by criminal networks. The proliferation of
   Trafficking and Smuggling of Human Beings (TSHB) between the Sahel and
   the Libyan shores feeds into the evolving threats of terrorism, crime
   and insecurity in the Sahel, West Africa and Europe. This paper explores
   the involvement of armed groups in TSHB in the Central Sahel and Libya.
   The author argues that the involvement of armed actors in the TSHB in
   the Central Sahel and Libya is not uniform and not systematically used
   for terrorism financing. Criminal networks and armed groups leverage
   opportunities created by conflict to generate profit and project power.
   They operate in convergent spaces benefitting from state fragility, and
   shared social networks. The link between terrorism and migrant smuggling
   and trafficking, if found, remains localized benefitting individuals
   rather than organizations.},

Abstract = {This article intends to understand the dynamics and particularities of
   the Georgian path to secularism by analyzing whether equal respect for
   all religions and freedom of conscience -principle of secularism- are
   fully realized in post-Soviet Georgia and whether state's neutrality
   towards minority religions and church-state separation -operative modes
   of secularism- is truly secured. Employing the data obtained from
   interviews conducted in Tbilisi and Batumi in 2015-2017 and the related
   literature, it inquiries into concerns about ineffectual realization of
   principles of secularism due to the weaknesses in the operative modes of
   secularism. Research data revealed that weaknesses in the separation
   between the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) and the state and the state's
   neutrality towards minority religions are the result of the power of the
   GOC caused by its historical significance and `cultural defense',
   exacerbated by a perception of threat to territorial integrity and
   national identity. Weaknesses in the operative modes of secularism and
   cultural defense both conduce to the unequal treatment of religious
   minorities, which is reflected in the legal framework and newly
   established institutions, leading to the Georgian path to secularism.},

Abstract = {North Korea and the United States are edging towards re-engagement. They
   agree in principle on pursuing a phased approach to negotiations but
   disagree on how to begin and what the end goal should be. A warming-up
   phase can allow states to informally explore specific options for future
   engagement. By participating in activities such as table-top exercises,
   simulations and familiarisation visits, the participants develop a more
   specific understanding of the purpose and format of the activities and
   verification measures that might follow a formal agreement. This process
   engages the technical and military bureaucracies at an early stage. It
   provides a private setting to raise concerns and address
   misunderstandings. It is an opportunity to demonstrate goodwill and
   interest in engagement that does not require concessions. Drawing on
   past examples, this article suggests specific options for a warming-up
   phase involving North Korea and the United States.},

Abstract = {The denuclearisation of North Korea is unlikely. Neither pressure nor
   rewards will persuade North Korean decision-makers to surrender their
   nuclear weapons because they have good reasons to see denuclearisation
   as tantamount to collective suicide. Therefore, the only realistic goal
   of the United States and the international community is arms control.
   There are ways to reward North Korean leaders for their willingness to
   restrict their nuclear and missile programmes. These include partial
   removal of sanctions, economic assistance and subsidised investment.
   However, any deal will be costly, since North Korea will exact maximum
   compensation for its willingness to accept an arms-control regime.
   Reaching an agreement also will be time consuming. A grand bargain is
   unattainable, and the parties will have to take small, incremental
   steps.},

Abstract = {Recent trends demonstrate that states with sufficient capabilities to be
   granted regional power status by its peers (primarily other states
   within their region) can nonetheless renounce regional leadership. This
   article analyzes the puzzling behavior of these detached or reluctant
   regional powers. We argue that resorting to an approach grounded in
   neoclassical realism is helpful to explain why regional powers might not
   exercise leadership. In this article regional leadership is
   conceptualized as an auxiliary goal within the grand strategy of a
   regional power. This goal will be pursued in the absence of certain
   structural and domestic constraints. Great power competition determines
   the incentives for regional leadership at the structural level. Capacity
   to extract and mobilize resources for foreign policy affects the
   decision to pursue leadership at the domestic level. We apply the
   analytical framework to analyze Brazil's detachment from South America
   after the Cardoso and Lula presidencies.},

   requires abandoning the categories of superexploitation and unequal

   limitations of this proposal highlights the misconceptions regarding
   these categories and the importance of recognizing dependent capitalism
   as a form of capitalism for an understanding of the state of the
   revolution in Latin America and the exceptional conditions that have
   made it possible for some economies to overcome underdevelopment. Una

Abstract = {Business schools are important agents in the cultural circuit of
   capitalism, but little is known about how they have played this role in
   countries like Chile. Research carried out in four Chilean business
   schools shows that they have contributed to the perpetuation of the
   labor relations model imposed after the neoliberal reforms in at least
   two ways: by circulating knowledge that makes the collective dimension
   of labor relations invisible and by declining to modify the attitudes of
   the student body toward labor relations management. Las escuelas de
   negocios son agentes importantes en el circuito cultural del
   capitalismo, pero poco se sabe sobre como han jugado su papel en paises
   como Chile. Una investigacion llevada a cabo en cuatro escuelas de
   negocios chilenas muestra que han contribuido a la perpetuacion del
   modelo de relaciones laborales impuesto despues de las reformas
   neoliberales en al menos dos maneras: circulando el conocimiento que
   invisibiliza la dimension colectiva de las relaciones laborales y
   negandose a modificar las actitudes del cuerpo estudiantil hacia la

   adaptation of the policy transfer heuristic (based on the work of
   Dolowitz, D., and D. Marsh. 1996. ``Who Learns What from Whom: A Review
   of the Policy Transfer Literature.{''} Political Studies; Evans, Mark.
   2009a. ``New Directions in the Study of Policy Transfer.{''} Policy
   Studies 30 (3): 237-241. doi:10.1080/01442870902863810) which draws
   attention to different types of multilevel governance systems (Hooghe,
   Liesbet, and Gary Marks. 2003. ``Unraveling the Central State, but How?
   Types of Multi-Level Governance.{''} American Political Science Review
   97: 02. doi:10.1017/S0003055403000649). This new adaption, ``Policy
   Transfer Across Governance Systems{''} (PTAGS) heuristic helps to
   anticipate challenges and opportunities for potential transfer
   (Manwaring, Rob. 2016. ``The Big Society in Australia: A Case of
   `Non'-Policy Transfer?{''} Australian Journal of Public Administration
   75 (2): 191-201. doi:10.1111/1467-8500.12164). To demonstrate this, we
   present three hypothetical scenarios of policy transfer from the
   European Union Green Capital Awards (EUGCA) to Australia. Using PTAGS
   reveals three main complexities that policy actors' may face when
   developing city-scale climate change policy. These are: problem
   identification; the type of transfer networks used; and what aspects of
   policy contents and goals can be transferred. We argue that the adapted
   PTAGS heuristic enables a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of
   transfer across different governance systems. This can better equip
   policy actors and relevant stakeholders to develop more holistic
   city-scale climate change adaptation policy that draws on the strengths
   of governance systems rather than amplifying their weaknesses.},

Abstract = {Although an extensive literature on the British idealist theory of human
   rights exists, it is limited by its focus on prominent British idealist
   philosophers and its predominant interest in civic and political rights.
   This article broadens our understanding of the subject by examining the
   lesser-known British idealist John Stuart Mackenzie's work on economic
   and social human rights. Mackenzie's reflections on the matter appear to
   be significant as an early example of employing human rights language as
   a solution to widespread poverty and destitution in Britain. His use of
   a tripartite idealist perception of human nature allows Mackenzie to
   underline the complexity of human potential and human need that must be
   protected in all spheres of social interaction. In light of ongoing
   challenges to the legitimacy of economic and social rights as human
   rights, Mackenzie's work constitutes a solid example of a maximalist
   approach to human rights that aims to not merely ensure survival but
   leads to the realization of a truly human life.},

Abstract = {Climate change mitigation and adaptation are among the policy areas
   covered by the European Union (EU) in trans-governmental cooperation
   with the neighboring countries. Although this cooperation is open to all
   European Neighborhood Policy countries and Russia, there is significant
   cross-country variance. This article maps the EU's climate networks in
   the neighborhood and, building on time-series cross-sectional data
   analysis, explains the cross-country differences. The study contributes
   to Europeanization and network governance literatures by demonstrating
   that the main driver of EU engagement in climate networks in the region
   is interdependencies stemming from geographic proximity. Meanwhile,
   state capacity is an important condition for establishing climate
   cooperation: climate cooperation develops more with closer neighbors
   that have stronger state capacity. Importantly, contrary to the logic of
   its international climate commitments, climate vulnerabilities do not
   define the extent of the EU's engagement in climate networks with its
   neighborhood.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the audience of state-media broadcasts (SMBs)
   among Chinese Internet users-a missing link for understanding political
   communications in the high-choice media environment of modern countries.
   Using a ``least likely case{''} strategy and a nationwide online survey,
   we created an audience profile of contemporary viewers among Chinese
   Internet users of Xinwen Lianbo (XWLB), the primary SMB program in
   China. We further examined the motivations driving viewers to watch the
   program, finding that external factors, such as media inequality,
   historical inertia, and family bundling, do not greatly alter people's
   watching behaviors. Instead, internal motivations, such as the pursuit
   of authentic information and psychological gratification, significantly
   increase the frequency with which viewers watch XWLB. These effects
   remain robust even after controlling for potential model biases and
   political desirability.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) have been
   introduced as part of public administration reforms around the world.
   Unlike traditional administrative agencies, most IRAs are not
   accountable to the executive and their accountability relationship to
   the legislative tends to be weak. Nevertheless, these agencies often
   engage in acts of voluntary explanation and justification of their
   decisions to stakeholders. Based on a comparative study of financial
   regulation agencies, this article shows that these IRAs resort more
   actively to voluntary accountability when the expectations of actors
   interacting with the agency are at conflict. Specifically, we argue that
   the agency's ability to manage expectations is shaped by the level of
   agency independence and the degree of organizational capacity. Our
   findings contribute to the existing debates by conceptualizing voluntary
   accountability as a mechanism for managing stakeholders' conflicting
   expectations through the lens of financial regulation based on original
   evidence from Spain and Turkey.},

Abstract = {Government agencies often encounter problems in service delivery when
   implementing public programs.This undermines effectiveness and raise
   questions about accountability. A central component of responsiveness
   and performance management is that agencies correct course when problems
   are identified. However, public agencies have an uneven record in
   responding to problems. In this article, we investigate whether, and to
   what extent, capacity both within the agency and within institutions
   performing oversight improves agency responsiveness to poor-performance
   indicators. Using panel data on eligibility determinations in the Social
   Security Disability program from US state agencies from 1991 to 2015 and
   fixed effects regression, we find that indicators of agency and
   oversight capacity moderate the relationship between poor performance
   and improvement. Our results suggest that investments in building
   capacity not only within agencies, but also within elected institutions,
   are important for successful policy implementation. However, we find
   evidence that while agency capacity alone can improve responsiveness to
   poor performance, the effect of oversight capacity on improving
   performance requires high agency capacity.},

Abstract = {This article defines and analyzes a new concept: inclusive transparency.
   Specifically, it conducts a comparative study of transparency portals in
   twenty-five Spanish local councils, all of which occupy prime positions
   in Transparency International's Index of Municipalities. The evaluation
   aims to establish their degree of compliance with Spanish and European
   regulations, ensuring website accessibility for people with
   disabilities. To this end, an evaluation model (composed of 4 criteria,
   11 variables and 45 indicators) has been generated, taking inspiration
   from electronic accessibility guidelines, which have been applied using
   automatic techniques and transparency portal revision manuals. The
   results of the research allow verification of a positive correlation
   between the levels of active and inclusive transparency. In other words,
   whether in terms of active advertising benchmark municipalities design
   and manage their portals in ways which also guarantee, alongside all
   other citizens, the right of access for people with limited capacities
   (hearing, visual, mobile and cognitive) thereby enhancing the exercise
   of their political citizenship and their social integration.},

Abstract = {This study empirically examines the effects of tax competition in both
   horizontal and vertical ways on the revenue capacity of counties in
   California from 2003 to 2015. Spatial Durbin model (SDM) identifies the
   effects of two-way tax competition on a county's revenue capacity. The
   findings provide evidence that local sales tax helps a county expand its
   total revenue, but the two-way tax competition brings about a decrease
   in local revenue capacity as a result of spillovers. Furthermore, a
   lower-taxing area can have more benefits because the expansions in the
   neighbors are much greater than the higher-taxing one. In spite of the
   extant research of tax competition, this study adds another contribution
   to this research arena that the empirical approach of the SDM rules out
   the geospatial effects of the other explanatory variables that might
   have some unobserved effects in the extant literature.},

Abstract = {Agricultural industrialization consortium is a key policy tool to
   promote agricultural development for local governments in China However,
   a stylized fact is that various consortia showed promising
   organizational performance at start, but then the performance
   deteriorated at later stages. The driving force behind is the dual
   paradox inherent in development and institution. The consortium is
   overly development oriented; yet as an institution it cannot adapt to
   the strong development impulses. Case studies show that the dual paradox
   inevitably led to the decline in organizational performance.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {12},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {This article adopts a holistic view of the theoretical and empirical
   interconnection between the development and foreign policies of four
   Asian rising powers: South Korea (hereafter Korea), Japan, Indonesia and
   China during three consecutive periods; the Washington Consensus (WC)
   era (1980-1990), the Post-Washington Consensus (PWC) era (1990-2008) and
   the Hybrid/Mix (H/M) era (2008-onwards). This study aims to elucidate
   and compare the level of coherence between the development agenda and
   foreign policy tools of these four Asian rising powers. First, the
   article provides an overview of the existing literature on the
   developmental state and developmental foreign policy. Second, it
   presents a development-foreign policy nexus (DFN) framework that takes
   into account five layers: (1) economics; (2) diplomacy; (3) security and
   peace; (4) civil society; and (5) state-market, and their related lines
   of action and instruments. The last part applies this DFN framework to
   our selected cases and provides comparative insights based on our newly
   created DFN Index scores, calculated separately for the four countries
   in each of the eras under review. In the final analysis, the results of
   our DFN Index and comparative case studies indicate that since the
   1980s, in the selected four countries development has almost become
   subordinated to foreign policy and this coherence has continued to
   increase since the end of the 1990s.},

Abstract = {Central banking as an avenue of research has been of interest to
   scholars from International Political Economy (IPE) and Public Policy
   and Administration (PPA) disciplines. Nevertheless, there is very little
   dialogue between these two perspectives to bridge macro, meso,
   micro-level analyses and examine the reciprocal relationship between the
   global and domestic political economy context and monetary policy
   conduct. This article investigates the Turkish experience to bridge IPE
   and PPA scholarship on central banking in emerging economies. In doing
   so, we adopt an analytic eclectic approach combining multiple
   structural, institutional, and agential causal explanations with
   particular reference to the Structure, Institution, and Agency (SIA)
   theoretical framework. This is because analytic eclecticism complements,
   speaks to, and selectively incorporates theoretical approaches such as
   the New Independence Approach (NIA) of IPE and institutional and
   ideational PPA approaches. Drawing on the empirical context of the
   historical evolution of the Turkish political economy, we explore
   domestic and international interactions among micro, meso, and macro
   levels that shape central banking behavior. Our analysis also reveals
   how global dynamics are translated into domestic policy choices and how
   particular ideas influence the policymaking process. The analysis
   underscores the constraining and enabling influence of international
   dynamics, politics of ideas on emerging economy central banking, and the
   essential role individual and organizational agency play in the
   policymaking process.},

Abstract = {At stake in this forum are the politics of translation in the study of
   global politics. More specifically, the following interventions aim to
   consider the ways that scholars can recenter the utility of language
   toward more flexible conceptions of relationality. As each contribution
   reveals, translation is indispensable to individual theorizations of
   international politics; yet taken together, the forum aims to mitigate
   the alleged necessity of a lingua franca in IR scholarship. We go beyond
   the linguistic demands of conventional conceptual history in that each
   intervention employs a reflexive disposition to consider both their
   subject position and normative aspirations in the experience of
   translation. The forum's overall goal is to illustrate the ethical
   imperative to acknowledge the contextual specificity of linguistic
   encounters-past, present, and future-and in the process breathe life
   into the prose of world politics.},

Abstract = {The concept of resilience is often discussed in relation to
   ``bouncing,{''} whether bouncing back or bouncing forward. This
   interdisciplinary article looks beyond ``bouncing{''} in either
   direction. In so doing, it offers a novel conceptualization of
   resilience as a dialectical process of expansion and contraction across
   multiple domains and levels. Drawing on fieldwork with
   victims-/survivors of conflict-related sexual violence in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, Colombia, and Uganda, it uses the qualitative data both to
   empirically critique the notions of ``bouncing back{''} and ``bouncing
   forward{''} and to explore what expansion and contraction look like in
   practice. It situates the arguments within a broader holonic
   perspective, in order to accentuate the systemic dimensions of
   resilience, and ultimately it discusses what they mean for the field of
   transitional justice.},

Abstract = {Understanding why and how individuals participate in militant
   organizations has been the focus of an increasing amount of scholarship.
   Traditionally, these studies focus at either the individual or
   organizational level of explanation. This article advances the
   discussion on individual participation in militant organizations by
   combining primary and secondary sources at both levels to explain how
   the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) attracted individuals into
   its organization as either suicide bombers or frontline fighters. First,
   at the individual level, we analyze a primary source dataset of over
   4,000 personnel files from foreign fighters who went to Syria to join
   ISIS between 2013 and 2014. Second, at the organizational level, we
   examine trends in Islamic State propaganda and messaging to see how the
   recruitment of individuals into the organization placed them on certain
   operational paths. Two specific takeaways emerge. First, foreign
   fighters in 2013-2014 volunteered to become suicide bombers with
   relatively less frequency than in past iterations of the conflict in
   Iraq and Syria. Second, fighters from Western countries and fighters
   from countries undergoing a civil war were especially less likely to
   volunteer for a suicide role. More broadly, this analytical essay makes
   a case for the value of looking inside an organization as well as at
   individuals to get a more complete picture about group-level behavior.},

Abstract = {Democratic backsliding has multiplied ``unprincipled{''} political
   principals: governments with weak commitment to the public interest. Why
   do some bureaucrats engage in voice and guerrilla sabotage to thwart
   policies against the public interest under ``unprincipled
   principals,{''} yet others do not? Despite its centrality in
   contemporary governance, this conundrum has not seen quantitative
   research. We address this gap with survey evidence from 1,700 Brazilian
   public servants during the Temer Presidency, widely perceived to lack
   democratic legitimacy and integrity. We focus on one key explanator:
   public service motivation (PSM). We argue that bureaucrats with greater
   PSM are more likely to engage in voice and sabotage of ``unprincipled
   policies,{''} and exit to avoid implementing ``unprincipled
   policies.{''} Structural equation models support these hypotheses.
   Public service-motivated bureaucracies are thus short-run stalwarts
   against ``unprincipled{''} political principals. Over time, they look to
   depart, however, leaving ``unprincipled{''} principals a freer hand to
   pursue policies against the public interest.},

Title = {No paradox here? Improving theory and testing of the nuclear
   stability-instability paradox with synthetic counterfactuals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {This article contributes to both the theoretical elaboration and
   empirical testing of the `stability-instability paradox', the
   proposition that while nuclear weapons deter nuclear war, they also
   increase conventional conflict among nuclear-armed states. Some recent
   research has found support for the paradox, but quantitative studies
   tend to pool all international dyads while qualitative and theoretical
   studies focus almost exclusively on the USA-USSR and India-Pakistan
   dyads. This article argues that existing empirical tests lack clearly
   relevant counterfactual cases, and are vulnerable to a number of
   inferential problems, including selection on the dependent variable,
   unintentionally biased inference, and extrapolation from irrelevant
   cases. The limited evidentiary base coincides with a lack of
   consideration of the theoretical conditions under which the paradox
   might apply. To address these issues this article theorizes some scope
   conditions for the paradox. It then applies synthetic control, a
   quantitative method for valid comparison when appropriate counterfactual
   cases are lacking, to model international conflict between
   India-Pakistan, China-India, and North Korea-USA, before and after
   nuclearization. The article finds only limited support for the paradox
   when considered as a general theory, or within the theorized scope
   conditions based on the balance of resolve and power within each dyad.},

Abstract = {The article investigates how exposure to gang-affiliated peers affects
   social behaviors and attitudes of early adolescents. Much of the
   literature finds that exposure to gangs contributes to adolescents'
   antisocial behaviors. According to other studies, however, gang exposure
   can also promote prosocial behaviors. The present article re-examines
   this contradictory evidence, exploring potential complementarity of both
   reactions to gangs. Using a survey of 1,782 adolescents aged ten to 13
   from rural Colombia, I compare adolescents who are and are not in a
   school class with members of youth gangs. I exploit the fact that
   schools in rural Colombia are unsegregated. Moreover, the presence of
   youth gangs across these schools is linked to incidence of historic
   armed conflict rather than typical forms of social disadvantage. This
   comparative setting thus allows me to establish an unconfounded
   relationship between exposure to gang-affiliated classmates and social
   outcomes. The analysis reveals gender differences in the effect of youth
   gang exposure. I find that girls react to male gang classmate by
   increased involvement in prosocial organizations. Boys, by contrast,
   adjust to male gangs by expressing more antisocial attitudes. There are
   no gender differences in the effect of gang classmates on alcohol
   consumption (an indicator of antisocial behavior). The article shows
   that the well-documented antisocial adjustments to gangs are -
   population-wide - complemented by prosocial adjustments, with gender
   being a key moderator. I discuss the implications of these findings for
   theories of violence and social change after conflict.},

Title = {Do Intergovernmental Organizations Have a Socialization Effect on Member
   State Preferences? Evidence from the UN General Debate},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},

Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {The question of whether intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) have a
   socialization effect on member state preferences is central to
   international relations. However, empirical studies have struggled to
   separate the socializing effects of IGOs on preferences from the
   coercion and incentives associated with IGOs that may lead to foreign
   policy alignment without altering preferences. This article addresses
   this issue. We adopt a novel approach to measuring state preferences by
   applying text analytic methods to country statements in the annual
   United Nations General Debate (UNGD). The absence of interstate
   coordination with UNGD statements makes them particularly well suited
   for testing socialization effects on state preferences. We focus on the
   European Union (EU), enabling us to incorporate the pre-accession
   period-when states have the strongest incentives for foreign policy
   alignment-into our analysis. The results of our analysis show that EU
   membership has a socialization effect that produces preference
   convergence, controlling for coercion and incentive effects.},

Title = {The EURO-D Measure of Depressive Symptoms in the Aging Population:
   Comparability Across European Countries and Israel},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {Most of the countries in Europe are experiencing a rapid aging of their
   populations and with this an increase in mental health challenges due to
   aging. Comparative research may help countries to assess the promotion
   of healthy aging in general, and mentally healthy aging in particular,
   and explore ways for adapting mental health policy measures. However,
   the comparative study of mental health indicators requires that the
   groups understand the survey questions inquiring about their mental
   health in the same way and display similar response patterns. Otherwise,
   observed differences in perceived mental health may not reflect true
   differences but rather cultural bias in the health measures. To date,
   research on cross-country equivalence of depression measures among older
   populations has received very limited attention. Thus, there is a
   growing need for the cross-country validation of existing depression
   measures using samples of the older population and establishing
   measurement equivalence of the assessment tools. Indeed, insights on
   mental health outcomes and how they compare across societies is
   paramount to inform policy makers seeking to improve mental health
   conditions of the populations. This study, therefore, aims to examine
   measurement equivalence of self-reported depressive symptoms among older
   populations in 17 European countries and Israel. The data for the
   current analysis are from the sixth wave (2015) of the Survey on Health,
   Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and consist of the population of
   respondents 50 years of age and older. The measurement of depression is
   based on the EURO-D scale, which was developed by a European consortium.
   It identifies existing depressive symptoms and consists of the 12 items:
   depression, pessimism, suicidality, guilt, sleep, interest,
   irritability, appetite, fatigue, concentration, enjoyment, and
   tearfulness. We examine the cross-country comparability of these data by
   testing for measurement equivalence using multigroup confirmatory factor
   analysis (MGCFA) and alignment. Our findings reveal partial equivalence
   thus allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions on similarities and
   differences among the older population across 18 countries on the EURO-D
   measure of depression. Findings are discussed in light of policy
   implications for universal access to mental health care across
   countries.},

Abstract = {Existing literature regarding punctuated equilibrium theories (PET) and
   agenda diversity has examined the patterns of cross-domain attention
   allocation based on western democracies; however, few studies have
   systematically discussed the situation within a specific policy domain
   in transitioning countries. To address this research gap, this study
   empirically explored the punctuations and diversity in attention
   allocation within China's national e-government issue from 2001 to 2018.
   By employing the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to analyse
   relevant articles on e-government in the People's Daily, we derived 10
   distinct dimensions hidden in the corpora and constructed an original
   dataset of the e-government agenda. The empirical findings revealed that
   the information processing in the domain of the e-government in China
   are leptokurtic, and a gradual decrease in the intensity of punctuations
   with the enhancement of central coordination and civic participation was
   also observed. We also found that the dynamics of attention diversity
   partially followed the theoretical expectations of classic scholarships.
   By examining patterns of attention allocation across multiple dimensions
   within a certain policy, our findings speak to literature on PET and
   agenda diversity and increases the externality of relevant theories
   derived from the cross-domain analysis.},

Abstract = {We analyzed posts written by Facebook profiles who advocate violent
   jihad without supporting any terrorist group. They share extremist
   content in the middle of regular posts, thanks to which they are likely
   to reach a large audience. We identified to what extent their
   ingroup-outgroup opposition is constructed in crisis, identity, and
   solution frames and how they use these frames in posts which sometimes
   breach Facebook's community standards, but which mostly circumvent them
   through various strategies of doublespeak. Among them, myth, in the
   sense of Barthes, and eudaimonic content appeared as particularly
   powerful to naturalize and spread jihadi ideology on social media.},

Abstract = {A variety of forms and practices of citizenship in China has been well
   studied, but, unfortunately, studies on industrial citizenship are
   missing. Moreover, while there has been a growing literature on Chinese
   workers and their relationship with management in the last decade or so,
   most of it has focussed on protest and litigation rather than on
   deliberation and industrial citizenship. This paper fills the
   intellectual gap by applying T. H. Marshall's idea of industrial
   citizenship to workplaces in China and examining it through a case study
   of a workplace deliberation experiment. The workplace deliberation
   experiment showed that, first, workplace deliberation in China can be
   seen as a form of industrial citizenship and ``participatory
   management{''}, which still retains an element of hierarchy, but falls
   short of the radical idea of industrial democracy and unionism. Second,
   workplace deliberation improved management practices but still faced
   significant obstacles, such as asymmetric power relationships and the
   control characteristics of industrial relations. Though Chinese
   industries are institutionalizing more workers' voice input, Beijing
   nevertheless forestalls the Polish style of an independent trade union,
   thus workplace deliberation can be seen as a part of its authoritarian
   empowerment strategy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of trust in corrupt networks and networks
   that facilitate corruption. Specifically, we ask what is the role of
   particularized trust in the operation of systemic corruption? How is the
   basis of trust reflected in the logic of corruption and with which
   effects? Based on the analysis of 50 in-depth interviews in two Mexican
   cities, we analyze two types of particularized trust that bind actors in
   informal networks: trust based on political affiliation and/or personal
   relationships and trust derived from complicity, or the co-participation
   in illicit activities. Analysis suggests that the basis of trust and the
   dynamics that arise thereof have different effects on the functioning
   and stability of the informal networks and that these, in turn, reflect
   the informal governance systems in place. This article provides further
   empirical evidence to the central role that particularized trust plays
   in contexts of systemic corruption, highlighting the importance of
   understanding these dynamics for the design of anti-corruption efforts.},

Abstract = {What impact did Donald Trump have on the Republican Party during his
   time as President? This article argues that although the presidency of
   Donald Trump was a natural progression of Republican conservatism, his
   legacy has cast a shadow on the Republican Party, as well as having
   further pushed the party rightward, whilst also helping to move the
   fringe/more extreme elements of Republican conservatism closer to the
   centre of American politics. As a result, the GOP has become
   increasingly dependent on a base of white support. Continuing along this
   path will only further put them at odds with a majority of the country
   and less likely to realize electoral victories. Only by a continued
   abating of democracy through compromises in the design of representative
   institutions and electoral practices will they be likely to win or
   retain power.},

Title = {`Turning' everywhere in IR: on the sociological underpinnings of the
   field's proliferating turns},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {314-340},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, calls for International Relations (IR) to
   `turn' have multiplied. Having reflected on Philosophy's own linguistic
   turn in the 1980s and 1990s, IR appears today in the midst of taking -
   almost simultaneously - a range of different turns, from the aesthetic
   to the affective, from the historical to the practice, from the new
   material to the queer. This paper seeks to make sense of this puzzling
   development. Building on Bourdieu's sociology of science, we argue that
   although the turns ostensibly bring about (or resuscitate) ambitious
   philosophical, ontological, and epistemological questions to challenge
   what is deemed to constitute the `mainstream' of IR, their impact is
   more likely to be felt at the `margins' of the discipline. From this
   perspective, claiming a turn constitutes a position-enhancing move for
   scholars seeking to accumulate social capital, understood as scientific
   authority, and become `established heretics' within the intellectual
   subfield of critical IR. We therefore expect the proliferation of turns
   to reshape more substantively what it means to do critical IR, rather
   than turning the whole discipline on its head.},

Abstract = {American capitalist medicine has produced a national healthcare system
   that is the most expensive - and producing the worse outcomes for
   patients - in the world. For many patients, social inequities and racial
   disparities embedded throughout the US healthcare system have only
   deepened and intensified over the last two decades, with very few
   realizing the promises made by medical technological innovation.
   Healthcare policy makers are turning to `data-driven healthcare' as a
   solution to these endemic problems. Yet the promise that digital
   technologies and data analytics will solve some of the most vexing
   questions in medical science, and will make healthcare more accessible,
   affordable, and equitable, in fact, hides the ongoing, structural
   inequities and injustices in health care.},

Title = {Everything Is Relative: How Citizens Form and Use Expectations in
   Evaluating Services},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {561-577},

Abstract = {In recent years, studies of citizen satisfaction have increasingly
   relied on the expectancy-dis-confirmation model, which highlights the
   role that expectations play in driving citizen evaluations of government
   services. But most empirical studies within public administration of the
   relationship between expectations and satisfaction indicate that
   expectations have little-to-no net effect on satisfaction. We argue that
   these results may be largely driven by the weaknesses of existing
   measurement approaches and inattention in many studies to the
   distinction between two types of expectations: those about what should
   happen (normative expectations) versus those about what will happen
   (predictive expectations). Distinguishing between these two types of
   expectations is important because they are likely to have different-and
   perhaps even opposite-effects on satisfaction. We recruited 972 US
   residents via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to complete a survey vignette
   experiment and found that normative expectations are strongly (and
   negatively) related to satisfaction levels, whereas predictive
   expectations are barely related to satisfaction at all. We also find
   that comparative performance information generally has a much stronger
   effect on predictive expectations than on normative expectations. These
   findings suggest that theories of satisfaction should more consistently
   distinguish between different types of expectations. Our results also
   leave us somewhat optimistic about the ability of ordinary residents to
   follow a reasonable process when assigning normative meaning to
   performance information.},

Abstract = {Concerns about closing civic space have focused on human rights, and
   little to date has been known of the impacts on development. This
   article traces impacts of closing civic space on civil society and
   social movements addressing poverty and hunger in Brazil, Ethiopia,
   Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Countries that clamped down on civil society and
   social movements have not all fared badly in terms of poverty and
   hunger, as the `developmental states' of China and Vietnam demonstrate.
   This article proposes that how closures of civic space affect
   development outcomes will depend on the role civil society plays in
   development, and specifically on the `fit' between civil society and the
   state with respect to development policy and programming. Despite
   diversity in political and economic context, restrictions on civic space
   commonly prevent broad civic engagement in policy processes, in
   particular critique or scrutiny of government policy and practice, and
   hamper non-governmental organizations' service delivery. Because civic
   engagement matters most for marginalized and disempowered people, their
   exclusion from policy processes and services will deepen. Reversals or
   stagnation in progress towards addressing poverty and hunger indicate
   that as civic space narrows, the most marginalized and disempowered
   groups face a growing risk of being left behind.},

Abstract = {Why do some countries rapidly adopt policies suggested by scientific
   consensus while others are slow to do so? Through a mixed methods study,
   we show that the institutional political economy of countries is a
   stronger and more robust predictor of health policy adoption than either
   disease burden or national wealth. Our findings challenge expectations
   in scholarship and among many international actors that policy
   divergence is best addressed through greater evidence and dissemination
   channels. Our study of HIV treatment policies shows that factors such as
   the formal structures of government and the degree of racial and ethnic
   stratification in society predict the speed with which new medical
   science is translated into policy, while level of democracy does not.
   This provides important new insights about the drivers of policy
   transfer and diffusion and suggests new paths for practical efforts to
   secure adoption of `evidence-based' policies.},

Abstract = {After almost a decade of conservative governments in Canada, the Liberal
   Party returned to power in 2015 under the leadership of Justin Trudeau.
   His resounding victory enabled him to implement a progressive agenda,
   one that prioritized cross-cutting gender equality, which led to the
   development of a feminist foreign policy (PEF, by its acronym in
   Spanish). The purpose of this paper is to analyze the conceptualization,
   implementation and results of this Canadian initiative, in order to
   identify lessons that might be useful to Mexico, one year after the

Abstract = {Respect for human rights is one of the main conditions for European
   Union (EU) cooperation with third countries. When human rights are
   gravely violated, the EU can apply a variety of restrictive measures
   ranging from issuing sanctions threats to imposing economic sanctions.
   However, can such measures impact the subsequent human rights situation
   in the target country, and under what conditions? Using time-series
   cross-sectional data accounting for eleven post-Soviet states over a
   period of twenty-six years (1991-2016), this article demonstrates that
   the impact of sanctions on the target's human rights situation depends
   on two factors - the type of sanction applied and the extent of the
   target's linkage with alternative regional powers. In the absence of
   regional alternative support, sanctions in the form of arms embargoes
   and aid suspension demonstrate a positive effect on the human rights
   situation.},

Title = {Gendered Articulations of Control and Care on Social Media During the
   COVID-19 Pandemic in Hungary},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine the Hungarian Fidesz-KDNP
   government ` s discursive practices of control and care during the first
   wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper researches the Hungarian
   government's communication on the official Hungarian COVID-19 Facebook
   page during the first wave of the pandemic. Its aim is to answer the
   question how the Hungarian government articulated control and care to
   reinforce sedimented gendered division of care work and institutions of
   control to tackle the potential disruption of the system of care before
   the widespread vaccination of the elderly population was available in
   the country. The paper argues that the pandemic has allowed the
   government to exert control in areas, such as the crisis in the
   workforce market and health care system, as well as in the destabilized
   system of care work. The main finding is that in the material the
   government performs control over care work, whose intensified discussion
   during the pandemic could lead to a potential disruption within the
   illiberal logic on two different levels. First, physical care work
   related to immediate physical needs, like hunger, clothing, pain enacted
   by female shoppers, female health care workers and female social
   workers, is newly defined during the pandemic as local, family-bound and
   a naturally female task. Second, the government articulates care work,
   either as potentially harmful (for the elderly population and thus
   indirectly to the government's familialist politics), or as vulnerable
   and in need of protection from outside influences (portrayed through the
   interaction of health care workers and ``hospital commanders{''}). This
   enables the government to perform full state control over care workers
   through the mobilization of police and military masculinity and to
   strengthen and re-naturalize the already existing hierarchies between
   traditional gender roles from a new perspective during the pandemic.
   This state of affairs highlights the vulnerability both of the elderly
   population, on whom its familialism builds, and of the system of
   informal care work, which builds on the unpaid care work of female
   citizens, who paradoxically are also articulated as potential harm for
   the elderly and for the system.},

Abstract = {This paper has a threefold objective. Firstly, it casts a new light on
   the legacy of the 1960s' student rebellion in the West and in Eastern
   Europe, reinterpreting the two upheavals as opposing kinds of
   civilizational critique of the modern project. Secondly, it unwraps the
   key problems with visions of re-enchanted modernity proposed by the
   Western and Eastern European Left. Lastly, it contends that reassessing
   the legacy of 1968 may offer a key to understanding the resurgence of
   illiberal movements in the twenty-first century.
   This symposium offers EEPS audience insights to the process of peer
   review to which manuscripts submitted to the journal are subjected. It
   is composed of the original paper (titled ``Re-enchanting Modernity in
   the East and West: Comparative Perspectives on the Legacy of 1968{''}),
   reviews and additional comments by the three reviewers, and the author's
   response. It illustrates the variety of criteria typically used by
   reviewers - and editors - in their assessment of submitted research
   papers and essays, as well as the options available to their authors in
   response. The symposium is also a contribution to the ongoing debates on
   the topic of the manuscript in question: the legacies of the tumultuous
   year 1968 and the contributions of the generation defined by those
   events to the intellectual, political, and other dimensions of public
   affairs in the East and the West.},

Title = {How much is too much? Effects of core concerns accommodativeness on
   emotion, credibility and integrative intention in supervisor-subordinate
   conflict negotiation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {574-598},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study drew on the core concerns framework (CCF) and communication
   accommodation theory (CAT) to examine the direct and indirect effects of
   manager core concerns accommodativeness on employee integrative (i.e.
   cooperative) intention through the mediating role of positive emotional
   change and manager credibility (i.e. competence, trustworthiness and
   goodwill). Core concerns accommodativeness refers to the degree to which
   one responds to another's socio-psychological needs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 339 working adults from
   various industries in the USA took an online questionnaire composed of
   manipulations, closed-ended and open-ended questions. Quantitative data
   was analyzed using a series of mediation analyses and triangulated with
   qualitative data.
   Findings
   The results showed that both accommodating and overaccommodating manager
   messages significantly improved employees' emotional state, perception
   of manager credibility and integrative intention more than the
   underaccommodating message. Importantly, the manager communication
   accommodativeness increases employees' positive emotional change which
   heightened the employees' perception of manager trustworthiness which
   then stimulated employees' integrative intention. Qualitative data
   surprisingly revealed that the overaccommodating message was regarded
   predominantly positively.
   Originality/value
   The mixed-methods approach of this study added deeper insight into the
   role of communication accommodation and emotion in
   supervisor-subordinate conflict negotiation, extending both the CCF and
   CAT literature. The findings also inform managers about how to
   effectively use the core concerns.},

Abstract = {The past 15 years have witnessed a striking trend in global governance:
   the creation of comparative indicators of the performance of
   international institutions by donor states seeking to allocate their
   resources more efficiently. Interestingly, however, not all highly rated
   institutions have been ``rewarded{''} with increased contributions,
   while not all poorly rated institutions have been ``punished{''} with
   funding cuts or freezes. I argue that the financial impact of
   performance indicators is contingent upon the relationship between
   institutions and other actors within their environment, with stronger
   effects occurring when institutions (1) are subject to a higher degree
   of resource competition and (2) possess deeper and more extensive
   operational alliances with actors above and below the state. I test the
   argument using a mixed-methods strategy that draws on a variety of
   original sources, including key informant interviews and a new dataset
   covering fifty-three institutions over the period 2000-2016. The
   findings enhance our understanding of when and why comparative
   performance indicators influence resource flows to assessed entities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Despite widespread acknowledgement of the dangers of selective
   subsidisation, government support to business remains common practice.
   Looking at State aid allocations in the European Union, the article
   explores why some countries grant more aid than others. Scholarship has
   failed to address this issue in a comprehensive manner, focusing either
   on the responsiveness of governments to voters' preferences or on the
   use of subsidies as a way to ensure the political survival of the
   incumbent. Using the lens of distributive politics, this article
   proposes a more comprehensive account of State aid politics that joins
   these two perspectives. By means of time-series cross-section regression
   analysis, it tests how aid allocation depends on the attainment of
   policy goals (namely correction of market failures), electoral
   pragmatism and responsibility towards international commitments. The
   results show that politicians are indeed electorally pragmatic, but not
   necessarily responsive, due to institutional constraints and
   international commitments.},

Abstract = {This study explores how autism and education policy are affected by
   austerity measures in Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and Greece by using a
   path dependence analysis. The implementation of mixed mainstream
   classrooms and improvements to infrastructure coincided with the
   ratification of inclusive education policy. Austerity measures appeared
   temporally associated with furthering of integration and inclusion
   policy for all countries under study, potentially due to the economic
   incentives of an integrated system. This trend is especially visible in
   Ireland, Portugal, and Greece, whereas lesser so in Italy. Even though
   the initial focus of this analysis was autism, the findings are
   applicable to the general area of special education needs due to the
   non-specific nature of national policies.},

Abstract = {We explore the role and influence of the Finnish energy elite's inner
   circle in the process of transition to renewable energy. Finland is a
   corporatist country where economic interest groups have privileged
   access to government decision-making circles. These dense networks
   reproduce decades-long energy policy structures that have always favored
   centralized electricity production, a model now implemented in renewable
   energy production. We address the formation of feed-in tariffs (FITs, a
   government subsidy for electricity produced by renewable energy) in
   Finland's routine corporatist system between 2006 and 2011. The views of
   inner-circle actors expressed in formal government documents correspond
   to legislative outcomes regarding FITs. They preferred market-based
   solutions and cost-efficiency and transferred the costs of FITs to the
   state budget, which benefited large companies. This was partly possible
   because Finland's corporatist energy policy model excludes
   non-inner-circle actors. Nevertheless, FITs have enabled the growing
   significance of wind power.},

Abstract = {Voters in many advanced democracies increasingly dislike their political
   opponents, a phenomenon that is known as affective polarisation. The
   growing animosity between electorates is particularly challenging in
   multiparty systems, where ruling is more dependent on cross-party
   alliances. In this work, we examine the case of Spain, a multiparty
   democracy that exhibits one of the highest levels of affective
   polarisation among advanced democracies. Using public opinion databases
   as well as extensive qualitative evidence, we operationalise and explore
   the evolution of affective polarisation in the Spanish electorate and
   its main drivers, with a particular focus on the competition for the
   left-wing electorate between the PSOE and Podemos during the 2015-2020
   period.},

Abstract = {Imposing significant challenges for both street-level implementation and
   policy (re)design, crises alter the environment for street-level policy
   entrepreneurship (SLPE), wherein street-level bureaucrats engage in
   policy formulation processes to secure future policy outcomes.
   Nevertheless, like street-level implementation in general, SLPE is
   studied during ordinary times but rarely during crises. Focusing on
   community-health workers in Brazil during the Covid-19 crisis uncovered
   a defensive motivation for SLPE, which aimed to legitimize community
   healthcare as an integral part of pandemic treatment, reforming the
   government's hitherto neglectful approach to community health services.
   Moreover, the continuing crisis created an unusually prolonged window of
   opportunity for securing community healthcare provision. By utilizing
   collective efforts and drawing on powerful politicians' mobilization,
   SLPE during crisis shares similarities with, yet differs from, SLPE
   during ordinary times, while further closing the interstices between
   local, professional, and political perspectives in the formulation of
   policy decisions.},

Abstract = {The issue of the relationship between pirate parties and populism has
   not yet been adequately resolved. This article aims to answer this
   question: Regarding its communication, is it possible to classify the
   Czech Pirate Party as a populist party? For that purpose, the Pirates'
   communication has been contextualized in a comparative perspective with
   the Czech parties ANO and SPD, which are commonly considered populist.
   The study uses qualitative and quantitative content analysis and the
   principle of triplets to measure populism. Among other things, the
   analysis indicates that the level of populism in the communication of
   the Pirates is negligible and the party cannot be identified as
   populist. Moreover, the anti-establishment appeal does not prevail in
   the communication either. In this respect, however, the communication of
   the Pirates has significantly changed after entering the Parliament.},

Abstract = {Right-wing terrorism (RWT) poses an increasing threat to Western
   societies, with perpetrators targeting diverse members of society. We
   investigated the affective and attitudinal outcomes of exposure to news
   about RWT, depending on the victims' religious affiliation (Christian
   vs. Muslim). Results of a quota-based experiment in {[}Austria;
   predominantly non-Muslim] (N = 315) revealed no direct effects of the
   victims' religious affiliation on affective and attitudinal outcomes.
   However, mediation analyses suggest that, compared to Muslim victims,
   Christian victims elicit higher perceived similarity, which in turn,
   impacts compassion. Similarity and compassion then significantly predict
   affective and attitudinal outcomes. Theoretical and practical
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing interest in women and grassroots/indigenous peace
   methods inclusion in peacebuilding in the Sub-Sahara region. These moves
   are proposed as subsidiaries to the `high-level' conventional
   institutions' methods. Yet, grassroots/indigenous institutions are not
   recognised, and women continue to be viewed as passive victims to be
   protected- but what roles do indigenous women institutions play in
   peacebuilding? Using empirical data and critical literature on gender
   and peacebuilding, this paper analyses how South Sudanese indigenous
   women (Honyomiji) institution engage in peacebuilding. It argues that
   women's indigenous obligations of leadership, education, social support
   and religious/cultural ceremonies are crucial in national peacebuilding.
   Also, it recognises that such institutions' terms may not be aligned
   with conventional standards and make the work of acknowledging
   indigenous peace methods difficult. However, this paper suggests that
   their inclusion in the national peace initiatives may provide
   alternative methods for delivering sustainable peace and learning to
   peace actors.},

Abstract = {This article sets out to examine two claims that have increasingly come
   to define the dividing lines between the ideational and the
   post-foundational discursive approaches to populism: namely, that the
   former is moralistic and the latter is normative in orientation. The
   article considers the conceptual merits of both critiques while using
   them to further examine some of the implicit assumptions and pitfalls
   within Cas Mudde's and Ernesto Laclau's paradigmatic conceptualizations
   of populism. It is argued that ideational scholars' attribution of a
   moralistic particularity to populism runs the risk of pathologizing the
   latter for characteristics that are arguably constitutive of all
   politics, while the danger of a certain crypto-normativity can be seen
   in Laclau's tendency to equate populism with the political and
   simultaneously emphasize its emancipatory effects. The key difference
   between the two approaches ultimately consists in the location that they
   assign to populism within the wider topography of politics itself.},

Abstract = {Special rights (such as a right to representation) are often used to
   address under-representation of minority and marginalised groups in
   political institutions. The case of Roma community in Slovenia is no
   different. Using a framework of social and political marginalisation,
   our article outlines asymmetry and exceptionality in the existing
   minority protection provisions for Slovenian Roma. We argue that the
   existing provisions are a consequence of majority's perception of Roma
   as racialised, marginalised, and undeserving group. We show that the
   limited access to special rights for Roma is not an oversight in the
   Slovenian democratic institutional design but a result of deep-rooted
   stereotypes and racialisation that this marginalised group is subjected
   to. More broadly, the case of Slovenian Roma demonstrates how principles
   of racialisation and marginalisation can help us understand absences of
   different marginalised minority groups from frameworks of special
   protection.},

Abstract = {Strategy is action in space and time. It is impossible to conceive of
   strategic behaviour outside of time, and the management of temporal
   factors plays a substantial role in determining the path and outcome of
   conflict. Yet time's role in strategy has been empirically under-studied
   and theoretically neglected by scholars. This paper addresses this by
   identifying four constituent concepts of time for strategists: Order,
   Duration, Significance and Transition. The paper explores how each
   applies to and can improve our understanding of strategic behaviour. The
   paper concludes by outlining some of the promising avenues of policy
   opportunity and scholarly research.},

Title = {Perceived School Characteristics Fostering Civic Engagement Among
   Adolescents in Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {It has been widely argued that effective citizenship education should
   focus on more than mere teaching of civic knowledge, but should provide
   a wider range of opportunities for the experience of participation and
   development of skills, efficacy and interest instrumental to active
   citizenship. Opportunities for critical reflection such as open
   classroom discussions, fairness at school, institutional efficacy and
   student participation at school activities have been linked to the
   development of civic and political attitudes. The capacity of school
   education to provide opportunities for critical reflection on students'
   participative experiences, however, has not been explored empirically
   sufficiently. This paper aims to identify the contribution of different
   school characteristics to the development of civic and political
   attitudes and their impact on students' level of participation in civic
   activities through a mixed methods study. Questionnaire data collected
   in two waves with 685 adolescents from Italy were analyzed through
   structural equation modeling to test the effects of school
   characteristics at Time 1 (democratic climate, student participation and
   critical reflection) on civic participation at Time 2, mediated by
   institutional trust, civic efficacy and political interest. In order to
   explore the quantitative findings and examine further students'
   perceptions of the school aspects that support their civic involvement,
   focus group discussions were conducted with students from secondary
   schools with different tracks.The results highlight the importance of
   opportunities for active involvement in school and critical reflection
   in fostering political interest, efficacy and civic participation.
   Democratic school climate was found to impact institutional trust and
   civic efficacy, but not participation. Students' accounts of schools'
   citizenship education activities highlight further the need for a
   participative environment that rises above information transmission by
   inviting critical reflection and giving value to students' active
   involvement in the institution.},

Abstract = {In most industrialised countries, citizens enjoy a very large amount of
   free time towards the end of their lives, when they are retired, but
   find it very costly to access free time during the middle part of their
   lives. This is concerning because those who die early are deprived of
   the reward of free time that retirement holds. Extreme discrepancies
   between a time-rich old age and a time-scarce middle age are not,
   however, inevitable: some states incentivise long work hours during
   middle age in combination with early retirement, whereas others
   incentivise shorter work hours during middle age and later retirement.
   This variation raises the thus far unexplored question of how a just
   society should design policies that affect the costs of access to free
   time across the life course. I answer this question by using a
   hypothetical decision-situation where prudent choosers must allocate
   access to free time across different life stages.},

Abstract = {Institutional explanations of intra-party violence rarely address
   political economy dynamics shaping the institutions in question, and
   therefore they fail to understand their emergence and their stability.
   Specifically, focusing on institutional factors alone does not enable a
   nuanced understanding of candidate nomination violence and why some
   constituencies are peaceful while others are violent. This article
   theorizes nomination violence in dominant-party systems in sub-Saharan
   Africa. Drawing on political settlement theory, it examines the nature
   of nomination violence in Uganda's October 2015 National Resistance
   Movement (NRM) primaries. We argue that the violence is a constitutive
   part of Uganda's political settlement under the NRM. Nomination
   procedures remain weak in order for the NRM ruling elite to include
   multiple factions that compete for access while being able to intervene
   in the election process when needed. This means, in turn, that violence
   tends to become particularly prominent in constituencies characterized
   by proxy wars, where competition between local candidates is reinforced
   by a conflict among central-level elites in the president's inner
   circle. We call for the proxy war thesis to be tested in case studies of
   other dominant parties' nomination processes.},

Abstract = {The potential threat posed by returning and repatriated foreign fighters
   and the upcoming release of homegrown violent extremists from prisons in
   developed democracies has raised interest in terrorist rehabilitation
   programs. Few studies, however, systematically examine how the public
   views such programs. Drawing on research on public attitudes toward
   prisoner reentry in criminology and social psychological theory, this
   study offers a series of hypotheses about support for rehabilitation
   programming for terrorist offenders. These hypotheses are then tested
   through a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of
   1,021 adult citizens in the United States. The results show that the
   public is less supportive of postrelease rehabilitation programming for
   terrorists than other criminal offenders. Support is also lower when an
   Islamist, rather than a white nationalist, offender is referenced.
   Support increases when a referenced Islamist is described as a juvenile
   convicted of a less serious offense. Men, younger individuals, those
   with some college education, and self-identified liberals are more
   likely to support terrorist rehabilitation programming. Finally,
   irrespective of treatment, respondents are most likely to cite evidence
   of effectiveness as the factor that would increase their support for
   rehabilitation programming.},

   or ``recitation{''}) as soundtrack elements within its video messaging,
   focusing primarily on a sample set of 755 videos released in 2015. The
   authors also present the development of an automatic content recognition
   (ACR) tool that enabled them to engage this large data set. The article
   then explores the possibilities of ACR for the identification of
   terrorist audio and video, utilizing the conclusions drawn from the
   trends of audio usage in Da'esh video messaging to support the validity
   and promise of such an approach.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The Syrian civil war has confounded all predictions on its end date and
   is still ongoing. Valuable explicative work has been done on civil war
   duration; however, scholars have failed to reliably predict the end of
   ongoing conflicts. This article argues that faulty predictions on
   termination date of the Syrian conflict did not necessarily result from
   statistical errors in modeling civil wars data and better models might
   not necessarily mitigate the prediction problem. Rather, three factors
   contributed to the misperceptions: the conflict's cartography problem,
   the splintering of the opposition, and the multi-partner foreign
   intervention in the conflict. The last two factors can also be held
   accountable for prolonging the conflict. Incorrect predictions or
   descriptions in scholarly works on ongoing conflicts can have disastrous
   implications for the present and future of states and populations beset
   by protracted conflict. Had it been made clear that neither the
   insurgents nor the government had the capacity to win the war within the
   predicted timeframe, the international community may have taken a more
   decisive role in bringing belligerents to the negotiation table,
   improving prospects for a peaceful diplomatic settlement.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the international strategy
   developed by the regime of Nicolis Maduro in Venezuela to address its
   internal limitations in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It argues
   that in the context of an economic crisis and international isolation,
   Maduro's government needs the aid of China and Russia, two revisionist
   powers, to deal with the pandemic. Beyond that, however, Venezuela's
   policy has also involved a positioning in favor of Russia and China in
   the struggle to build a new global order. This process has been
   accelerated by the pandemic and Venezuela has adopted the position of a
   revolutionary state that has signed up to the demands for a new global
   order set out by the two revisionist powers.},

Abstract = {This article provides a theoretical understanding of the potential
   contribution of digital platforms to the co-creation of public value. On
   the basis of insights from different academic disciplines, a layered
   model is developed for the relations between technology, governance,
   users and societal outcomes. The theoretical model proposes that these
   layers can result in basic configurations consistent combinations of the
   four elements - but also hybrid configurations. We identify three basic
   configurations: (1) a closed platform controlled by a private sector
   organisation, (2) an open platform controlled by a government
   organisation and (3) an open platform run by a civil society
   organisation. The configurations are illustrated with examples of
   digital platforms from all over the world. The configurational
   understanding of digital platforms for the co-creation of public value
   provides the basis for a systematic analysis of these rapidly growing
   practices in countries around the world.},

Title = {The Politics of Generosity. Colombian Official Discourse towards
   Migration from Venezuela, 2015-2018},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {29-56},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: As a step towards understanding the nature of power
   and political action amidst large-scale human mobility, the article
   analyses how migration from Venezuela emerged in Colombian official
   discourse between 2015 and 2018. The aim is to trace Colombia's
   migration policy's leading drivers, widely perceived as a generous
   response towards an escalating humanitarian crisis. Methodology: A
   context analysis of over 400-plus pieces of information produced by
   three high-level entities inside the Colombian government was designed.
   Units of analysis were defined based on van Dijk's (1997) approach to
   political discourse, while coding of information was traced drawing upon
   selected scholarship on Critical Border Studies. Conclusions: Colombian
   official discourse between 2015 and 2018 was shaped by pragmatism,
   focusing on consolidating a schema of specific governmentality by
   eliciting three interrelated processes: the construction of an imaginary
   of migration from Venezuela as a process made precarious; the
   consolidation of a strategy of irregularization; and the centering of
   `generosity' as the leading premise for legitimizing political action.
   Originality: The article sheds light on the nature of the power context
   in which the Colombian government's response to migration from Venezuela
   emerged by empirically adapting current critical scholarship.},

   Assessing the Duality of Formal and Informal Mechanisms in Promoting
   Collaborative Processes},

Abstract = {To address complex and cross-cutting policy problems, multiple
   independent administrative units within an organization often work
   together to accomplish a larger objective. Within local governments,
   doing this requires administrative mechanisms able to facilitate
   interdepartmental collaboration, through which the efforts of individual
   units contribute to city-wide policy goals. Research increasingly finds
   that informal elements of collaboration, such as casual communications,
   ad hoc meetings, and voluntary working groups, are important for
   building strong and trusting collaborative ties. Conversely, a
   nontrivial number of studies also suggest that formal mechanisms, such
   as mandates, rules, and authority, are necessary for ensuring and
   sustaining credible commitment over time. This research empirically
   examines the types of coordination mechanisms employed by US local
   governments to promote intragovernmental efforts to collaborate around
   the issue of sustainability-a complex and broad objective that
   transcends city departments' traditional boundaries. It particularly
   focuses on assessing the relative contributions of formal and informal
   mechanisms toward achieving that end. Results from structural equation
   modeling analyses of 506 city governments indicate that informal
   mechanisms are positively and significantly associated with promoting
   cross-departmental collaboration. Interestingly, the results further
   show that formal mechanisms, while lacking a direct association with
   collaboration, have important implications for facilitating
   collaborative processes indirectly through their influence on informal
   mechanisms. Overall, our findings suggest a critical need for balancing
   the two approaches when forging interdepartmental collaboration.
   Implications for policy and future research are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Less researched than the second-order character of elections to the
   European Parliament (EP) is the `Europeanness' of European elections and
   its implications for voter participation in these elections. This
   article aims to fill this gap by studying the Europeanness of the public
   debate in the run-up to the 2019 EP elections and the mobilizing power
   of European issues in these electoral contests. In doing this, we draw
   on a new data set covering intriguing aspects of the 2019 EP elections.
   The findings of the empirical analysis of media and survey data indicate
   that the elections to the EP were more European contests than ever
   before in the history of these elections - yet this is not true in the
   same way for all of the countries under consideration. Moreover, the
   Europeanness of electorates, measured as genuine orientations towards EU
   politics, matters for electoral participation and thus has the power to
   mobilize citizens. Nonetheless, national factors still play an important
   role in these elections. These findings are insightful for the future
   assessment of EP elections and the scholarly debate over multi-level
   electoral politics in Europe.},

Title = {Claims of Representation: Between Representation and Democratic
   Innovations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {This article seeks to build a bridge between the empirical scholarship
   rooted in the traditional theory of political representation and
   constructivist theory on representation by focusing on the authorization
   of claims. It seeks to answer how claims can be authorized beyond
   elections - selecting three democratic innovations and tracing claims
   through the claim-making process. Different participatory democratic
   innovations are selected - providing various claims and taking place in
   different institutional contexts, i.e., (elected) members of the Council
   of Foreigners Frankfurt; individual citizens in participatory budgeting
   procedures in Munster; and citizen's associations elected politicians in
   the referendum campaign in Hamburg. We first analyze the claims raised
   by the different claim-makers to identify their claimed constituency
   eligible to authorize claims. In the second step, we focus on the
   authorization by the claimed constituency and the relevant
   decision-making authority. The article finds that claim-making in
   democratic innovations is fractured and incomplete. Nevertheless, this
   is not the reason to dismiss democratic innovations as possible loci of
   representation; on the contrary, seen through the prism of claim-making,
   all representation - electoral and nonelectoral - is partial. Focusing
   on the authorization of claims in democratic innovations provides novel
   inferences about the potential and limits of democratic innovations for
   broadening democratic representation},

Abstract = {Why do some autocracies democratize? A country's violent past has
   received little attention. We argue that genocide and politicide
   undermine democratization by binding the elites' supporters more tightly
   to the governing power, while cementing in-group/out-group animosities,
   and helping preserve the elites' status quo position within the state.
   We test this argument on a new dataset of government atrocity and
   democratization since 1900. These novel data allow us to capture many
   important instances of atrocity missed by others, and thus take a longer
   look at democratization and violence throughout history. We find that
   episodes of genocide and politicide are associated with a lower
   likelihood of democratization in both the short and long run. These
   effects are larger and more consistent than other common explanations
   for democratization. They also differ from the effects of non-genocidal
   civil war violence.},

Abstract = {What causes ethnic minority parties (EMPs) to emerge, and why do only
   some of them become electorally successful? I test commonly offered
   explanations for variation in EMP emergence and success with a large-N,
   cross-national quantitative analysis on an original dataset of European
   legislative elections in the period 1990-2012. Using generalized linear
   mixed and Heckman selection models, I find that ethnic groups that are
   native to their state and that have previous experience with autonomy
   are most likely to establish and support EMPs. These historical factors
   eclipse the influence of variables like electoral rules, the state's
   party system and political culture, and support from kin states and

Title = {From global norms to national politics: decoupling transitional justice

Abstract = {As transitional justice has spread across the world as an expected
   approach for states dealing with grave human rights violations,
   seemingly similar global measures have been established in disparate
   ways. In Colombia, opposing administrations set up diverging types of
   transitional justice at different points in time: In 2005, President
   Uribe established a transitional justice approach for paramilitaries to
   evade intervention by the International Criminal Court and bury the
   truth. A decade later, President Santos negotiated a transitional
   justice approach with the FARC that focused on truth-telling and
   deviated from prison sentences to secure a peace agreement. Moving
   between global norms and national politics, this study reveals how
   transitional justice is adjusted, contested, and transformed, as
   different groups struggle to shape the state's approach. This generates
   a more dynamic understanding of the historical, social, and political
   processes involved in the ways that governments decouple transitional
   justice in distinct national contexts.},

Abstract = {The counterterrorism and CVE community has long questioned the
   effectiveness of counterspeech in countering extremism online. While
   most evaluation of counterspeech rely on limited reach and engagement
   metrics, this paper explores two models to better measure behavioral
   change and sentiment analysis. Conducted via partnerships between
   Facebook and counter-extremism NGOs, the first model uses A/B testing to
   analyze the effects of counterspeech exposure on
   low-prevalence-high-risk audiences engaging with Islamist extremist
   terrorist content. The second model builds upon online safety
   intervention approaches and the Redirect Method through a search based
   ``get-help{''} module, redirecting white-supremacy and Neo-Nazi related
   search-terms to disengagement NGOs.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the 15(th) March 2019 far-right
   terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand on public
   opinion toward Muslims. It also examines whether the impact of the
   attack varies for individuals across the political spectrum. We make use
   of data from the 2019 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N =
   47,951) to compare the attitudes of New Zealanders before and after the
   attack. Using a range of statistical techniques, including regression
   discontinuity analysis, we find robust evidence that the attack led to
   an immediate increase in warmth toward Muslims. We also show that this
   increase was driven by both left-wing/liberal and
   right-wing/conservative individuals in the immediate days after the
   attack. Soon after the attack, however, attitudes toward Muslims among
   the politically conservative population tended to revert to pre-attack
   levels. By contrast, political liberals maintained their heightened
   level of positive attitudes for a longer period. We discuss the possible
   theoretical reasons for these findings.},

Abstract = {This article explores the gender dynamics of recruitment materials
   published by the so-called Islamic State. Through an investigation of
   the Islamic State's only female-authored column in Dabiq, it reveals how
   a unique ``voice{''} evokes support by urging readers to consider their
   agency in both the citizen-state relationship and the husband-wife
   patriarchal structure. It utilizes an original method of contextualizing
   narratives through reflexivity and responsivity. Overall, it reveals
   that an analysis of contemporary extremist recruitment materials must
   consider the mediatized environment in which it forms as well as the
   realistic political situations to which it responds.},

Title = {Pathways of Representation in Network Governance: Evidence from
   Multi-Jurisdictional Disasters},

Abstract = {Governance systems reconcile diverse interests to enable collective
   decision-making and action. Questions related to representation in the
   governance of networks are addressed in the literature; underexplored is
   the empirical variation in governance arrangements and pathways of
   representation. Complex, multi-jurisdictional disasters provide a robust
   theoretical and empirical context in which to investigate network
   governance pathways due to the tensions between democratic principles of
   representation and the need for timely, expert-informed response
   actions. In this article, we address three questions related to network
   governance, representation, and complex disasters: what governance
   structures allow for a representation of diverse interests? What
   governance structures provide a perception of voice to key affected
   parties? And where do we see variation in the kinds of structures that
   give voice to these entities? Using an inductive, grounded theory
   approach along with mixed methods that include case studies, interviews,
   and archival data in the form ICS 209 incident reports, we provide
   evidence from 10 of the most jurisdictionally complex wildfires that
   took place in 2017. In doing so, we introduce the distinction between
   macro and micro structures of network governance for understanding more
   precisely the pathways by which representation occurs and how
   representation functions in disaster networks, There is no singular
   normative goal when we think about network governance and representation
   in disasters; rather there are competing contingencies that emerge out
   of complex contexts. We propose four key propositions to guide further
   work in this arena.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of the approaches adopted by the various
   administrations which succeeded one another in Washington between 1977
   and 2020, this article aims to demonstrate that, despite occasional and
   cyclical periods of cooling, the White House's policy towards the
   Islamic Republic is, to a large extent, characterized by a perennial and
   binary logic of ``neutralization-negotiations{''}. In doing so, this
   study seeks to show that Washington's policy of maximum pressure adopted
   since 2017, while constituting a break in form, remains consistent with
   the long-term efforts invested by the different administrations which
   preceded that of President Trump.},

   social benefits},

Abstract = {The hukou is one of the enduring institutions that defines social
   citizenship of residents/immigrants in mainland China. Whilst much
   discussion has focused on the Chinese case, relatively little attention
   has been paid to the system in Taiwan, to say nothing of a comparison
   between the two. This article seeks to enrich the discussion of the two
   hukou systems in terms of their functions in determining the access of
   cross-strait immigrants to social benefits in the respective host
   countries. Drawing on the `credibility thesis', the analytical locus is
   placed on the continuity and change of institutional functions
   underlying the apparent persistence of institutional forms. When
   granting/withholding immigrants access to local social benefits, hukou
   systems fulfil several functions: firstly, a symbolic dimension, in
   which immigrants from both sides are (artificially) regarded as citizens
   of a divided nation rather than two separate countries; secondly, a
   substantial dimension that defines the scope and extent of social
   benefit entitlements granted to the immigrants in question; and finally,
   a management dimension that allows room for considerable administrative
   discretion in terms of adaptation to various circumstances arising from
   the unsettled state of cross-strait relations. Often times, realisation
   of these various functions is compounded by conflicts in identity
   politics, with repercussions for the generosity/rigidity of social
   inclusion for cross-strait immigrants. Evidence underpinning the
   theoretical elaboration stems from the analysis of legal documents
   regulating the social rights of immigrants in mainland China and Taiwan,
   supplemented by historical traces of the politics of cross-strait
   migration. The final findings should shed light on the
   facilitative/restrictive mechanisms of the hukou regulations in mainland
   China and Taiwan, highlighting the puzzling phenomenon that both hukou
   systems are gaining increasing significance in steering the cross-strait
   migration at a time when their functions in regulating domestic
   migration are changing, if not waning.},

Title = {The Modern Regency Leadership Transition and Authoritarian Resilience
   of the Former Soviet Union and China},

Abstract = {Political regimes that can iron out some form of orderly leadership
   succession and adhere to it are generally more resilient (Blondel,
   1980). Routinized succession, being a feature of highly
   institutionalized authoritarian regimes (Slater, 2003), not only shores
   up the autocrat (Frantz \& Stein, 2017), it also benefits various social
   actors (Clapham, 1988). This echoes the argument that the more
   leadership generations an organization manages to transit, the more
   institutionalized it is (Domi ` nguez, 2002; Huntington, 1968).
   Notwithstanding all seeming benefits, regularized leadership transition
   of autocracies is still a perplexity: Why do some of them manage to
   institutionalize power succession, whereas others fail to do so? Under
   what circumstances can autocracies institutionalize, and how do they get
   on particular trajectories of institutionalization? This article answers
   these questions by comparing the two most similar cases, the
   Extant literature has shown the importance of routinized leadership
   succession for authoritarian resilience. However, the factors leading to
   orderly power transitions in autocracies are unclear. This article
   argues that an orderly succession requires relatively peaceful exit of
   the incumbent. Through a comparison of the power transition trajectories
   of the post-Stalin USSR and China in the Age of Deng Xiaoping, this
   article proposes three conditions that facilitate the voluntary
   retirement of dictators, including their strong political will to
   institutionalize successions, adequate capacity to initiate the plan,
   and reliable retirement packages. Meeting all three conditions,
   leadership succession in China has resulted in the emergence of the
   ``modern regency{''} in which the elder leaders can retire relatively
   voluntarily and continuously influence the politics of a regime after
   their retirement, especially by proactively supervising future
   leadership successions. In contrast, without meeting the initial
   requirements for a dictator's exit, the case of leadership succession in
   the USSR is characterized as parallel succession, which includes neither
   a credible plan on routinization of elite politics nor simultaneous
   coexistence of the elder leaders and the younger cohort as in the case
   of China. Moreover, during similar regime crises in the late 1980s, the
   arrangement of the modern regency helped prolong the authoritarian
   regime in China, while the USSR collapsed without this safeguard.},

Abstract = {Local policy innovation is considered one of the major drives for
   China's rapid economic development, especially during the first 35 years
   of reform in China. Given the new central policies and constant
   anti-corruption campaigns under the Xi administration, this article
   examines a timely question of why and how local officials continue to
   develop new innovative policies and projects. Based on previous
   theoretical building, the article analyzes such key institutional
   factors as new rules of game and their impact on local officials'
   competition for survival and career advancement. Selecting cases across
   all the districts from a typical city in China, this article compares
   and identifies the changing patterns in local policy innovation. Policy
   innovations are administrative choices made by local officials in
   response to new and changing institutional opportunities and
   constraints. The discussion in this article makes significant
   contributions both theoretically and empirically to the China studies.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, Western local governments are dealing with community-based
   initiatives (CBIs) of citizens providing public services. Municipalities
   possess critical resources CBIs generally lack, including subsidies,
   buildings, and exposure. There is still little knowledge on CBIs'
   factors for government support. Therefore, this study adopts an
   organizational perspective distinguishing among institutionalization
   (intraorganizational, e.g., organizational size and democratic
   legitimacy) and interaction (interorganizational, e.g., boundary
   spanning leadership {[}BSL]) factors for the support CBIs obtain from
   local government. Analyzing large N data (N = 2331) from CBIs in six
   countries by using structural equation modeling, we found that
   interaction factors are related to more government support, whereas
   institutionalization factors are less significant. More specifically, we
   found stronger relationships for BSL and linking social capital than for
   the factors related to the formalization and development of
   organizational infrastructure, including the much-discussed democratic
   legitimacy of CBIs, suggesting a limited interest of governments in this
   topic as a factor for support.},

Title = {Great Power Narcissism and Ontological (In)Security: The Narrative
   Mediation of Greatness and Weakness in International Politics},

Abstract = {Why do self-representations of weakness pervade public discourse in
   self-identified great powers? Moreover, why do they intersect with
   self-representations of greatness? Do such narrative instability,
   inconsistency, and incoherence simply indicate that great powers are
   ontologically insecure? This article advances a theoretical explanation
   that is both embedded in and contributes to scholarship that theorizes
   ontological (in)security from a Lacanian perspective. The gist,
   ironically, is that great powers' quest for greatness is co-constituted
   with the narrative construction of weakness. The article then challenges
   the assumption in existing ontological security scholarship that states
   are generally self-reflexive and experience pride when ontologically
   secure but shame when ontologically insecure. Since great power
   narratives reflect persistent, exaggerated, and simultaneous feelings of
   shame and pride, it argues that narcissism helps better account for
   great power self-identification and ontological security-seeking.
   Drawing on psychological research on narcissism, the article develops
   four narrative forms-shame, pride, denial, and insult-through which
   self-representations of weakness and greatness, and feelings of shame
   and pride, can be mediated. Finally, using empirical illustrations from
   the United States and China, the article analyzes how and with what
   implications political leaders have narrated about each respective great
   power's weakness and greatness, with a focus on the period 2006-2020.},

Abstract = {Politicians frequently issue public threats to manipulate tariffs but
   only sometimes follow through. This behavior theoretically ought to
   generate audience costs. We therefore test the validity of audience
   costs in trade war settings through a vignette-based survey experiment.
   The vignettes describe a hypothetical situation involving the U.S. and a
   second country (China, Canada, or unspecified) with whom the U.S. has a
   trade deficit. The president (Democrat, Republican, or unspecified)
   either maintains the status quo, threatens to impose tariffs and backs
   down, or threatens to impose tariffs and follows through. Our findings
   highlight differences between security and trade conflict when it comes
   to audience costs and presidential approval. While Americans sanction
   the president for issuing a threat to raise tariffs, they generally
   support backing down. Regression modeling and text analysis of a free
   response question from our surveys suggest this is because consumers are
   wary of paying the costs of tariffs.},

Abstract = {The continued relevance of the second-order elections (SOE) theory is
   one of the most widely debated issues in the study of European
   Parliament (EP) elections. While the theory has been criticized from
   many angles, the recent success of populist, extremist, and Eurosceptic
   parties raises additional questions about the applicability of a model
   that depicts EP elections as a low-stakes affair revolving around
   national issues. This article tests the SOE model with party-level data
   from all 175 EP elections held between 1979 and 2019. While turnout in
   EP elections remains well below participation rates in national
   elections, the 2019 EP elections were marked by a significant reduction
   in the average turnout gap. Across all election years, party size is the
   most potent predictor of electoral gains and losses in EP elections.
   Incumbency is associated with electoral losses in most EP election
   years. These effects are moderated by the electoral cycle and the
   electoral system in some but not all years. The expectation that the SOE
   model performs worse in countries with fragmented party systems was not
   confirmed. All in all, the SOE model continues to wield significant
   explanatory power in both the West and the East.},

Abstract = {The idea that internal inclusion requires external exclusion features
   prominently in many theoretical accounts of modern statehood and
   citizenship. In a similar vein, it has been argued that internal freedom
   of movement in the European Union requires strict immigration control at
   its external borders. This article sheds light on the relationship
   between internal de-bordering and external re-bordering, making two main
   contributions. First, we theorise the idea of an integration-demarcation
   conditionality based on the European Union's symbolic legitimacy and
   functional needs. Second, we test the common belief that public support
   for free movement within Europe depends on a restrictive border regime
   for non-European immigration. For this purpose, we assess how the
   external shock of the 2015 refugee crisis shaped the bordering
   preferences of European citizens. We find that the crisis primarily
   increased citizens' support for external re-bordering, and did not
   substantially undermine their support for internal free movement. Thus,
   the large-scale arrival of refugees has not led to a general backlash
   against open borders and immigration but has, rather, increased public
   support for the European model of combining internal freedoms with
   external controls.},

Title = {What's the Value of Partisan Loyalty? Partisan Ambivalence, Motivated
   Reasoning, and Correct Voting in US Presidential Elections},

Abstract = {Partisans vary in the extent to which they rely on their partisan
   identities when voting. Are partisans who rely less on their partisan
   loyalties more likely to vote correctly than those who stick with their
   partisan intuitions? Research on motivated reasoning suggests so, but
   research focused on the heuristic value of partisanship implies
   otherwise. We examine this question using evidence from the ANES Time
   Series (1972-2004) and 2008 ANES Panel Survey. We find that ambivalent
   partisans, that is, those less reliant on partisanship when deciding,
   are generally less likely to vote correctly than univalent partisans,
   that is, those more reliant on partisanship. These results challenge
   some of the pessimism concerning the democratic competence of partisans
   as they imply that partisans engaging in directional reasoning can
   nevertheless perform their duties at the ballot box at least as well, if
   not better, than those engaged in more systematic and ``rational{''}
   modes of decision-making.},

Abstract = {As a product of China's planned economy, the state-run hukou system has
   dramatically influenced national and social management. However, hukou
   identity often results in social exclusion and alienation of outsiders.
   This study explores how hukou identity affects urban residents'
   perception of local government performance. The least-square method
   (OLS), ordered-logit regression, and propensity score matching method
   (PSM) are applied to test our hypothesis. We found that hukou identity
   has a significant impact on perceived performance of local government.
   Specifically, non-locals' perceived performance is lower than that of
   native locals, but there is no apparent distinction between new locals'
   perceived performance and native locals through hukou conversion.
   Furthermore, hukou identity's influence on perception of local
   government performance has individual heterogeneity. Here, the opinions
   of highly educated residents coincide due to hukou identity. Beginning
   with the unique heterogeneous social structure in urban China
   attributable to hukou system, this study provides a new way to
   understand residents' complicated political psychology in urban China.},

Abstract = {Armed conflict actors frequently target civilian populations. Thus, an
   improved understanding of such behaviour could pave the way to reducing
   it. We use the Civilian Targeting Index (CTI) and a broad array of
   geo-referenced data to investigate the spatio-temporal and economic
   dynamics of civilian targeting by conflict actors in Africa. Two main
   insights are generated. First, the civilian targeting behaviour of
   African non-state conflict actors is strongly influenced by the
   behaviour of other proximate actors. In particular, non-state actors
   tend to increase their civilian targeting after nearby non-state actors
   have done so. Possible mechanisms to explain such spatial spillovers
   include emulation and retaliation. Second, a negative relationship
   between economic activity and civilian targeting exists and applies to
   both state and non-state actors. In addition, CTIs of non-state actors
   tend to increase with population density, the geographical spread of
   their conflict activity and conflict duration. State actors have higher
   average CTIs than non-state actors do, but the gap between the two actor
   types tends to close during long-duration conflicts.},

   Organizations Taking the IRS 501(h) Election},

Abstract = {While public policy scholars are gaining a better understanding of the
   nonprofit sector's impact on the policy process, the sector's role in
   lobbying efforts has only been studied in a limited manner. Currently,
   nonprofit organizations' lobbying activities and expenditures are
   limited by federal regulations, which are often misunderstood by
   nonprofit leaders. This article uses 2003 IRS Form 990 data for all
   nonprofit organizations in the United States to examine the
   organizational determinants of 501(c)3 nonprofits taking the Internal
   Revenue Service's 501(h) election and whether organizations use
   h-election in a manner consistent with patterns of strategic behavior.
   Results show that nonprofit organizations that are reliant on direct
   public support are more likely to take the h-election, while those
   reliant on government grants are less likely to take the h-election.
   Examining lobbying expenditures, we find nonprofits associate with
   501(h) election in a pattern consistent with strategic behavior. The
   findings suggest that nonprofit organizations with certain revenue
   streams and in specific subsectors respond differently to this election
   decision, and that organizations may respond strategically to mechanisms
   regulating their political activity.},

Title = {Implicit-explicit power motives congruence and forgiveness in the
   workplace conflict: the mediating role of empathy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Purpose - In the workplace, forgiveness can increase positive
   interactions between the victim and offender in the aftermath of a
   conflict. As an important intrapersonal factor in an organization, a
   victim's power motives may shape one's forgiveness. However, previous
   research shows inconsistent results because it only considers explicit
   power motives while ignoring the possible contingent role of implicit
   power motives in influencing forgiveness. This paper aims to consider
   both implicit and explicit power motives and aims to examine their joint
   effect on interpersonal forgiveness in the workplace conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - Polynomial regressions with response
   surface analysis were conducted with 415 Amazon Mechanical Turk users.
   Implicit power motives were measured by using a modified picture story
   exercise technique, whereas explicit power motives were measured via
   self-response scales.
   Findings - First, congruence in power motives was associated with higher
   empathy and forgiveness than incongruence. In addition,
   high-implicit/high explicit power motives led to higher level of empathy
   and forgiveness than low-implicit/low-explicit power motives.
   Furthermore, directional power motive incongruence had an additive
   effect on forgiveness, such that discrepantly low-implicit/high-explicit
   power motives were more detrimental to empathy and forgiveness than
   discrepantly high-implicit/low-explicit power motives. Finally, empathy
   underlies the combined effect of implicit and explicit power motives on
   forgiveness.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that in a workplace
   conflict, managers should consider an employee's explicit and implicit
   motives. To build the harmony group work climate, managers can improve
   intrapersonal implicit-explicit power motive congruence by providing
   developmental support and training focusing on self-enhancement and
   self-affirmation with the low-explicit-powerful employees. Further, to
   promote forgiveness in a conflict, organizations can use empathy-based
   exercise and provide team building activities to increase employees'
   empathy and perspective-taking toward others.
   Originality/value - By integrating implicit-explicit framework, this
   paper conciliates previous studies investigating the relationship
   between power and forgiveness by proposing that the two types of power
   motives, implicit and explicit power motives, jointly influences a
   victim's forgiving tendency. This study serves as a meaningful
   touchstone for future research to consider both implicit and explicit
   power motives into the organizational conflict framework.},

Abstract = {The institutions and instruments of the Global Financial Safety Net
   (GFSN) represent the part of the global financial architecture that is
   responsible for providing an anti-crisis and stabilization support to
   the countries in need. We argue that the standard understanding of the
   GFSN as a system consisting of four layers - national reserves,
   bilateral swaps, regional financing arrangements and the IMF - demands
   rethinking. We suggest the concept of an enlarged GFSN, namely its
   expansion by two additional elements - multilateral development banks
   and bilateral financial support. Both elements of the international
   financial architecture are partly involved in providing an anti-crisis
   and macroeconomic stabilization support at concessional terms. We
   demonstrate how the enlarged GFSN functions, including at the time of
   the COVID-19 crisis.},

Abstract = {In the 2020 General Election, the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand
   appeared ideally positioned to capitalise on its association with the
   Labour-NZ First coalition, led by Jacinda Ardern. Leading up to the
   election campaign, the Green Party presented itself as a progressive
   partner for the dominant Labour Party against weak opposition from the
   National Party. During the campaign, polls suggested that there was a
   risk the party would not pass the threshold for representation in
   Parliament, leading to the vigorous targeting of the Auckland City
   electorate seat. The strategy was successful, as the Green Party
   slightly increased its representation and won the electorate seat.
   Securing an agreement with the Labour Party could ensure continued
   policy influence but does raise concerns about the potential for
   fragmentation, in view of the party's non-conformist roots and the
   urgency of the environmental challenges ahead.},

Abstract = {The Socio-Technical Imaginaries (STI) approach in Science and Technology
   Studies (STS) has illuminated the central role of social imaginaries in
   shaping the politics of technology. Its emphasis on the multilinear
   forms of socio-technical development is a useful corrective to
   universalist explanations of technological change. However, STI lacks a
   clear account of how inter-societal interaction shapes the imaginaries
   of any given political community. Synthesizing STI with the theory of
   Uneven and Combined Development (UCD) can correct this shortcoming. UCD
   offers an ontology of universals and accompanying methodology of
   incorporated comparison, enabling STI to integrate inter-societal
   causality into its theoretical framework. A combined UCD and STI
   framework is examined in this paper through a focus on imaginaries of
   technological innovation in contemporary American foreign policy.
   Responding to the `whip of external necessity', US foreign policy seeks
   to upend technological diffusion and impose global regulatory evenness
   on national forms of technological innovation.},

Abstract = {The multiple streams framework (MSF) hypothesizes changes in problem
   indicators or data documenting the scale and scope a problem help draw
   policymaker attention to previously ignored issues. We test this
   hypothesis by systematically analyzing agenda setting and agenda denial
   in the United States Congress in response to indicators of the opioid
   crisis, namely opioid overdose deaths. We confirm that changes in
   indicators can, in some cases, help facilitate agenda setting and policy
   change. However, we also show indicator politicization, which refers to
   the extent to which changes in a particular indicator threaten the
   economic and political interests of groups operating in the political
   stream, is inversely related to issue attention. We, therefore, suggest
   refining existing MSF hypotheses to allow for a more nuanced
   understanding of the relationship between indicators and agenda setting.},

Title = {`Catalytic nuclear war' in the age of artificial intelligence \&
   autonomy: Emerging military technology and escalation risk between
   nuclear-armed states},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JAN 15},
Abstract = {This article revisits the Cold War-era concept of `catalytic nuclear
   war,' considered by many as unworkable, and reconceptualizes it in light
   of technological change, as well as improved understanding of human
   psychology and other factors. It argues in the modern digital era, the
   catalyzing chain of reaction and counter-retaliation dynamics set in
   motion by the deliberate action of a non-state or third-party actor is
   fast becoming a more accessible and plausible alternative to acquiring a
   nuclear weapon or manufacturing an improvised atomic device - or `dirty
   bomb.' The article concludes that artificial intelligence (AI)
   technology is creating new - and exacerbating old - escalation pathways
   that risk catalyzing accidental nuclear confrontation between
   nuclear-armed powers, particularly under irrational (or sub-rational)
   conditions. Are existing notions of accidental and inadvertent nuclear
   escalation still relevant in the age of AI and autonomy?},

Pages = {1196-1216},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The expansion of renewables is still dependent on appropriate policy
   support. Nonetheless, in the wake of the economic crisis, even pioneer
   European countries have begun to dismantle the set of measures
   implemented in the past decades. Policy dismantling in the area of
   renewable energy is a recent phenomenon that has attracted little
   attention in comparison to the study of the diffusion of support
   schemes. By focusing on the dismantling of renewable energy policy in
   Italy, this contribution helps fill this gap and highlights an important
   aspect of the current politics of energy transition. It shows how
   interactions between the political economy of the renewable energy
   sector, policy design, institutional constraints and external events
   affect policy dismantling. It also demonstrates the role of
   self-undermining mechanisms and framing effects in the dismantling of
   renewable energy policy.},

Title = {Defeating Fake News: On Journalism, Knowledge, and Democracy},
Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {5-26},
Abstract = {The central thesis of this paper is that fake news and related phenomena
   serve as defeaters for knowledge transmission via journalistic channels.
   This explains how they pose a threat to democracy; and it points the way
   to determining how to address this threat. Democracy is both
   intrinsically and instrumentally good provided the electorate has
   knowledge (however partial and distributed) of the common good and the
   means of achieving it. Since journalism provides such knowledge, those
   who value democracy have a reason to protect it. Hostile agents,
   however, can undermine both the effectiveness of democratic
   decision-making and faith in democracy itself, by deliberately
   promulgating fake news and hyper-partisan views; moreover, these effects
   can come about unintentionally on social media. I conclude that we may
   need to change, not just the way we process information online, but also
   the informational environment in which we operate.},

   from 2017 onwards by analyzing Unasur's disintegration and the emergence

   well as the regional and global conditions that enabled them. We
   assessed their performance in responding to different crises in South
   America, concluding that the constraints and challenges they faced
   jeopardize their aim to prosper in the future. Special attention is
   given to changes in Brazilian foreign policy guidelines toward South
   America, which contributed to these outcomes.},

Abstract = {The problem of discrimination and unequal treatment of women from
   culturally diverse backgrounds affects countries such as the
   Netherlands. The centuries of tolerance and openness to an ``alien{''}
   seem to be ending. This is evidenced by numerous reports and scientific
   studies, statements from specialists, and experts on the issues of
   immigrant integration. Increasingly, feeling marginalised and deprived
   of development opportunities, immigrant or refugee women come to the
   fore. Some of them (those remaining in isolation) are represented by aid
   organisations, i.e. foundations, associations, volunteer groups, and the
   municipalities themselves. This article covers the existing issue of the
   increasing number of refugees and immigrants in the Netherlands,
   especially refugee and immigrant women towards whom, according to
   specialists, integration policy should be redefined.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-110},

Abstract = {How does algorithmic finance operate in society as it crosses the
   threshold into the hands of lay investors? This article builds on
   original ethnographic research into a new class of algorithmic trading
   programs known as `roboadvisors'-inexpensive, automated, digital
   financial platforms that enable ordinary people to invest very small
   minimum amounts and that rely to a large extent on passive, index
   strategies that follow the prescripts of Modern Portfolio Theory. The
   main argument of the article is that roboadvisors, representing an ethos
   of `low-finance', are actively constructing passive investors by
   disciplining them through technologies that embody canonical models of
   financial economics. Roboadvisors and their algorithms reconfigure their
   users and objectify them through automating investment decisions and
   enforcing a principle of `don't do' vis-a-vis the market. Implications
   that bear on agency, market structure and regulatory regimes are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the motivations of street-level
   bureaucrats when implementing change initiated by elected politicians.
   We analyse experimental data on more than 1,800 local civil servants
   from all 243 local governments in South Korea and find that street-level
   bureaucrats are more likely to implement change instigated by local
   elected politicians when their own policy positions are reflected in the
   reforms. Moreover, the degree to which street-level bureaucrats are
   likely to execute reforms instigated by local politicians is greater
   when bureaucrats perceive themselves as having more freedom to exercise
   discretion. These findings reveal a behavioural insight into the
   conditions in which bureaucrats are more likely to respond to change
   championed by elected politicians versus conditions where they are more
   likely to follow existing rules in the policy implementation process.},

Abstract = {The `hostile environment' agenda of Government has effectively endorsed
   the deliberate exploitation of irregular migrants in the agricultural
   industry. This minor project of jurisprudence will provide two arguments
   in support of this hypothesis. Firstly, the vulnerabilities faced by
   irregular migrants are reinforced through the xenophobic narrative
   embodied within the law and the courts. The lack of priority afforded to
   modern slavery on the UK Policy Agenda has allowed a `grey labour
   market' (1) to develop. Irregular migrants face a `precarity paradox'
   and (2) they must avoid the carceral regime of immigration control by
   entering into unprotected and deliberately exploitative work. Secondly,
   a lacklustre attempt to remedy the corruption in the horticultural
   industry proves that the state is preoccupied, capitalising on irregular
   labour practice in the interests of state capital. Thus, the Government
   allows the commodification of workers within the supply chain to profit
   British businesses.},

Title = {What is Public about Public Leadership? Exploring Implicit Public
   Leadership Theories},

Abstract = {While scholarship on public leadership has recently gained momentum in
   public administration, it is unclear how researchers should account for
   the ``public{''} in public leadership. We shed new light on this issue
   by introducing the approach of Implicit Leadership Theories (ILTs) to
   the field of public administration. This socio-cognitive approach
   suggests that people's everyday, rather than scholarly, theories about
   the characteristics of leaders provide important explanations of how
   they respond to leadership situations. We investigate whether people
   hold Implicit Public Leadership Theories (IPLTs) and explore how these
   images of public leaders contrast with generic ILTs. We extract these
   taxonomies from data gathered in a survey experiment in Germany (N=
   1,072). Results show that IPLTs have overlaps with generic ILTs but are
   unique in terms of rule abidance and innovation-orientation. In
   contrast, charismatic aspects of leadership only figure in generic ILTs.
   The structure of ILTs, both generic and public, is surprisingly stable
   across the subsamples of public and non-public employees. We discuss how
   the findings may assist public management scholars in the development of
   explicit theories of public leadership and derive a research agenda
   based on a socio-cognitive approach.},

   Part two looks into defense policies in the region. The final part
   explains the growing diversity of security perspectives in Central
   Europe by referring to the balance of threat concept.},

Abstract = {Peace research has taken a local turn. Yet, conceptual ambiguities,
   risks of romanticization, and critiques of co-option of the ``local{''}
   point to the need to look for novel ways to think about the interactions
   of actors ranging from the global to the local level. Gearoid Millar
   proposes a trans-scalar approach to peace based on a ``consistency of
   purpose{''} and a ``parity of esteem{''} for actors across scales. This
   article analyzes the concept of trans-scalarity in the peace process in
   Ituri, a province in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo
   (DRC). Drawing on qualitative data from more than a year of research in
   the DRC, I argue that while a trans-scalar approach was taken to end
   violence, it was not applied to transitional justice initiatives. The
   result was a negative, rather than a positive peace. By showing the
   high, but still untapped, potential of trans-scalarity, the article
   makes three contributions. First, it advances the debate on the local
   turn by adding empirical insights on trans-scalarity and further
   developing the concept's theoretical foundations. Second, it provides
   novel empirical insights on the transitional justice process in the DRC.
   Third, it links scholarship on peacebuilding and transitional justice,
   which have often remained disconnected.},

Abstract = {Why do countries respond differently when they face the same pandemic?
   In this article, we comparatively investigate the effects of policy
   styles in shaping responses to the COVID-19 crisis in two European
   countries: Greece and Sweden. Extending the concept of policy styles to
   extraordinary policymaking, we argue that political trust and policy
   styles result in national responses that range from centralization to
   decentralization. The combination of policy styles and political trust
   inevitably raises questions about the role of experts in shaping
   responses to pandemics. We conclude with implications for theories of
   national policy styles, political trust and crisis management.},

Abstract = {How did North Korea's nuclear research community develop in the context
   of its science and technology policy, and how did this development
   reflect progress in North Korea's nuclear program? We conduct network
   analysis using a dataset of North Korean domestic scientific journal
   articles to assess the structure of the North Korea's nuclear research
   communities from the beginning of the country's nuclear program until
   its capability ``completion{''} in 2018. We find that the networks
   showed increasing internal density of research collaborations,
   suggesting North Korea was able to improve knowledge transfer, and
   consolidate its nuclear research community over time. Furthermore,
   different areas of nuclear-related research increased interconnectivity
   over time, particularly in the run-up to milestones in North Korea's
   nuclear development. We close with implications for engaging with North
   Korea on science and technology issues.},

Abstract = {Political endorsements are becoming common in African elections.
   Endorsements by chiefs in Ghana's 2016 presidential election re-ignited
   debates on chiefs' involvement in partisan politics. But, (how) did the
   outcome of the election reflect chiefly endorsements? This article
   examines the relationship between chiefly political endorsements and
   election outcome. Data is extracted from online archives of select media
   outlets and Ghana's Electoral Commission; the analysis is framed in the
   duality of the postcolonial (African) state. Findings show a complex
   relationship across levels. The article argues that chiefly political
   endorsement is unnecessary and undercuts royal agency in community and
   national development.},

Abstract = {Inequality is a major international development challenge. This is so
   from an ethical perspective and because greater inequality is perceived
   to be detrimental to key socioeconomic and political outcomes. Still,
   informed debate requires clear evidence. This article contributes by
   taking stock and providing an up-to-date overview of the current
   knowledge on the impact of income inequality, specifically on three
   important outcomes: (1) economic growth; (2) human development, with a
   focus on health and education as two of its dimensions; and (3)
   governance, with emphasis on democracy. With particular attention to
   work in economics, which is especially developed on these topics, this
   article reveals that the existing evidence is somewhat mixed and argues
   for further in-depth empirical work across disciplines. It also points
   to explanations for the lack of consensus embedded in data quality and
   availability, measurement issues, and shortcomings of the different
   methods employed. Finally, we suggest promising future research avenues
   relying on experimental work for microlevel analysis and reiterate the
   need for more region- and country-specific studies and improvements in
   the availability and reliability of data.},

Abstract = {Much research on disruptive innovations has focused on firms that
   disrupt existing industries. Yet, regulators and lawmakers are
   instrumental in containing or enabling market disruption, in ways that
   are less understood. This article examines taxi industries in New York
   City, Chicago and San Francisco between 2010 and 2014 to better
   understand the role of regulators and lawmakers in enabling Uber to
   disrupt these industries. Relying on 142 interviews, ethnographic
   observations and primary source documents, I show that regulators and
   lawmakers used two strategies in responding to Uber: blocking and
   incorporating. Blocking refers to measures that stop a firm from
   entering the industry. Incorporating refers to adding, subtracting or
   modifying regulations to align with an innovative firm's practices. I
   identify three incorporating strategies: horizontal venue shifting,
   vertical venue shifting and reinterpreting existing regulations.
   Analyzing these strategies more clearly illuminates regulatory change
   mechanisms and lawmakers' and regulators' role in enabling disruptive
   innovations.},

Abstract = {Various feminist contributions to Terrorism Studies provide insight into
   how the media rationalizes terrorism-affiliated women through framing,
   but the question of how newspapers frame women returnees remains
   scarcely explored. Through a semantic content analysis of 63 German news
   articles, supplemented by interviews with journalists, this article
   reveals how German news media framing fosters a skeptical attitude
   toward women returnees. This effect is further reinforced when
   accompanied by a portrayal of individual returnees as irresponsible
   mothers. In contrast to the treatment of terrorism-affiliated women in
   general, the framing of women returnees does not seek to rationalize
   their violence, but instead provides moral guidance regarding security
   responses.},

Abstract = {Recent interventions in critical security studies have argued that the
   field has struggled to account for the racialised/racist foundations of
   security politics. This article engages with the US Black Panther Party
   (BPP), arguing that the Party did important work to show how security
   politics is dependent on racial violence. The idea that we can theorise
   global politics through struggle (`struggle as method') is becoming
   popular within disciplinary International Relations (IR), but has longer
   lineages in Black radical thought. The BPP were important advocates of
   struggle as method, with tactics and strategies intentionally designed
   with a pedagogical purpose; through Panther actions (including community
   self-defence and survival programmes), and the state's response to
   these, the mechanisms of capitalist white supremacy were laid bare. The
   article therefore acknowledges BPP action as a series of theoretical
   interventions, which demonstrated how the terms of US/white security are
   rooted in and dependent on anti-Blackness. It also shows how Panther
   tactics prefigured alternative, radical, anti-statist approaches to
   security, these conceptualised as `survival pending revolution'. The
   article closes by arguing that scholarship on critical security studies
   - especially as related to the racialised politics of security - should
   do more to work with and acknowledge its indebtedness to struggle as
   method.},

Abstract = {Ceasefires are often associated with inhibiting conflict ripeness
   because they remove the immediate costs of conflict and the pressure on
   conflicting parties to negotiate. Yet, in many intrastate conflicts,
   ceasefires have proven instrumental in reviving or enabling peace talks.
   This article provides an analytical framework to systematically assess
   the impact of ceasefires on conflict ripeness and identify key factors
   that condition their effects. Enriching ripeness theory with insights
   from the related bargaining theory of war and ceasefire research, this
   article identifies three key milestones in the transition from war to
   negotiated settlement-ripeness for negotiations, for concessions and for
   settlement-and the conditions that help conflicting parties reach these
   milestones. It demonstrates how and why ceasefires have the potential to
   foster ripeness at all three stages, whereas ceasefire violations
   threaten to undermine the ripening process, particularly after the onset
   of negotiations. The analysis suggests that temporal limits to
   ceasefires in the first two ripeness stages increase the probability
   that ceasefires contribute to ripening, while in the third stage, it is
   better that parties agree on an indefinite ceasefire or link it to the
   progress of negotiations in order to enable movement towards settlement.
   External enforcement of a ceasefire can pose a significant impediment to
   conflict ripeness.},

Abstract = {Many governments maintain lists of terrorist groups, imposing sanctions
   on designated organizations. However, the logic behind designation
   remains unclear. Furthermore, most studies focus on Western countries.
   This paper develops arguments for why attack attributes, group
   attributes, and policy diffusion might explain proscription.
   Empirically, we examine hundreds of militant organizations to see which
   are listed by the European Union, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United
   Kingdom, or the United States. Generally, designation does not seem to
   be driven by target or attack severity. It often results from diffusion:
   most countries follow the United States. Islamist group motivation is
   also an important factor.},

Abstract = {This article explores changes in the relationship between attitudinal
   and participatory dimensions of politics, and age in Southern European
   countries. We look at how attitudes towards the political system and
   institutions combine with engagement in politics to define the ways in
   which citizens relate to the political sphere and the impact of the
   economic crisis on this relationship, in particular among the young.
   Using all available rounds of the European Social Survey for Greece,
   Italy, Portugal and Spain between 2002 and 2019, this article develops a
   typology of citizens and analyses heterogeneities based on age, time and
   countries to find whether the relationship between citizens and politics
   has changed over time among the four states, in particular among young
   citizens.},

Abstract = {Gender is rarely considered in the works on state socialism in Czech
   history writing. Given the prominence of the equality of the sexes in
   communist rhetoric and the heated anti- and pro-feminism media and
   intellectual debates of the 1990s, the omission stands out as a
   remarkable loss of opportunity in historical research. It also defies
   logic. For if ``emancipation{''} and ``equality{''} were so strongly
   present in pre-1989 discourse and women constituted half the population,
   does it not follow that the plain demographic fact should drive the
   interest of researchers to inquire where this population was, what it
   did, and what it had to say? The question has so far attracted primarily
   sociologists, but how does it fare in historiography? What are the
   losses of the absence and the gains of the inclusion of a gender
   perspective on the history and memory-making of state socialism? This
   article will first consider the status quo of gender blindness in Czech
   historiography and its possible reasons in the context of the legacy
   that state socialism left to social sciences and humanities: the legacy
   of expertise, disciplinary legitimation and epistemological legacy. A
   discussion of the consequences of the near absence of gender history and
   analysis from post-1989 interpretations of state socialism in
   historiography follows: blind spots and loss of knowledge, lack of
   precision and a gender bias of historical accounts, and perpetuation of
   false legacy. Finally, the article discusses the gains to Czech
   historiography, memory-making and international discussion, if scholars
   do consider gender.},

Abstract = {How do military tactics shape civilian support for foreign intervention?
   Critics contend that invasive tactics undermine popular support by
   alienating the civilian population. Counterexamples suggest that
   civilians will support invasive tactics when foreign counterinsurgents
   are willing and able to mitigate a proximate threat. I reconcile these
   divergent findings by arguing that civilian support is a function of
   threat perception based on three interacting heuristics: social
   identity, combatant targeting, and territorial control. To evaluate my
   theory, I enumerate a survey among Iraqi residents in Baghdad during the
   anti-ISIS campaign. Respondents preferred more invasive tactics when
   foreign counterinsurgents assisted the most effective local members of
   the anti-ISIS coalition. Across sectarian divides, however, respondents
   uniformly opposed the deployment of foreign troops. These findings
   suggest that in regime-controlled communities, civilians will support
   counterinsurgents who are invasive enough to mitigate insurgent threats,
   but not too invasive as to undermine local autonomy.},

Abstract = {Randomly selected deliberative mini-publics (DMPs) are on the rise
   globally. However, they remain ad hoc, opening the door to arbitrary
   manoeuvre and triggering a debate on their future institutionalization.
   What are the competing proposals aiming at institutionalizing DMPs
   within political systems? I suggest three ways for thinking about
   institutionalization: in terms of temporality, of legitimacy and
   support, and of power and role within a system. First, I analyze the
   dimension of time and how this affect DMP institutional designs. Second,
   I argue that because sortition produces `weak representatives' with
   `humility-legitimacy', mini-publics hardly ever make binding decisions
   and need to rely on external sources of legitimacies. Third, I identify
   four institutional models, relying on opposing views of legitimacy and
   politics: tamed consultation, radical democracy, representative
   klerocracy and hybrid polyarchy. They differ in whether mini-publics are
   interpreted as tools: for legitimizing elected officials; to give power
   to the people; or as a mean to suppress voting .},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue against an all-too-easy `climate bad guy'
   thesis, which holds that in right-wing populism climate change denialism
   or at least skepticism is one-dimensional, i.e. right-wing populist
   parties generally reject climate change mitigation. To this end, we
   present a revision of the `populism as thin-centered ideology' approach
   and situate populist politics in the context of a process we refer to as
   devolution of democracy. We develop a heuristic list of distinct
   populist climate policy claims for empirical investigation and then
   apply a contextualist approach by examining differing right-wing
   populist party positions on climate change mitigation within a two-level
   framework that covers their positioning towards both the global climate
   agenda and domestic low-carbon policies. We substantiate our thesis that
   populist climate politics is retrograde as well as context-relative by
   drawing on empirical cases from Germany, Austria, and Poland.},

Abstract = {There is perennial debate in comparative politics about electoral
   institutions, but what characterizes this debate is the lack of
   consideration for citizens' perspective. In this paper, we report the
   results of an original survey conducted on representative samples in 15
   West European countries (N = 15,414). We implemented an original
   instrument to elicit respondents' views by asking them to rate ``real
   but blind{''} electoral outcomes. With this survey instrument, we aimed
   to elicit principled rather than partisan preferences regarding the kind
   of electoral outcomes that citizens think is good for democracy. We find
   that West Europeans do not clearly endorse a majoritarian or
   proportional vision of democracy. They tend to focus on aspects of the
   government rather than parliament when they pass a judgment. They want a
   majority government that has few parties and enjoys wide popular
   support. Finally, we find only small differences between citizens of
   different countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how populist parties in power contest the external
   democratization agenda within the European Union (EU)'s European
   Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). We present an analytical framework that
   conceptually unpacks both contestation and populism to argue that
   radical right, market liberal, regionalist and left-wing populist
   parties differ from each other concerning their views on external
   democratization. Our empirical focus is on the discursive strategies of
   Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from PiS, Fidesz, Lega, Forza
   Italia and Movimento Cinque Stelle in European Parliament (EP) debates.
   The exploratory analysis reveals that populist actors rarely and
   selectively use the European arena for contesting democracy promotion.
   While an emphasis on stability and security in the neighbourhood
   prevails among all populist parties in our study, other considerations,
   such as migration policy, support for ethnic kin, suspicion towards
   Russia but also membership in the EP's Party Groups inform the
   differences between the parties. Supplemental data for this article is
   available online at at},

Abstract = {This article examines how Eurosceptic parties in Serbia framed the issue
   of ``Europe{''} in their discourse during times of crisis. It identifies
   three main frames through which the EU has been problematised -
   socio-economic, political and cultural ones. While political framing
   dominated the discourse, distinct domestic circumstances had an
   important bearing on how each party criticised the Union. Serbia's
   turbulent relationship with Western-based organisations and its status
   as a post-conflict and fragmented state greatly affected the way
   Eurosceptic parties portrayed the EU. At the same time, EU crises had
   the minor impact on party narratives in the Serbian context, suggesting
   that Eurosceptic party narratives in EU member states do not necessarily
   resonate with Eurosceptic parties outside the Union.},

Abstract = {After the last major financial crisis, there was much discussion about
   the idea that the increase in income inequality during the expansionary
   phase could have forced middle- and low-income groups to increasingly
   resort to indebtedness to finance their consumption. This debt-led
   consumption would have stimulated economic growth, but would also
   explain why it was not sustainable since families would have become more
   financially fragile. This approach, which we refer to as the `income
   inequality and debt-financed consumption as a cause of financial
   fragility hypothesis', is based on empirical studies that mostly
   consider the US economy. In this article, we examine whether, as some of
   the literature suggests, this assumption is sufficient to explain the
   expansion and subsequent recession in the Spanish economy.},

Abstract = {The recent `emotion turn' in international theory is widely viewed as a
   cutting-edge development which pushes the field in fundamentally new
   directions. Challenging this narrative, this essay returns to the
   historical works of Walter Lippmann to show how thinking about emotions
   has been central to international theory for far longer than currently
   appreciated. Deeply troubled by his experience with propaganda during
   the First World War, Lippmann spent the next several decades thinking
   about the relationship between emotion, mass politics, and the
   challenges of foreign policy in the modern world. The result was a
   sophisticated account of the role of emotional stereotypes and symbols
   in mobilizing democratic publics to international action. I argue that a
   return to Lippmann's ideas offers two advantages. First, it shows his
   thinking on emotion and mass politics formed an important influence for
   key disciplinary figures like Angell, Morgenthau, Niebuhr, and Waltz.
   Second, it shows why the relationship between emotion and democracy
   should be understood as a vital concern for international theory.
   Vacillating between scepticism and hope, Lippmann's view of democracy
   highlights a series of challenges in modern mass politics -
   disinformation, the unintended consequences of emotional symbols, and
   responsibility for the public's emotional excesses - which bear directly
   on democracies' ability to engage the world.},

   Drawing on my experience as a framework, the article provides a brief
   description of both the organisations and explicate the transitions. In
   the latter half of the article, I dwell upon the implications of this on
   organising and proceed to draw upon work of Black scholars and activists
   to argue for the breakdown of the contested binary of the personal and
   the political for an organising ethic based on solidarity.},

   Within Authoritarian Regimes?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This article tries to conceptually lay down the troubled relations
   between civil society and social movements within authoritarian regimes.
   This is done by, first, bringing clarity to the conceptual relationship
   between civil society and social movement and, then, applying it to the
   authoritarian context, still theoretically. Following the ``hints{''} of
   the Eastern European intellectuals of the late 1970s and the 1980s and
   building on the appropriation of Durkheim's differentiation between
   mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity, the article distinguishes
   two types of solidarity: associative solidarity and action and
   collective solidarity and action. Civil society is proposed to emerge on
   associative solidarities (and their actions), while social movements
   build on collective solidarities (and their actions). Furthermore,
   associative and collective actions are identified to be progressive and
   transgressive, respectively. Consequently, the proposed theoretical
   account is applied theoretically to the authoritarian context and
   several hypotheses are proposed on the relationship between civil
   society and pro-democracy movement within authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {Why did the German government champion a debt-financed and grants-based
   EU corona recovery plan, despite the country's traditional aversion
   towards greater fiscal risk-sharing in Europe? To elucidate this
   question, this article critically assesses different explanatory factors
   cited in the academic literature and public debate to determine a
   country's response to pressing challenges. Tracing Germany's approach to
   the corona pandemic within the EU context, it finds that national
   material interests rather than (new) economic ideas or party politics
   were decisive. The timing, scope, as well as the limits of the
   German-inspired recovery plan for the fight against the corona crisis
   suggests at least as much continuity as change in Germany's position on
   EU fiscal policy. Yet, the findings also highlight Germany's enduring,
   and in fact reinforced, commitment to European integration and its
   preparedness to provide stability in moments of deep crisis for the EU.},

Title = {The Effects of Naming and Shaming on Public Support for Compliance with
   International Agreements: An Experimental Analysis of the Paris
   Agreement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {445-468},
Abstract = {How does naming and shaming affect public support for compliance with
   international agreements? We investigated this question by conducting
   survey experiments about the Paris Agreement, which relies on social
   pressure for enforcement. Our experiments, administered to national
   samples in the United States, produced three sets of findings. First,
   shaming by foreign countries shifted domestic public opinion in favor of
   compliance, increasing the political incentive to honor the Paris
   Agreement. Second, the effects of shaming varied with the behavior of
   the target. Shaming was more effective against partial compliers than
   against targets that took no action or honored their obligations
   completely. Moreover, even partial compliers managed to reduce the
   effects of shaming through the strategic use of counter-rhetoric. Third,
   identity moderated responses to shaming. Shaming by allies was not
   significantly more effective than shaming by non-allies, but Democrats
   were more receptive to shaming than Republicans. Overall, our
   experiments expose both the power and the limits of shaming as a
   strategy for enforcing the Paris Agreement. At the same time, they
   advance our understanding of the most significant environmental problem
   facing the planet.},

Abstract = {It is often assumed that we are currently living in an `age of apology',
   whereby countries increasingly seek to redress human rights violations
   by offering apologies. Although much has been written about why this may
   occur, the phenomenon itself has never been examined through a
   large-scale review of the apologies that have been offered. To fill this
   gap, we created a database of political apologies that have been offered
   for human rights violations across the world. We found 329 political
   apologies offered by 74 countries, and cross-nationally mapped and
   compared these apologies. Our data reveal that apologies have
   increasingly been offered since the end of the Cold War, and that this
   trend has accelerated in the last 20 years. They have been offered
   across the globe, be it that they seem to have been embraced by
   consolidated liberal democracies and by countries transitioning to
   liberal democracies in particular. Most apologies have been offered for
   human rights violations that were related to or took place in the
   context of a (civil) war, but there appears to be some selectivity as to
   the specific human rights violations that countries actually mention in
   the apologies. On average, it takes more than a generation before
   political apologies are offered.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes historical monuments as instruments of Russia's
   attempts to impose its aesthetic hegemony in the post-Communist world.
   Drawing on case studies from the Czech Republic and Estonia, it argues
   that this hegemony is precarious and vulnerable due to inability to deal
   with the inherent ambiguity and complexity of historical events and
   figures. The Russian approach regards historical truth in absolute terms
   and is underpinned by a zero-sum game understanding of historical
   narratives. It does not tolerate a multiplicity of perspectives on
   history and has no appreciation for postmodernist deconstruction of
   historical symbols. This conflicts with a more diverse, reflexive and
   inclusive politics of memory as an intrinsic element of cityscapes of
   Prague and Tallinn where some of the controversial monuments connected
   with the Soviet occupation have been removed. Russia's reaction to these
   changes reveals an inherently vulnerable nature of its aesthetic
   hegemony which is deeply dependent on recognition of the absolute nature
   of its historical truth that the monuments are supposed to embody.},

Abstract = {Preventing violence against women (VAW) is a prerequisite for
   sustainable development in the international arena and many actors
   around the world have tried to eliminate it. This study aims to
   elucidate the strategies that were successful and the circumstances in
   place when Law 4320 was adopted in Turkey, a law designed to prevent
   VAW, with the aim of providing broader lessons for developing successful
   policy-making strategies elsewhere. The 1980s were arguably a watershed
   moment in Turkey, when a few eminent women, who were at the forefront of
   the struggle, and came from diverse ideological backgrounds and
   different bodies, united for the purpose of combatting VAW. In-depth
   interviews were conducted with ten leading feminists who worked together
   and used creative and adaptive strategies to achieve progressive goals.
   The case study shows that the building of communication networks among
   feminists, and the lobbying of political bodies, were significant
   milestones in the history of policy making. However, the most difficult
   stages of the policy process were the implementation and evaluation
   stages.},

Abstract = {While information campaigns have been widely recognized as a pillar of
   public health crisis management and heightened by the current COVID-19
   pandemic, an insufficient number of studies have investigated the impact
   of information disclosure on influencing citizen cooperation crucial for
   emergency management. Focusing on generic information disclosure
   practices during the recovery period from January 19, 2020, to February
   29, 2020, in China and by employing a difference-in-difference method,
   this study finds that information disclosure significantly enhanced
   citizen coproduction as measured by aggregated search queries of
   COVID-19-related information, and earlier disclosure yielded greater
   effect more quickly. Moreover, government capacity and citizens' trust
   in government at the local level significantly moderate the positive
   impact of information disclosure. This study uncovers the novel
   relationship between information disclosure and citizen coproduction
   during emergencies in the Chinese context.},

Title = {Building Africa's Homegrown Humanitarian Systems: Restoration as an
   Alternative to Localization},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Many humanitarian actors now recognize that it is crucial to build
   response structures on the basis of the norms, knowledge, and
   institutions of those affected by disasters. Currently, this concept has
   been captured through the term localization. However, the use of
   localization both as a term and process has so far been done without
   critical reflection on the traditional meaning of the term, and the
   impact of its historical application. It has also come about without
   proper historicization of the broader localization process and how this
   related to historical antecedents. This paper problematizes localization
   as a troubled term that describes a concept that has been applied in the
   past to help erode the homegrown humanitarian initiatives that Africans
   started. It draws attention to how international humanitarian actors
   established themselves in Africa as a process of localization which
   eventually contributed to the erosion of the homegrown initiatives that
   they interacted with. Given its historically erosive effects on
   homegrown initiatives, localization, the paper argues, is a troubled
   term that cannot be redeemed or repurposed for the current attempt to
   build humanitarian action on homegrown structures. A more reflective and
   appropriate term is restoration, which not only recognises this history
   of erosion, but repairs historical mistakes, and ensures that homegrown
   structures are built in a sustainable manner that avoids a repeat of
   those mistakes. Restoration in practice should be based on
   self-determination, and will depend on the leadership of African states,
   their ability to create a conducive environment for homegrown NGOs to
   thrive, and the successful synergies they build with other restoration
   processes across the continent. International actors will have to
   intentionally reconcile themselves with their erosion footprints,
   exercise restraint, and scale back their involvement so that local
   actors can gain the space to evolve. The paper concludes that all this
   starts with the ability of those leading the process to build homegrown
   structures to imagine an alternative humanitarian future.},

Abstract = {New means and methods of war such as remote warfare by drones-the focus
   of this special issue-challenge international law, as there no longer
   exists agreement between states regarding the rules regulating the use
   of force. The existing legal norms are interpreted in widely diverging
   manners and seemingly put aside if not in the interest of the state in
   question. Yet, this article argues that, taking a closer look at the
   state practice of drone strikes beyond the paradigmatic case of the USA,
   the demise of international legal norms regulating the use of force
   seems overstated. Instead, the analysis reveals that the international
   laws addressing the use of force and means and methods of warfare are
   not as dead as the general discourse asserts, and can still serve to
   regulate state action.},

Abstract = {Governing cybersecurity risks from digital trade is a growing
   responsibility for governments and corporations. This study develops a
   systematic framework to delineate and analyze the strategies that
   governments and corporations take to address cybersecurity risks from
   digital trade. It maps out the current landscape based on a collection
   of 75 cases where governments and corporations interact to govern
   transnational cybersecurity risks. This study reveals that: first,
   governing cybersecurity risks from digital trade is a global issue
   whereby most governments implement policies with concerning that the
   cybersecurity risks embedded within purchasing transnational digital
   products can influence their domestic political and societal systems.
   Second, governments dominates the governance interactions by
   implementing trade policies whereas corporations simply comply.
   Corporations do, however, have chances to take more active roles in
   constructing the governance system. Third, supply chain cybersecurity
   risks have more significant impacts on governance mode between
   governments and corporations whereas concerns on different national
   cybersecurity risks do not. Fourth, the interactions between governments
   and corporations reveal the exisitence of loops that can amplify or
   reduce cybersecurity risks. This provides policy implications on
   transnational cybersecurity governance for policy makers and business
   leaders to consider their potential options and understand the global
   digital trade environment when cybersecurity and digital trade overlap.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to recent scholarship on the effects of
   economic hardship on political participation, and particularly on the
   issue of how individual and contextual effects interact. More
   specifically, we study whether the effect of individual unemployment on
   turnout depends on the level of aggregate unemployment. In contrast to
   most existing researchers on this topic, we argue that contextual
   unemployment may reinforce the negative effects of individual
   unemployment. We also contend that previous studies have not adequately
   considered how the composition of the unemployed population differs
   across times of high and low unemployment. Our empirical approach uses
   state-of-the-art Swedish register panel data, which gives us good
   opportunities to control for the selection of the unemployed population
   over the business cycle. We find that once this problem of dynamic
   selection is taken into account, the negative effect of individual
   unemployment on electoral turnout is actually stronger in high
   unemployment contexts.},

Abstract = {This article considers how nation states steer transnational forums by
   examining how the Australian government has `metagoverned' the Bali
   Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related
   Transnational Crime, a multilateral forum with 50 plus members (nation
   states and international agencies) that was created in 2002 to promote
   policy dialogue, information sharing and practical cooperation on
   irregular migration in the Asia Pacific region. A `tools-based approach'
   is used to analyse the Australian government's metagovernance of this
   forum across four dimensions: nodality; authority; treasure;
   organisation. The overall finding is that Australia has accumulated
   steering capacity across each of these dimensions and that a
   `tools-based approach' to metagovernance offers a promising way of
   understanding differences in steering capacity within transnational
   forums.},

Title = {Performative Control and Rhetoric in Aotearoa New Zealand's Response to
   COVID-19},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {This article analyses how specific nodal points of performative control
   developed and consequently structured the discourse on Aotearoa New
   Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies these points
   by adopting a rhetorical-performative approach to uncover three
   particular performances of control that articulated the pandemic in
   Aotearoa New Zealand, from the diagnosis of the first COVID-19 case in
   the country in February 2020 through to October 2020. This period of
   analysis covers the emergence, subsequent nationwide lockdown,
   elimination, and re-emergence of the virus. There are three distinct
   nodal points that unfold as key to the nation's ability to control
   COVID-19: the hegemonic ``us{''}; iwi regionalism; and the rhetoric of
   kindness. A mixed approach of content analysis of government data,
   Facebook data, and key imagery is employed to constitute these nodal
   points' relevance and how they structured the performative control that
   threaded through the nation's initial response as a whole. The article
   demonstrates how Aotearoa New Zealand, considered by popular assessment
   to have been successful in its response to COVID-19, managed to
   eliminate the virus twice in 2020, but not without aspects of the
   antagonisms that have beset other nations. These include the
   exacerbation of internal dichotomies and questions about the legality of
   Government mandates. As the country's response to COVID-19 is traced,
   the employment of a rhetorical-performative framework to identify the
   key nodal points also highlights how the framework could be applied to
   Aotearoa New Zealand's continuing response as the pandemic endures.},

Abstract = {We compare flexible low-carbon regulations in the transportation sector
   and their interaction and sequencing with greenhouse gas emissions
   trading systems in California and Quebec. As momentum builds for greater
   climate action, it is necessary to better understand how carbon markets
   and other low-carbon transportation policies influence one another.
   First, we demonstrate that emissions trading between California and
   Quebec has been asymmetric, with linking having little influence on
   carbon prices from California's perspective but leading to a
   considerable cost reduction from the point of view of Quebec. Second, we
   present evidence that Quebec has replicated many of California's
   low-carbon transportation policies that promote increased electric
   vehicle use, where Quebec has an advantage, while deferring to the
   Canadian federal government with regard to policies that incentivize the
   production of other low-carbon transportation fuels. Third, we
   demonstrate that while the stringency of the policy mix of carbon
   pricing and flexible transportation regulations has increased over time
   in both jurisdictions, the stringency of flexible regulations has been
   more aggressively ratcheted up and is expected to continue to dominate.
   Overall, our findings suggest that the policy sequence observed in
   California and Quebec can be attributed to the political economy
   benefits that the selected instruments confer to governments seeking to
   move from the middle towards the bottom of the clean technology
   experience curve. We discuss a number of important research questions
   and associated hypotheses emanating from our findings, which provide the
   basis for more in-depth studies involving a larger universe of cases and
   economic sectors.},

Abstract = {The distinction between equality and sufficiency, much discussed in the
   distributive justice literature, is here applied to democratic theory.
   Overlooking this distinction can have significant normative
   implications, undermining some defences and criticisms of political
   equality, as I show by discussing the work of three prominent democratic
   theorists: Thomas Christiano, David Estlund, and Mark Warren. Most
   importantly, Christiano sometimes defends egalitarian conclusions using
   sufficientarian premises, or worries about inequality in situations
   where insufficiency is also part of the problem; inequality above the
   level of sufficiency is not always as troubling. Estlund makes the
   reverse error. He attacks rather than defends political egalitarianism,
   but insufficiency seems to explain some of his concerns. Nonetheless, I
   show that political egalitarians may need to specify a sufficientarian
   threshold, to avoid levelling-down objections. Democratic theorists
   should thus take seriously the distinction between political equality
   and political sufficiency. More generally, political theorists and
   philosophers should be aware of omitted variable bias and interaction
   effects due to conceptual stretching arising from under-theorised
   distinctions in their thought experiments.},

Abstract = {We argue that overseas economic interests and traditional non-economic
   aspects such as political sovereignty and territorial integrity
   constitute important parts of a country's integrative national security
   set. To enable a better understanding of the overseas economic dimension
   of a country's foreign policy rationale, we develop an analytic
   framework inspired by the Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis
   approach (Multi-MOORA), which quantifies a country's overseas economic
   interests adjusted by country-specific risk factors. Using China as an
   example, aided by a dataset covering 172 countries with economic ties
   with China spanning a period from 2013 to 2017, we show that its foreign
   policy focus in developing countries since the Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) motivated by geopolitical and ideological considerations as well
   as significant economic interest. Protection of these overseas economic
   interests is imperative to establish an advantage over Western firms
   which presently avoid many of the countries in question.},

Abstract = {Islamist radicalization and terrorism studies, besides lacking in
   methodological transparency, have long suffered from immense access
   problems. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Sweden and Denmark-two
   countries with significant populations of Salafi-jihadist Western
   foreign fighter returnees-this article focuses on challenges to gaining
   initial access to a field described as emotionally demanding,
   hard-to-reach and high-risk. Addressing emotional trials that emerge
   when experiencing risks of physical dangers, emotional stressors and
   ethical issues, we demonstrate how emotions shape and influence
   decisions made in the field, such as whether to continue or to give up
   attempting to gain initial access. Thus, we provide the transparency
   that is so crucial to unraveling and understanding the methodological
   obstacles to accessing Salafi-jihadist environments.},

Abstract = {Procurement has received scholarly attention as a valuable policy tool
   to reach desired outcomes in society, such as innovation. While interest
   has grown in analyzing the impact of the `substantive' function of
   procurement (purchasing of goods and services), procurement is much more
   than purchases, and most public buyers' activities are `procedural', as
   they are aimed at improving the many internal stages of the procurement
   process. This study explains how procurement can be both a substantive
   and procedural tool, particularly in terms of innovation. Using the 2010
   Innobarometer dataset that consist of 4,063 public organizations from 29
   European countries, this study answers how public procurement, as a
   procedural policy tool, affects the implementation of public sector
   innovations. We find that procurement activities are positively related
   to innovation within public organizations. In particular, procurement as
   R\&D for new technologies and services has an important and meaningful
   effect. We discuss implications for policy tools and public sector
   innovation literature, and we suggest that policy makers make use of
   more procedural tools such as procurement to increase innovation within
   public organizations.},

Abstract = {The article aims to investigate the applicability of the `failing
   forward' framework to the case of the European Neighbourhood Policy
   (ENP). The `failing forward' framework explains how the liberal
   intergovernmentalist and neo-functionalist developments shape policy
   dynamics in the ENP. It is, however, proven to be challenging to
   determine the initial policy incompleteness and, due to the influence of
   exogenous factors, also explain the origins of the Ukraine crisis using
   the framework. Although the `failing forward' framework responds to the
   intellectual demand for stronger exchange between the theories of EU
   integration and the EU Foreign Policy Studies, it is not able to fully
   explain complex crises at the `high politics' level.},

Abstract = {Bureaucratic reputations are largely shaped by the media's evaluations
   of such agencies. However, the research overlooks how the media
   evaluates public agencies, particularly in low-trust contexts. Using
   inductive machine-learning techniques, we uncover the media's
   evaluations of Brazilian regulatory agencies based on more than 38,000
   stories published within the last 20 years with the aim of exploring
   what drives their media evaluations and which reputational dimensions
   are privileged in the negative media coverage of regulatory agencies. We
   find different patterns of media evaluations that reflect a unique
   interplay of media logic, agency strategizing, and the quality of the
   policy context in which the agencies operate. However, even in a
   low-trust context, some agencies are able to build a favorable media
   reputation. In contrast, agencies with unfavorable media reputations are
   systematically questioned along many reputational dimensions and are
   subject to stronger negativity bias.},

Abstract = {Recent investigations into the phenomenon of state capture in South
   Africa have identified procurement as a central mechanism of rent
   generation for key actors. This article examines some of the ways in
   which anti-corruption measures failed, and argues that it will not be
   resolved by implementing more robust policies. Policies already conform
   to world-class standards, yet the way in which procurement is practised
   should be addressed more urgently. Practices that are reminiscent of
   apartheid-era levels of compliance have made it a function that
   prioritises `following orders' above policy compliance, which undermines
   procurement's ability to contribute to organisational effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The Constitution's division of powers from which E. Corwin famously
   asserted an ``invitation to struggle{''} in the making of US foreign
   policy (1957, 171) has become overshadowed by partisan conflict in the
   contemporary era. Although much of the extant literature points to
   Congress's subsidiary role in foreign policy relative to the
   presidency-centered model, the appeal of partisanship has worked to
   further deepen congressional abrogation and extend presidential
   unilateralism (Lindsay in Congress and the politics of U.S. Foreign
   Policy. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1994; Kriner in
   After the rubicon: congress, presidents, and the politics of waging war.
   University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2010; Potter in Pres Stud Quart
   46(4):849-867, 2016). Our analysis illustrates a puzzle. On one hand,
   there are growing levels of majority support in the USA for political
   leadership on the world stage. But on the other hand, our analysis of
   congressional behavior such as voting, lawmaking, and oversight shows
   relatively clear patterns of congressional decline-Congress no longer
   exercises much of its power in foreign affairs, neither in form or
   substance. Partisan incentives for congressional abdication to the
   presidency carry at least one additional risk we point to: Congressional
   capitulation from its constitutional duty places democracy in the
   jeopardy that the Framers' design was intended to prevent.},

   difference-in-differences estimation using cross-national panel data of
   over 100 countries from 1995 to 2015 shows that democracy reduces
   poverty, although the size of the effect varies by the poverty line
   chosen. The results also show that the effects are channeled by
   entitling more political rights, increasing freedom of speech and the
   size of middle classes, and improving governmental quality, and are
   heterogeneous over time and democratization types.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the preferences of food delivery platform
   workers regarding their employment status and working hours. We focus on
   the relationship between flexibility and protection, both of which can
   be understood-from a worker's perspective-as a means towards increased
   autonomy and control. The analysis is based on a case study of Deliveroo
   in Belgium, which hired riders as employees through an intermediary,
   SMart. Despite their flexible working lives, most riders preferred
   employee status to self-employment. However, riders were divided in
   their preferences regarding working time flexibility, with many in
   favour of more regular working time patterns. To explain this
   divergence, we develop an embeddedness framework that relates worker
   preferences to the degree of their dependency as shaped by labour market
   and institutional factors. We thus link divergence in preferences
   concerning flexibility to workers' scope for exercising control, their
   labour market vulnerability and economic attachment to the platform.},

Abstract = {The Capitol attack has provoked intensive debate and reflection far
   beyond the United States. These debates and their repercussions will be
   part of the legacy of the event. The article looks at the public debate
   on the Capitol attack in Finland and Sweden. In both countries, the
   Capitol attack was interpreted as a warning about the powerful
   consequences of sowing distrust towards democracy. The attack may
   inspire far-right actors to attempt to shake the democratic system in
   these countries too. Whether such mobilisation could succeed and gain
   support from within the political system seems unlikely, but not
   entirely impossible.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role religious beliefs play in leading
   European Muslims to justify terrorism, using survey data collected in
   twenty-one countries. Results show that the factors leading Muslims to
   justify terrorism contextually vary. Where Muslims are predominant, this
   probability decreases with the importance respondents assign to
   religion, while it increases where Muslims are a minority. We find no
   evidence in support of the thesis that Islamist propaganda causes
   ordinary believers' radicalization. Yet, in Western countries affected
   by homegrown terrorism, we observe that justifying terrorism is strongly
   associated with an increase in religious practice, providing support to
   the thesis that Islamist groups are attracting Islam radical

Abstract = {An unpleasant truth overlooked is that although war is a great evil, it
   does have a great virtue: it can solve political conflicts and lead to
   peace. This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
   one wins decisively. This study empirically analyzes whether these
   arguments are supported by evidence on recent military interventions. In
   our analysis, the effect of military intervention on deterioration risk
   is not highly significant and considerable. At peak, danger-the risk of
   state collapse-is about 38\%, whereas a country with no intervention has
   a risk of 19\%. R2P doctrine, however, developed by the International
   Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty in 2001 with the avowed
   objectives of protecting humans from mass atrocities and other crimes,
   is theoretically defective, which will continue to be limited. To avoid
   arbitrary intervention, we should restructure the philosophy of the R2P
   to one with which any society of any age can agree and pursue a
   ``minimalist-institutional approach.{''}},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {311-325},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {This article reframes the relationship between peace and power through
   the notion of the sacred. Both orthodox and critical theorisations of
   power tend to be grounded within a power-as-force discourse, which sees
   peace and power as dichotomous rather than synergistic. In this article,
   I argue that in order to understand and embody power in a new way, we
   must bring attention to the relationship between the inner
   psycho-spiritual realm and the outer socio-political realm. I introduce
   the sacred through a holographic epistemology, which invites three
   conceptual reorientations. First, I posit power as distinct from force
   and compatible with peace. Second, I explore the ways in which power is
   holographically mirrored between inner and outer realms of peace. Third,
   I invite a peace-centric approach to researching conflict. These
   reorientations reclaim the sacred in peace research in order to
   conceptualise and embody a more congruent relationship between power and
   peace.},

Abstract = {This article develops a new analytical framework to account for
   institutional change in vocational education and training (VET) systems.
   Trajectories of institutional change are typically explained using one
   of two perspectives on institutional contention. First, the Varieties of
   Capitalism-approach highlights positive efficiency effects from
   coordination between companies on skill formation. Second, a historical
   institutionalist approach focuses on positive political feedback effects
   from the governance of VET institutions. We propose adding a third
   dimension of institutional contention related to what role VET should
   play in fostering greater socio-economic equality. Employing this
   three-dimensional framework enables a more fine-grained analysis of
   gradual forms of institutional change and greater appreciation of the
   ways in which political struggles over the configuration of the three
   dimensions drive institutional reform. The argument is supported by
   analyzing the trajectory of institutional change in the Danish VET
   system in the post-war period.},

Abstract = {Apology diplomacy promises to assuage historical grievances held by
   foreign publics, yet in practice appears to ignite domestic backlash,
   raising questions about its efficacy. This article develops a theory of
   how political apologies affect public approval of an apologizing
   government across domestic and foreign contexts. The authors test its
   implications using large-scale survey experiments in Japan and the
   United States. In the surveys, the authors present vignettes about World
   War II grievances and randomize the nature of a government apology. They
   find that apology-making, both as statements acknowledging wrongdoing
   and as expressions of remorse, boosts approval in the recipient state.
   But in the apologizing state, backlash is likely among individuals with
   strong hierarchical group dispositions-manifested as nationalism,
   social-dominance orientation, and conservatism-and among those who do
   not consider the recipient a strategically important partner. This
   microlevel evidence reveals how leaders face a crucial trade-off between
   improving support abroad and risking backlash at home, with implications
   for the study of diplomatic communication and transitional justice.},

Abstract = {One of the priority directions of administrative reforms that take place
   in the Republic of Kazakhstan is the enhancement of civil service
   effectiveness. And, the success of reforms will mostly be determined by
   the condition of civil service, which depends on the performance of
   civil servants. Taking into consideration the importance of motivated
   and satisfied employees on their commitment, this study was aimed to
   identify the relationship between motivation and job satisfaction on
   employees' commitment and studying the mediating role of job
   satisfaction on the relationship of civil servants' motivation and
   organizational commitment in the central and local executive bodies in
   Kazakhstan. In total, 1205 civil servants from 5 ministries and 4
   regional administration completed a questionnaire adapted from previous
   studies. The results show significant relationships exist between work
   motivation dimensions and organizational commitment as well as work
   motivation and job satisfaction. Moreover, the study found the mediating
   effect of job satisfaction on the hypothesized relationships. This paper
   contributes to the existing human resources literature on employees'
   commitment and guides management on how to improved employees' job
   satisfaction and employee's commitment.},

Abstract = {Alliances are costly to form and to terminate, and yet alliances change
   frequently. Scholars typically attribute these decisions to static
   factors, such as the power balance, and retrospective ones, such as past
   power shifts. We highlight another factor: prospective changes,
   particularly anticipated military strength shifts. We analyze a
   three-country bargaining model of alliances and war that incorporates
   forward-looking power dynamics. The model, unlike those restricting
   players to set roles, flexibly allows players to ally in any
   arrangement. We find that alliance arrangements that are optimal when
   power is static are often suboptimal when power fluctuates. Maintaining
   prior alliances despite expected power shifts may even lead to
   preventive war. States thus strategically look to the future to identify
   optimal alliances in the present. Quantitative analyses corroborate the
   expectation. As the anticipated size of power shifts increases, alliance
   changes become more common. Accordingly, states navigate expected
   changes in the international landscape by rearranging current alliance
   commitments that can help minimize the risk of conflict. When power
   balances are in flux, malleable institutional arrangements may prove
   preferable to rigid ones.},

Abstract = {Military theories are thoughts explaining how armed forces are to be
   used to achieve objectives. These thoughts are often influenced by
   emotions, yet the influence of emotions on military theory-crafting
   remains underexplored. This article fills the gap by exploring how awe
   influences military theorising. Awe is an emotion associated with the
   feeling of transcendence. Several military theorists felt that way about
   the technologies of air power, nuclear power and cyber power,
   respectively. Consequently, their theories became narrowly focused,
   technocentric and detached from the previous theories and military
   history. Understanding these tendencies can help improve military
   theorising in the future.},

Abstract = {While it has become accepted that norms can act in institution-like
   ways, a highly valued norm that has not been examined is free speech.
   Can free speech be conceptualised as acting in institution-like ways? If
   it can, what does this illuminate about processes of policy change? I
   analyse policy change between 2001 and 2011 in the United States, the
   United Kingdom and Australia, a period during which significant new
   limits were introduced on free speech in relation to national security.
   In addition to showing how free speech acted in institution-like ways,
   the analysis suggests three implications: norms can both act in
   institution-like ways and be subject to change in interaction with other
   institutions; a broad, cultural level institution can mask policy change
   at the narrow, rule-based level even where the latter contradicts the
   former; and complexity and variation in speech regulation can be
   understood as consequences of the to-be-expected variability in the
   institutionalisation of a norm.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the political violence
   during the Arab Spring on the stock market return of international
   defense firms. The direction of this impact is not directly
   straightforward as the civil unrests influence the expectations of
   investors in two opposite ways. On the one hand, investors might expect
   that when the peaceful demonstrations were turned into violent events,
   the Arab governments involved will start acquiring more
   military-strategic goods to repress the protests or send a strong signal
   of power to ensure their stay in office. However, on the other hand,
   when the popular protests escalated, investors, perhaps, became more
   concerned about the possible imposition of international military
   sanctions against the Arab Spring countries to restore peace and protect
   human rights. The main empirical findings of a dynamic panel model
   clearly confirm this pattern and point out that when the Arab Spring
   originated, the abnormal return of international defense stocks starts
   to rise immediately. However, in the course of time, the concerns of the
   introduction of arms embargoes become stronger and eventually start to
   dominate, causing the abnormal return to fall again, while the
   idiosyncratic risk began to fall due to enhanced diversification. It
   turns out that firm-specific factors can explain a substantial part of
   the effect found. For instance, the reaction of investors to the Arab
   Spring is significantly larger for firms that produce predominantly
   military goods.},

Abstract = {To better understand the impact of deliberations during participatory
   policymaking events, we introduce and explore the concept of group
   proximity. An example of such events is citizens' summits, during which
   many parallel groups deliberate on solutions for a policy issue. At the
   summit that was studied, each group followed a value deliberation
   process with the aim to increase mutual understanding among
   participants. They were asked to rank the solutions in their order of
   preference before and after the deliberation. From these rankings, group
   proximity can be calculated with a rank correlation, enabling a precise
   comparison of participants' preferences in each deliberative group. High
   group proximity indicates very similar rankings in a deliberative group,
   while low group proximity demonstrates the opposite. Comparing group
   proximity of the before and after rankings shows if a group ranked
   convergent, unchanged or divergent. This measure allows for a
   quantitative analysis of early-stage public policymaking processes.},

Abstract = {We examine how different spatial compositions affect the educational
   achievement in mathematics of 16-year-old students in Chile, a Latin
   American country with high inequality and one of the most segregated
   education systems in the world. Conceptually, we complement the
   literature on `neighbourhood effects', which typically addresses the
   influence of concentrated disadvantage, by focusing on concentrated
   advantage and its influence on educational outcomes. We construct a
   panel with all school students who took a national standardized
   mathematics test in 2010, 2014 and 2016 in the Metropolitan Region of
   Santiago, Chile. We complement it with survey data for the 52 districts
   of the Metropolitan Region, clustering the districts based on factors
   such as unemployment, economic inequality, access to services,
   experiences of violence and stigmatization. Our different identification
   strategies consistently show that concentrated poverty and affluence are
   both relevant for explaining educational achievement in mathematics
   above and beyond individual and school characteristics.},

Abstract = {Opposition coordination varies widely in electoral autocracies.
   Sometimes, opposition parties are highly coordinated and create
   alliances, present joint candidates or common policy platforms. Yet, at
   other times, oppositions choose to challenge incumbents individually.
   This article seeks to explain what drives opposition parties to
   coordinate in non-democratic regimes. It finds that opponents'
   decision-making and strategy formation is influenced by the amount of
   repression they face from the incumbent regime. It argues that
   repression has a curvilinear relationship with opposition coordination.
   When repression is low and high, opposition coordination will be
   informal or clandestine. However, when repression is at intermediate
   levels, opposition parties will formally coordinate to dislodge
   authoritarian incumbents. This article illustrates this argument through
   an analysis of the Venezuelan opposition under Chavismo (1999-2018),
   combining 129 interviews with party elites, journalists, academics, and
   regime defectors, along with archival research at key historical
   moments.},

Abstract = {Venezuela's state-led national-popular Bolivarian process opened up a
   new political field for feminism-an approach that was both institutional
   and popular, aiming to combine forces from above and from below and use
   state gender institutions to foment popular women's organization. Yet
   this field was conflictual, containing contesting popular feminist
   projects with different implications for the gendered division of labor.
   Analysis of popular women's organizing around Venezuela's 2012 organic
   labor law shows that state adoption of feminism marked a gendered
   political opening for popularizing feminism while also presenting risks
   of state co-optation of popular women's organizing. The state understood
   popular women's organization and mobilization as central to the
   revolution, yet it generally attempted to limit their autonomy and
   organizing to challenge the gendered division of labor.
   El bolivarianismo nacional-popular liderado por el estado venezolano
   abrio un nuevo campo politico para el feminismo: un enfoque que era
   tanto institucional como popular y cuyo objetivo era combinar fuerzas
   tanto de arriba como de abajo, asi como utilizar las instituciones
   estatales de genero para fomentar las organizaciones populares de
   mujeres. Sin embargo, este campo resulto conflictivo, y parte de su
   contenido impugnaba proyectos feministas populares con diferentes
   implicaciones para las divisiones de genero en el trabajo. El analisis
   de la organizacion popular de las mujeres en torno a la ley organica del
   trabajo de Venezuela de 2012 muestra que la adopcion estatal del
   feminismo marco una apertura politica de genero con intenciones de
   popularizar el feminismo a la vez que presentaba el riesgo de que la
   organizacion popular de las mujeres fuera cooptada por el estado. El
   estado consideraba la organizacion y movilizacion popular de las mujeres
   como esenciales a la revolucion. Sin embargo y hablando generalmente, se
   aboco a limitar su autonomia y organizacion cuando se trataba de
   desafiar las divisiones de genero en el trabajo.},

   Revealed Publicness or Revealed Privateness?},

Abstract = {This article asks what distribution behavior of private foundations in
   the United States reveals about their motivations and strategy. Do
   private foundations intentionally distribute additional money to
   grantees to help them manage through business cycles and maintain
   services during economic downturns? Such behavior would be consistent
   with revealed publicness with respect to distributions. Do they retrench
   during difficult economic times to protect their endowments? Or do they
   simply distribute money independent from the larger economy? The current
   study considers these conflicting expectations, and empirically tests
   whether private foundation distributions vary with endowment returns and
   the larger economy as suggested by competing theories. Using
   administrative data filed with the Internal Revenue Service, fixed
   effects regression models indicate that private foundations change
   distributions in a manner consistent with retrenchment or independently
   from the larger economy, depending on the sample used. The results do
   not support the notion that private foundations act with
   prosocial-countercyclical motivations about distributions-in which more
   money is distributed during economic downturns-despite their receiving
   significant public subsidies.},

Abstract = {We examine the political consequence of exposure to widely available
   video content of terror violence. In a two-wave survey of Americans, we
   assess who is exposed to, and seeks out, terror-related video content in
   the first wave and then observe who decides to watch raw video footage
   of the Boston marathon terror attack in the second. We focus centrally
   on anxiety and anger as differing emotional reactions to the threat of
   terrorism and document their influence on exposure to terror violence.
   Anxiety generates avoidance of violent terror content whereas anger
   increases its consumption. Moreover, we find that anger increases
   exposure to violent terror content and in addition enhances support for
   punitive and retaliatory anti-terrorism policy. We discuss the
   implications of our findings for the broader dynamics of terrorist
   violence and the emotional basis of selective news exposure.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between court performance and
   citizen attitudes toward corruption. We develop a framework inspired by
   signaling theory that focuses on the need for institutional actors to
   send credible signals about their commitment against corruption if they
   seek to engage citizens. We suggest two channels that link court signals
   to citizen attitudes, an ``institutional channel{''} linking signals to
   trust in courts and attitudes about state-driven anti-corruption
   measures and a ``citizen channel{''} linking signals to citizen efficacy
   and norms about bribe paying. We investigate these channels with a
   survey experiment about a fictional court case in low income areas in
   South Africa and Tunisia. We find evidence that impartiality and
   efficiency by courts in corruption cases activate the institutional
   channel. Our findings suggest that courts can play an important role in
   the fight against corruption, not just by acting as deterrents but by
   affecting citizen attitudes toward corruption.},

Abstract = {Over the last twenty years, researchers have undertaken systematic
   comparison of migration policy by creating sets of policy
   indicators/indexes at the national level. These indicators are designed
   to analyse the differences and trends in migration policy and then be
   used by the research community to assess the determinants and effects of
   policy. This article aims to assess the comprehensiveness of current
   migration policy indicators by analysing their thematic, geographical
   and temporal coverage as a way of understanding how migration policy has
   been conceptualised and measured in quantitative migration research. Our
   analysis of the 67 existing indexes shows that they disproportionally
   focus on immigration policy, mainly admission and citizenship, in OECD
   and particularly Western European countries, with limited opportunities
   for longitudinal analysis of policy change. These findings reveal that
   migration policy has been largely conceptualised in indexes as a
   contemporary phenomenon, concerning mainly Western countries that have
   become major destination countries.},

Abstract = {Most scholars have described the European Union (EU) as a liberal actor
   in its approach to international climate and energy governance. This
   paper argues that the EU has shifted to a strategic approach, including
   the use of legislation and the adoption of negotiating positions that
   promote a political agenda. This is illustrated through an analysis of
   the EU's evolving stance on multilateral energy governance and its
   handling of the Nord Stream 2 project. The EU began to shift towards a
   strategic stance already in the 2000s, in the context of the Energy
   Charter Treaty negotiations and the growing securitization of European
   energy debates. Following the polycrisis of the mid-2010s, the EU
   adopted a full-fledged strategic stance on external energy policy.
   Geopolitical crises and great power competition, together with intra-EU
   divisions and an increased focus on the climate agenda, have catalyzed
   the EU's shift to a strategic approach.},

Abstract = {While there has been growing concern about the use of technology by
   terrorist groups to organize and execute violence, there has been much
   less academic work on the effectiveness of governmental efforts to
   control the use of technology to prevent terrorist violence. Governments
   across the world have relied on network shutdowns to tackle violence,
   amongst other ends. Using data from one such country, Pakistan, this
   paper examines the effectiveness of disrupting cellphone networks as
   acounterterrorism strategy to tackle terrorist violence. This paper
   relies on daily data on terrorist violence in Pakistan from January 2012
   to December 2017 combined with data on government-mandated cellphone
   shutdowns. The results show a statistically significant decline in the
   number of terrorist attacks on the day of cellphone shutdowns and an
   increase in terrorist attacks on the day after cellphone shutdown.
   Overall, it is argued that while cellphone shutdowns might displace
   terrorist violence from one day to the next, they are not an effective
   way to tackle terrorist violence.},

Abstract = {Bitcoin went from being an obscure online project to a globally
   exchanged money valued at tens of thousands of dollars (USD) per unit.
   It has achieved this in spite of fundamental irreconcilabilities between
   the economic theories which spurred its creation and its own material
   basis. This article investigates how this happened using a
   computationally grounded analysis of 100 000s of messages from the early
   years of Bitcoin's two main online communities. It will show how the
   continuing divergence in participants' understandings of why Bitcoin
   possessed value ultimately gave way to an emerging focus on the social
   problem of adoption. In demonstrating this shift and accompanying
   promotion of activities that affirmed Bitcoin had value in practice,
   this article with argue that shared meaning in the form of practical
   affirmations of worth, rather than conceptual understandings of it, are
   key to communities' ability to `bootstrap' a money's initial economic
   value.},

Abstract = {This paper provides empirical evidence on the incentive role of
   personnel control in China in the twenty-first century. Employing the
   city-level turnover data of political leaders in China between 2000 and
   2018 and utilizing the fixed effects ordered logit model, we find that
   the likelihood of promotion of local leaders rises with their economic
   performance. This relationship holds more firmly in the municipal party
   secretary. The probability is also found to decrease with the economic
   performance of their immediate predecessors and neighboring cities. This
   finding is robust to various robustness tests. We interpret the finding
   as evidence that the relative economic performance (peer effects) also
   contributes to the local political turnover, in particular within a
   province. Moreover, after the Third Plenary Session of the 18(th) CPC
   Central Committee, a material change in the personnel arrangement within
   the party arises and this promotion mechanism shows a dynamic change.
   Our study sheds some light on the growing literature emphasizing the
   relationship between political turnover and economic performance.},

Abstract = {The Rafael Correa administration, usually characterized as
   ``neo-extractivist,{''} did in fact propose an alternative development
   model that, under a particular understanding of the notion of buen
   vivir, aimed to overcome the country's economic dependence on extractive
   activities through its gradual replacement by a knowledge-intensive
   economic sector. An examination of this model, some of the main policies
   implemented in order to configure it, and the main obstacles encountered
   in the process confirms the classic intuition of so-called dependency
   theory: that the ability of peripheral countries to overcome their
   reliance on commodities exports is constrained by economic and
   institutional mechanisms that limit their room for maneuver.
   La administracion de Rafael Correa, generalmente caracterizada como
   ``neoextractivista{''}, propuso un modelo de desarrollo alternativo que,
   bajo un entendimiento particular de la nocion del buen vivir, tenia como
   objetivo superar la dependencia economica del pais de las actividades
   extractivas a traves de una sustitucion gradual por un sector economico
   intensivo en conocimiento. Un analisis de este modelo, algunas de las
   principales politicas implementadas para configurarlo, y los principales
   obstaculos encontrados en el proceso confirman la clasica intuicion de
   la llamada teoria de la dependencia: que la capacidad de los paises
   perifericos para superar su dependencia de las exportaciones de
   productos basicos esta limitada por mecanismos economicos e
   institucionales que limitan el margen de maniobra.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) and
   discusses options to improve sub- and non-state involvement in post-2020
   climate governance. A framework that stimulates sub- and non-state
   action is a necessary complement to national governmental action, as the
   latter falls short of achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient
   development as envisaged in the Paris Agreement. Applying design
   principles for an ideal-type orchestration framework, we review
   literature and gather expert judgements to assess whether the GCAA has
   been collaborative, comprehensive, evaluative and catalytic. Results
   show that there has been greater coordination among orchestrators, for
   instance in the organization of events. However, mobilization efforts
   remain event-driven and too little effort is invested in understanding
   the progress of sub- and non-state action. Data collection has improved,
   although more sophisticated indicators are needed to evaluate climate
   and sustainable development impacts. Finally, the GCAA has recorded more
   action, but relatively little by actors in developing countries. As the
   world seeks to recover from the COVID-19 crisis and enters a new decade
   of climate action, the GCAA could make a vital contribution in
   challenging times by helping governments keep and enhance climate
   commitments; strengthening capacity for sub- and non-state action;
   enabling accountability; and realizing sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Observers argue that robots and other advanced technology will eliminate
   millions of jobs across affluent democracies in the coming decades. But
   do citizens in affluent democracies recognize this, and if so, does it
   affect how salient they find economic problems compared to other
   problems the governments might address? Using a unique Eurobarometer
   survey with an extensive set of questions about technology we
   investigate the extent of sociotropic and selfish employment concerns
   regarding technology and examine how these concerns are associated with
   the micro-level prioritization of economic problems in European mass
   publics. We find that sociotropic employment concerns regarding
   technology are widespread compared to selfish, but that only those with
   selfish employment concerns demonstrate greater prioritization of
   economic problems. Our findings have important implications for
   understanding how people view the threat posed by technology to their
   jobs and potential shifts in policy agendas as technology-induced job
   loss spreads.},

Abstract = {The article is a critical analysis of data collected during
   anthropologic fieldwork in the Albanian city of Berat, where one of the
   world's largest political slogans is located. The inscription
   ``ENVER{''} on Shpirag mountain was created in 1968 as a birthday
   present for the leader of the Albanian regime Enver Hoxha. For almost
   thirty years, this inscription dominated the city, being visible from a
   distance of many kilometers. After the political transformation in 1991,
   the new Albanian government planned to destroy the slogan as a remnant
   of the cult of personality. However, despite the help of the army and
   the use of explosives, the inscription could not be removed. The giant
   slogan from Berat is a phenomenon on a global scale: its history, as
   well as its meanings, created a unique narrative about Albanian politics
   and culture. For over three decades, the inscription has become an
   element of the local aesthetic and social landscape. In 2012 the
   Albanian artist made a subversive act of capturing the old propaganda
   slogan: as a consequence, the original inscription ``ENVER{''} was
   replaced with a new one: ``NEVER.{''} Anthropological fieldwork and
   art-based research focused on the slogan, encouraged participants to
   express ideas, insights, views, and experiences. The data collected
   during the research are very varied. Many of them consist of superficial
   judgments, gossips, presumptions, and stereotypical cliches. They are
   also accompanied by much deeper expressions, articulating the palimpsest
   memory of women and men living in the shadow of ENVER/NEVER.},

Abstract = {Surveying civil war in the world today is striking in terms of how often
   religious cleavages and grievances have become central to armed
   conflict. How are the causes and outcomes of religious civil wars
   different than other civil wars, if at all? Is Islam implicated for the
   contemporary surge in religious civil war? The first section reviews the
   literature and addresses the importance of religion for civil war. I
   then introduce a dataset and describe key trends in religious civil war
   in the third section, while in the fourth section I present tests of
   whether Muslim or Arab Muslim societies in particular are more prone to
   religious strife. The paper concludes with a discussion of the
   implications of the main findings.},

Abstract = {When the state fails to carry out the duties it would normally fulfil in
   the post-conflict period, non-state actors eventually step in to fill
   the gaps. Such processes ultimately come to stand in for official state
   response. While this seems like a fairly innocuous turn of events, there
   are consequences to the substitution of civil society-run post-conflict
   rebuilding that are rarely unpacked. The literature has so far not taken
   up what is a fairly serious issue: By letting the state off the hook,
   citizens' needs are never appropriately met; governments are able to
   continue with other areas of foci - including carrying on with acts of
   war and human rights abuses and official responsibility is never taken.},

Abstract = {This paper defines the solution to the European Sovereign Debt Crisis as
   a European solidarity deal and analyzes it from the perspective of
   citizens in an EU debtor state. To be more precise, we test the
   conditions under which citizens living in an indebted state support
   their country's part of the solidarity deal, namely the introduction of
   austerity measures to overcome the crisis. Using Greece in the peak of
   its drama as a case in point, we find that the belief in the necessity
   of the deal due to pessimistic economic evaluations, citizens' support
   for their country's EU membership as well as economic right-wing
   positions were clear determinants for citizens' vote in favor of the
   introduction of austerity measures, otherwise known to be highly
   unpopular.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {216-230},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article demonstrates the value of rhetorical audience studies for
   analysing constructions of `the nation' and national identity. A key
   strength of this approach is its recognition of the interplay between
   the rhetorical situation, the text of the speech, and the audience's
   responses to that rhetoric. Using the historical method for
   investigating rhetoric and its reception, the article examines Theresa
   May's efforts to bring the nation together after the 2016 referendum and
   to offer an inspiring vision of post-Brexit Britain. A textual analysis
   shows that her rhetoric of Britishness was constructed around an
   imagined audience of Leave voters, and thus excluded Remainers from her
   conceptions of Britain and `the British people'. The audience reception
   study supports this finding, as it reveals two competing myths of `the
   nation' which in turn constituted rival subject positions. In short,
   May's epideictic failed to unite the country behind her conception of a
   strong, cohesive Global Britain.},

Abstract = {Despite calls for the development of `second-generation' approaches,
   security sector reform (SSR) processes in conflict-affected contexts
   remain dominated by state-centric strategies with weak records of
   improving security governance or human security. SSR's current impasse,
   we suggest, is best captured in the tension between an ongoing
   commitment to the rule of law and a growing recognition that sustainable
   peace must be grounded in local traditions and practices. Our argument
   is that re-thinking the place of the rule of law within SSR as a
   long-term aspiration, rather than a short-term fix, requires
   reconsidering accountability in security governance. In contexts where
   the rule of law is weakly institutionalised, and where myriad forms of
   security provision co-exist, how (and by whom) can security actors be
   held accountable? We seek to identify varieties of extra-legal
   accountability arrangements that exist in conflict-affected contexts,
   and ways in which external actors may support - without coopting - such
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {The Institute of International Finance (IIF) is a key actor in global
   finance, mixing private-interest representation and market governance
   roles. Analyzing the historical development of the IIF offers important
   insights into the interaction between state and business and the
   resulting patterns of public and private governance. Based on archive
   sources and a unique set of interviews with elite policymakers spanning
   three decades, I argue that market structures, interest groups, and
   public policymaking processes stand in a recursive relationship.
   Secondly, I argue that interest groups take on private governance roles
   with the aim to remain the focal point of public policymakers vis-a-vis
   competing interest groups. This has important implications for the study
   of interest groups and global financial governance. The analysis of
   interest groups should be extended to the way they shape markets through
   private governance mechanisms and how that recursively feeds back into
   interest group advocacy and public policymaking processes to fully grasp
   lobbying dynamics. The study of global governance should include
   analysis of interest group competition within the opportunities and
   constraints emanating from public policymaking processes so as to
   understand the emergence of private patterns of governance and their
   interaction with public governance mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump broke many presidential norms, including the preponderance
   of expertise in the formulation and implementation of u.s. foreign
   policy. While his predecessors have shown a relative distrust towards
   the national security apparatus's expertise, Trump has fully embraced
   his hostility towards these institutions and their experts. This article
   analyzes the three main consequences of this hostility : false
   loyalty-competence tension in the selection of advisors; prioritization
   of symbolic gains and underutilization of organizational resources that
   have jeopardized the implementation of foreign policy and the
   sustainability of instituted changes; and flawed crisis management
   (covid-19).},

Abstract = {In the past decade, the world has entered a new nuclear age : relations
   among the major nuclear powers (United States, Russia and China) have
   grown more competitive, the spread of nuclear weapons to new states has
   resulted in worrying regional nuclear instabilities, and technological
   advances are raising new threats, while Arms Control is in a state of
   near total collapse. A new multilateral nuclear disorder, combining
   traditional concerns with distinctive new dangers, is here. The perils
   of this new and still evolving nuclear reality must be understood. The
   purpose of this article is to present a critical analysis of this
   reality and offer some thoughts regarding the future of the nuclear
   (dis)order.},

Title = {Trade Competition and Worker Compensation: Why Do Some Receive More than
   Others?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {65},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Dealing with the distributional consequences of trade liberalization has
   become one of the key challenges facing developed democracies.
   Governments have created compensation programs to ease labor market
   adjustment, but these resources tend to be distributed highly unevenly.
   What accounts for the variation? Looking at the largest trade adjustment
   program in existence, the US' Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), we
   argue that petitions for compensation are largely driven by legislative
   attitudes. When legislators express negative views of TAA, individuals
   in their districts become less likely to petition for, and receive,
   compensation. This effect is especially pronounced in Republican
   districts. An underprovision of TAA, in turn, renders individuals more
   likely to demand other forms of government support, like in-kind medical
   benefits. We use roll-call votes, bill sponsorships, and floor speeches
   to measure elite attitudes, and we proxy for the demand for trade
   adjustment using economic shocks from Chinese import competition. In
   sum, we show how the individual beliefs of political elites can be
   self-fulfilling.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {All wars are expensive, but civil wars carry heightened stakes. Defeat
   can mean loss of territory, the dissolution of the sitting government,
   or the liquidation of the state itself. Even a victorious government may
   face tremendous crises and pressures in the short-term. A central bank
   can signal a sovereign's creditworthiness to potential lenders, but the
   bank's independence (or even existence) can be terminated should a
   government wish to do so. Despite this, lenders not only continue to
   lend to governments amidst civil wars but also respond to signals of
   creditworthiness such as the presence of an independent central bank.
   Using several statistical models and bond yield data from the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries, I demonstrate that the presence of a
   central bank reduces sovereign borrowing costs for a state amidst a
   civil war. This confirms the institution's ability to secure cheap
   wartime capital under suboptimal conditions.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the `affective turn' within social sciences,
   alongside the shift to a more emotional public and political sphere, and
   the implications of these shifts for the study of social policy. A
   context of austerity cuts and reforms to welfare services contributes to
   heightened and unstable emotions surrounding services. A case study of
   Sure Start Children's Centers in the UK is presented, in two areas where
   centers were threatened with closure. Interview and ethnographic
   material with both staff and service users is presented to show how
   emotions became heightened and politicized in this context. Both staff
   and service users articulated the values of the centers in new ways,
   drawing on intimate and emotional registers of experience. Overall, the
   material shows how in this context, emotions can be understood as
   place-based, relational and politicized, potentially producing different
   values and visions of welfare services.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for the need to go beyond appreciating co-production
   as a stand-alone process. Rather it offers a holistic model of value
   creation for public services, by integrating insights from both the
   public administration and management and the service management and
   marketing literatures. The components of this model are the loci,
   elements, and processes of value creation. Co-production is located
   within this model but only as one process, not as the pre-eminent one.
   The implications of this new model for public management theory and
   practice are explored.},

Abstract = {This article brings insights from Critical Border Studies (CBS) to bear
   on the diverse and proliferating borderings that have characterised the
   EU's migration crisis. It harnesses the broad ontological and empirical
   scope of `Borderscapes' scholarship to make coherent sense of seemingly
   disparate, plural borderings without eliding their diversity or
   particularity. It conceptualises the `borderscape' as being constituted
   by `related arrays' of bordering features, discourses and practices.
   This analytical framework is complemented by an interpretive framework
   that distinguishes the borderscape from other sociopolitical phenomena
   while contextualising it in relation to wider political concerns. The
   conceptualisation encourages nuanced yet cogent analysis of
   proliferating (in)securities, (im)mobilities and borderings, as well as
   their political implications: for identity, subjectivity, order and
   governance. The article thus offers a way to make sense of diverse
   manifestations, representations and analyses and of Europe's migration
   crisis-and provides a tool for making policy recommendations to address
   their negative consequences.},

   governance in Cote d'Ivoire},

Abstract = {Why is rebel governance more responsive in some areas than in others? In
   recent years, scholars have started to examine the determinants of rebel
   governance. Less attention has been given to explaining variation in the
   responsiveness of rebel governance, that is, the degree to which rebels
   are soliciting and acting upon civilian preferences in their governance.
   This article seeks to address this gap by studying local variation in
   rebel responsiveness. I argue that rebel responsiveness is a function of
   whether local elites control clientelist networks that allow them to
   mobilize local citizens. Strong clientelist networks are characterized
   by local elite control over resources and embeddedness in local
   authority structures. In turn, such networks shape local elites'
   capacity for mobilizing support for, or civil resistance against, the
   rebels, and hence their bargaining power in negotiations over rebel
   governance. Drawing on unique interview and archival data collected
   during eight months of fieldwork, as well as existing survey data, the
   study tests the argument through a systematic comparison of four areas
   held by the Forces Nouvelles in Cote d'Ivoire. The analysis indicates
   that the strength of local elites' clientelist networks shapes rebel
   responsiveness. Moreover, it provides support for the theorized civil
   resistance mechanism, and shows that this mechanism is further enhanced
   by ethnopolitical ties between civilians and rebels. These findings
   speak to the burgeoning literature on rebel governance and to research
   on civil resistance. In addition, the results inform policy debates on
   how to protect civilians in civil war.},

   Hong Kong: Associations Between Offline and Online Forms of Political
   Participation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Youth have often been described as politically apathetic or disengaged,
   particularly with respect to more conventional forms of participation.
   However, they tend to prefer non-institutionalized modes of political
   action and they may express themselves on the Internet. Young people
   have also been recognized as having a ``latent preparedness{''} to get
   politically active when needed. This paper reports forms of offline and
   online participation adopted by young adults in Hong Kong who were
   surveyed shortly before the anti-extradition bill social movement of
   2019 and 1 year later. The results tentatively suggest that young adults
   may not be very active in politics when they do not perceive the need to
   bring about change. However, they are involved in expressive activities
   and on the Internet more broadly, and ready to turn their latent
   participation into concrete political participation when they are
   dissatisfied with government actions and believe it is their
   responsibility to act against laws perceived to be unjust.
   Cross-sectional and cross-lagged panel analyses show that youth's
   participation in offline political activities is associated with their
   online participation. Positive effects of past experiences in each mode
   on participation in offline and online political activities show the
   mobilizing potential of social media and provide support for the
   reinforcement hypothesis, though previous participation in offline
   activities appears as a better predictor of political participation when
   compared with prior participation on the Internet.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political-institutional determinants of
   bureaucracy quality among a group of newly industrialized countries in
   Latin America and East Asia democratized in the Third Wave. Four causal
   conditions are examined for the occurrence of higher levels of
   bureaucratic ``weberianess{''} in the selected cases: historical
   sequence, political parties' institutionalization, electoral
   competition, and ethnic politics. The study employs the fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis to explore the expectation that each of
   these conditions' implications depends on other conditions' presence or
   absence. The findings disconfirm claims about the critical role of party
   system institutionalization for Weberian bureaucracies in new
   democracies. Besides, the analysis did not declare a professional public
   administration's prior existence before democratization as a necessary
   or sufficient condition for the outcome of interest. Finally, although
   the electoral competition was declared necessary for the outcome
   occurrence, it does not imply the same result if combined with ethnic
   politics.},

Abstract = {States often use covert operations to undermine their adversaries. This
   strategy involves, among other methods, intelligence organizations
   directing and supporting the operations of covert networks residing
   within the target state. This was a common occurrence during the Cold
   War, but covert clients also operate in modern conflicts in Syria,
   Ukraine, and elsewhere. This paper introduces and defines covert clients
   as a distinct and novel concept. We then use original data on more than
   250 clandestine networks within the French Resistance to investigate the
   determinants of covert client success and failure. We find that clients
   founded by foreign operatives inserted into the target state fail at
   significantly higher rates than those that establish themselves
   organically within the target state, although this effect diminishes
   among stronger groups. We corroborate these findings with a case study
   of the Prosper network to demonstrate how clandestine group origins
   influence their local knowledge, incentives, and security practices.
   This study uses original data to provide novel insights into clandestine
   group survival by linking survival to group origins. In demonstrating
   the potential utility of focusing on the conduct of covert operations,
   we also contribute to a rapidly growing international relations
   literature on how states project power through covert action.},

Abstract = {While power-sharing arrangements are often commended for establishing
   peaceful relations between major ethnic groups, they are also criticised
   for excluding `Others'. Nevertheless, more complex forms of party
   competition can emerge in power-sharing systems, including parties
   representing the dominant communities ('ethnic parties') seeking to
   engage Others ('non-dominant' groups). Drawing on semi-structured
   interviews with parties from Northern Ireland, we examine the extent to
   which dominant parties reach beyond their core ethnic constituencies,
   how and why. We consider increasingly salient non-sectarian issues, such
   as marriage equality and abortion, and explore how ethnic parties have
   sought to respond to these debates. We consider whether liberal forms of
   power-sharing influence the willingness of dominant parties to advance
   inclusion of non-dominant groups. Our findings suggest that under
   favourable conditions, flexible power-sharing can create space for
   incremental moves by ethnic parties to reach out to constituencies
   beyond their core, gradually moving the system towards more inclusive
   representation.},

Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-56},
Abstract = {The paper explores the impact of the Education for Peace programme in
   Colombia, drawing on evidence from one secondary school in Bogota,
   Colombia. Called `Lectures on Peace', this initiative is part of the
   government's strategy to overcome the internal conflict that lasted over
   fifty years. The study attempted to understand the role of Education for
   Peace in the Colombian post-conflict era as well as the policy
   implementation regarding the Lectures on Peace and the impact on
   students' future perspectives. Data were collected from questionnaires
   and interviews, as well as documentary data from the Colombian
   government and the secondary school. The study highlights that the
   initiative is contributing to peacebuilding in Colombia but it also
   presents some challenges, especially those related to bring an
   understanding of the conflict to individuals who have not directly
   experienced the effects of war.},

Title = {Between Human and State Security: Does the EU Offer a Coherent Response
   to Security Challenges in Central America, Colombia and Venezuela?},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {117-145},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: Central America, Colombia and Venezuela face
   important security challenges. Despite its rhetoric about the importance
   of human security, the EU applies different policies to the three
   conflicts: a security-development nexus in Central America, a
   combination of donor engagement and ``securitization{''} in Colombia and
   a mixture of sanctions and diplomacy in Venezuela. Employing a
   comparative approach based on a common methodological framework, this
   article sets out to determine which EU concept of security - State or
   human-focused - is applied to each conflict and assess its degree of
   coherence. Methodology: Basing itself on a qualitative content analysis,
   the article addresses the following question: to what extent does State
   or human security govern the EU ` s respective policies towards these
   countries and how consistent are they? Conclusions: The article finds
   that, despite its official discourse, the EU's security-development
   nexus is not a coherent policy and its relationship with the United
   States, its transatlantic ``partner{''} and the region's main donor, are
   mainly responsible for that policy ` s internal and external
   inconsistencies. Originality: The article questions the EU's image as a
   soft power and development partner. Although the EU continues to deal
   with the causes of insecurity, like inequality and poverty, rather than
   its consequences, its development-security nexus tends to
   ``securitize{''} development, particularly in countries, like Colombia
   and Venezuela, which, due to their armed conflicts and fragile States,
   are regarded as ``security threats.{''}},

Title = {Testing for Negative Spillovers: Is Promoting Human Rights Really Part
   of the ``Problem{''}?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-102},
Abstract = {The international community often seeks to promote political reforms in
   recalcitrant states. Recently, some scholars have argued that, rather
   than helping, international law and advocacy create new problems because
   they have negative spillovers that increase rights violations. We review
   three mechanisms for such spillovers: backlash, trade-offs, and
   counteraction and concentrate on the last of these. Some researchers
   assert that governments sometimes ``counteract{''} international human
   rights pressures by strategically substituting violations in adjacent
   areas that are either not targeted or are harder to monitor. However,
   most such research shows only that both outcomes correlate with an
   intervention-the targeted positively and the spillover negatively. The
   burden of proof, however, should be as rigorous as those for studies of
   first-order policy consequences. We show that these correlations by
   themselves are insufficient to demonstrate counteraction outside of the
   narrow case where the intervention is assumed to have no direct effect
   on the spillover, a situation akin to having a valid instrumental
   variable design. We revisit two prominent findings and show that the
   evidence for the counteraction claim is weak in both cases. The article
   contributes methodologically to the study of negative spillovers in
   general by proposing mediation and sensitivity analysis within an
   instrumental variables framework for assessing such arguments. It
   revisits important prior findings that claim negative consequences to
   human rights law and/or advocacy, and raises critical normative
   questions regarding how we empirically evaluate hypotheses about causal
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This article presents a process tracing-based comparative analysis of
   the nuclear programs in Argentina and Mexico between 1950 and 1991. It
   seeks to study the development of each case according to the possibility
   of implementing the idea of technological autonomy, based on their
   capacity for advancement as determined by three specific dimensions: the
   lateral autonomy of the main nuclear agency, the formation of strategic
   alliances with key intermediary actors, and a foreign policy in nuclear
   matters conducive to this goal.},

Abstract = {Economic populism was once recognized as a paradigmatic understanding of
   the boom-and-bust cycles of Latin America. By now, the concept has lost
   its analytical strength and academic attractiveness. Nevertheless,
   policy analysts cannot neglect the supply side analysis of contemporary
   populism, that is, what populists actually do once elected into
   government. Adopting and operationalizing the ideational definition of
   populism, the article identifies three major consequences of populist
   incumbency: (1) the inclination of populists to embark on redistributive
   policies favoring ``our{''} people against ``others,{''} (2) their
   critical attitude toward autonomous organizations, professionals, and
   institutions, and (3) their antagonistic relationship with the
   competitive market mechanism. The article demonstrates that populism is
   no longer about myopic and irresponsible policies; instead, populists
   tend to disregard the institutional constraints of economic decision
   making.},

Title = {Contesting the ``Corrupt Elites,{''} Creating the ``Pure People,{''} and
   Renegotiating the Hierarchies of the International Order? Populism and
   Foreign Policy-Making in Turkey and Hungary},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {This article explores the link between populism and hierarchies in
   international relations by examining the recent foreign policy-making in
   Turkey and Hungary-two countries run by populist leaders. We argue that
   when populists bring populism into foreign policy, they do so by
   contesting the ``corrupt elites{''} of the international order and,
   simultaneously, attempt to create the ``pure people{''} transnationally.
   The populists contest the ``eliteness{''} and leadership status of these
   ``elites{''} and the international order and its institutions, that is,
   the ``establishment,{''} that these ``elites{''} have come to represent
   by challenging them both in discourse and in action. The creation of the
   ``pure people{''} happens by discursively demarcating the
   ``underprivileged{''} of the international order as a subcategory based
   on religion and supplementing them with aid, thus mimicking the
   distributive strategies of populism, this time at the international
   level. We illustrate that when populist leaders, insert populism into
   foreign policies of their respective states, through contesting the
   ``corrupt elites{''} and creating the ``pure people,{''} the built-in
   vertical stratification mechanisms of populism that stems from the
   antagonistic binaries inherent to populism provide them with the
   necessary superiority and inferiority labels allowing them to
   renegotiate hierarchies in the international system in an attempt to
   modify the existing ones or to create new ones.},

Abstract = {This article aimed to illustrate that the role of the finance sector in
   an economic system can be explained more systemically and systematically
   in the context of its interaction with macroeconomic governance, based
   on the case of the USA from 1952Q1 to 2019Q2. The article introduced two
   modes of economic governance based on negative and positive
   institutional complementarities, developed its hypotheses built on a
   structural analysis of the long-run relationship between the finance
   sector and macroeconomic governance within the frame of these two modes,
   and quantitatively tested the hypotheses using time-series cointegration
   analysis. The article concluded that the finance sector enhanced and
   impaired the US economic performance, respectively, in the periods
   1952Q1-1973Q4 and 1980Q1-2007Q4, and that its long-run relationship with
   the US economic performance disappeared in the period 2008Q1-2019Q2.},

Abstract = {The private prison industry is a multi-million-dollar industry that has
   increasingly profited from the detention of undocumented immigrants. As
   a government contractor, therefore, the industry has a natural interest
   in government decision making, including legislation that can affect its
   expansion into immigrant detention. In this article, we examine the
   relationship between campaign donations made on behalf of the private
   prison industry and an untested form of position taking-bill
   cosponsorship-in the US House of Representatives. We hypothesize the
   private prison industry will reward House members for taking positions
   that benefit the industry. We also hypothesize the private prison
   industry will also reward House members who incur greater political risk
   by taking positions out of sync with the party. To test our hypotheses,
   we focus on punitive immigration legislation that has the potential to
   increase the supply of immigrant detainees over the course of eight
   years. We find support for our second hypothesis, that private prison
   companies are more likely to reward House Democrats who cosponsor
   punitive immigration policies even after accounting for possible
   endogeneity. The findings have important implications regarding the
   relationship between House members and private interests.},

Abstract = {Early propaganda studies in authoritarian countries argue that state
   media works to legitimize the regime through indoctrination and
   persuasion. However, recent scholarship shows that citizens in
   authoritarian countries-in states like China, Syria, Russia, and
   Kazakhstan-can be unconvinced by state propaganda. How, then, does the
   way in which citizens experience unconvincing propaganda shape their
   political beliefs? How might unpersuasive propaganda contribute to
   authoritarian stability? Given the lack of alternative theories of
   propaganda, this article proposes a new hypothesis based on a reception
   study that interviewed 24 Russian citizens from Krasnoiarsk Krai after
   they watched items from Russian state television. The article theorizes
   that unconvincing state propaganda in Russia can reinforce a preexisting
   cynical attitude toward politics-an attitude that makes the collective
   action necessary for bottom-up reform hard to contemplate, let alone
   organize in an authoritarian context.},

Abstract = {After World War II, Polish nobility was commonly considered an obsolete
   social group because of the post-1945 confiscation of their properties
   and the decline of their legal and political privileges. From a formal
   point of view, the Polish nobility had ceased to exist. However, this
   group did not simply vanish. For this reason, we should not speak of the
   disintegration of the former noble milieu but rather its reorganization.
   To expand deliberation on these ``reorganization strategies{''} with the
   use of appropriate sociological tools, this article analyzes major
   social actors in contemporary Poland who use their noble legacies in
   their collective identity-building practices.},

Abstract = {Scholars increasingly call for documentation and analysis of specific
   forms of conflict-related sexual violence. Moreover, accountability for
   crimes is stronger when specific patterns of victimization are
   documented. This article introduces the Repertoires of Sexual Violence
   in Armed Conflict (RSVAC) data package, which assembles reports from
   1989 to 2015 of forms of sexual violence by government/states forces,
   insurgent/rebel organizations, and pro-government militias for each
   conflict and year. RSVAC compiles the reported prevalence of eight forms
   of sexual violence - rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage, forced
   prostitution, sexual mutilation, forced pregnancy, forced sterilization
   and abortion, non-penetrative sexual torture, and sexual abuse (as well
   as that of multiple-perpetrator reports of each form). It includes
   extensive qualitative notes on reported incidents, as well as `conflict
   manuscripts' that include the relevant portions of source documents.
   Disaggregating `sexual violence' into its distinct forms enables
   analysis of the reported presence of forms of sexual violence across
   time, conflicts, and organizations. We illustrate its usefulness by
   highlighting hitherto neglected global patterns it suggests, and also
   discuss limitations, potential biases and underreporting that users need
   to take into account. We outline several research questions that the
   data can help answer and suggest how the data package could inform
   policy efforts to address sexual violence and its consequences.},

Title = {Populism and Its Authoritarian Tendencies: The Politics of Division in
   Bolivia},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Evo Morales rose to power on the shoulders of Bolivia's most powerful
   social movements, ostracizing the neoliberal elite with a
   progressive-left populist discourse that swept through Latin America.
   After nearly 14 years in power, Morales's caudillo-style leadership
   shifted toward authoritarianism and a politics of division that
   ultimately led to his ouster as president. While many have been quick to
   adopt the narrative of a coup d'etat, this perspective plays directly
   into the oversimplified binary politics used by the Morales
   administration, overlooking the complexity and fluidity of social forces
   and the changing state-society dynamics over time. Evo Morales suffered
   a crisis of legitimacy that was years in the making. His authoritarian
   tendencies, alliances with classes of capital, and reliance on the
   extractive economy ultimately led to his downfall as he lost support
   from his social bases and was unwilling to give up state power. The
   electoral scandal in October 2019 and the subsequent departure of Evo
   Morales into political exile were only the tip of the iceberg. Evo
   Morales accedio al poder gracias a los movimientos sociales mas
   poderosos de Bolivia, en conflicto con la elite neoliberal y utilizando
   un discurso populista de izquierda progresista que se extendio por
   America Latina. Despues de casi 14 anos en el poder, el liderazgo
   caudillista de Morales viro hacia el autoritarismo y una politica
   divisoria que finalmente llevo a su destitucion como presidente. Si bien
   muchos se han apresurado a adoptar la narrativa de un golpe de Estado,
   esta perspectiva se enfila directamente con la politica binaria
   simplista utilizada por la administracion misma de Morales, pasando por
   alto la complejidad y fluidez de las fuerzas sociales, asi como la
   dinamica cambiante estado-sociedad a traves del tiempo. Morales sufrio
   una crisis de legitimidad que se gesto durante anos. Sus tendencias
   autoritarias, sus alianzas con las clases capitalistas y su dependencia
   de la economia extractiva finalmente llevaron a su caida: perdio el
   apoyo de sus bases sociales sin estar dispuesto a renunciar al poder
   estatal. El escandalo electoral de octubre de 2019 y su posterior exilio
   politico fueron tan solo la punta del iceberg.},

Abstract = {Scholars have identified a range of terrorist strategies that militant
   groups employ to influence intended audiences, but there is scant
   empirical validation. Following Kenya's invasion of Somalia in late
   2011, Al-Shabaab executed retaliatory terrorist attacks in Kenya with
   the strategic aim to compel the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from
   Somalia. Drawing on unique in-depth interviews with Al-Shabaab defectors
   and civilian witnesses to counterterrorism measures in Kenya, this
   article investigates the strategic motives underlying Al-Shabaab's
   transnational terrorist operations and assesses the effect these have
   had on the intended audiences. The empirical findings reveal that the
   attrition strategy has underpinned Al-Shabaab's major terrorist attacks
   (large-scale events) whilst their minor terrorist attacks (small-scale
   events) have been motivated by the provocation strategy, aimed at
   eliciting a repressive state overreaction against Kenya's Somali and
   Muslim minorities. Whilst the major terrorist attacks succeeded in
   fomenting the Kenyan public's anti-war views, this did not result in
   troop withdrawal; the minor terrorist attacks, however, engendered harsh
   state repression and draconian measures against Kenya's Somali and
   Muslim minorities, ultimately exacerbating existing grievances and
   channelling fresh recruits to Al-Shabaab. This article contributes to
   the growing literature on terrorist strategies, offering nuanced
   empirical insights to understanding the strategic motives underpinning
   transnational terrorist campaigns. The article demonstrates that
   transnational terrorism campaigns are rooted in the strategic need to
   influence different audiences abroad. Depending on militant groups'
   short- and long-term objectives, the type of attack indicates the type
   of terrorist strategy they will employ.},

Abstract = {Formal models of war termination have been developed along two major
   approaches: in one, war is interpreted as a series of battles, where
   nations exchange denials that aim to destroy enemy forces; in the other,
   war is illustrated as a process of bargaining with mutual punishments
   that inflict costs on opponents. By integrating these two approaches, I
   build a dynamic model of war, where two nations choose between military
   force and civilian value as the targets of their attacks in every
   battle. The war proceeds along one of the following three paths in
   equilibrium. First, either nation immediately gives in to the other's
   threat of punishment such as nuclear strikes. Second, both the nations
   continue to conduct counterforce denial campaigns to weaken each other
   until either side is fully disarmed (i.e. all-out war). Third, after
   significant military imbalance is generated by the exchange of denials
   in an early battle, the winner of the battle switches to a countervalue
   punishment campaign, to which the loser responds by capitulation (i.e.
   limited war). My equilibrium analyses suggest that while denials largely
   determine a war's outcome, punishments can influence its duration.
   Unlike existing models, mine illuminates the two-way causal
   relationship, where past battle outcomes can influence the choice of
   military strategy, whereas military strategies also shape how the war
   will further evolve.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the updated version of our dataset, which is the
   third iteration of the Decision-making in the European Union (DEU-III)
   dataset. We outline the DEU project before describing the dataset in
   detail, including the case-selection criteria, and the definitions and
   operationalisations of the main constructs. The paper discusses the
   integration of the dataset with other variables that are used in many of
   the contributions to this special issue and other studies. Finally, we
   describe validity and reliability test of the DEU-III dataset as well as
   some avenues for its future use by scholars.},

Abstract = {If the European Parliament (EP) is responsive to electoral outcomes,
   then the positions it takes during negotiations on policy issues with
   other EU institutions will reflect its ideological composition. However,
   the dominance of a grand coalition of the centrist party groups may
   limit the extent to which changes in the composition of the EP affect
   the policy positions that it adopts. The EP may also suffer from an
   integrationist bias, as further integration enhances its power. This
   paper tests whether the positions taken by the EP in legislative
   negotiations reflect its ideological composition, drawing on data
   covering the period 1999-2019. The findings indicate that the policy
   positions adopted by the EP more closely reflect the ideological profile
   of the grand coalition than the median MEP. While the EP generally
   adopts pro-integration positions, this is in line with its ideological
   composition; there is no evidence of systematic policy drift in this
   direction.},

Title = {From the Anti-Semitic Campaign in 1968 to the Nationalism of the

   Tool of Politics},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the article is to deconstruct slogans and phrases
   that transmit anti-Semitism in Poland despite the apparent changing
   political and historical context. It contains a comparative analysis of
   messages from two historical periods: the anti-Semitic campaign of 1968
   and the nationalist and anti-Semitic revival in 2018. The material
   related to the 1968 events comes from archival press materials published
   between 1967 and 1968. On the other hand, materials illustrating the
   upsurge of anti-Semitism in the public space after the adoption of the
   memory law emanate from various sources representing the PiS (Law and
   Justice) party environment released between January and May 2018. The
   analysis of the anti-Semitic narrative from two different historical
   periods shows that nationalist message is always intended to strengthen
   the authoritarian power and mobilise its supporters by attacking
   imaginary opponents. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in communist
   Poland served a similar function as anti-Semitic cliches under the rule
   of the populist right.},

Abstract = {Existing electoral violence prevention programming does not sufficiently
   account for the incentives that compel political actors to use violence.
   When Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo defeated Ghana's incumbent President,
   John Dramani Mahama, in December 2016, the transition was lauded for its
   orderliness and credited with furthering Ghana's democratization. Many
   attributed the peaceful transfer of power to significant reforms
   undertaken by the electoral commission and the democratic values
   internalized by the candidates. However, we find that the reforms and
   personal attributes of the political actors were inadequate for
   resolving impasses that could have worsened the electoral environment.
   Our analysis reveals that interventions to prevent electoral violence
   must mitigate political actors' incentives to use or tolerate violence
   in furtherance of their objectives. In Ghana, we find that back channel
   negotiations-coupled with identifying potential hotspots, early
   monitoring and observation, and conflict resolution mechanisms-created a
   robust electoral violence prevention framework that reduced tensions and
   produced a relatively peaceful political transition. Our findings
   advance existing theories and practices for preventing electoral
   violence, which emphasize capacity building, institutional reforms, and
   other technical approaches to managing elections. We conclude that
   directly engaging political actors is a critical component of preventing
   electoral violence in Africa.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature by examining gender
   inequalities in political participation and political engagement among
   young people from a comparative perspective. By analyzing data on young
   people from nine European countries collected in 2018, we examine gender
   inequalities in participation in various modes of conventional and
   unconventional activism as well as related attitudes, broader political
   engagement and key determinants, cross-nationally, in order to provide a
   detailed picture of the current state of gender inequalities in
   political activism among young people in Europe. Our results allow us to
   speak to extant theorizing about gender inequalities by showing that the
   extent of political inequality between young men and women is less
   marked than one might expect. While the gender gaps in political
   participation for activities such as confrontational types of protest
   are small or absent, we find that young women are actually more active
   in petitioning, buycotting, and volunteering in the community. Young men
   instead are more active than young women in a majority of the nine
   countries analysed with respect to more institutional forms of
   participation linked to organizations and parties, various types of
   online political participation, and broader political engagement
   measures, such as internal political efficacy and consumption of
   political news through various channels. However, young men also appear
   to be more sceptical at least of certain aspects of democratic practice
   relative to young women.},

Abstract = {What politicizes White identity? We consider here a racialized partisan
   hypothesis. Although Whites numerically prevail within each party, the
   variance around this central tendency varies sharply between them:
   Republicans are tightly organized around Whites, yet Democrats are
   structured around Whites who share membership with people of color. This
   configuration puts White Democrats in a more precarious position and can
   sometimes motivate them to jockey for intraparty prominence. We support
   this claim with survey and experimental evidence. First, we show that
   White identity is more strongly associated with opposition to
   immigration among White Democrats than White Republicans (n = 6,126).
   This pattern is absent on a placebo (opposition to federal spending on
   science). Second, we demonstrate, experimentally, that White identity
   (but not partisan identity) mediates the impact of racial threat on
   racially coded policies among White Democrats (n = 400). This pattern
   does not emerge among White Republicans (n = 400) and is absent on
   another placebo (support for infrastructure spending).},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to advance the study of the nexus of populism and
   foreign policy by showing the connection between the personality traits
   of the leader and the foreign policy behavior of the state that they
   represent. It focuses on the political personality profiles of two
   populist leaders who can be characterized as antiplural, Hugo Chavez and
   Donald Trump, as a way to empirically further substantiate the recent
   research agenda on populism in world politics. The paper builds the two
   populist leaders' political profiles through the use of the leader trait
   analysis approach. It contends that there are patterns in populist
   leaders' personalities that can act as key drivers of their
   noncooperative and conflict-inducing behavior in foreign policy. The
   results show the characteristics that appear as the strongest predictors
   of their behavior in the international arena are their low task
   orientation and high focus on relationships.},

   themselves as credible actors in the eyes of potential supporters on
   social media. This paper will address this question by exploring the
   role of authenticity in strategic narratives, which is believed to help
   these groups achieve this purpose. Apart from introducing this new
   theoretical concept, the paper will also apply it to a new case study of
   the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) - the first far-right organization
   to be designated as terrorist by the U.S. and Canada. By conducting
   discourse analysis of the group's social media propaganda on the Russian
   network VKontakte, the paper will show how the RIM makes its strategic
   narratives authentic and, as a consequence, creates an image of a
   credible and trustworthy actor and thus manages to reach out to its
   target audience.},

Abstract = {As the state has become more susceptible to global pathologies, public
   policy scholars have found increasingly common ground with their IPE
   cousins. The development of these relatively young fields of study -
   increasingly they are sub-disciplines - has been commensurate but rarely
   intersecting. Yet contemporary maelstroms of global politics, economics,
   health, and security, span borders with ease, and increasingly force us
   to recognise, reconsider, and reconceptualise the overlapping realms of
   the national and international. In so doing, we must overcome the
   disciplinary distinctions. In this article, we traverse the prominent
   in-built disciplinary imperatives and methodologies that have kept these
   two disciplines from concerted inter-operability or, at least,
   interchange of theories and concepts. To do so, we begin by presenting a
   brief overview of the conceptual pedigrees and trajectories of these
   disciplines, before drawing attention to the prominent prevailing
   overlaps, `trespasses' and tensions as they specifically relate to
   policy convergence and diffusion, and policy transfer. We proceed to
   specify a reconciliation of these tensions through, in the third
   section, a brief study of the growth of global administrations,
   administrators, and administrative spaces. This, we contend, stands as a
   paradigm case of how reconciled IPE/public policy concepts can produce
   enhanced theoretical and substantive insights into the
   transnationalising political world.},

Abstract = {Keeping local government units' financial stability to run necessary
   projects is becoming a severe threat due to the remarkable increase of
   theirs' debt level. A question arises whether the application of debt
   limits excessively restrict municipalities' investment potential. Using
   the linear regression model, we proved that increasing the maximum
   allowable debt level decreases investment potential. We have challenged
   the relevance of using fiscal rules and presented liberalizing the
   fiscal rules' principles to assess the investment potential as an
   indicator to guarantee optimum use of the local government units'
   economic potential from different perspectives.},

Abstract = {A growing number of studies have paid attention to the dynamic nature of
   vertical government interactions in authoritarian China. Yet, less
   attention has been paid to the question of why higher level governments
   play different roles in diverse cases of innovation adoptions. Building
   on the extant literature, this study introduces the concept of
   innovation copyright, that is, the perceived ownership of the
   innovation, to explain the different roles of higher-level government
   involvement in innovation adoption. A comparative case study of policy
   innovations in China highlights that if higher-level governments
   perceive that they own the innovation copyright, they act as proactive
   facilitators, and if higher-level governments perceive that the
   innovation copyright belongs to local governments, they are involved as
   political backers. The copyright structures the expectations of
   higher-level and local governments and as a consequence determines their
   roles in innovation adoptions.},

Abstract = {Organising effective policy coordination has become a key principle of
   EU policymaking in recent decades. Within the European Commission,
   interservice consultations (ISCs) play an important role to coordinate
   between the different directorate-generals. In spite of this importance,
   ISCs have so far not been analysed in a systematic way. This paper
   addresses this gap by systematically analysing the numbers, types and
   content of comments made in ISCs around climate change adaptation. Our
   analysis shows that ISCs were primarily used to provide substantive
   comments, related to problem analyses, objectives or instruments, as
   well as to strengthen or weaken connections with policy efforts in
   adjacent domains. Institutional comments, related to mandates or
   resources, proved rare. Moreover, we find that the types of comments
   given in ISCs are mediated by institutional factors that shape the
   temporal dynamics of policy processes. Rather than reflecting the ideal
   types of `negative' and `positive' coordination, the overall pattern of
   policy coordination in the ISCs typifies an in-between form of
   `incremental policy coordination.'},

Abstract = {Human trafficking is a compelling and persistent problem that has
   attracted a great amount of attention among political leaders,
   government institutions, NGOs, and nonprofit organizations. While there
   is consensus that trafficking necessitates a multipronged policy
   response commonly known as the ``3Ps{''} (prosecution, protection, and
   prevention), anti-trafficking policies diffused across U.S. states in a
   piecemeal fashion. In this paper, we explore the fragmented diffusion of
   the different types of anti-trafficking laws. Drawing from social
   constructivist approaches, we posit that the differential diffusion
   rates depend on the social construction of the target population and
   policy intention of the law. Using event history analysis, we examine
   the diffusion of 14 types of human trafficking laws throughout the U.S.
   during 2003-2013. We find strong support for our hypotheses and show
   substantial differences in the rates at which prosecution, protection,
   and prevention-related laws diffuse.},

Abstract = {Purpose In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to
   explore how working remotely might impact the superior-subordinate
   relationship. Specifically, this study examines how immediacy explains
   articulated dissent, considers how an individual's attitudes toward
   online communication predicts immediacy and articulated dissent and
   compares these relationships in England, Australia and the USA.
   Design/methodology/approach Three nations were examined: Australia,
   England and the USA (n = 1,776). Surveys included demographic questions
   and the following measures: organizational dissent scale, perceived
   immediacy measure, computer-mediated immediate behaviors measure and
   measure of online communication attitude. Findings The results reveal
   supervisors' computer-mediated immediate behaviors and perceived
   immediacy both positively predict dissent. Some aspects of online
   communication attitudes positively predict computer-mediated immediate
   behaviors and perceived immediacy. In addition, attitudes toward online
   communication positively predict dissent. National culture influences
   some of these relationships; in each case the effects were substantively
   larger for the USA when compared to the other nations. Originality/value
   This study is the first to cross-culturally analyze dissent and
   immediacy. In addition, this study considers the extent to which the
   COVID-19 pandemic influences the superior-subordinate relationship.},

Abstract = {Critical decolonial assessments of International Political Economy (IPE)
   curricula have found a continued dominance of Euro-Western perspectives.
   However, these critical assessments have often been of specific programs
   or courses. In this article, we open the canvas wider in our
   quantitative assessment of privilege and marginalization, by conducting
   an analysis of IPE curricula from universities from around the world as
   well as of one of the most widely used introductory textbooks in the
   field. We find that scholars based outside of the Euro-West are
   marginal, while those based in the Euro-West continue to be dominant -
   in all the assessed course offerings. We also find that female voices
   are marginal, in all locations. Knowledge production systems privilege
   Euro-Western male voices and perspectives, furthering a process of
   systemic cognitive and epistemic injustices. Building upon our analysis
   of teaching and learning content, this article critically reflects on
   the implications of when IPE meets policy, and offers avenues for the
   policy engagement to avoid the same processes of privileging and
   marginalizing, and thereby better situating policy making to avoid
   repeating failures resulting from the identified entrenched biases.},

Title = {Power and Poverty in China: Why Some Counties Perform Better in Poverty
   Alleviation?},

Abstract = {Eliminating poverty is a worldwide problem, but China has recently made
   major achievements in poverty alleviation. By the end of 2020, 832
   nationally designated poor counties had all been lifted out of poverty
   within five years. Why do some poor counties perform better in poverty
   alleviation? This paper leverages a unique county-level dataset of 832
   nationally designated poor counties in China and uses discrete-time
   event history analysis to understand the relationship between political
   institutions and poverty alleviation. We find that the presence of a
   county party committee secretary concurrently holding a higher rank
   position above the county level significantly increases the odds ratio
   of accomplishing poverty alleviation tasks. Previous studies have
   emphasized the important role of empowering people in democracies for
   poverty reduction. This study shows that empowering key governmental
   actors in authoritarian regimes can help them increase their bargaining
   power and improve the performance of poverty alleviation. In addition,
   this paper echoes the research on political institutions of
   authoritarian systems and deepens the understanding of the importance of
   the higher-ranking institution of Chinese officials.},

Title = {(Un)Just transitions and Black dispossession: The disposability of
   Caribbean `refugees' and the political economy of climate justice},

Abstract = {Caribbean populations face increased displacement, dispossession and
   debt burdens due to shocks related to climate change. As the major
   neighbouring power that is the most significant historical contributor
   to global warming, the United States has persistently deflected from
   this responsibility. Instead, its climate plans are weaponized to target
   potential climate refugees who constitute a `national security threat'
   and are faced with risks of premature death. These policies also aim to
   create green capitalist peripheries following racial capitalist logics.
   The paper contends that US climate interventions and policies increase
   the likelihood of Black dispossession within Caribbean societies. These
   policies commit to supporting so-called `left-behind' white communities
   in need of a `just transition', while Caribbean racialized subjects are
   not as equally deserving. To explain this, the paper examines major
   climate policies, in particular the recent Congressional Climate Action
   Plan of the US House of Representatives and President Biden's climate
   proposals. It juxtaposes policy claims against political actions and
   racial capitalist historiography of the United States, especially its
   past treatment of climate refugees from the Caribbean. This analysis
   shows the persistent ways in which US climate policies advance organized
   abandonment and a neocolonial relationship predicated on an unjust
   system of racial capitalism.},

Abstract = {How do international audiences decide whether to support action against
   human rights abusers? Foreign governments often respond to human rights
   abuses with naming and shaming, economic sanctions, or military action.
   Individuals make decisions about whether to support these actions with
   varying levels of information: Allegations might be sparse on details
   because of insufficient resources for reporting or because perpetrators
   conceal their behavior. Using a survey experiment that randomly varies
   the precision of details in human rights allegations, I found that
   respondents are highly supportive of action against human rights abusers
   regardless of the level of detail in reporting. Audiences especially
   support naming and shaming and imposing economic sanctions; they are
   more skeptical about intervening militarily. I found no evidence that
   precise fatality estimates, precise geographic location, or prompt
   reporting make respondents more willing to support these actions.
   Obfuscating details of human rights violations is not enough for
   perpetrators to escape international support for accountability.},

Abstract = {Interest groups cannot advocate on every issue they might consider
   relevant. They must decide what issues to prioritise and which ones to
   leave to one side. In this article, we examine how groups seek to
   balance different internal and external considerations when prioritizing
   issues, and which factors might explain variation in the relative
   strength of these drivers. We integrate data of a survey of national
   interest groups in Australia with findings from interviews with a cross
   section of high-profile groups. While the literature often suggests a
   clash between external political considerations and internal membership
   demands, we find that groups view these drivers as largely compatible.
   Our explanatory analysis points to the policy orientation and insider
   status of the group, its democratic character, and the extent to which
   it faces competition for membership contributions, as important factors
   shaping the relative strength of distinct drivers of internal agenda
   setting.},

Abstract = {Scholars of international relations frequently explore how states
   normalize the use of military force through processes of militarization,
   yet few have analyzed how new information and communication technologies
   impact on these processes. The essays in this forum address this gap,
   and consider the political significance of new technologies, new actors,
   and new practices that shape ``Militarization 2.0{''} and normalize
   political violence in the digital age. The authors in this forum rely,
   to varying degrees, on common militarized tropes and dichotomies (such
   as authenticity, belonging, and (de)humanizing framings) that are key to
   militarization, including those devices that rest on gender,
   race/ethnicity, and heteronormativity. Moving beyond a military-centered
   approach to militarization, the authors' questions cover ministries of
   foreign affairs; the embodied performances of celebrity leaders and
   insurgency groups; arms producers, the military video game industry, and
   private military and security companies; and violence entrepreneurs. The
   forum closes with reflections from Cynthia Enloe.},

Abstract = {State sponsorship of rebel groups is a recurring phenomenon of
   contemporary civil wars. However, these rebellions are often relatively
   unlikely to succeed, even if they are financed by powerful states. Why
   do states support rebel causes with such limited chances of success ?
   This article looks into this paradox by suggesting that states often do
   not seek to help the rebel enterprise, but to weaken a rival country by
   provoking a civil war or intensifying an existing one. The analysis with
   a formal model shows that foreign support to rebel groups can act as a
   counterforce that prohibits institutional conflict resolution. The
   historical relationship between Russians and Turkish Kurds is analyzed
   with these new theoretical insights.},

Abstract = {This study explores the constructions of gender in social media
   narratives regarding Shamima Begum, a British born woman who travelled
   to Syria to join Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Using the
   Twitter hashtag \#ShamimaBegum - developed in response to Begum's
   expressed interest in returning to the United Kingdom to give birth to
   her third child - we employ critical discourse analysis to examine
   social media users' responses to Begum's case across a 3-week period. We
   portray how the vernacular narratives constructing femininity, gender,
   and their relation to terrorist activity are built on the expectation
   that the female actor should express remorse for her actions and is
   judged according to certain perceptions of maternalism, religion, and
   victimhood. We also explore the absence of considered agency in the
   narratives about women engaging in and disengaging from violent
   activities, demonstrating the weight of race, religion, and gender in
   shaping narratives surrounding perceived violent women.},

Abstract = {This article looks at a select number of biographies of Wladyslaw
   Gomulka-an important postwar Polish politician, who because of his long
   presence in politics is often perceived as the de facto Polish postwar
   leader. He served in multiple roles: parliamentary deputy, deputy prime
   minister, minister, member of the Council of State, and the First
   Secretary of the communist party. I argue that for historians who take
   up the task of writing his biography, Gomulka is more than a historical
   figure, and that writing about him allows them to ponder the question of
   agency and historical contingencies, as well as the meaning of the past
   for the present. Not surprisingly, Gomulka's biography serves as a form
   of a meta-commentary on contemporary approach to the Communist history
   and its place in Polish history. The existing biographies contain
   reflections, even if indirectly, on the nature of Communism in Poland,
   not as elements of the past but as aspects of the present that loom over
   the future. By the same token, the lack of interest in Gomulka at
   certain important historical junctures, or a rather selective interest,
   indicates not as much a lack of interest in an important politician, but
   rather a certain skewed interest in Communism-not just its shortcomings,
   but also its potential benefits. The silence gives a certain perception
   of Communism as something pushed to the margins.},

Title = {Becoming Mediterranean: semantic shifts in German asylum and refugee
   discourse},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The European `refugee crisis' has seen the Mediterranean described as: a
   hot spot in need of better governance and border policing; the world's
   deadliest border; and as a humanitarian catastrophe. In Germany, the
   initial default option was to treat the various articulations of crisis
   as localized. Keeping the Mediterranean (and thus the crisis) at arm's
   length was facilitated by the Dublin II regulations stipulating that
   asylum claims would only be processed in the state where they were first
   made. Only in 2015, when large numbers of refugees arrived, the
   Mediterranean was rearticulated as concerning `us' rather than `them'.
   Focusing on German asylum and refugee debates, this article traces such
   semantic shifts to show how, counter-intuitively, becoming Mediterranean
   is enabled by a tacit process of de-Europeanization which instrumentally
   calls for European solutions only when the `crisis' reaches the national
   level.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {501-518},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change now constitutes a major issue in world politics,
   intersecting with and shaping many other political domains, and wider
   patterns of social and economic life. Global climate governance is also
   no longer restricted to multilateral negotiations under the UN Climate
   Convention: it increasingly extends beyond the international climate
   regime to climatize other areas of global politics. This concept of
   climatization points to a powerful but uneven process of extension,
   translation, and social coordination, as climate change becomes the
   frame of reference through which other policy issues and forms of global
   activism are mediated and hierarchized. This special issue brings
   together contributions on both theoretical aspects and empirical cases
   of the climatization process. The introduction sets out a conceptual
   framework to systematize these observations and guide further research.
   First, we identify the preconditions for, and driving forces behind,
   climatization. We then sketch the contours of an emergent `climate
   logic' that reshapes affected domains, and examine the wider
   implications of climatization for global politics. Beyond the climate
   case, we hope this will provide new ways to observe and understand
   contemporary transformations of global society and global governance.},

Abstract = {The Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) has ignited a remarkably active
   research community, one of its main contributions being distinct
   narrative elements-including settings, characters, and plots. Yet, while
   the plot constitutes a core element of narrativity, it has received less
   attention vis-a-vis other narrative components. Existing classifications
   of plots have been proven to possess a great ability to capture
   ``universal{''} policy stories, but not the specific variations of
   different types of policies. This article presents a typology of plots
   by linking their universal and policy-specific themes, thereby
   theorizing from Lowi's seminal typology of regulatory, distributive, and
   redistributive policies. Empirically, it focuses on the political
   communication of Germany's policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Policy narratives were mined from Twitter and from governmental press
   conferences (March-June 2020). The qualitative NPF analysis demonstrates
   that the identified plots-restricting-to-control, liberating-to-promote,
   providing-to-promote, giving-to-give, and giving-to-promote-can grasp
   different regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies as well
   as their variety.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we critically discuss whether digital technology can
   address health inequities. We reflect on the role technology plays in
   support of an economic model that produces increasingly significant
   socio-economic inequalities, both within and across countries. We focus
   in particular on the role that technology plays in deepening the
   historical North/South chasm, briefly analysing economic, political,
   social, and cultural implications. We conclude by emphasizing how
   technology can indeed be a useful tool, but only when it is embedded in
   popular action or policies that redistribute power and resources.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the local government's position in the national
   cybersecurity system. It refers to the status of the local government
   administration in cyberspace, including the duties and responsibilities
   ensuring cybersecurity. In Poland, the local government is considered
   the basic form of decentralisation of public power, as a result of which
   the legislator has entrusted it with a significant portion of public
   duties. The list of such duties also encompasses telecommunication
   responsibilities carried out in cyberspace. In general practice,
   cyberspace is also used to carry out other responsibilities. The local
   government has the most extensive knowledge on the matters concerning a
   given (local or regional) community, referring also to cybersecurity;
   however, the legislator has not awarded this entity with any special
   status. It is merely one of the many entities forming the national
   cybersecurity system. Inter alia, the local government is obliged to
   carry out a range of activities aimed at incident detection, incident
   cause analysis, and corrective actions. It is also expected to ensure
   the appropriate incident management which includes, inter alia, incident
   handling and eliminating incident causes.},

Abstract = {Questions of consciousness pervade the social sciences. Yet, despite
   persistent tendencies to anthropomorphize states, most International
   Relations scholarship implicitly adopts the position that humans are
   conscious and states are not. Recognizing that scholarly disagreement
   over fundamental issues prevents answering definitively whether states
   are truly conscious, I instead demonstrate how scholars of multiple
   dispositions can incorporate a pragmatic notion of state consciousness
   into their theorizing. Drawing on recent work from Eric Schwitzgebel and
   original supplementary arguments, I demonstrate that states are not only
   complex informationally integrated systems with emergent properties, but
   they also exhibit seemingly genuine responses to qualia that are
   irreducible to individuals within them. Though knowing whether states
   possess an emergent `stream' of consciousness indiscernible to their
   inhabitants may not yet be possible, I argue that a pragmatic notion of
   state consciousness can contribute to a more complete understanding of
   state personhood, as well as a revised model of the international system
   useful to multiple important theoretical debates. In the article's final
   section, I apply this model to debate over the levels of analysis at
   which scholarship applies ontological security theory. I suggest the
   possibility of emergent state-level ontological insecurity that need not
   be understood via problematic reduction to individuals.},

Abstract = {How should political leaders be evaluated? This article reviews existing
   approaches and argues that they are insufficiently developed to map the
   more complex policy effects of political leaders, since they tend to
   focus on electoral and broader regime level outcomes. In response, it
   maps out a layered framework based on scientific realism. The layered
   approach argues that analysis should focus on the effects of leaders
   within societal structures, formal political institutions, the framing
   of policy problems as well as policy. The approach requires that we are
   sensitive to the structure and agency relationships between layers when
   identifying where leaders brought about policy and political change, as
   well as the effects on the international system and on other polities.
   It is proposed that the new approach will help to develop a more
   complete and nuanced understanding of the policy effects of leaders that
   will uncover their effects in hidden spaces as well as broader societal
   shifts.},

Abstract = {What determines the consequences of economic sanctions? Is there a
   common explanation for these consequences? This article provides a
   comprehensive review of the fragmented literature focusing on the
   consequences of sanctions. We critically discuss the complex
   relationships between types of sanctions and sanction senders and their
   targets, as well as the structural factors that account for the specific
   consequences of different sanction cases. A discussion on the thematic,
   methodological, and theoretical shortcomings of the existing literature
   on sanction consequences follows. We argue that a ``common approach{''}
   to sanction consequences research should be framed within the framework
   of international interdependence. We also present several nascent trends
   and propose new directions for sanction researchers and other
   disciplines.},

Abstract = {We formulate and test a comprehensive model of participation by
   ministers in sessions of the Council of the EU. Ministers often delegate
   the task of representing their governments at Council sessions to
   deputies or civil servants. However, EU members differ significantly in
   how frequently that occurs. Using new data on ministers' participation
   in all 793 Council sessions in 2004-2014, we find (1) that ministers
   choose to participate more frequently when the salience of the meeting
   agenda is higher and (2) when they represent countries with more
   advanced political-administrative systems. The participation rates
   decrease (3) when national governments face upcoming legislative
   elections. Ministerial participation dramatically increases (4) for a
   country when it holds the Council presidency. Contrary to our
   expectations, participation is not associated with public support for
   the EU. In addition, we find that average ministerial participation rate
   decreased significantly between EP6 and EP7, from around 76\% to around
   64\%.},

Title = {Rethinking Intersections of Crime and Terrorism: Insights from Political

Abstract = {The post-Cold War environment has ushered in an era of threats from
   terrorism, organized crime, and their intersections giving rise to the
   growing literature on the so-called crime-terror nexus. This article
   takes stock of this literature, assesses its accomplishments and
   limitations, and considers ways to deepen it conceptually,
   theoretically, and empirically. To challenge assumptions informing the
   crime-terror studies and suggest avenues for future research, the
   article draws on ideas from the scholarship on political economies of
   violence. These insights are used to probe the (1) non-state actors that
   form the crime-terror nexus, (2) conditions under which the nexus is
   likely to emerge, and (3) varied effects of criminal-terrorist
   intersections. The article emphasizes the ties of criminal and terrorist
   groups to local politics, society, and economy, and relationships of
   competition, rather than cooperation, which often characterize these
   ties. The conditions under which these groups operate cannot be
   understood without considering the role of the state in
   criminal-terrorist constellations. The structure of resource economies
   influences both the preferences of terrorist groups for crime and the
   consequences of terrorist-criminal convergence, which are also mediated
   by state participation in crime.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the impact of the democracy and human rights
   promotion efforts that are supposed to bolster positive attitudes among
   the public abroad and act as a tool to reach hearts and minds. Yet, we
   suggest that a salient in-group versus out-group dichotomy within a
   society could activate a reactive devaluation bias, and hence,
   conditions how individuals perceive and react to foreign actors and
   their policies depending on the source country and its links with in-
   and out-groups within the target state. By employing an original public
   opinion survey from Lebanon, we find that identities, and the level of
   attachment to the identity, affect individuals' attitudes towards human
   rights and democracy promotion efforts. Our results offer important
   policy implications: practitioners should comprehensively reconsider the
   benefits of hearts and minds tools, as pre-existing attitudes are the
   main drivers of how these policies will be evaluated by the public
   abroad.},

Abstract = {The existing literature is unclear about whether private military and
   security companies (PMSCs) are a cause of increased conflict severity,
   or rather are simply hired within more severe conflicts. We argue that
   PMSCs do increase conflict severity, yet this is the result of an
   escalation strategy by states to regain territory from rebels. If
   contracted, PMSCs either substitute for host nation forces, or free up
   such conventional forces to engage in offensive operations. In both
   cases the conflict severity increases substantially. This argument is
   tested with OLS regression using data from 30 weak states from 1990 to
   2007.},

Title = {When opportunity backfires: exploring the implementation of urban
   climate governance alternatives in three major US cities},

Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {116-135},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Around the world, cities have committed themselves to urban climate
   action strategies with targets that go beyond those of their national
   governments. To implement their strategies, cities have embraced a range
   of alternative governance instruments and approaches ('governance
   alternatives'). While they have long been lauded by academics,
   policymakers, and practitioners for doing so, these `frontrunner' cities
   are now being seen to struggle to achieve their ambitious targets when
   using governance alternatives. This article seeks to unpack and better
   understand this struggle by zooming in on the progress made in reducing
   (non-renewable) energy consumption in the built environment of three
   major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York, and San Francisco)
   over the last decade. Informed by interviews and supplementary data, the
   article uncovers a pattern across these three cities. In the early
   2000s, they all set ambitious urban climate change targets, but lacked
   the power and capacity to achieve these. They all used a largely
   uncoordinated `scattergun approach', embracing a broad set of (at best)
   modestly ambitious and (regularly) opportunistic governance alternatives
   to achieve the aims of their ambitious strategies. Whilst this approach
   allowed the cities to obtain quick initial results, the resulting
   fragmented configuration of traditional and alternative governance
   instruments and approaches now hinders them from meeting their targets.},

Title = {How to Explain Major Policy Change Towards Sustainability? Bringing
   Together the Multiple Streams Framework and the Multilevel Perspective

Abstract = {Most efforts at explaining major policy transformation apply a single
   lens to study specific cases. Recent contributions have called for a
   more plural use of theories to facilitate the production of valuable new
   perspectives and research agendas. The German energy transition is a
   good example of such a transformative change. This article takes up the
   call for cross-fertilization of theories, using two complementary lenses
   to explain the German energy transition: (i) applying the multiple
   streams framework (MSF) demonstrates how political factors and public
   opinion have opened a ``policy window{''} for reform from a political
   dimension. (ii) The multilevel perspective on sustainability transitions
   (MLP) sheds more light on the importance technological innovation for
   transformation processes. Exemplified through the German energy
   transition, we highlight limitations of both lenses, as well as the
   value of using multiple lenses to analyze specific cases of major policy
   change. The MSF highlights the role of agency and power relations. The
   MLP demonstrates how niche-technologies uproot the incumbent regime.
   Employing both lenses together offers insights as to how major policy
   change goes beyond single instances of decision-making but is the
   product of a larger trajectory of path-dependence that emerges from the
   interplay of socio-technical and political dynamics.},

Abstract = {Former US President Donald Trump has caused international controversies
   on Twitter, fuelling conflict and spreading misinformation up until the
   suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account in January 2021. This paper
   shows that this Twitter undiplomacy furthered what Bauman called `liquid
   modernity'. For Bauman, new forms of communitarianism appear in liquid
   times, changing the way politics is conducted and how communities engage
   with strangers. We contend that Trump's use of Twitter has been a
   symptom of and an accelerating force in this transformation. Both the
   form-short aggressive messages-and the content-based on fear of
   strangers-of his messages accentuated the liquidification of modern
   society, the banalization of international politics and the uncivil
   treatment of strangers. This analysis advances critical diplomatic
   studies, the study of digital politics and International Relations on
   two levels: it clarifies the nature of the challenges that both Trump
   and Twitter posed to traditional diplomatic norms and practice; it
   builds understanding on how Twitter transforms the international public
   square, and how we might then try to make sense of diplomatic practice
   in the modern digital era. The case of Trump's engagement with the UK in
   2017 is taken as an illustration.},

Abstract = {Drawing from studies on national human rights institutions anchored in
   accountability perceptions, this article examines the role of the
   Egyptian National Council for Human Rights as a producer of a human
   rights discourse and as a platform for human rights advocacy in the
   fluctuating political environment created by the country's 2011
   revolution. Analyzing the council's discourse as represented in its
   reports, recommendations, and media presence, it is argued that the
   council has failed to disengage from its past and to provide a
   discursive public space for the government and society to communicate,
   negotiate, and contest human rights violations. The experience of the
   council in Egypt indicates that the effectiveness of national
   institutions for human rights is not merely a product of their mandate
   and powers but is influenced significantly by the local context, which
   can lead them to restrict their discourse and turn them into a force
   normalizing human rights violations.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity is becoming an increasing hurdle for digital trade. The
   governance of cybersecurity in the global digital trade system is a
   bottom-up approach, where governments are implementing fragmental and
   inconsistent trade policies and forming different models of
   public-private co-governance. Based on network-governance theory,
   information security behavior theory, and international risk theory, we
   develop a conceptual model to investigate how various factors drive
   cybersecurity governance practices. Using Huawei's 5G as an example,
   this study explores how different governments-the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and India-act on the cybersecurity
   concerns from Huawei's 5G. The comparative analysis demonstrates how
   balancing different factors drive governments' actions and discuss what
   international corporations like Huawei can do to align their digital
   trade system strategies. This research guides international firms to
   participate in cybersecurity governance constructions within the digital
   trade system.},

Abstract = {Research on symbolic representation suggests that citizen-state
   interactions might benefit from public organizations'
   representativeness. Recent experiments on symbolic gender representation
   provide contradictory findings regarding the influence on citizens'
   co-production intentions. This study conducts a wide replication based
   on new data to reexamine the positive impact of symbolic gender
   representation identified by Riccucci et al. (2016, Public
   Administration Review, 76(1), pp. 121-130). The applied survey
   experiment closely resembles the original design aspects. The experiment
   is set in criminal justice policy, a policy field featuring
   co-production of core public services such as prisoner rehabilitation.
   The results do not confirm a positive effect of symbolic gender
   representation on willingness to co-produce. Instead, several arguments
   point to citizens' perceptions of uncertainty related to the
   co-production context and procedures as a boundary condition for the
   effects of symbolic gender representation.},

Abstract = {Previous research shows that Differentiated Integration (DI) in areas of
   core state powers works according to a postfunctional logic, in response
   to concerns about national autonomy and sovereignty. Against this
   backdrop, scholars usually expect that the policies and practices
   ensuing from formal DI are equally differentiated. This article presents
   theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. It argues that,
   while postfunctionalism explains the emergence of formal DI, its
   practical consequences are driven by functional pressures. The
   interdependencies produced by the integration process create functional
   incentives for states with opt-outs to work towards `reintegration' by
   converging with EU policies. The result of this process is a decoupling
   between differentiated rules and similar practices. The plausibility of
   this argument is tested by applying process tracing techniques to the
   case of Denmark in Justice and Home Affairs.},

Abstract = {While women are underrepresented in politics, recent improvements in
   women's representation in legislative and executive bodies have spurred
   academic interest in the effects of electing women on a wide array of
   outcomes. Effects on bureaucracies, however, have received less
   attention. Do women mayors reform local bureaucracies differently than
   their men counterparts? We take advantage of rich administrative data
   from Chile to explore the effects of having a woman mayor on the size
   and gender composition of municipal bureaucracies. Using a regression
   discontinuity design in close electoral races, we find that women mayors
   reduce the size of local bureaucracies while simultaneously increasing
   the share of women public employees. Our findings thus show that women
   mayors' approach to bureaucratic reform once in office differs from that
   of their men counterparts, and contribute to existing research on the
   consequences of electing women.},

Abstract = {Settler colonial theory has made a hugely significant contribution to
   the theorisation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but there is a
   danger that its application to the specific practice of security
   coordination could simply render the practice as an instrument of
   settler colonial rule. In this article, we would like to propose the
   important qualification that Coordination is, in practice, deeply
   conflicted and subject to multiple internal pressures, which extend from
   elites to public opinion. In accepting that Coordination can be
   appropriately viewed through a settler colonial lens, we would like to
   argue that it can also be viewed from `below', and as an object of
   domestic political struggle that is implicated in legitimisation
   processes. Coordination is therefore simultaneously renounced and
   retained as part of the survival strategy of assorted elite groups. In
   order to demonstrate this, we reference Elite theory, interviews and
   online materials. Moreover, internal Palestinian divides suggest that
   opposition is more incomplete, partial and reactive within the
   neoliberal and settler colonial context.},

Abstract = {Political community in complex modern societies confronts abiding
   competition among different normative understandings and commitments
   that render agreement difficult on urgent issues of bioethics and
   biotechnologies. Disagreement follows in part from essentialist
   understandings of human nature as well as from essentialist
   understandings of human rights. Broad agreement could be facilitated by
   a ``political{''} and naturalistic understanding of both human nature
   and human rights. Human nature could be construed politically as the
   self-understanding of the human species in response to the question: To
   what kind of human nature should we humans aspire? Such construal leads
   to a notion of a human nature oriented on human rights. This notion
   offers a moral standard in current debates on the legal regulation of
   biotechnological interventions into the human genome. That standard is
   capable of wide embrace by participants.},

Abstract = {Individual attitudes towards immigration are powerfully driven by ethnic
   context, that is, size of foreign-born population. We advance the
   literature by examining how the change (growth) in foreign-born
   population, in addition to its size (level), is related to two distinct
   outcomes: natives' views on legal and unauthorized immigration. By
   analysing a probability US sample, we find that an increase in the
   state-level immigration population is positively related to Americans'
   approval of a policy aimed at containing the flow of undocumented
   immigrants. The proportion of immigrants in a state, however, is not a
   significant predictor of support for such restrictive policy. With
   respect to legal immigration, neither the amount of recent change in,
   nor the size of, the immigration population matters. Our study provides
   strong evidence for contextual effects: net of compositional factors, a
   dynamic change in foreign-born population has an independent impact on
   how Americans view unauthorized, but not legal, immigration.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explain how a segment Kurdish nationalists in Syria
   imitates and substitutes the Westphalian conception of sovereign
   statehood in Syria. It argues that the Partiya Yekitiya Democrat (PYD-an
   offshoot of the PKK in Syria) establishes its rule both by mimicking and
   substituting modern tools of state-making. The study identifies a
   three-pronged political-military strategy used at the local, regional
   and international levels. It shows that facing existential challenges
   from local non-state competitors and regional predatory states, the
   PYD's main approach has been mimicking the modern state where possible
   and substituting the lack of legitimate rule and sovereignty with a set
   of political and global support networks. The study lastly shows how the
   PYD's logic in mimicking the modern state practices is ultimately
   dependent on the support particularly from great powers such as the USA
   and reactions from the regional powers such as Turkey. Overall, the
   study examines how the fluctuations in the logic of the PYD stems from
   its mimicry and substitution of the modern state conduct such as
   survival strategies, foreign practices and identity politics that
   interweave and cut across the conventional state, sovereignty,
   geopolitics and territoriality.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {I argue that insulation via managerial coordination is a key element in
   any explanation about the formation of political regions among states.
   The key role it plays is as a tool for the maintenance of intra-regional
   pacific relations in the face of diffusion and contagion processes,
   resulting from continued security linkages with excluded extra-regional
   states. In order to explore these dynamics, I propose a new
   reconceptualization of the concept of managerial coordination based on
   the basic framework concept mapping tool. This leads to clarity about
   what managerial coordination does as a dimension of insulation. It also
   necessitates a revamp of the scale of interstate managerial coordination
   as a measuring instrument of the intensity of collective intentionality
   toward insulation among the members of a region. I then map the region
   concept of durable security complex (DSC) as the scope for the enactment
   of managerial coordination, based on a review of existing region
   concepts in the new regionalist literature. I then conduct an
   ideographic proof-of-concept exercise on three DSCs in the presence or
   absence of managerial coordination. These are the Scandinavian states,
   the South Asian regional security complex, and the South American
   Norther Tier local hierarchy. The exercise provides indicators for a
   number of theoretical propositions worthy of future evaluation.},

Title = {State Capacity and Innovation Policy Performance: A Comparative Study on

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {427-453},

Abstract = {This study analyzes state capacity by comparing two types of innovation
   policies in China and estimating its impacts on policy performance.
   State capacity is defined as the extent to which the state can realize
   its objectives in policy and it is determined by government
   professionalism and penetration into industrial activities. Due to both
   the lack of channels to grasp information regarding complicated
   innovation processes and professional personnel capable of understanding
   such information, the state capacity demonstrated in these policies is
   low. The government relies more on indicators of innovation quantity
   rather than those of innovation quality as criteria for identifying
   innovation. This leads to poor policy performances in which grantees
   tend to meet only the qualitative requirements of the policies, namely
   increasing the number of patents, rather than engaging in genuine
   innovation and pursuing the essential objective of the policies.
   Therefore, even with market-oriented reform, transitional economies like
   China still need to strengthen state building for achieving policy
   objectives.},

Abstract = {How effective are different political institutions, policy-making
   processes and policies when it comes to mediating, mitigating and
   managing vertical and horizontal political tensions caused by disruptive
   societal challenges and political polarization? The present crisis for
   liberal democracy places this question high on the research agenda. A
   concept of political robustness is helpful for identifying the
   properties of political systems with a strong capacity for coping with
   political instability and conflict. This article defines political
   robustness, draws the contours of a conceptual framework for analysis of
   the political robustness of political systems and applies it
   illustratively to the political robustness of liberal democracies. We
   propose that the robustness of a political system depends on how much
   those who voice political demands-which differs greatly over time and
   between regimes-are involved in aggregating and integrating political
   demands into binding decisions.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate on terrorism designation and
   proscription by providing information and analysis on the
   ``double-track{''} system of terrorism designation and proscription in
   China. It calls for greater attention to China's terrorism proscription
   system as China has increased its engagement in international affairs
   and became more willing and capable of international cooperation in
   counterterrorism. The case of China provides important insights from a
   non-Western perspective into how states function in dealing with the
   challenge terrorism poses. In particular, it examines China's efforts in
   balancing effective counterterrorism and the accountability of the
   government. Adopting an interpretivist approach based on primarily
   Chinese-language documents, it traces the development of China's
   proscription regime since 2003 to illustrate its evolution from ad-hoc
   list-making to a more complicated system. Because of the difficulties in
   collecting information and presenting it as admissible evidence in
   court, like many other countries, China relies on the executive for
   terrorism designation and proscription. While the workings of China's
   proscription system demonstrates authoritarian characteristics, the
   development of its proscription regime reveals how it sought to respond
   to the concerns about the legitimacy of its counterterrorism practice,
   for example, on issues of due process and presumption of innocence.},

Abstract = {Substantial literature demonstrates that flexible labor market
   institutions promote entrepreneurial activity. We re-evaluate this
   finding by considering the complementarity between institutions as
   advocated by the varieties of capitalism literature. We study the
   relevance of labor market regulations, wage-setting institutions and
   social security, and their complementarity for different types of
   entrepreneurial activity in 19 European countries and the USA. Two
   findings stand out. First, the four distinct bundles of labor market
   institutions characterizing Europe support different forms of
   entrepreneurial activity, and that innovative entrepreneurial activity
   also exists in less-flexible and -regulated labor market arrangements.
   Second, the relationships between single labor market institutions and
   entrepreneurial activity vary across the four institutional
   constellations. Therefore, to promote entrepreneurship in Europe, there
   is a need for tailored reform strategies that consider the diversity of
   the institutional constellations.},

Abstract = {Nothing has done more to shake confidence in the World Trade
   Organization, and create uncertainty in rules-based international trade,
   than the demise of the WTO's Appellate Body (AB). Given the design of
   the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), in the absence of a
   functioning Appellate Body, members cannot have confidence in the
   finality or enforceability of panel rulings. Thus, a fundamental premise
   of the legal commitments under WTO treaties is undermined. The collapse
   of the AB is due to a decision of the Trump Administration
   systematically to block new appointments to fill vacancies. This move,
   unprecedented in US trade policy in the WTO era, and not supported by
   any other WTO member, has completely failed as means of pressing the
   Administration's complaints about `judicial overreach' in the Appellate
   Body. This single Trump decision can easily be reversed by the Biden
   Administration stating that it is prepared to participate in good faith
   in a new process for selecting AB members. In this article, I suggest
   how the Appellate Body appointment process might go forward in the
   current context, addressing concerns of the US and some others about the
   past performance of the AB.},

Abstract = {The roots of ethical relativism in philosophy of liberalism is in the
   growing radicalness of anthropocentrism being characteristic of modern
   thinking. The scientific intellect applying itself to external objective
   phenomena and based on a very narrow empiricist-analytical conception of
   science contains man's desire for emancipation. The central question of
   liberalism is the fundamental emphasis on individualism and liberty. In
   such society is much more urgent to create the code of ethics in modern
   society in very differente level of society and modern life.
   Philosophical foundation of code of ethics in local Self-Government and
   management at all levels of social and personal life is more urgent and
   necessary than ever, if we want to preserve the basic dignity of human
   life, the fact that man respects himself, keeps his word, does not
   manipulate others nor allows being manipulated, keeps his personal
   freedom and self-confidence, self-respect and integrity. In Slovenia,
   management is responsible for preparation and fair presentation of
   financial statements in accordance with accounting standards, and within
   the requirements of the Slovenian Companies Act and in accordance with
   the code of ethics.},

Abstract = {Hierarchy in international relations has often been understood as an
   arrangement with a single dominant state controlling aspects of the
   subordinate actor's sovereignty. While such arrangements play an
   important role in structuring international politics, it does not
   exhaust the forms that hierarchy can take. Very often hierarchies have
   developed where multiple states jointly claim control of the same
   sovereign rights of the subordinate state. This paper introduces a new
   conceptualization of hierarchy where the sovereign rights of the
   subordinate state are understood as a resource that can be controlled by
   multiple dominant states. As with other resources, different types of
   property regimes can be developed to organize access and extraction of
   sovereignty, such as common property resources regimes. Finally, an
   explanation of common-pool hierarchy regimes is developed and explored
   using two case studies: European imperialism in the nineteenth-century
   China and the scramble for Africa.},

Abstract = {While most scholars analyze European Union politicization as a process
   that shapes public opinion, little attention has been paid to political
   strategies. In this article, I focus on politicization as an outcome of
   political work, the practice of carving out a space for agency in an
   environment that is constrained by institutional rules and
   intergovernmental power structures. Through an ethnographic analysis of
   the Juncker Commission's implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact
   in Italy, Spain, and Portugal in 2015-2017, I make three arguments.
   First, the Commission succeeded in redefining the rules of the Pact,
   without however challenging them. Second, this political work was
   enabled by conservative and social-democrat actors who neutralized each
   other. Third, political work contributed to a politicization of the
   Pact. The ethnographic narrative reveals two practices of politicization
   at play: (1) the purposeful exercise of political discretion vis-a-vis
   institutional rules; (2) the embrace of ideological and partisan
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Policymakers and peacebuilding research often focus on rebel groups when
   studying demobilization and integration processes, but post-war
   governments must also manage the non-state militias that helped them
   gain or maintain power. Why do some post-war governments disintegrate
   their militia allies, while others integrate them into the military? We
   argue that when a salient ethnic difference exists between the (new)
   ruling elite and an allied militia, a process of mutual uncertainty in
   the post-war period will incentivize governments to disintegrate the
   group. However, governments will be most likely to integrate their
   militias when the military has sufficient coercive capabilities but few
   organizational hindrances to re-organizing. Using new data on the
   post-war fates of victorious militias across all civil conflicts from
   1989 to 2014, we find robust support for these claims. The results
   suggest that a government's optimal militia management strategy is
   shaped by both social and organizational constraints during the post-war
   period.},

Title = {The UK Government's COVID-19 Policy: What Does ``Guided by the
   Science{''} Mean in Practice?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {UK government ministers state that their COVID-19 policy is ``guided by
   the science.{''} In practice they mean ``our scientists,{''} and initial
   UK government policy was highly consistent with that advice. Ministers
   formed strong relationships with key scientific advisors, relied on
   evidence from their Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE),
   and ignored or excluded many other sources. I explore two types of
   lesson from this experience. First, UK studies of interest groups help
   explain the politics of expert advice. They show that the
   minister-adviser relationship is conditional on the ways in which the UK
   government assigns status to particular sources of science advice, and
   the willingness of those advisers to follow the ``rules of the game,{''}
   within a wider political and policymaking context. Second, documentary
   analysis of SAGE minutes and meeting papers, and analysis of oral
   evidence to key House of Commons committees, shows high consistency
   between SAGE advice and UK government policy in the run up to lockdown.
   Ministers relied on their advisers to define the policy problem and
   identify feasible solutions throughout this period, while their advisors
   supported government policy and the right of ministers to make it. This
   new experience reflects and reinforces longstanding evidence from policy
   community studies: some experts remain core insiders if they advise on
   policies that they do not necessarily support, while outsiders have the
   freedom to criticize the policy they were unable to influence.},

Abstract = {In May 2017, Operation Temperer - the deployment of British military
   personnel in support of the police following a terrorist attack or the
   threat of such an attack - was activated for the first time. The
   deployment of uniformed armed personnel as a core element of the U.K.'s
   CT capability represents a significant and, in the authors view, welcome
   shift in how successive administrations have utilized aspects of state
   power in response to a terrorist threat or incident. Little academic
   work has been devoted to explaining how and why this change occurred,
   with the military moving from reluctant participants in domestic CT
   missions, to playing a central (and public) role in providing capacity
   for domestic security, as witnessed under Operation Temperer. This
   article charts the evolution of greater military involvement in domestic
   counter-terrorism missions after 9/11, revealing that a decade of policy
   paralysis was finally broken by the combination of terrorist events in
   Paris in January 2015, and the intervention of a forward leaning prime
   minister overcoming institutional reluctance on the part of the Ministry
   of Defence and other government departments to put British troops on
   British streets.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice has become a key component of the larger
   peacebuilding project. State responsibility for wrongful acts has been
   recognised; it is expected that justice, truth, reparations, and
   guarantees of non-repetition will be addressed after conflict or
   political unrest. However, governments routinely flout these
   responsibilities, because either their resources are depleted, or they
   are reluctant to enact potentially disadvantageous policies. In these
   cases, other actors - both global and local, state and non-state - step
   in to fill the resulting implementation gap, assuming, and oftentimes
   absolving, the state of its obligations. The contributions to this
   special issue on Cambodia, Colombia, Solomon Islands, South Korea,
   Tunisia, and Uganda dissect the ethical, normative, and political
   implications of letting the state off the hook - or, alternatively, how
   local actions are getting it on the hook - and point to dilemmas of
   scaling and the legitimacy of actors, timing and sequencing, and
   navigating a hostile political environment.},

Abstract = {The hydraulic fracturing (fracking) boom has outpaced both our
   understanding of its potential impacts on human health and the
   environment, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks in place to
   govern it. We conducted interviews in Pennsylvania with individuals
   living in communities affected by fracking to examine how residents
   perceive the laws and regulations that are in place to protect them from
   its risks. We found that residents felt that they lacked access to
   sufficiently comprehensive and comprehensible information about the
   potential risks that fracking poses. We then drew from scholarship on
   the use of information disclosure as a regulatory tool to discuss the
   need for increased information transparency in the fracking context, and
   proposed several policy interventions that could ease the information
   asymmetry experienced by residents in these communities.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intellectual puzzle of whether the domestic
   political instability associated with the Arab Spring is responsible for
   a surge in global terrorism that peaked in 2014. A series of negative
   binomial regressions demonstrate strong support for an ``escalation
   effect{''}: more severe forms of domestic political instability, most
   notably government purges and riots, breed greater levels of terrorism,
   although the most severe form of domestic political
   instability-revolution-does not. We also find that specific types of
   domestic political instability affect terrorism levels differently
   depending on geographical region and regime type (i.e., democracy versus
   dictatorship).},

Abstract = {Recent work on consultants and academics in public policy has
   highlighted their transformational role. The paper traces how, in the
   absence of an explicit government strategy, external advisors establish
   different organizational arrangements to build Behavioral Insights in
   public agencies as a new form of administrative expertise. This
   variation shows the importance of the politico-administrative context
   within which external advisors exert influence. The focus on
   professional expertise adds to existing understandings of ideational
   compatibility in contemporary policy advisory systems. Inspired by the
   sociology of professions, expertise is conceptualized as professionally
   constructed sets of diagnosis, inference, and treatment. The paper
   compares four Danish governmental agencies since 2010, revealing the
   central roles external advisors play in facilitating new policy ideas
   and diffusing new forms of expertise. This has implications for how we
   think of administrative expertise in contemporary bureaucracies, and the
   role of external advisors in fostering new forms of expertise.},

Title = {Anti-gambling policies: framing morality policy in Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {137-160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent research on morality policy has focused on policy change,
   morality framing and the presence of favourable cultural opportunity
   structures (COSs). The resulting literature describing various aspects
   of morality policy has failed to discuss the impact of multilevel
   dynamic in this field. This contribution examines gambling policy in
   Italy, applying a multilevel approach to detect the presence of
   favourable COSs, and whether policymakers frame policies morally. Italy
   offers a particularly fertile field for the study of morality policy,
   featuring a liberal national approach versus local restrictive policy.
   By applying a methodology based on semistructured interviews and
   secondary sources, we examine the national and local political spheres,
   demonstrating that morality framing, when detected, is more likely to be
   found at the local level where the influence of experts and interest
   groups on legislators may result in the transformation of a health
   policy based on paternalistic considerations.},

Abstract = {The impact of Donald Trump's personality and leadership style on u.s.
   foreign policy was the subject of much speculation upon his arrival at
   the White House. Will this inexperienced president's unorthodox methods
   irrevocably transform foreign policy ? Are the institutional and
   structural constraints of the American society and the international
   system would hinder the announced revolution ? After four years of a
   tumultuous presidency, we find that Donald Trump has put in place a
   histrionic foreign policy that acted on three levels, as a magnifying
   mirror of the ambiguities, hesitations, and errors of American foreign
   policy since September 11, 2001. First, a break in tone but a
   substantive continuity that sent contradictory messages, both within the
   national security apparatus and in the world, undermining the
   credibility of the United States; second, a double crisis - of American
   identity and of the world order - that impeded compromises; third, a
   management of decline focused on both economic competition and political
   and military disengagement that contributed to international instability
   and the weakening of American leadership. In this issue, authors analyze
   these elements of Trump's foreign policy through the prism of various
   regional and transnational issues.},

Abstract = {The roles of government and the other institutions of society are
   analyzed with respect to the provision of goods and services. Goods and
   services are classified, according to the principles of political
   economy, using the two defined variables: consumption and exclusion.
   This leads to four kinds of goods: individual goods, toll goods,
   common-pool goods, and collective goods. The goods can be provided by
   four different institutions: government, the family, civil society, and
   the market. Each of these institutions has shortcomings and is subject
   to failures. Moreover, not all of the four kinds of goods can be
   supplied by each of the four institutions. The characteristics of the
   goods and of the supplying institutions result in a table showing which
   types of goods can be provided by which of the four institutions. So,
   who should do what? How should the responsibility for providing goods
   and services be allocated between government and the three private
   institutions of society? What kinds of collaboration-including
   privatization-can be applied to achieve a better functioning society?
   The discussion is summarized in a decision tree that shows how one can
   consider the different kinds of goods, the different institutions, and
   the collaboration needed for a better allocation of these necessary
   societal activities.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the thus far unnoticed ``intellectual origin{''}
   of the so-called Prague Spring. It summarizes tenets of behavioral
   revolution in the field of social sciences and documents its
   considerable influence on Czechoslovak scholars. From the mid-1960s,
   behavioral reasoning coexisted with other (mutually conflicting)
   perspectives. Literature on Czechoslovak reform has given evidence of
   the impact of Marxian revisionism, the Frankfurt school, and theories of
   industrial societies. This article stresses the significance of
   behavioral meta-theory not only in academia but also in the political
   arena. However, the process of normalization after 1968/1969 signified
   the inevitable end for this paradigm.},

Abstract = {Advancing the literature on status in world politics, this article
   argues that Brexit generated status insecurity for the UK. In order to
   deal with the consequences of the shock represented by Brexit, the UK
   sought to address status insecurity in two ways. Firstly, it pursued
   more modes of engagement with European security simultaneously. It
   continued to play a leadership role in NATO, and it deepened bilateral
   cooperation with individual European countries. Secondly, it also
   articulated its willingness to be treated differently to any other third
   party by advancing `Global Britain' as a framework for post-Brexit
   foreign policy, opening up space for involvement in EU defence
   initiatives. Nevertheless, this article argues that the UK faces the
   challenge of having to work more for less in the short term, without
   recognition by the EU of a status beyond third party for the UK. The
   implications of this are discussed.},

Abstract = {The international governance of asylum requires states to cooperate to
   provide the public good of humanitarian protection. The need to
   establish responsibility-sharing resembles the collective action problem
   in climate change mitigation. While there is a general consensus on the
   differentiation of state responsibilities in most environmental
   agreements, states continuously fail to progress on
   responsibility-sharing in asylum governance. In this article, we compare
   the collective action challenges in asylum to those in climate
   governance and identify the similarities and differences in their
   characteristics as public goods. We then discuss the principle of
   ``common but differentiated responsibilities{''} that guides global
   climate change mitigation and demonstrate how equity principles can be
   applied to differentiate state responsibilities in the context of
   humanitarian protection. The subsequent analysis of recent efforts to
   establish effective responsibility-sharing reveals the trade-offs
   involved in the design of a responsibility allocation mechanism for
   refugee protection. Our findings provide important lessons for the
   prospects and limits of responsibility-sharing in asylum governance.},

Abstract = {Research on rebel behavior during conflicts has traditionally focused on
   the use of violent tactics. However, evidence from several intrastate
   wars suggests that armed groups also occasionally employ general
   strikes-a method of civil resistance that has typically been associated
   with nonviolent groups. But when do rebels resort to general strikes? I
   argue that these tactics have a particular function which can offset
   potential risks for rebels after they have suffered losses in previous
   battles: Through general strikes, rebels signal sustained authority to
   the local population. The argument is tested for districts in Eastern
   India using newly compiled, disaggregated data on contentious action
   during the Maoist conflict. The paper contributes to a burgeoning
   literature on wartime civilian activism in two ways: First, it shows
   that armed groups themselves rely situationally on civilian
   mobilization. Second, it investigates the effect of conditions
   endogenous to the conflict on these tactical choices.},

Abstract = {Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, hybrid warfare has become a
   widely used yet ambiguous term to describe Russia's hostile activities.
   In academic publications and policy documents, there have been a
   plethora of different definitions and concepts to make sense of hybrid
   warfare. This article takes a bottom-up approach and analyzes the
   discourse of political and military representatives in the United
   Kingdom to explore how they understand hybrid warfare by Russia and what
   the implications are for defense policy. Using qualitative content
   analysis with quantitative aspects, the results show not only a range of
   different terms used to describe Russia's hostile activities, but also
   that the discussed topics do not reflect one particular definition of
   hybrid warfare. The analysis further reveals that representatives
   highlight non-military aspects of hybrid warfare over the military ones
   and consider the role of defense policy dependent on the nature of a
   particular hybrid threat.},

Abstract = {Scholars have pinpointed that women's underrepresentation in peacemaking
   results in gendered outcomes that do not address women's needs and
   interests. Despite recent increased representation at the negotiating
   table, women still have a limited influence on peacemaking outcomes. We
   propose that differences in female and male speeches reflected in the
   gendered patterns in discourse during peacemaking explain how women's
   influence is curtailed. We examine women's speaking behavior in
   transitional justice debates in the post-conflict Balkans. Applying
   multimethod quantitative text analysis to over half a million words in
   multiple languages, we analyze structural and thematic speech patterns.
   We find that men's domination of turn-taking and the absence of topics
   reflecting women's needs and interests lead to a gendered outcome. The
   sequences of men talking after men are longer than those of women
   talking after women, which restricts women's deliberative space and
   opportunities to develop and sustain arguments that reflect their
   concerns. We find no evidence that women's limited influence is driven
   by lower deliberative quality of their speeches. This study of gendered
   dynamics at the microlevel of discourse identifies a novel dimension of
   male domination during peacemaking.},

Abstract = {Does partisan alignment affect sub-national political units'
   performance? When testing for a partisan alignment effect, local
   authority planning processes represent a `hard case'. Formally,
   decision-making processes are insulated against political
   considerations, and there is a mis-match between national party
   commitments to expand house-building on the one hand, and pressure on
   local councillors from residents opposing new developments on the other.
   I find that, in general, partisan alignment brings an increased
   propensity to approve large residential planning applications. This
   suggests councillors' willingness to `take one for the team' by
   prioritising national over local interests. Consistent with `party
   politics of housing' insights, inter-party variation sees an altered
   effect in left-wing constellations, which display lowered approval
   propensities. In addition to these substantive extensions to scholarship
   on partisan alignment effects, the insights presented into the drivers
   of variation in local authority planning outcomes contribute to the
   pressing tasks of understanding and addressing the chronic under-supply
   of new housing within the English housing system.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a previously unexplored type of gaming of
   performance data, collaborative gaming, where the performance
   measurement system incentivizes the executive and an agency to game
   collaboratively. The paper shows how overlapping incentives between
   government departments and agencies to present successful implementation
   of programs can drive collaboration to modify performance targets and/or
   performance measurements. The argument is illustrated by two brief case
   studies of collaboration between the Swedish Department of Employment
   and the Swedish Public Employment Service in the implementation of
   labor-market programs.},

Abstract = {This article explores the nature and the desirability of private sector
   contribution to national strategies of cyber deterrence. The article
   starts by developing a variation of the concept of cyber deterrence,
   called RCDC deterrence, which is simultaneously restrictive,
   comprehensive, dynamic, and complemental. Second, it applies RCDC
   deterrence to identify and analyze specific areas of cyber deterrence
   that can benefit the most from private sector contribution. Third, the
   article cautions about the potential security, legal, and moral issues
   that could arise from such private contributions. Instead of offering
   definitive answers on these complex issues, the article ends by
   suggesting avenues for further research. The ultimate objective is to
   assist decision-makers in designing policies and regulations aimed at
   maximizing the benefits of public-private cooperation in cyber
   deterrence while mitigating its potential downsides.},

Abstract = {The 2015 civil war in Yemen has given rise to an assortment of local
   fiefdoms that contest the power and authority of the internationally
   recognized government. Some of them resemble proto-states and exert a
   variety of sovereign functions, such as providing security and services.
   The Houthis have the most developed proto-state, but similar entities
   exist in areas, which are nominally under government's control. This
   article claims that the rise of parallel sovereignties across Yemen stem
   from the legacy of neo-patrimonialism and hybrid security and political
   orders dating back to Saleh rule, but their specific character and the
   extensive fragmentation of the anti-Houthi camp are the result of the
   particularities of the 2015 external intervention. Contrary to Houthis,
   who receive limited and focused support from Iran, the anti-Houthi camp
   is `blessed' with several regional supporters that hold divergent
   interests and funnel support to their preferred local allies, leading to
   fragmentation and the multiplication of local fiefdoms.},

Abstract = {The European refugee crisis has been communicated visually through
   images such as those of Alan Kurdi lying dead on the beach, by body bags
   on the harbor front of Lampedusa, by people walking through Europe and
   by border guards and fences. This article examines the broader visual
   environment within which EU policy-making took place from October 2013
   to October 2015. It identifies `tragedy' as the key term used by the EU
   to explain its actions and decisions and points out that discourses of
   humanitarianism and border control were both in place. The article
   provides a theoretical account of how humanitarianism and border control
   might be visualized by news photography. Adopting a multi-method design
   and analyzing a dataset of more than 1000 photos, the article presents a
   visual discourse analysis of five generic iconic motifs and a
   quantitative visual content analysis of shifts and continuity across
   four moments in time. The article connects these visual analyses to the
   policies and discourses of the EU holding that the ambiguity of the EU's
   discourse was mirrored by the wider visual environment.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {448-465},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Whereas early scholarship depicted minority cabinets as weak recent
   findings demonstrate how various factors contribute to effective
   minority governance. Nevertheless, the role of prime ministers (PMs) was
   largely ignored in the performance of these cabinets. The paper
   addresses this problem by comparing Hungary's only two minority
   governments in an MSSD framework. Combining a qualitative review with a
   quantitative analysis of voting patterns in Parliament, it argues that
   differences in aforementioned cabinets' policy performance can be traced
   back to contrasting ideological position of PMs and subsequent
   ideological moderation. These findings have important implications for
   minority governments in majoritarian and polarised contexts.},

Abstract = {The article compares parties' candidate selection strategies and voters'
   electoral response to female candidates in Hungary. The analysis covers
   five elections (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018) that is a period which
   offers broad variation in partisan, institutional, and even in systemic
   terms amongst the static and low level of descriptive female
   representation. Although parties continue to deprivilege female
   candidates they do it in varying manners and degrees. The article will
   broaden the demand aspect of the demand and supply model placing
   parties' candidate selection in a complex institutional context. The
   article also demonstrates stability in voters' electoral gender
   response, namely non-discriminatory behaviour.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the 2030
   Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the scope to shift the world on
   to a resilient path focused on promoting sustainable development leaving
   no one behind. Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, academic research
   on the topic has blossomed. However, most academic research has focused
   on specific topics within the Agenda, with a bias towards the 17
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) settled on it. The aim of this
   study is to contribute to the comprehension and delimitation of the 2030
   Agenda as a field of study. To do so, we draw upon bibliometric
   techniques to undertake a sound analysis of the academic and thematic
   basis of the discipline, by analyzing the academic research on the
   Agenda to date, composed by 656 research papers. The results highlight
   the transdisciplinary nature of the 2030 Agenda, which has gathered
   attention from a wide range of disciplines and authors, especially in
   the sustainability and green sciences. At the same time, it points out
   some weaknesses in the development of a deeper comprehension of the 2030
   Agenda from disciplines such as political and international sciences,
   which could hinder its governance, efficacy and impact.},

Abstract = {China's open embracing of the age of artificial intelligence (AI) has
   attracted considerable academic and media attention. Many argue that
   China has taken advantage of its national approach to contest for AI
   supremacy and geopolitical dominance. The relevant analyses assume
   China's AI plans as being Beijing's coherent top-down geopolitically
   driven national strategy, reflecting Chinese leaders' global ambitions.
   This article argues that these views are mistaken. It argues that
   China's AI plans are primarily driven by contestation and the struggle
   for resources among domestic stakeholders who are economically motivated
   and have little awareness of the bigger geopolitical picture. Instead of
   a top-down command approach, China's national AI plan is an upgrade of
   existing local AI initiatives to the national level, reflecting a
   bottom-up development. This article suggests that the existing analyses
   vastly exaggerate: (1) Beijing's capacity to coordinate domestic capital
   and actors towards a unified, specific strategic objective; and (2) the
   extent of China's AI advancement and its geopolitical threat, triggering
   unnecessary anxiety among China's near competitors.},

Abstract = {This article examines the reasons for the rise of the Taliban and the
   onset of the insurgency in Afghanistan after the 2001 U.S. invasion,
   using counterfactual and path dependence analysis to bolster its
   arguments. We argue that the U.S. decision to de-Talibanize was a
   critical juncture, after which the rise of insurgency was far harder to
   prevent. The total rejection of the Taliban translated into the
   under-representation of Pashtuns in the Afghan government, delivering
   power to ethnic minorities at their expense. De-Talibanization led the
   United States to support strongmen to hunt the Taliban, but they were
   predatory, creating grievances that the Taliban exploited to recruit.
   Finally, de-Talibanization led many Taliban to flee to Pakistan, pushing
   them into the country most opposed to Afghanistan new political order.
   The lessons of the U.S. experience in Afghanistan suggest the necessity
   of a strategy for managing defeated enemies after an initial military
   victory.},

Abstract = {West German society faced the emergence of a new calibre of right-wing
   terrorism in the 1970s. Right-wing terrorist groups evolved that showed
   themselves willing and able to commit violent attacks such as bombings
   and murder. This article explores the genesis and development of
   right-wing terrorism in West Germany between 1970 and 1980 while
   examining 22 identifiable groups and lone actors and taking into
   consideration the radicalization within the far right as well as the
   prevailing social conditions. West German right-wing terrorism until
   1990 has remained a blind spot in historiography to this day. This
   article contributes to historical terrorism studies as well as to
   studies into the far right while applying historical-qualitative methods
   and interpreting primary sources. Using an approach informed by social
   history, this paper sheds new light on the individual participants,
   groups, and networks of right-wing terrorism as well as on its topics
   and targets. While taking into account a more dynamic definition of
   right-wing terrorism, this paper disengages from definitions that
   identify terrorism solely as a threat to the state itself. This makes
   possible a multidimensional approach employing contemporary history and
   studies in both terrorism and right-wing extremism.},

   legitimation of austerity during the euro crisis: in the face of growing
   social unrest over their austerity-based crisis management, EU and
   national policy elites would attempt to remove the political character
   of economic policy-making, thus insulating budgetary issues from public
   deliberation and party competition. Nevertheless, little attention has
   been paid to the actual success of depoliticizing strategies in
   effectively achieving these aims. By setting up a dialogue between two
   research programmes on (de)politicization that have developed so far in
   isolation, the article articulates a new framework for studying the
   impacts of depoliticization. Empirically, the analysis focuses on the
   process of discursive depoliticization of budgetary policy in Spain in
   the context of the austerity-oriented budgetary reforms implemented
   between 2010 and 2013. Methodologically, this process of (contested)
   discursive depoliticization is examined by developing a relational
   content analysis of the parties' electoral manifestos and newspapers'
   opinion articles on budgetary policy that were published in the three
   electoral campaigns held in Spain before, during and after the euro
   crisis. The analysis shows that the EU-led depoliticization of budgetary
   policy encountered important political limits in Spain, in fact
   paradoxically promoting a re-politicizing backlash.},

Abstract = {This chapter looks at the national image that President Xi Jinping is
   attempting to project on the world stage vis- a-vis China's global
   interactions. By studying Xi's speeches, this chapter identifies the
   ways China tries to distinguish itself from the West in the space of
   domestic governance and the extent to which these ideas reflect the
   Chinese political worldview and belief in Chinese exceptionalism. Three
   main themes form the key narratives of both the promoted national image
   of China and Chinese exceptionalism, namely: (I) the ``Chinese dream{''}
   and image of China as a flourishing civilization; (II) a progressive and
   peaceful China; and (III) China as a moral example which should be
   internationally emulated.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines Singaporean elite perspectives towards China and
   how China's rise is understood and debated in Singapore. It argues that
   Singapore's reading of China's rise is broadly divided into three
   schools that parallel theories of mainstream international relations,
   namely, the realist, economic institutionalist, and the constructivist
   positions. By analyzing the views put forth by three Singaporean thought
   leaders that are representative of each of these schools, the chapter
   argues that at the crux of Singapore's perspectives on China is a
   contestation between these three schools of thought as well as the
   extent to which Singapore perceives China as exceptional.},

Abstract = {The democratic peace-the idea that democracies rarely fight one
   another-has been called ``the closest thing we have to an empirical law
   in the study of international relations.{''} Yet, some contend that this
   relationship is spurious and suggest alternative explanations.
   Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized experiments, we can never
   rule out the possible existence of such confounding biases. Rather than
   commonly used regression-based approaches, we apply a nonparametric
   sensitivity analysis. We show that overturning the negative association
   between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is
   forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other
   dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy
   and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and
   lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars
   would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already
   identified in the literature.},

Abstract = {Deepfakes are a newformof syntheticmedia that broke upon the world in
   2017. Bringing photoshopping to video, deepfakes replace people in
   existing videos with someone else's likeness. Currently most of their
   reach is limited to pornography, and they are also used to discredit
   people. However, deepfake technology has many epistemic promises and
   perils, which concern how we fare as knowers. Our goal is to help set an
   agenda around these matters, tomake sure this technology can help
   realize epistemic rights and epistemic justice and unleash human
   creativity, rather than inflict epistemic wrongs of any sort. Our
   project is exploratory in nature, and we do not aim to offer conclusive
   answers at this early stage. There is a need to remain vigilant to make
   sure the downsides do not outweigh the upsides, and that will be a tall
   order.},

Abstract = {To what extent did 9/11 impact the discipline of International Relations
   (IR)? In the current article, we argue that while the impact of 9/11 on
   global politics is undeniable, the verdict when it comes to the
   discipline in charge of studying these events, IR, is more ambiguous.
   For while IR and the study of global politics has changed over time, the
   discipline is, we argue, as much prone to ``internal{''} changes as it
   is to external shocks. Thus, we suggest a model for understanding the
   sociology of science of IR which takes into account both internal and
   external sources of change. While IR would have looked quite different
   today without the attacks of 9/11, we argue that we would still have
   been able to recognize it.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ideology shapes militant recruitment, organization, and conflict
   behavior. Existing research assumes doctrinal consistency, top-down
   socialization of adherents, and clear links between formal ideology and
   political action. But it has long been recognized that ideological
   commitments do not flow unaltered from overarching cleavages or elite
   narratives; they are uneven, contingent, fraught with tension, and often
   ambivalent. What work does ideology do in militant groups if it is not
   deeply studied, internalized, or sincerely believed? How can scholars
   explain collective commitment, affinity, and behavioral outcomes among
   militants who clearly associate themselves with a group, but who may not
   consistently (or ever) be true believers or committed ideologues? I
   argue that practical ideologies-sets of quotidian principles, ideas, and
   social heuristics that reflect relational worldviews rather than
   specific published political doctrines, positions, platforms, or
   plans-play a key role in militant socialization through everyday
   practices. Ethnographic evidence gained from fieldwork among
   Palestinians in Lebanon demonstrates how militants and affiliates render
   ideas about ideological closeness and distance accessible through
   emotional, intellectual, and moral appeals. This approach reaffirms the
   role of discourse and narrative in creating informal mechanisms of
   militant socialization without expressly invoking formal doctrine.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies and synthetically demonstrates the most important
   steps and changes in the evolution of the idea and institution of
   citizenship in Europe over more than two thousand years. Citizenship is
   one of the essential categories defining human status. From a historical
   perspective, the idea of citizenship in Europe is in a state of constant
   evolution. Therefore, the essence of the institution of citizenship and
   its acquisition criteria are continually being transformed. Today's
   comprehension of citizenship is different from understanding citizenship
   in Europe in earlier epochs of history. In some of them, the concept of
   citizenship existed only in the realm of ideas. In others, the idea
   materialised, and membership in the state (or city) and civic rights and
   obligations found a formal, legal expression. The formation of the idea
   and institution of citizenship is a long and multi-phase process.},

Abstract = {Medical school asylum clinics are complex organizations that blend
   medical and legal expertise with service to assist individuals seeking
   refuge from human rights violations. The balance of power shared by the
   students and faculty who lead these clinics varies widely across
   institutions, usually in an inverse reciprocal relationship. The Weill
   Cornell Center for Human Rights will observe its 10th anniversary in
   2020 and is notable for espousing maximal student autonomy in the
   organization's governance with minimal faculty control or administration
   participation. This level of autonomy requires that, in addition to
   successfully running the organization, student leaders must adeptly
   manage logistical, administrative, and ethical challenges without
   compromising the trust and confidence of the medical college and larger
   university. This article describes a series of difficult decisions
   involving policy, conflict resolution, and resource management made
   expeditiously by the student leadership. Ethical dilemmas, operational
   challenges, and the difficulties imposed by an unexpected global
   catastrophe-the COVID-19 pandemic-are presented alongside detailed
   descriptions of how these issues were deliberated and resolved by the
   student leadership.},
