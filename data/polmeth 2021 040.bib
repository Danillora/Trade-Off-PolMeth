Abstract = {In 2020, the United Kingdom became the first member state to leave the
   European Union (EU). This followed a referendum on membership in 2016.
   Public opinion about EU membership has been regularly measured since the
   1970s in Britain. In this Poll Trends article, we document the changes
   in sentiment towards the EU in a variety of different ways. We report on
   attitudes towards the cost and benefits; national and European
   identities; support for continued membership of the EU; specific policy
   preferences towards Britain's involvement with the EU; vote intention in
   a referendum on membership pre- and post- the 2016 referendum; and the
   prevalence of new political identities created by the referendum.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on identifying the variable which has the highest
   predictive power in predicting electoral behaviour. To do this, we apply
   a tree-based machine learning technique to data from Malaysia's 14th
   General Election. We find that constituencies' urbanization level has
   the most significant predictive power in determining vote share.
   Ethnicity, a long-touted variable of significance, plays a secondary
   role. Moreover, these predictors' marginal effects on the vote share are
   highly complex, non-linear and difficult to pick up by conventional
   regression methods. Other explanatory factors do not exhibit significant
   predictive qualities of electoral behaviour, although the extant
   literature has shown them to have important causal relationships. As our
   analysis reflects the significant predictive power of urbanization in
   predicting voting behaviour, we caution against the haste to dismiss its
   relevance in the Malaysian context.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how practices of counter-terrorism (CT) have been
   perceived by legally-operating groups labelled `extremist'. Taking the
   cases of Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain (HTB) and Hizb ut-Tahrir Scandinavia
   (HTS), the paper explores how two branches of the same Islamic activist
   organisation have experienced CT through interviews with party members
   and activists. Using existing models of repression, the paper maps how
   counter-terrorism is perceived by activist groups, revealing new
   information on Hizb ut-Tahrir and providing a framework for
   understanding the interaction of security with groups problematised as
   `extremist' within a widening `securitised lens'. The paper finds that,
   whilst there are similarities in how CT has been articulated in Britain
   and Denmark, it has impacted on HTB and HTS differently, creating
   different strategies of response. In tracking these, we highlight the
   prominent role played by civil society actors in the UK in creating a
   hostile environment for Islamic activist groups. By using mechanistic
   models of repression, we conceptualise the impact of counter-terrorism
   and newer patterns of countering violent extremism (CVE) on contentious
   activist organisations at a moment when the so-called `risk' of
   extremism is increasingly being conceptualised and responded to
   throughout Europe.},

Abstract = {It is very difficult to know how international social linkages affect
   domestic ideological polarization because we can never observe
   polarization occurring both with and without international connections.
   To estimate this missing counterfactual, we employ a new statistical
   method based on Bayesian item-response theory that permits us to
   disaggregate polarization after the Arab Uprisings into domestic and
   transnational components. We collected a dataset of Twitter accounts in
   Egypt and Tunisia during the critical year of 2013, when the Egyptian
   military overthrew the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. We find that
   the coup increased retweets among Egyptian ideological allies by 50\%
   each day following the coup and decreased cross-ideological retweets by
   25\%. Tunisian Twitter communities also showed stronger intragroup
   retweeting although at lower levels than in Egypt. Counter-intuitively,
   our model shows that the additional polarization in Tunisia after the
   coup appears to have dampened further polarization among Islamists in
   Egypt.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Political scientists routinely face the challenge of assessing the
   quality (validity and reliability) of measures in order to use them in
   substantive research. While stand-alone assessment tools exist,
   researchers rarely combine them comprehensively. Further, while a large
   literature informs data producers, data consumers lack guidance on how
   to assess existing measures for use in substantive research. We
   delineate a three-component practical approach to data quality
   assessment that integrates complementary multimethod tools to assess:
   (1) content validity; (2) the validity and reliability of the data
   generation process; and (3) convergent validity. We apply our quality
   assessment approach to the corruption measures from the Varieties of
   Democracy (V-Dem) project, both illustrating our rubric and unearthing
   several quality advantages and disadvantages of the V-Dem measures,
   compared to other existing measures of corruption.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the use of populist framing
   mechanisms by grassroots right-wing organizations. It brings together
   the social movement literature on framing and the populist literature to
   understand how actors build an emergent field of activism in a highly
   contentious context. Based on the analysis of a sample of 4,574 Facebook
   posts published by 5 civil society organizations during the campaign to
   oust Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, it argues that two mechanisms,
   reductionism and antagonism, enabled actors to focus on similar targets
   and diagnostics while maintaining relevant differences when seeking to
   motivate followers and present prognostic frames. These were key
   mechanisms used by all the actors, albeit with different contents,
   depending on the frame task. This article contributes to filling gaps in
   the framing and populist literatures and sheds light on the relevance of
   populist communication in the rise of right-wing activism.},

Abstract = {Cambodia's swing to hegemonic authoritarianism has been accompanied by a
   related transformation in the field of information and communication:
   the co-optation of digital platforms to spread a newly crafted hegemonic
   discourse. This article shows that Prime Minister Hun Sen has co-opted
   social media to promote a new, more emotive, online persona in tandem
   with the projection of a discourse that justifies his right to rule
   unchallenged. Echoes of Hun Sen's social media repertories are also
   evident in the online activities of his son Hun Manet, which may speak
   to a transference of symbolic capital prior to a possible succession in
   the future. At the same time, everyday users of social media in Cambodia
   engage in counter-hegemonic practices by valuing social media for
   affording access to sources of news and information not controlled by
   the ruling Cambodian People's Party. Yet, they also practise an active
   silence regarding their holding of dissenting political sentiments. This
   study thus also draws attention to a critical civic awareness growing
   among the Cambodian public at a time of deepening authoritarianism-a
   contradiction that may contain the seeds of new political subjectivities
   and future contestations to Hun Sen's hegemonic rule.},

Abstract = {It is postulated that collective labour movements responding to demands
   for political reform, rather than to workplace demands, are key actors
   in democratic mobilization. Contrary to this proposition, this article
   draws on evidence from labour movements and related social allies in
   Cambodia to examine why they fail to mobilize in support of democratic
   revolutions. This article argues that labour movements in Cambodia do
   not ``burst onto the political scene{''} because they possess weak
   social and institutional alliances with political actors, such as
   opposition parties and other interest groups, to establish a democratic
   revolution. The capacity of labour movements to transform ``democratic
   intent{''} into ``democratic action{''} is thus hindered by the ability
   of authoritarian rulers and their coalitions, including business elites,
   to tightly control and co-opt alliances of labour movements designed to
   put pressure on the ruling regime. In essence, capitalist development
   does not strengthen the capacity of excluded labour groups but co-opts
   them to break down the opposition alliance and thus prevent
   democratization.},

Abstract = {Recent accounts of American politics focus heavily on urban-rural gaps
   in political behavior. Rural politics research is growing but may be
   stymied by difficulties defining and measuring which Americans qualify
   as ``rural.{''} We discuss theoretical and empirical challenges to
   studying rurality. Much existing research has been inattentive to
   conceptualization and measurement of rural geography. We focus on
   improving estimation of different notions of rurality and provide a new
   dataset on urban-rural measurement of U.S. state legislative districts.
   We scrutinize construct validity and measurement in two studies of rural
   politics. First, we replicate Flavin and Franko (2020, Political
   Behavior, 845-864) to demonstrate empirical results may be sensitive to
   measurement of rural residents. Second, we use Mummolo and Nall's (2017,
   The Journal of Politics, 45-59) survey data to show rural

Title = {The Potential and Limits of Environmental Disclosure Regulation: A
   Global Value Chain Perspective Applied to Tanker Shipping},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Exploring how transnational environmental governance and the operation
   of global value chains (GVCs) intersect is key in explaining the
   circumstances under which mandatory disclosure can improve the
   environmental footprint of business operations. We investigate how the
   governance dynamics of the tanker shipping value chain (a major emitter
   of greenhouse gases) limits the effectiveness of the European Union (EU)
   monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) regulation, which mandates
   the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions for ships calling at EU
   ports. Although MRV seeks to help shipowners and ship managers save fuel
   and reduce emissions, it does not address the complexity of power
   relations along the tanker shipping value chain and currently cannot
   disentangle how different actors influence the design, operational,
   commercial, and ocean/weather factors that together determine fuel
   consumption. In particular, the EU MRV neglects to reflect on how oil
   majors exert their power and impose their commercial priorities on other
   actors, and thus co-determine fuel use levels. We conclude that, in its
   current form, the EU MRV is unlikely to lead to significant
   environmental upgrading in tanker shipping. More generally, we argue
   that regulators seeking to facilitate environmental upgrading need to
   expand their focus beyond the unwanted behaviors of producers of goods
   and providers of services to also address the incentive structures and
   demands placed on them by global buyers.},

Abstract = {A key challenge facing many large, in-person public opinion surveys is
   ensuring that enumerators follow fieldwork protocols. Implementing
   ``quality control{''} processes can improve data quality and help ensure
   the representativeness of the final sample. Yet while public opinion
   researchers have demonstrated the utility of quality control procedures
   such as audio capture and geo-tracking, there is little research
   assessing the relative merits of such tools. In this paper, we present
   new evidence on this question using data from the 2016/17 wave of the
   AmericasBarometer study. Results from a large classification task
   demonstrate that a small set of automated and human-coded variables,
   available across popular survey platforms, can recover the final sample
   of interviews that results when a full suite of quality control
   procedures is implemented. Taken as a whole, our results indicate that
   implementing and automating just a few of the many quality control
   procedures available can streamline survey researchers' quality control
   processes while substantially improving the quality of their data.},

Abstract = {The article takes up the sacrificial theory of national myths presented
   by Steven J. Mock and discloses its further potential for understanding
   the symbolic structures of nationalism. While Mock builds mainly on a
   Girardian reinterpretation of Freud, I try to show that even more
   interesting results may be obtained by using Maurice Bloch's theory of
   ritual symbolism. The advantage of Bloch's model is threefold. (1) It
   discloses further interesting aspects of the sacrificial symbolism in
   national myths not noted by Mock. I illustrate some of these by a
   detailed analysis of the Czech national myth. (2) Bloch's model allows
   us to trace the sacrificial pattern not just in myths of the modern
   awakening of the nation but in myths concerning present-day political
   events as well. As an example, I analyse symbols of defeat in several
   myths of Czech 20th-century political leaders. (3) Bloch's model is more
   complex and thus allows us to understand different types of national
   myths than those featuring symbolism of defeat. As an example, I discuss
   imperial nationalism, which Mock considers as one of the exceptions to
   his theory, and I also use Bloch to throw interesting light on the
   distinction between ``civic{''} and ``ethnic{''} nationalism.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the complex hydrogeological, legal framework and
   socioeconomic costs of the groundwater protection in major groundwater
   basins (MGBs) in Poland in accordance with European directives. The
   hydrogeological criteria developed in Poland for establishing MGBs and
   the principles of their protection provide more details to the
   directives that are in force in Europe, which define the general
   principles for groundwater protection. The procedure of establishing MGB
   protection zones is connected with a change in local plans and land
   development and requires an analysis of the cost-benefit relationship in
   the sphere of social economy in the sector of public economics. The cost
   assessment was performed on the basis of data from hydrogeological
   documentations, and the aggregation of subareas to which the same
   existing and planned development can be attributed. A legal analysis of
   bans, orders and restrictions together with the identification of the
   risk of claims in specific hydrogeological and development conditions
   was a fundamental issue of research. These costs depend on the acreage
   and land use of the protected area. The unit costs of MGB protection,
   calculated per 1 km(2) of the protection area, for six sample basins
   were estimated at euro120 to euro208,000/2 years/1 km(2). The highest
   costs are generated by establishing protection in urban areas, while the
   lowest costs are generated in forest areas.},

   Research a Decade after the Arab Uprisings: Facing the Facts on
   Tremulous Grounds takes stock of MENA political science research a
   decade after the Arab uprisings. Engaging with key contributions from
   social movement and protest studies, comparative politics, and
   International Relations, we discuss three overarching questions that we
   consider as particularly important today: First, does `2011' represent a
   critical juncture for the respective MENA research fields? Second, what
   promises does a revisiting of the Area Studies Controversy hold in light
   of the Arab uprisings? Third, which changes has the past decade yielded
   for the ways political science research in/on MENA is done? Against this
   background, we present the six contributions to the special issue.},

Abstract = {The Arab uprisings of 2011 led to a reassessment of comparative politics
   research on authoritarianism in the Middle East and North Africa. The
   Arab region made its way from area studies into mainstream comparative
   politics, and research foci have shifted towards civil-military
   relations and repression. Ten years later, we observe higher levels of
   repression across the region, reflecting a diversity of repressive
   trends. Advocating comprehensive research on this variation, we review
   recent literature that tackles various dimensions of repression in Arab
   autocracies. In addition to disaggregating forms and targets of
   repression, we call for its justifications, agents and transnational
   dimensions to be considered next to the implications of digital
   technologies of coercion. We also reflect on how repression affects the
   possibility of doing research and how we can investigate the proposed
   dimensions of repression.},

Abstract = {A growing scholarship argues that decarbonization cannot be achieved
   with single instruments like carbon pricing alone. A broader mix of
   reinforcing policies is required. This literature focuses on how
   policies can accelerate technological innovation, restrict polluting
   activities, promote green growth, and ensure social justice. Applying
   the policy mix literature to the European Union (EU), this article
   examines the development of climate and energy policies from separate
   and narrow initiatives to coordinated policy packages to achieve
   increasingly ambitious climate targets, culminating with the European
   Green Deal. The starting point to explain this policy development is
   that EU policies will reflect the positions of the `least ambitious'
   actors when unanimity is required. Examination of different policy
   phases shows that EU policy mixes are not only needed to fulfil
   different transition functions-they also provide opportunities to
   combine different actor interests to raise climate ambitions. The EU
   institutions have been instrumental in crafting policy packages that
   exempt and compensate the least climate-ambitious actors. The Paris
   Agreement has also provided an enabling context for higher EU ambitions.
   Looking towards the future, the corona-induced recession has so far
   mainly been used by the EU as an opportunity to strengthen climate
   ambitions and the European Green Deal.},

Abstract = {The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a profound
   effect not only on the warring countries but also on diasporas that are
   related to them. Bringing together theories of diasporic identities and
   new media, this paper explores how Ukrainian diasporic `selves' are
   affected by the ongoing conflict with the focus on the role of social
   media in the formation of their national and ethnic identities. With a
   series of in-depth interviews conducted in Europe and North America,
   this study identifies the functions of social media in diasporic
   self-understanding, representation of national culture and online
   commemoration and mourning. The findings reveal that social media
   provide diasporic subjects with a space for the negotiation and
   performance of ethnic and national identities. Within this space,
   however, they experience ongoing contestation that makes `new' diaspora
   members more prone to relate to the radicalised discourses on national
   history, explanations of the conflict and Ukrainian monolingualism.},

Abstract = {The growing smartphone penetration and the integration of smartphones
   into people's everyday practices offer researchers opportunities to
   augment survey measurement with smartphone-sensor measurement or to
   replace self-reports. Potential benefits include lower measurement
   error, a widening of research questions, collection of in situ data, and
   a lowered respondent burden. However, privacy considerations and other
   concerns may lead to nonparticipation. To date, little is known about
   the mechanisms of willingness to share sensor data by the general
   population, and no evidence is available concerning the stability of
   willingness. The present study focuses on survey respondents'
   willingness to share data collected using smartphone sensors (GPS,
   camera, and wearables) in a probability-based online panel of the
   general population of the Netherlands. A randomized experiment varied
   study sponsor, framing of the request, the emphasis on control over the
   data collection process, and assurance of privacy and confidentiality.
   Respondents were asked repeatedly about their willingness to share the
   data collected using smartphone sensors, with varying periods before the
   second request. Willingness to participate in sensor-based data
   collection varied by the type of sensor, study sponsor, order of the
   request, respondent's familiarity with the device, previous experience
   with participating in research involving smartphone sensors, and privacy
   concerns. Willingness increased when respondents were asked repeatedly
   and varied by sensor and task. The timing of the repeated request, one
   month or six months after the initial request, did not have a
   significant effect on willingness.},

Abstract = {Expert organizations increasingly adopt participatory strategies to
   strengthen their knowledge claims. We introduce the notion of knowledge
   platforms for sustainability to conceptualize expert organizations that
   not only rhetorically embrace but also actively attempt to
   institutionalize the norm of stakeholder participation in seeking
   authority in sustainability governance. In doing so, they encounter a
   tension between the ambition of stakeholder participation and
   conventional foundations of epistemic authority, such as scientific
   autonomy and consensus. Taking this tension as a starting point, we
   utilize a dynamic perspective on epistemic authority to investigate the
   contestations over institutional designs. We compare the
   institutionalization of participation in two knowledge platforms for
   sustainability-the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services, and the research platform Future Earth: Research for
   Global Sustainability. Our comparison reveals that institutional designs
   for participation open up the process of knowledge creation and
   evaluation. Yet, in seeking epistemic authority, knowledge platforms
   also reinforce existing power structures by redrawing boundaries that
   protect scientific autonomy and privilege relationships with elite
   actors.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, severe limitations
   have been placed on Ukraine's coastal state rights and navigational
   freedoms in the Black and Azov Seas and the Kerch Strait. The ``Kerch
   Strait clash{''} in November 2018, which resulted in the Russian capture
   of three Ukrainian naval vessels in international waters south of the
   strait, can be seen as the temporary culmination of tensions that have
   been building up over a longer period. In violation of international law
   and bilateral agreements, Russia has in recent years pursued an
   increasingly assertive and revisionist policy in the region and sought
   to turn the maritime spaces on the country's southwestern flank into a
   ``Russian lake{''}. This policy is affecting not only the security and
   economy of neighbouring states such as Ukraine and Georgia, but also the
   strategic balance in the southeastern corner of Europe. Drawing on
   empirical evidence derived from Russian, Ukrainian and Western sources,
   as well as insights from neoclassical realist theory, this article
   discusses legal, economic and security aspects of Russia's ongoing quest
   for a dominant position in the Black Sea region.},

Abstract = {Technological advances have improved our lives but have also contributed
   to inequalities in contemporary societies. In a world increasingly
   defined by cyberculture, social representations are constructed and
   shaped through myriad media and communication channels and networks.
   Access to technology allows people to create, manage, and track diverse
   relations at the local and global levels. However, a world of universal
   justice remains a promise not yet delivered and there is ample evidence
   of discrimination and human rights violations throughout normative
   democracies. Having access to information and knowledge is not enough.
   There is an increasing need to work towards the development of
   capabilities for critical thinking and awareness of social justice
   amongst citizens. The way to do so is by merging together Media and
   Information literacy and Human Rights Education. This merger is a key
   tool for combating discrimination and human rights violations. Both
   methods of education share a common goal, developing empowerment and
   emancipation through critical thinking and empathy, in a quest to
   develop peace and social justice. This chapter will attempt to show how
   the merger of Media and Information Literacy and Human Rights Education
   becomes a powerful tool for today's democracy and global citizenship.
   Links between Media and Information Literacy and Human Rights Education
   will be presented to inspire professional practice in formal and
   informal contexts, especially in relation to the promotion of critical
   teaching and learning capable of transforming the realities of students,
   educators and communities.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the similarities and differences in methods of
   conveying information to common people in two societies where printing
   was coming into greater use - the huge agrarian empire of Song China
   (tenth to thirteen centuries) and the city of Renaissance Rome
   (fourteenth to fifteenth centuries). The Song material is strongest on
   the bureaucratic reasons for posting notices and the language used in
   them. Authors preserved hundreds of notices, probably seeing in them
   proof of their serious commitment to promoting the welfare of the people
   under them. The sources for notice-posting in Renaissance Rome are
   fuller on the practices associated with circulating notices throughout
   the city on church doors both by the papacy and by its critics, who
   sometimes posted satirical or contemptuous notices at the same sites.
   The posting of notices in Renaissance Rome was a bureaucratic practice
   that had strong ritualistic overtones, was often highly politicized, and
   therefore could easily be subverted by critics of the regime.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {At-risk youth, those on the verge of dropping out of school (and
   potentially society), are of ongoing global concern. The term
   ``at-risk{''} contains several different marginalities beyond dropping
   out of school, such as displaying social and learning difficulties, or
   encountering challenges in language or life situations. Yet, despite the
   importance of engaging these youth in maintaining healthy societies,
   there is a paucity of critical discussion of media education that
   supports them specifically. This text considers how both schools and
   youth institutions can promote media skills, while increasing motivation
   towards autonomous digital agency in the light of 21st-century
   technological citizenships. Our proposed media education uses
   account-inclusive perspectives through the use of participatory media.
   Media education here is understood through pedagogies of multiliteracies
   that support youth agency in digitalized societies. We conducted an
   extensive, action-based qualitative study, consisting of eight
   sub-studies implemented between 2015-2017, in collaboration with youth
   institutions around Finland. Each sub-study included a media workshop
   promoting youth media-making as self-expression and participation in
   public media culture. The workshops were attended by nearly 100 young
   people, between the ages of 15-22. As a result of our study, we propose
   a model of Inclusive Media Education for supporting at-risk youth and,
   therefore, enhancing Democracy 2.0 in digitalized societies. Our model
   contains five key features of media education as an everyday practice,
   including: safe spaces, caring interaction, trust in competence,
   creative media-making and authentic agency, the ultimate goal being to
   advance: at-risk youths' motivation to participate, communicative media
   skills, autonomous agency, relatedness and experiences of inclusion in
   both educational settings and society.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) ``Post-truth
   Explorers: Information Literacy vs. Fake News,{''}(1) created for a
   Spanish speaking population as a lifelong learning strategy for
   developing Media and Information Literacy skills among the general
   public in the eve of the most recent elections in Mexico and in a
   context of global democratic crisis. The text explores how this course
   was conceived, designed, produced and implemented by the e-learning team
   of the Autonomous University of the State of Morelos (UAEM).
   Regarding the thematic proposal of the course, creators confirmed its
   pertinence not only for the target audience (general public), who valued
   its contributions to awareness of different topics covered, but also for
   specific audiences such as students, educators and media professionals.
   Concerning its design, based on interactive storytelling, it was found
   that a ludic didactic approach was welcome by most participants and
   contributed to higher completion rates, but produced some undesired
   effects, such as disorientation, especially when flowing between
   academic and fictional resources.},

Title = {Civil society, insecurity and Arab support for normalization with
   Israel: Contextualizing the Abraham Accords},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {525-553},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Extant literature suggests that public support for peace accords plays a
   role in their durability. Yet while the Abraham Accords represent
   significant rapprochement between governments, the region is marked by
   the conditions of violence and insecurity that harm social trust and
   reduce the likelihood of conciliatory views among citizens. Using Arab
   Barometer data from twelve countries (2012-2014), I explore the factors
   that lead Arab citizens to be more supportive of normalization. I argue
   that while instability undermines the demand for peace, civil society
   engagement develops bonding and bridging social capital that supports
   conciliatory views. I find that perceived insecurity is negatively
   related to support for Arab-Israeli peace, yet greater social capital,
   in the form of tolerance, associational membership, and social media
   use, produced demand for peace. Country of residence and religious
   identity are important predictors, with Sunni and Shi'a Muslims being
   less conciliatory towards Israel than Christians. Contrary to
   assumptions underlying US foreign policy, participating in politics by
   voting in democratic or authoritarian elections or protesting were
   related to lower demand for peace. By illustrating the role that civil
   society and perceived security play, the results have implications for
   scholars of security studies and policymakers working to support
   peacemaking.},

Abstract = {The literature on aid allocation shows that many factors influence
   donors' decision to provide aid. However, our knowledge about foreign
   aid allocation is based on traditional foreign aid, from developed to
   developing countries, and many assumptions of these theories do not hold
   when applied to southern donors. This article argues that south-south
   development cooperation (SSDC) can be explained by the strength of
   development cooperation's domestic allies and foes. Specifically, it
   identifies civil society organizations as allies of SSDC and nationalist
   groups as opponents of SSDC. By using for the first time data on SSDC
   activities in Latin America, this article shows the predictive strength
   of a liberal domestic politics approach in comparison to the predictive
   power of alternative explanations. The results speak to scholars of both
   traditional foreign aid and south-south development cooperation in
   highlighting the limits of traditional theories of foreign aid
   motivations.},

Abstract = {Groups that have experienced collective suffering are sometimes more
   sympathetic toward outgroups, while other times they display higher
   outgroup prejudice. What can account for these contradictory
   observations? This study uses a unique historical episode of forced
   displacement to examine how perceptions of recognition of the ingroup's
   victimhood affect views toward outgroups. We collect data on descendants
   of ethnic Germans ousted from Central and Eastern Europe after the end
   of World War II, and examine their attitudes toward Syrian refugees
   today. Both observational data and an experiment are used to test the
   role of victimhood recognition. When they learn that their suffering is
   acknowledged by more Germans than they expected, descendants of
   expellees become more positive toward refugees. Interestingly, this
   effect is not symmetric. When recognition of suffering is revealed to be
   lower than respondents' expectations, their sympathy toward refugees
   does not decrease. This effect is not present among respondents without
   a family background of forced expulsion. Additional evidence documents
   the underlying mechanism at work.},

Abstract = {Scholars of electoral autocracies accord far more attention to
   post-election protests than pre-election ones, as the former have the
   potential to trigger a regime transition. We argue that pre-election
   protests can have a significant effect on election outcomes. In
   particular, they are likely to deepen social cleavages along two
   dimensions: age and immigrant status. The 2019 social unrest in Hong
   Kong provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the electoral impact of
   pre-election protests. Comparing public opinion data related to the 2019
   and 2015 District Council elections, we find strong empirical support
   for our argument, as immigrant status and age are strong predictors of
   voting choices and voter turnout. Our findings imply that exposure to
   democratic protests may not help in bridging the gap in political
   attitudes between immigrants and natives.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a comparative case study of Nikola Tesla's use as a
   symbol in interwar Yugoslavia and the contemporary United States to
   build upon Anderson's theory of modular nationalism. The modularity of
   national symbols, I argue, is driven by their utility in addressing
   similar social, political and economic transformations in different
   countries and may be transmissible through emigrant communities-albeit
   not without some changes in substance. Just as Yugoslavia used Tesla to
   bridge ethnic divisions, Yugoslav emigrants deployed Tesla to enhance
   their status in the United States. The cult of Tesla, moreover, is
   doubly modular, with its Yugoslav incarnation drawing inspiration from
   the American cult of Thomas Edison, just as Edison's current
   obsolescence as a symbol led to the cult of Tesla's adoption in the
   United States.},

Abstract = {This article examines and compares strategies of international relations
   of three European cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona and Stockholm. Amsterdam
   was chosen due to its broad human rights agenda and friendly attitude
   towards migrants, Barcelona due to its innovative International
   Relations Master Plan, and Stockholm because of its long-term vision of
   Stockholm for Everyone, which clearly takes a people-centered approach.
   The author attempts to answer the following research questions - which
   of the three strategies is the most developed one in human rights terms?
   Which is the most progressive and which propose something more or new
   rather than only recognize already existing human rights? Research
   methods include desk analysis, comparative analysis, critical analysis
   of literature and online interviews with representatives of the examined
   cities. As a result, the article shows the rising role of cities in
   implementing and promoting human rights and meeting the needs of their
   citizens which fall under the umbrella of people-centered approach.},

Abstract = {The Philippine response to COVID-19 has been described as being one of
   the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world. Why has the Philippine
   government relied heavily on draconian measures in its ``war{''} against
   COVID-19? And what discourse informed the framing of its response as a
   war against the virus? This article argues that the government's
   reliance on draconian measures was a consequence of securitising
   COVID-19, appreciating the virus as an ``existential threat.{''} The
   securitisation of COVID-19 was reinforced with a narrative
   characterising the situation of the country as being at war against an
   ``unseen enemy.{''} This war-like narrative, however, invariably
   produced a subject, the pasaway. As the perpetual enemy of health and
   order, the pasaway became the target of disciplining and policing. The
   targeting of the pasaway was informed by deep-seated class prejudices
   and Duterte's authoritarian tendencies.},

Abstract = {Diversified business groups play a major role in the economies of many
   developing countries. Business group members, often from the same
   communal, ethnic, or tribal group, have or develop interpersonal
   relations that make it easier to obtain information and monitor
   compliance related to transactions that require a strong measure of
   trust. This in-group cohesion facilitates profitable and productive
   economic activity. However, it can create resentment among other members
   of society who are barred from membership in a group that is, of
   necessity, exclusive. This envy can fuel a self-reinforcing cycle of
   societal hostility and group protectiveness that can deprive society of
   the economic benefits the groups can provide. There are several possible
   reactions such as ``affirmative action{''} programs that can slow or
   stop the cycle of envy and group vulnerability.},

Abstract = {The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU) does
   not only challenge the idea of an ever-deeper integrated union; it also
   calls into question the very principles on which the European political
   order has been established. Against this backdrop, the contributions of
   this Special Issue set out to analyse how parliaments, that is political
   institutions at the core of democratic systems, have positioned
   themselves towards and reacted to Brexit. In this introductory article,
   I first discuss the meaning of Brexit as yet another major political
   crisis with serious consequences potentially affecting the role and
   functioning of representative institutions and actors across the EU.
   Having taken stock of the extant literature on the parliamentarisation
   and politicisation of the EU, I then detail the cross cutting issues
   that permeate this Special Issue, namely: How do parliamentarians assess
   the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU and its consequences? Does
   Brexit exacerbate existing political divisions or does it generate new
   cleavages? To what extent have parliaments attempted to and succeeded in
   influencing Brexit negotiations and their outcome? Finally, the rest of
   the introductory article provides an overview of the articles
   constituting this Special Issue.},

Abstract = {The European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is
   considered as a key element in the quest for a European Security and
   Defence Union. The EDTIB strategy initiated in 2007 aimed to lead to
   greater integration of the fragmented national defence industries of EU
   member-states, achieve economies through the coordination of defence
   industrial policy, the pooling of resources in the production and
   acquisition of weapons systems and better serve the political objectives
   of European defence. The paper examines the extent to which EU27
   member-states satisfy their demand for arms through the procurement of
   EDTIB origin defence inputs. Moreover, it explores whether a process of
   convergence is present in terms of the share of EDTIB origin imports in
   the total arms imports of the EU member-states. The presence or not of a
   convergence process is examined empirically using beta- and club
   convergence methodologies. In broad terms, the findings point to a
   process of convergence albeit at different speeds, as indicated by the
   club-convergence analysis.},

Title = {Measuring Ethnic Bias: Can Misattribution-Based Tools from Social
   Psychology Reveal Group Biases that Economics Games Cannot?},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Economics games such as the Dictator and Public Goods Games have been
   widely used to measure ethnic bias in political science and economics.
   Yet these tools may fail to measure bias as intended because they are
   vulnerable to self-presentational concerns and/or fail to capture bias
   rooted in more automatic associative and affective reactions. We examine
   a set of misattribution-based approaches, adapted from social
   psychology, that may sidestep these concerns. Participants in Nairobi,
   Kenya completed a series of common economics games alongside versions of
   these misattribution tasks adapted for this setting, each designed to
   detect bias toward noncoethnics relative to coethnics. Several of the
   misattribution tasks show clear evidence of (expected) bias, arguably
   reflecting differences in positive/negative affect and heightened threat
   perception toward noncoethnics. The Dictator and Public Goods Games, by
   contrast, are unable to detect any bias in behavior toward noncoethnics
   versus coethnics. We conclude that researchers of ethnic and other
   biases may benefit from including misattribution-based procedures in
   their tool kits to widen the set of biases to which their investigations
   are sensitive.},

Abstract = {Although placebo conditions are ubiquitous in survey experiments, little
   evidence guides common practices for their use and selection. How should
   scholars choose and construct placebos? First, we review the role of
   placebos in published survey experiments, finding that placebos are used
   inconsistently. Then, drawing on the medical literature, we clarify the
   role that placebos play in accounting for nonspecific effects (NSEs), or
   the effects of ancillary features of experiments. We argue that, in the
   absence of precise knowledge of NSEs that placebos are adjusting for,
   researchers should average over a corpus of many placebos. We
   demonstrate this agnostic approach to placebo construction through the
   use of GPT-2, a generative language model trained on a database of over
   1 million internet news pages. Using GPT-2, we devise 5,000 distinct
   placebos and administer two experiments (N = 2,975). Our results
   illustrate how researchers can minimize their role in placebo selection
   through automated processes. We conclude by offering tools for
   incorporating computer-generated placebo text vignettes into survey
   experiments and developing recommendations for best practice.},

Volume = {9},

Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {The article designs an empirical model to compare the level of
   engagement of de facto states in Eurasia by three great powers and
   non-great power patron states. The authors build diagrams based on three
   variables - military, political, and economic - whose indicators are
   determined by an expert survey. Russia engages the most de facto states
   and to the greatest degree, while the US falls behind since engaging the
   de facto states is not a key national security concern. However, neither
   holds a universal principle of engaging de facto states - each case is
   treated based on broader political and national security considerations.
   China, wary of domestic separatism, has no military ties with the de
   facto states and limited economic and political engagement. Taiwan
   scores the highest among the de facto states with the Turkish Republic
   of Northern Cyprus and Abkhazia falling behind by a large margin. The
   Peoples' Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk and Transnistria score the
   lowest. The study reveals, the degree of engagement matters more than
   the number of the UN member states formally recognizing a de facto
   state.},

Abstract = {There is ample research on the incidence of coups d'etat but less on
   their aftermath. Why do some national leaders who seize power via
   military coup stay in power longer than others once they unseat their
   predecessors? This study tests whether facial attractiveness-which we
   argue is a testable proxy for personal charisma-helps explain variation
   in coup-installed leader survival. We draw on multiple data sources of
   coups worldwide from 1950 to 2010, as well as original attractiveness
   data coded from survey responses. We find that more attractive
   coup-installed leaders retain power longer than their less attractive
   counterparts after successfully ousting the incumbent. The
   attractiveness advantage is particularly strong for leaders in the first
   5 years of their tenure, those who seized power from a dictatorship as
   opposed to a democracy, and those who rule without parties in the
   legislature. We argue that leaders who take power through a military
   coup lack both traditional and rational-legal authority; for such cases,
   facial attractiveness may signal charismatic authority sufficient to
   survive the institutional vacuum following an unconstitutional ascent to
   power.},

Abstract = {The flows of refugees have ignited the European political debate,
   thereby boosting nationalistic forces in almost all countries. The aim
   of this paper is to counterbalance a widespread view about their overall
   impact and show that the number of asylum seekers did not represent a
   `refugee crises'. It argues, however, that the current European Union
   institutions and procedures are highly insufficient to successfully
   manage refugee inflows and asylum requests. It is often forgotten that
   large number of refugees are created from conflicts initiated or not
   prevented by EU members themselves. Once the problem comes into
   existence, as the procedures based on the Dublin Convention are widely
   recognised as inadequate, the paper provides a few suggestions for
   implementing radical changes to manage refugees and asylum seekers in
   the EU.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {260-266},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The prespecification of the network is one of the biggest hurdles for
   applied researchers in undertaking spatial analysis. In this letter, we
   demonstrate two results. First, we derive bounds for the bias in
   nonspatial models with omitted spatially-lagged predictors or outcomes.
   These bias expressions can be obtained without prior knowledge of the
   network, and are more informative than familiar omitted variable bias
   formulas. Second, we derive bounds for the bias in spatial econometric
   models with nondifferential error in the specification of the weights
   matrix. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that an omitted spatial
   input is the limit condition of including a misspecificed spatial
   weights matrix. Simulated experiments further demonstrate that spatial
   models with a misspecified weights matrix weakly dominate nonspatial
   models. Our results imply that, where cross-sectional dependence is
   presumed, researchers should pursue spatial analysis even with limited
   information on network ties.},

Abstract = {Most theoretical and empirical approaches to nationalism not only
   distinguish between ethnic and civic notions of national belonging but
   also differentiate national identity from national hubris, pride, and
   attachment. In this research note, we examine recently published
   research on nationalist sentiments in the United States that takes a
   different approach. The study in question, `Varieties of American
   Popular Nationalism' by Bonikowski and DiMaggio (2016), has already
   become quite influential in the field and has the potential to change
   how we conceptualise and operationalise attitudes about the nation. In
   this research note, we revisit its analytical strategy and exploratory
   methods. We ask two questions. First, does this study allow us to draw
   conclusions about American nationalism? To answer this, we replicate the
   original model and then execute additional postestimation analyses,
   whose results undermine the study's main conclusions. Second, we
   investigate whether judicious revisions to the study's model generate
   results that would lead us to the article's same conclusions. The 385
   additional models lend no support. Based on this evidence, we argue that
   the original study's conclusions stem from a misinterpretation of its
   latent class analysis (LCA), as our own analyses demonstrate that there
   is no empirical basis for its claims.},

Abstract = {This article, which introduces a Special Issue of the JCES on the
   challenges of EU enlargement policy towards the Western Balkans,
   critically examines the geopolitical turn of the EU's institutional
   thinking on enlargement since 2017. After several high-ranked EU
   officials and leaders of member states more or less explicitly voiced
   their concerns about the declining influence of the EU in the Western
   Balkans, the European Commission - which has traditionally been
   responsible for carrying out administrative-technical aspects of the
   accession process - adopted a more geopolitical approach to enlargement
   policy in February 2018, and has since sought to advance Western Balkan
   accession more decisively. However, this geopolitical turn to the EU's
   institutional thinking on enlargement has so far failed to translate
   discourse into concrete results. The article argues that the main
   reasons for this failure can be found in a lack of support by EU
   members, which either do not share the Commission's sense of urgency, or
   are eager to use enlargement policy and the accession process to advance
   their national interests. The article concludes with a brief
   presentation of the structure of the special issue and introduces the
   contributing articles.},

Abstract = {Although the European Union pledges to `maintain {[}and reaffirm] the
   credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans,' (European),
   some of the new requirements which it demands the Western Balkan
   candidate states to meet in order to gain membership seem to be very
   demanding for the political leaderships of these states. This is
   particularly the case for the requirement that candidate states solve
   all their `bilateral disputes horizontal ellipsis as a matter of
   urgency'. While Montenegro hopes to solve its only remaining (though
   nearly thirty year old) dispute with Croatia over their maritime border
   sometime soon, the second regional frontrunner for EU membership,
   Serbia, and the other remaining Western Balkan states (with the partial
   exception of Albania) have many more (and more serious) problems to
   resolve with their neighbours. This article discusses the nature and
   origins of problems in several most complex bilateral relationships in
   the Western Balkans and critically assesses the difficulty these
   problems pose for the Western Balkan states' accession to the EU.},

Abstract = {This article is interested in Syrian and Syrian refugees' ties of
   belonging to their country in times of war and displacement. By looking
   at individuals, the paper follows a micro-level approach to research
   societal ties of belonging to a country that has slipped into war. It
   argues that during conflicts, the meaning and boundaries of national
   identity are grasped in individuals' re-imagination of their country in
   either more ``civic{''} or ``ethnic{''} terms. As a result of this
   process, national identity may gain an inclusive, civic meaning based on
   the idea of citizenship or a more exclusive content based on the
   narrower confines of ethnicity and sect. Empirically, 100 Syrians and
   100 Syrian refugees provided their vision of a future Syrian state in
   online interviews. The findings show that the majority of respondents'
   visions of Syria follows a civic rationale, with most survey
   participants linking their belonging to a future Syria with the broader
   ideas of citizenship, political rights and participation, rather than

Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the progress and impact of the literature on
   comparative authoritarianism, showing not only how its development over
   the previous two decades can help us understand China's authoritarian
   politics better, but also how the latter can move the former forward. We
   focus on two important topic areas in the literature: authoritarian
   power-sharing and autocratic politics of information (e.g., partial
   media freedom and government censorship). For the first topic, we shall
   review the literature on the authoritarian power-sharing between
   dictators and their allies and explicate how this conceptual innovation
   helps us understand the institutional foundation of China's regime
   stability and phenomenal economic performance before Xi Jinping. The
   analysis then provides us a baseline for assessing China's economic and
   political future under Xi Jinping given his clear departure from the
   pre-existing power-sharing framework. Finally, this paper also assesses
   the relevance of the literature on authoritarian politics of information
   to the Chinese context. In sum, we not only emphasize the conceptual
   contributions of the literature of comparative authoritarianism to the
   field of Chinese politics, but also identify lacunae in the current
   literature and avenues for future research that post-Xi political
   developments have made visible to us.},

Abstract = {Global coal use must be phased out if we are to minimize temperature
   increases associated with climate change. Most new coal plants are being
   built in the Asia Pacific and rely on overseas finance, with Indonesia
   and Vietnam the leading recipients. However, the politics of coal plant
   finance are changing, with many projects cancelled in recent years. This
   article explores the factors that led to coal plant cancellations in
   Vietnam and Indonesia. Based on new data of coal plant finance and elite
   interviews, we find fuel switching, public opposition, and national
   planning were the dominant reasons for cancellations in Vietnam, while
   Indonesia's reasons were more diverse. Vietnam also had a larger number
   of cancellations than Indonesia, which has a more entrenched domestic
   coal mining sector. These findings suggest that Vietnam is farther along
   the coal phaseout agenda than Indonesia. We further provide provisional
   explanations for these patterns.},

Abstract = {Studies of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people suggest
   that they are more politically engaged and active compared to cisgender
   and heterosexual people. However, knowing the voter registration rates
   of eligible LGBT Americans has been elusive because the U.S. Census
   Bureau does not document sexual orientation or gender identity in the
   Current Population Survey and existing estimates are limited based on
   small sample sizes or on self-reports, which have social desirability
   biases. The 2016 and 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey
   merges respondents to their official voter status as contained in state
   voter files, which overcomes biases in self-reported registration
   status. We provide demographics and estimates of voter registration
   rates by sexual orientation and gender expression. Many gaps in
   registration rates are attributable to demographic differences between
   groups, though lesbians and gay men were registered at greater rates
   than heterosexuals even after adjusting for demographics. Transgender
   Americans were the least likely to be registered to vote, though this
   may be due to the vote-validation process itself.},

Abstract = {On 7 December 2020, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted an `EU Global
   Human Rights Sanctions Regime' (EU HRSR). The EU HRSR is an example of a
   transnational response to a fundamental security-related challenge. Both
   its adoption and its specific institutional set-up are a continuation of
   the move towards stronger supranational practices in the area of
   sanctions. Further supranationalising the EU's sanctioning practices, as
   one of its most developed and most powerful tools to response to
   security threats, is likely to increase the uniformity, flexibility, and
   arguably also the impartiality of the sanctions. At the same time, the
   adoption process also demonstrated that national governments set limits
   to further supranationalisation. While in particular the Dutch
   parliament was a driving force behind the adoption of the EU HRSR, both
   national parliaments and the European Parliament are likely to struggle
   to have significant influence over the sanctioning process. Yet, much
   depends on the actual sanctioning practices and the legal framing of the
   EU HRSR's objectives, designation criteria and evidentiary threshold may
   in practice raise legitimacy problems.},

Title = {Massive Institutional Structures in Global Governance},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {26-48},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Global governance consists of elementary regimes that form regime
   complexes, which in turn give rise to what we call superclusters around
   broad policy domains. In recent years, scholars have explored what these
   macroscopic structures look like and how they evolve over time. Yet the
   complex ways in which entire governance superclusters interact and
   coevolve, and what might emerge through this process, have not received
   much attention. In this article, we expand the ontological frontier of
   global governance research by offering a first bird's-eye view on
   supercluster-level institutional interaction with an empirical focus on
   trade and environment. We constructed and analyzed a dynamic
   network-of-networks model, revealing a supercluster complex , a massive
   institutional structure in global governance consisting of two or more
   interlocking superclusters that exert a measurable influence on each
   other's course of development. We theorize that the supercluster complex
   serves as an institutional fabric that enables the degree of
   self-organized coordination observed between the trade and environment
   policy domains. Our preliminary findings warrant more research on
   supercluster complexes as an important but little-noticed phenomenon in
   global governance.},

Abstract = {We introduce a fine-grained measure of the extent to which electoral
   districts combine and split local communities of co-partisans in
   unnatural ways. Our indicator-which we term Partisan Dislocation-is a
   measure of the difference between the partisan composition of a voter's
   geographic nearest neighbors and that of her assigned district. We show
   that our measure is a good local and global indicator of district
   manipulation, easily identifying instances in which districts carve up
   clusters of co-partisans (cracking) or combine them in unnatural ways
   (packing). We demonstrate that our measure is related to but distinct
   from other approaches to the measurement of gerrymandering, and has some
   clear advantages, above all as a complement to simulation-based
   approaches, and as a way to identify the specific neighborhoods most
   affected by gerrymandering. It can also be used prospectively by
   district-drawers who wish to create maps that reflect voter geography,
   but according to our analysis, that goal will sometimes be in conflict
   with the goal of partisan fairness.},

   policy behaviour},
Journal = {CAUCASUS SURVEY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {120-139},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {The conventional wisdom says that material and structural constraints
   push small states into a more or less predictable foreign and security
   policy. Georgia's case shows that, together with these limitations, the
   foreign policy of small states is also influenced by the way the ruling
   elites perceive the smallness of their state. This article explains why
   at different periods of time Georgia demonstrated diverging and even
   contradictory foreign policy behaviours, despite not achieving
   significant economic and military strength or witnessing crucial
   systemic changes in its security environment. I argue that the way
   ruling elites interpreted smallness influenced their understanding of
   Georgia's foreign policy capacity and agency in the international
   system. This in turn pushed Georgia into fundamentally different paths,
   stretching from a passive and mostly reactive foreign policy to a highly
   ambitious, uncompromising and hawkish one.},

Abstract = {This article takes a critical look at the relationship between
   subnational struggles, tribal politics and political aspirations in
   Mizoram, North-east India. It examines how community dynamics and
   relationships shape the demand for autonomy in a diverse and complex
   region like North-east India. Looking at communities registered as
   tribes in the government scheme of classification, it underlies how
   autonomy becomes an arena where communities mobilise both against the
   central state and within themselves. The paper examines the formation of
   Lushai Hills District Council and the Pawi-Lakher Regional Council
   (PLRC) in Mizoram, their subsequent development as in the case of the
   Mizo Hill District Council to Union Territory and statehood and the
   split in the case of the PLRC into three distinct autonomous councils.
   Based on ethnographic fieldwork, it notes that while territorial
   autonomy requires recognition and legitimation from the state, the way
   ethnic groups deploy demands for autonomy is inspired, if not
   instigated, by the nature of the relationship and interface within and
   across communities.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the drivers and developments of the recent rise of
   a fictional region: Tabarnia in Spain. This platform proposes the
   creation of a new autonomous region to oppose the project of secession
   of the independentist Catalan movement. Given the dearth of academic
   research, our article documents and explores the case of Tabarnia. We
   draw on a multimethod approach, entailing a thematic analysis and
   process-tracing, to reconstruct the trajectory of this platform and to
   uncover its drivers, goals and strategies. By building on this evidence
   base, this article construes Tabarnia as an instance of imaginary
   regionalism created ex nihilo in the noosphere. As such, Tabarnia
   represents an a-topia substantiated through a digital region-building
   process heavily relying on the use of humour.},

Abstract = {The institutions, programs and budgets-in other words, the
   infrastructure-involved in the democracy promotion agendas of the
   Visegrad states are quite differentiated. This chapter focuses on the
   architecture of the mechanisms that permit the operationalization of
   democracy assistance by each of the four Visegrad states. It attempts to
   track the evolution of the infrastructure and describe its standing
   within government structures. Given the fairly strong integration of the
   democracy assistance agenda into the official structures of Czech
   foreign politics, it identifies the country as being the most determined
   promotor of democracy among the Visegrad states, followed by Poland. In
   this sense, Hungary is depicted as being most reluctant to engage too
   explicitly in the agenda.},

Series = {Critical Media Literacies Series},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {138-157},
Abstract = {While a central focus of media literacy 1.0 was teaching and learning
   about the impact of marketing on children and youth, the new literacies
   of Web 2.0 have distracted us from this central purpose in favour of
   focusing on social media in general, and specific social media platforms
   in particular. We contend that utilitarian and production-oriented
   exigencies of media literacy 2.0 have displaced core analytical
   assumptions of media literacy 1.0 and this chapter is an attempt to
   resolve this divide. To facilitate a critical media literacy approach to
   social media, we propose a framework that facilitates an analysis of the
   content of social media in order to unravel the marketing models
   employed. Despite common perspectives that celebrate the ease of media
   production and participation in social networks, a feature that reflects
   their democratic and open nature, we believe that critical media
   literacy continues to require the capacity to identify and analyze one
   of its less readily apparent dimensions: its commercial orientation. We
   propose an open framework, adapted to each teaching and learning context
   involving social media and social networks, focusing on four main
   dimensions: a formal analysis of the social network structure and its
   privacy policy; an evaluation of the main models of audience
   segmentation used by each network; a critical review of specific media
   content; and an analysis of strategies used to promote personalization
   and audience immersion in the new marketing models. In short, we believe
   that a critical media literacy for social media and social networks
   requires more than an instrumental view of functionalities and
   affordances, but should involve the development of more complex analyses
   of the commercial implications of social media and the management of
   user generated data.},

Abstract = {Defence diplomacy has gained attention in the past decades. Hence,
   Indonesia has also developed its defence diplomacy for achieving its
   strategic interests. In Indonesia's defence diplomacy, bilateral forms
   have dominated the practice of joint exercises with its defence
   partners. However, under the Yudhoyono administration in 2014, Indonesia
   hosted its first multilateral joint exercise, the Multilateral Naval
   Exercise Komodo (MNEK), which aimed at facilitating multilateral
   engagement with greater international partners. This exercise was
   continued by the Widodo administration as a biannual event in the
   following years. Since this multilateral exercise has rarely been
   studied, this article attempts to qualitatively examine how this
   exercise has developed and contributed to Indonesia's multilateral
   defence diplomacy. To support the analysis, this article relies on a
   combination of documentary analysis and semi--structured interviews,
   including with numerous participants of past MNEK exercises in 2014,
   2016, and 2018.},

Abstract = {Nationalism today interacts in complicated ways with advanced
   information and communication systems, regularly leading to
   unanticipated consequences. Popular online nationalism in the People's
   Republic of China (PRC) is a case in point: In the PRC, digital
   nationalism has become a central feature of political discourse and
   decision-making, at times powerfully shaping the state's policy efforts.
   This article explores a missing puzzle piece in how state-led and
   popular nationalism interact in Chinese politics: the role that advanced
   information and communication technologies play in such processes. This
   is a question that is not only relevant to scholars of China but also to
   anyone interested in the role that digital media and communication play
   in the formation and spread of contemporary nationalism. How do
   interactions in complex sociotechnical systems affect nationalism today?
   To answer this question, the article analyses and traces interaction and
   feedback loops in Chinese digital environments during Sino-Japanese
   disputes over the East China Sea. It shows how the interactions between
   humans, organisations and technologies create unexpected variations in
   outcome that resonate through China's internet and create the conditions
   from which digital nationalism can powerfully emerge to shape
   legitimation and policy-making processes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the idea of Northern Ireland independence in
   Unionist political thought. It focuses on three moments which compelled
   Ulster Unionists to re-evaluate Northern Ireland's constitutional status
   as part of the United Kingdom-the Stormont parliament's cohabitation
   with the post-war Labour government, Stormont's collapse in 1972, and
   the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. It argues that rather than being the
   expression of Ulster nationalism or a contractarian understanding of
   political obligation, Unionist arguments for independence were motivated
   by a classical republican concern: the arbitrary power Northern Ireland
   is subject to as part of the United Kingdom. This locates Unionist
   thought on independence within a problem of democratic
   self-determination: the relationship between majority rule and the
   bounds of the political community. The article finds that each moment
   compelled particular Unionist thinkers to reconceive of Ulster Unionists
   as a political minority subject to arbitrary power in the UK
   constitution and to choose between Northern Ireland and the United
   Kingdom as the sovereign political community. The article is unique as
   there exists little scholarship on the idea of Northern Ireland
   independence and instructive in providing a challenging case study to
   assess the attraction and determinacy of classical republicanism as a
   theory of self-determination.},

Abstract = {Some scholars argue that Donald Trump's electoral college victory in
   2016 was predicated on his ability to attract racially hostile white
   voters. Others argue that the increased relationship between whites'
   racial attitudes and presidential vote choice in 2016 was because racial
   attitudes and partisanship had become even more aligned following the
   presidency of Barack Obama. Building on research that shows voters tend
   to update their policy positions to align with their preferred
   candidates, we propose a third mechanism that helps account for the
   strong relationship between whites' racial attitudes and vote choice in
   2016. We hypothesize that over the course of the presidential campaign,
   many whites shifted their survey responses on questions related to race
   and immigration to align with their support for Trump or Clinton. To
   test this argument, we use a unique panel dataset from surveys conducted
   by YouGov of more than 5,000 respondents interviewed at multiple points
   during the 2016 presidential election campaign. We find that the strong
   link between white attitudes toward Black Americans and Trump support
   observed in prior studies is likely due as much to white Trump
   supporters updating their survey responses to report opinions more
   consistent with Trump's, as it is to Trump drawing support from more
   racially antagonistic white voters. Similar results emerge with respect
   to whites' immigration opinions. These findings complicate our
   understanding of the 2016 election by offering direct evidence that
   Trump's campaign benefited from and catalyzed racial divisions. The
   results also hold implications for how we study election and campaign
   effects and the stability of race and immigration attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article tries to identify the links between media and politics
   within the context of far-right politics. Populism provides such a
   conceptual link. In this article, we ask whether the way some media
   frame certain discussions, which are considered privileged issues for
   the far right, facilitates the diffusion of their narrative and ideas
   and thus normalizes their rhetoric among the population and improves
   their electoral prospects. We also examine the way the far-right party
   itself frames the same issues in order to identify whether there is a
   match between the two frames. Our case study is the Greek Cypriot far
   right party, ELAM. We argue that the populist representation of these
   particular issues by the media and the way the party positions itself on
   these same issues has facilitated the normalization of their political
   rhetoric, thus enabling it to penetrate into the mainstream political
   space and increase its electoral potentials.},

Abstract = {When and how does state indoctrination work? Building upon research on
   motivated reasoning and family socialization, I argue that only those
   individuals whose parents have connections to political patronage are
   subject to state indoctrination because their pro-regime biases
   transmitted from parents induce higher receptivity prior to government
   messages. Focusing on political education in China, I conduct a
   quasi-experimental analysis exploiting the sharp variation in textbook
   content generated by China's most recent curriculum reform. Results
   based on a national survey show that the new politics textbooks
   successfully affected only those individuals whose parents had worked
   for the government. The finding survives extensive robustness checks and
   falsification tests. I also consider several alternative explanations of
   the effects: preference falsification, selective attention, parental
   indoctrination, and educational quality. This paper not only highlights
   the role of intergenerational transmission in moderating the
   effectiveness of state indoctrination but also casts doubt on the actual
   degree to which regimes can change minds by changing educational
   content.},

Title = {Evolving together: transboundary water governance in the Colorado River
   Basin},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-574},

Abstract = {Transboundary collaboration between the United States (US) and Mexico in
   the Colorado River Basin has heightened in recent years, as climate
   change, population growth, and overallocation threaten the long-term
   stability of the region. Through a combination of document analysis and
   semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examine patterns of
   change in the governance of the Colorado River, as the US and Mexico
   navigate socioeconomic, cultural, and political asymmetries to jointly
   share water over the past two decades. We ask: What key events and
   environmental agreements have influenced transboundary water governance
   in the Colorado River over the past 20 years? We draw on the rich
   scholarship on transboundary water governance, especially around
   international river basin organizations, to uncover patterns of
   engagement and collaboration over time. We focus on the binational scale
   with an eye to study governance at multiple scales including
   interactions and impacts at the national and subnational scales. Our
   findings illustrate how Mexico's role has evolved from a narrow one
   following a strict interpretation of the 1944 Treaty toward a more
   creative partnership between the US and Mexico demonstrated in
   binational negotiations and the creation of joint solutions to emerging
   challenges around water conservation and ecological restoration. We find
   transboundary water governance in the basin is influenced by both
   long-term and short-term contextual changes that can inform strategies
   key actors employ to bolster institutional resilience and take advantage
   of opportunities for transformative change. Further, we find that the
   evolution of the binational relationship is reflected in changes in the
   negotiation process and structure, which highlights the importance of
   trust and relationship building, transparency, joint fact-finding, and
   information sharing to foster collaboration. However, we also find
   uneven institutionalization of stakeholder participation and
   transparency in engagement patterns that may ultimately, serve to hinder
   governance and cooperation in the basin.},

Abstract = {Voters' ideological stances have long been considered one of the most
   important factors for understanding electoral choices in Chile. In
   recent years, however, the literature has begun to call this premise
   into question, due to several changes in the Chilean political
   landscape: the current crisis of representation, the high programmatic
   congruence between the two main coalitions, the decline in the political
   relevance of the dictatorship, and the rise of nonprogrammatic electoral
   strategies. In addition to these transformations, Chile switched to
   voluntary voting in 2012. This article studies whether ideology still
   informs electoral choices in Chile in an era of voluntary voting. It
   implements a conjoint survey experiment in low-to-middle-income
   neighborhoods in Santiago, where voters would be expected to be less
   ideological. It shows that candidates' ideological labels are crucial
   for understanding the electoral decisions of a large part of the sample,
   particularly among likely voters.},

Abstract = {Distinguishing substantively meaningful spillover effects from
   correlated residuals is of great importance in cross-sectional studies.
   Both forms of spatial dependence not only hold different implications
   for the choice of an unbiased estimator but also for the validity of
   inferences. To guide model specification, different empirical strategies
   involve the estimation of an unrestricted spatial Durbin model and
   subsequently use the Wald test to scrutinize the nonlinear restriction
   of common factors implied by pure error dependence. However, the Wald
   test's sensitivity to algebraically equivalent formulations of the null
   hypothesis receives scant attention in the context of cross-sectional
   analyses. This article shows analytically that the noninvariance of the
   Wald test to such reparameterizations stems from the application of a
   Taylor series expansion to approximate the restriction's sampling
   distribution. While asymptotically valid, Monte Carlo simulations reveal
   that alternative formulations of the common factor restriction
   frequently produce conflicting conclusions in finite samples. An
   empirical example illustrates the substantive implications of this
   problem. Consequently, researchers should either base inferences on
   bootstrap critical values for the Wald statistic or use the likelihood
   ratio test which is invariant to such reparameterizations when deciding
   on the model specification that adequately reflects the spatial process
   generating the data.},

Abstract = {The 2013-14 People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC)-a mass protest
   movement that occupied a number of major Bangkok traffic
   intersections-bears a significant degree of responsibility for the fact
   that Thailand remains under a hybrid form of military rule today.
   Nevertheless, close scrutiny of the PDRC reveals that the movement was
   more diverse and wide-ranging than previously understood. Like the
   earlier People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which staged anti-Thaksin
   rallies in 2006 and 2008, the PDRC was actually a broad church of
   factions and individuals, united by little more than a shared disdain
   for the then government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Drawing
   on 48 interviews conducted with PDRC protesters in 2014, this article
   examines the diverse motives and circumstances that explained individual
   participation in these important protests.},

Abstract = {This paper is a study of the Islamic Republic of Iran's 1st- to
   12th-grade textbooks. This paper examines issues of language, race,
   ethnicity and religious nationalism in textbooks to cast light on how
   the state in Iran has striven to Perso-Shi'ify the polity through its
   education system. The official textbooks depict the sovereign community
   (Persians) as the sole agent of history. The state considers alternative
   (unofficial) narratives treasonous. This is an in-depth study of how
   Iran's state-sanctioned textbooks, their situatedness and the contextual
   knowledge gained from them offer revealing points of interpretation,
   illuminating the foundation of the existing structural ethnolinguistic
   dividing lines, and shows that Islamism, as the governing bounded logic
   implanted in textbooks, lends solidity to racial theories and
   historiographies. This study sporadically discusses the views and
   experiences of a number of Kurdish schoolteachers with whom we could
   conduct in-depth interviews.},

Abstract = {This article explores the nature of the process of nationalisation and
   the construction of nationality in Franco's Spain. Despite that
   nationalism constituted the principle axis of the narratives and the
   policies of the Francoist State, there has been scant research into the
   reach, the channels, and the role of Spaniards in the process of
   nationalisation. From a starting point of a complex conception of the
   Francoist national project, this essay seeks to reframe its analysis in
   light of the theoretical contributions of `banal nationalism' and
   `everyday nationalism'. As such, on the one hand, I intend to make clear
   the heterogeneity and the dynamism of Francoist nationalism and, on the
   other, to include individuals within the scene and further, and in
   particular, to take into account the role of daily experiences and the
   capacity for agency on the part of Spaniards on the ground, as
   participants and constructors of the national community.},

Abstract = {Tunisia's civil society has widely been identified as one of the factors
   that prevented the country from following the unfortunate path of other
   Arab states in which long-term autocrats were ousted in 2011. Hence, the
   EU has identified it as a key interlocutor, began to provide more
   substantial support to associations and started to regularly consult
   with activists. While substantial research has been devoted to the EU's
   financial assistance for civil society, interactions outside the
   donor-recipient relationship have received less attention. In line with
   this special issues' objective to examine how the EU projects democratic
   norms through its interactions with non-state actors in in the Southern
   Mediterranean, this article zooms in on its consultations with Tunisian
   civil society. It finds that the EU is including only a
   non-representative subset of civil society activists as a result of its
   practices. To what extent these activists' perspectives and preferences
   are conveyed to Brussels is not entirely clear either. Moreover, some of
   its practices strengthen the perception of the EU being a patronizing
   and paternalistic actor.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of `strategic nationalism' to
   explain the shift of national allegiance of most Alsatians and
   Lorrainers from Germany to France during the First World War. Combining
   the historiographical concept of `national indifference' with
   rational-choice theories of nationalism, the article examines why a
   growing number of local citizens came to defy the authorities'
   relentless demand of national loyalty. Contrary to previous studies that
   emphasize the dictatorial character of the regime and the passivity of
   local citizens, the article argues that national attitudes were shaped
   by strategic interests and highly responsive to shifts in state policy,
   regional circumstances and the course of the war. From mid-1918, it was
   less escalating state repression or dormant Francophile sympathies, but
   half-hearted liberalization of policy, the authorities' unfaltering
   insistence on national loyalty and imminent military and economic
   collapse that prompted people to see France as an attractive alternative
   to German rule.},

Abstract = {The rise of green industrial policy has injected purpose and competition
   into global environmental politics. Efforts to build green industry have
   raised the economic and geopolitical stakes of environmental issues as
   states seek to position their firms in global value chains and reshore
   strategic industries. This could help to generate the technologies and
   political momentum needed to accelerate global decarbonization. At the
   same time, these green interventions confront status quo interests and a
   variety of industrial policies that support fossil fuel-based
   industries. To help make sense of this new landscape, this introduction
   to the special issue defines green industrial policy and situates it
   within domestic political economy, social policy, and global
   geopolitics. We present six new studies that demonstrate and explore the
   global politics of green industrial policy. To illustrate the kinds of
   effects and implications of green industrial policy we are interested in
   exploring, we show how green industrial policy has transformed climate
   politics. Changes in state practice, ideas about the environment and
   economy, and technological cost declines came together to produce a new
   opportunistic and competitive climate politics. We then identify areas
   for further investigation as we call for a new climate politics research
   agenda, integrating green industrial policy more intentionally into
   studies of global environmental politics.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Special Issue `European transnationalism
   between successes and shortcomings: Threats, strategies and actors under
   the microscope'. Specifically, it focuses on transnationalism in terms
   of a key concept to be deployed while seeking to decode and evaluate EU
   political and legal governance-related choices, and particularly those
   made to address cross-border security threats. In doing so, it first
   explains the choice of `transnationalism' as focal point while referring
   to the current momentum, namely legal and political developments that
   have recently taken place or are currently under consideration. In this
   context, it looks both at current and diachronic transnational
   challenges, such as terrorism and irregular migration. Second, it
   explores the links between law and politics with respect to security and
   transnationalism, in order to present the background of this Special
   Issue as well as its added value. Third, it provides an overview of the
   studies included in the latter and explains how those are connected to
   each other, while seeking to identify which threats, strategies and
   actors shall be put under the microscope.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The article challenges the existing view of Mt Athos, a centre of
   Orthodox Christian monasticism, as a hotbed of Russian and Balkan
   nationalism at the turn of the 20th century. It proposes to analyse that
   complex situation using the concept of ``national indifference,{''} that
   is, prioritisation of concerns and loyalties different from the agendas
   pursued by nationalist activists. The article suggests that the
   motivations of most Russian and Greek monks in that autonomous monastic
   republic were dominated by traditional piety, corporate interests,
   mundane economic concerns, regional and dynastic loyalties. I will rely
   on Greek and Russian archival sources to discuss chronologically how
   those alternatives appeared to take the upper hand around several
   flashpoints from the return of significant groups of Russian friars in
   1839 after a late medieval hiatus to the end of over four centuries of
   Ottoman control of the area in 1912.},

Abstract = {It is widely understood that the environmental problem is getting
   borderless and challenging, requiring concerted efforts of many states
   and increasing the need for international agreements. However, only for
   the agreement to exist may not be sufficient-the agreement needs to be
   credible: obliging the signatories with actions associated with the
   goal, displaying clear and unambiguous rules, and involving third
   parties in the dispute settlement. Unfortunately, in the presence of the
   non-interference principle, the creation of a credible agreement may be
   implausible as, conceptually, the principle is innately antipodal to
   hard obligations and third-party involvement in the dispute settlement.
   This case study seeks to understand how the legalization of the ASEAN
   Agreement of Transboundary Haze Pollution conformed to the
   non-interference principle and influenced Indonesia, the main laggard,
   in dealing with the predicament accordingly. Diverging with the common
   understanding, the agreement seems to carry strong obligation and
   precision, as shown in the main agreement and its protocols. However,
   the apparent downside lies in the lack of delegation dimension, as the
   current dispute resolution is made through diplomatic efforts that led
   to fruitless outcomes. This study counters the simplistic view of the
   association between the non-interference principle and the lack of
   obligations. Overall, this study points out the importance of the
   delegation dimension in regionalization and encourages the
   interventionist approach concerning global environmental protection.},

Abstract = {Analyzing variation in treatment effects across subsets of the
   population is an important way for social scientists to evaluate
   theoretical arguments. A common strategy in assessing such treatment
   effect heterogeneity is to include a multiplicative interaction term
   between the treatment and a hypothesized effect modifier in a regression
   model. Unfortunately, this approach can result in biased inferences due
   to unmodeled interactions between the effect modifier and other
   covariates, and including these interactions can lead to unstable
   estimates due to overfitting. In this paper, we explore the usefulness
   of machine learning algorithms for stabilizing these estimates and show
   how many off-the-shelf adaptive methods lead to two forms of bias:
   direct and indirect regularization bias. To overcome these issues, we
   use a post-double selection approach that utilizes several lasso
   estimators to select the interactions to include in the final model. We
   extend this approach to estimate uncertainty for both interaction and
   marginal effects. Simulation evidence shows that this approach has
   better performance than competing methods, even when the number of
   covariates is large. We show in two empirical examples that the choice
   of method leads to dramatically different conclusions about effect
   heterogeneity.},

Title = {More Stick than Carrot?: Xi's Policy toward Establishment Intellectuals},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {After President Xi Jinping came to office, the Chinese government
   tightened its ideological control over establishment intellectuals and
   particularly the university teachers. This project aims to answer the
   question of why and when an authoritarian state chooses to do so. It
   focuses on the CCP's policy toward establishment intellectuals under Xi
   and explores the most applicable explanation for this policy shift.
   Based on the existing literature on the cyclical model of
   state-intellectual relations in China, we propose a new model of ``Dual
   Methods in State-Intellectual Relations.{''} The model demonstrates that
   the CCP has employed dual methods of repression and co-optation on
   intellectuals adopting different roles. Leaders choose repression when
   they perceive that the legitimacy of their rule is challenged externally
   or internally by criticism and collective actions led by intellectuals.
   In this case, the goal of repression is to either set up a new ``red
   line{''} or warn intellectuals that they have crossed it.},

Abstract = {This article analyses barriers to women's political representation in
   Indonesia and the ways that women candidates overcome them. Surveying
   the literature and drawing on three data sources - findings of thirteen
   teams of researchers studying women candidates running in the 2019
   election, a survey of 127 such candidates, and a nationally
   representative survey of Indonesian citizens - the article identifies
   widespread patriarchal attitudes as one significant barrier, alongside
   structural disadvantages. It highlights two distinctive methods by which
   women candidates aim to overcome these barriers: one group of candidates
   target women voters and draw on women's networks to mobilise what has
   been called ``homosocial capital{''}; another group of dynastic
   candidates rely on the political and financial resources of (often male)
   relatives. The article briefly surveys the place of political Islam in
   both impeding and facilitating women's representation. By surveying
   these issues, the article introduces this special issue on women's
   political representation and the 2019 election.},

Title = {Assessing Socio-Economic Factors Affecting the Implementation of Payment
   for Ecosystem Services (PES) Mechanism},
Journal = {WORLD},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {81-91},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) mechanism has been pursued as a
   means to provide incentives for achieving conservation goals while also
   promoting rural development by alleviating poverty. However, the degree
   to which these goals are met depends on the implementation of the
   programs, which depends on the desirability and accessibility of
   programs targeting rural communities. Understanding the factors
   motivating or dissuading PES is vital for successful implementation.
   This paper evaluated the determinants of locals' preference for PES
   implementation in the Begnas Lake Watershed. We interviewed 180
   residents representing upstream and downstream. Factors such as income,
   the distance between house and lake, knowledge about PES, education, and
   duration of living in the area significantly determined locals' attitude
   towards PES implementation. Their decision to take a stake in the PES
   program, if implemented, was influenced by income, family size, the
   distance between house and lake, education, and knowledge about PES. The
   majority of the household prefer community forestry as an institution
   and indirect payment as a compensation mechanism. The study suggests
   that the implementation of PES can contribute to uplifting the
   livelihood of local communities and conservation of Begnas lake
   watershed. The study further recommends the involvement of
   multi-stakeholders for ground-level awareness.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines to what extent the EU includes Moroccan and
   Tunisian civil society actors in bilateral political processes in the
   two policy domains of trade liberalization and anti-corruption. It finds
   that while the EU has strongly committed itself to more such
   interaction, gaps between its discourses and its practices remain. We
   observe variance between both sectors and both countries. Civil society
   is much more substantially included in EU policy processes in Tunisia
   than in Morocco, which is partly due to the EU's respect for some of
   Moroccan government's red lines. Moreover, the EU tends to be more open
   towards including civil society on transparency and anti-corruption than
   on trade. This may at least partly be explained by the fact that EU
   interests are more aligned with those of civil society on the former
   than on the latter.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is the largest public health crisis in recent
   history. Many states have taken unprecedented action in responding to
   the pandemic by restricting international and domestic travel, limiting
   economic activity, and passing massive social welfare bills. This begs
   the question, why have states taken extreme measures for COVID-19 but
   not the climate crisis? By comparing state responses to COVID-19 with
   those to the climate crisis, we identify the crisis characteristics that
   drive quick and far-reaching reactions to some global crises but not
   others. We inductively develop a conceptual framework that identifies
   eight crisis characteristics with observable variation between COVID-19
   and climate change. This framework draws attention to under-considered
   areas of variance, such as the perceived differences in the universality
   of impacts, the legibility of policy responses, and the different sites
   of expertise for both crises. We use this structured comparison to
   identify areas of leverage for obtaining quicker and broader climate
   action.},

Abstract = {The field of journalism in Azerbaijan is vastly understudied. Aiming to
   fill the major knowledge gap owing to the lack of any empirical data on
   Azerbaijan's media, this is an attempt to systematically study the media
   environment in Azerbaijan. Through a national survey based on the larger
   frameworks of the Global Journalist (GJ) and the Worlds of Journalism
   (WoJ) projects this study constructs a demographic profile of
   journalists in Azerbaijan. We find that the overall picture of
   journalism in Azerbaijan is, in many ways, similar to the global
   averages (i.e. education, ethnic and religious affiliation with majority
   groups). However, even when the findings are similar between Azerbaijan
   and other countries, especially the ``Western{''} countries with
   particular media systems, similar demographic characteristics can be due
   to a set of factors specific to Azerbaijani society.},

Abstract = {Chapter 2 clarifies the definition of sanctions and draws on the
   existing international relations literature to discuss four different
   expectations that speak to the central puzzle of this book. These
   expectations are based on structural, domestic, and cultural factors:
   China was simply `not yet powerful enough' to employ sanctions in a
   wholehearted manner; the Chinese political leadership may have at times
   been constrained by its domestic actors; China's participation in
   international institutions shaped its sanctions behaviour; and the
   Chinese political elite may have inherited certain predispositions that
   led them to favour the use of `carrots', like economic inducements, over
   `sticks', such as punitive sanctions. It finds that none of these
   explanations provide a wholly satisfactory answer to the puzzle.},

Abstract = {In eleventh-century China, a growing number of local men received a
   classical education and played a visible role in the government. Some
   passed the civil service examinations and held office, but those who did
   not also actively engaged themselves in local administration. These
   local men of culture, or local literati, had a dual identity: they were
   influential members of local society in their hometowns, but they were
   also participants in an empire-wide literati community that defined
   itself by a shared culture and supralocal networks. This chapter
   provides a case study of how local literati on the fringes of
   officialdom negotiated between these two identities and how they both
   cooperated with the state in local administration and protested against
   it in defence of local interests. The protagonist in this chapter is
   Zhang Yu, a Sichuanese literatus of the early Northern Song Dynasty who
   never held office but commanded great respect from local officials.
   Using his letters, parting valedictions, and commemorative inscriptions,
   this chapter explores how local literati provided political counsel and
   communicated their demands to the government. It argues that Zhang
   pursued, in different genres of his writings, several agendas that
   complemented one another. He eagerly fashioned himself as a true
   literatus in the metropolitan circles, which in turn strengthened his
   social standing and enabled him to weigh in on local policy and speak
   for local interests.},

Abstract = {Scholarship examining the highly successful ozone negotiations is rare
   today, as lessons derived from them do not seem to have produced
   comparable success in climate negotiations. This article argues that
   there is a ``missing piece{''} critical to understanding ozone
   negotiation success. I draw on path dependency and feedback literature
   as well as detailed historical research into the ozone negotiation
   process to propose a coherent feedback mechanism I refer to as the
   ``green spiral.{''} In a green spiral, an iterative interaction between
   negotiation outcomes and changes to the sticky, internal material
   interests of industry works to make more stringent regulation feasible
   in subsequent negotiating rounds. Such dynamics offer a consistent
   explanation for the overall success of the ozone negotiations as well as
   the timing and nature of individual countries' shifts in negotiating
   position and regulatory behavior over time. Understanding environmental
   negotiation through this lens offers insight into how outcomes of
   climate and other environmental negotiations might be improved.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of states and industrial policy in
   shaping the historical coevolution of energy and international order. I
   explore how states, by narrowly self-interested pecuniary goals, the
   desire for geopolitical advantage, and concerns about the political
   ramifications of domestic economic structure, use industrial policy to
   encourage the development of energy-intensive transportation and
   agricultural systems. Over time, increasingly energy-intensive systems
   allowed an increasingly complex international order to develop, one
   characterized by significant differentiation and specialization
   organized over a geographically expansive area. This contemporary
   complex order is dependent on fossil fuels. I argue that states retain
   geopolitical and domestic political incentives to use green industrial
   policy to develop the technologies needed to transition away from this
   fossil fuel dependence, but industrial policy today faces greater
   challenges than it did in the past.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, developing countries across the world have collectively
   experienced a series of economic upswings and downturns. Existing
   theories of international development, which mostly focus on
   country-specific factors that facilitate or hinder growth, cannot
   explain this across-the-board cycle. We argue that the cycle is driven
   by changes in the global supply of the US dollar, the default currency
   of transaction and foreign exchange reserves in the world economy. Based
   on a time-series-cross-section analysis with fixed effects on 170
   developing countries from 1973 to 2017, we find that an increase in the
   global dollar supply brings lower borrowing costs and greater
   availability of external financial resources, enabling higher growth
   rates in the developing world. Conversely, a contraction in the global
   dollar supply increases borrowing costs and dries up financial
   resources, slowing down growth in developing countries. The vagaries of
   the dollar supply, determined largely by the domestic political economy
   of the USA, have formed the context for international development
   contributing to the ``golden age of development{''} in the 1970s, the
   international debt crisis of the 1980s, the Asian Financial Crisis of
   1997-1998, and the beginning and end of rapid growth in the 2000s, among
   others.},

Abstract = {The current article problematises European Union governance arrangements
   in times of crisis. The debate is built by arguing for a conceptual link
   between policy learning and indirect governance in the EU. These two
   frameworks are seen as fundamental theoretical pieces for understanding
   the EU's learning journey and the resulting governance mechanisms during
   and after these major events. Yet, the article shows that none of these
   two approaches can explain on its own how EU governance evolves because
   of crises. It is rather by looking at the intersection between indirect
   governance and policy learning that we get a more complete picture of
   the EU governance landscape in times of crisis. This theoretical debate
   builds on recent EU crises and scrutinises the policy-politics link by
   concluding on the preferred forms of EU indirect governance in times of
   crisis, while adding insights from the literature on policy learning and
   entrepreneurship.},

Title = {Characterizing and Assessing Temporal Heterogeneity: Introducing a
   Change Point Framework, with Applications on the Study of
   Democratization},

Abstract = {Various theories in political science point to temporal heterogeneity in
   relationships of interest. Yet, empirical research typically ignores
   such heterogeneity or employs fairly crude measures to evaluate it.
   Advances in models for change point detection offer opportunities to
   study temporal heterogeneity more carefully. We customize a recent such
   method for political science purposes, for instance so that it
   accommodates panel data, and provide an accompanying R-package. We
   evaluate the methodology, and how it behaves when different assumptions
   about the number and abrupt nature of change points are violated, by
   using simulated data. Importantly, the methodology allows us to evaluate
   changes to different quantities of interest (for various estimators). It
   also allows us to provide comprehensive estimates concerning uncertainty
   in the timing and size of changes. We illustrate the utility of this
   flexible change point methodology on two types of regression models
   (Probit and OLS) in two empirical applications. We first re-investigate
   the proposition by Albertus (2017) that labor-dependent agriculture had
   a more pronounced negative effect on democratic survival before the
   ``third wave of democratization.{''} Next, we utilize data extending
   from the French revolution to the present, from V-Dem, to examine the
   time-variant nature of the income-democracy relationship.},

Title = {Generalized Full Matching},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {423-447},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Matching is a conceptually straightforward method to make groups of
   units comparable on observed characteristics. The method is, however,
   limited to settings where the study design is simple and the sample is
   moderately sized. We illustrate these limitations by asking what the
   causal effects would have been if a large-scale voter mobilization
   experiment that took place in Michigan for the 2006 election were scaled
   up to the full population of registered voters. Matching could help us
   answer this question, but no existing matching method can accommodate
   the six treatment arms and the 6,762,701 observations involved in the
   study. To offer a solution for this and similar empirical problems, we
   introduce a generalization of the full matching method that can be used
   with any number of treatment conditions and complex compositional
   constraints. The associated algorithm produces near-optimal matchings;
   the worst-case maximum within-group dissimilarity is guaranteed to be no
   more than four times greater than the optimal solution, and simulation
   results indicate that it comes considerably closer to the optimal
   solution on average. The algorithm's ability to balance the treatment
   groups does not sacrifice speed, and it uses little memory, terminating
   in linearithmic time using linear space. This enables investigators to
   construct well-performing matchings within minutes even in complex
   studies with samples of several million units.},

Title = {A Fast Estimator for Binary Choice Models with Spatial, Temporal, and

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Binary outcome models are frequently used in the social sciences and
   economics. However, such models are difficult to estimate with
   interdependent data structures, including spatial, temporal, and
   spatio-temporal autocorrelation because jointly determined error terms
   in the reduced-form specification are generally analytically
   intractable. To deal with this problem, simulation-based approaches have
   been proposed. However, these approaches (i) are computationally
   intensive and impractical for sizable datasets commonly used in
   contemporary research, and (ii) rarely address temporal interdependence.
   As a way forward, we demonstrate how to reduce the computational burden
   significantly by (i) introducing analytically-tractable pseudo maximum
   likelihood estimators for latent binary choice models that exhibit
   interdependence across space and time and by (ii) proposing an
   implementation strategy that increases computational efficiency
   considerably. Monte Carlo experiments show that our estimators recover
   the parameter values as good as commonly used estimation alternatives
   and require only a fraction of the computational cost.},

Abstract = {While a comprehensive body of research provides evidence that politics
   does not always stop at the water's edge, the question ``when does
   politics stop at the water's edge{''} has remained largely unanswered.
   This article addresses this gap in the literature by examining the level
   of agreement in Belgium's parliament on military deployment decisions.
   More specifically, the uncontested decisions to participate in the 2011
   Libya intervention and the air strikes against the self-proclaimed
   Islamic State in Iraq are compared with the contested decision to
   participate in strike operations against IS over Syrian territory. The
   results of our study indicate that a broad parliamentary consensus will
   emerge if the domestic political context forces left- and right-leaning
   parties into negotiating a compromise that takes into account their
   preferences regarding the scope of the operation and if left-leaning
   parties have no reason to oppose the operation because it pursues
   inclusive goals and its international legal justification is not
   contested.},

Abstract = {What explains the variation in individual support for the territorial
   integrity of the state that faces violent secession? While previous
   research has emphasised the role of state elites, institutions, and
   secessionist groups, this article elucidates the popular underpinnings
   of the state's response to secessionist claims. The proposed theory
   utilises in-group and between-group social distance to explain
   individual attitudes. Greater alienation from society leads people in
   the core state to reduce their support for the territorial integrity of
   the state. The perception of the cultural distinction of the
   secessionist group is associated with higher or lower support for the
   territorial integrity of the state, depending on the feasibility of
   reconquest of the secessionist territory. When reconquest is probable,
   support for the territorial integrity of the state will be positively
   associated with cultural distance. When it is improbable, support for
   the territorial integrity of the state will be negatively associated
   with cultural distance. The analysis of survey data from the South
   Caucasian countries that have struggled with secessionist movements for
   decades provides strong supportive evidence for these conjectures.},

Abstract = {Though conspicuous by its absence in debates among the British political
   and media establishments during the EU referendum campaign, the Irish
   border has been the central feature of Brexit as the implications and
   complications of trying to ``take back control of borders{''} have
   become apparent. Drawing on focus group data gathered between 2017 and
   2019 I employ ontological security theory to investigate the impact that
   Brexit is having on residents and communities living in the central
   Irish border region. In particular, I draw on the work of David Carr to
   explore the social role of memory and narrative in ontological
   (in)security and how this has manifested in the border region throughout
   the Brexit process. I find that the uncertainties generated by Brexit
   have caused border residents to draw on anxiety-filled memories and
   narratives from the securitised border of the pre-Good Friday Agreement
   era which they then project onto and vicariously through the next
   generation who, in turn, embody these anxieties, creating
   intergenerational ontological insecurity. Brexit has reintroduced, if
   not the physical border, the psychological borders of the past.},

Abstract = {The significance and influence of U.S. Supreme Court majority opinions
   derive in large part from opinions' roles as precedents for future
   opinions. A growing body of literature seeks to understand what drives
   the use of opinions as precedents through the study of Supreme Court
   case citation patterns. We raise two limitations of existing work on
   Supreme Court citations. First, dyadic citations are typically
   aggregated to the case level before they are analyzed. Second, citations
   are treated as if they arise independently. We present a methodology for
   studying citations between Supreme Court opinions at the dyadic level,
   as a network, that overcomes these limitations. This methodology-the
   citation exponential random graph model, for which we provide
   user-friendly software-enables researchers to account for the effects of
   case characteristics and complex forms of network dependence in citation
   formation. We then analyze a network that includes all Supreme Court
   cases decided between 1950 and 2015. We find evidence for dependence
   processes, including reciprocity, transitivity, and popularity. The
   dependence effects are as substantively and statistically significant as
   the effects of exogenous covariates, indicating that models of Supreme
   Court citations should incorporate both the effects of case
   characteristics and the structure of past citations.},

Abstract = {A recent paper in this journal examines the presence of convergence or
   divergence in terms of institutional quality among the Eurozone
   countries over the period 2008-17. Convergence is a long-term process.
   Furthermore, it may not follow a smooth and stable course since it can
   be affected by major episodes such as the recent crisis and the
   recession that afflicted Eurozone countries. Better insights can be
   drawn with the use of timeseries spanning over a longer period and by
   allowing for structural shifts in the process caused by important

Abstract = {This article focuses on electoral victories by wives of regional heads
   in West Sumatra province during Indonesia's 2019 elections. We argue
   that these victories can be explained by the emergence of a phenomenon
   we label ``neo-ibuism.{''} We draw on the concept of ``state ibuism,{''}
   previously used to describe the gender ideology of the authoritarian
   Suharto regime, which emphasised women's roles as mothers (ibu) and
   aimed to domesticate them politically. Neo-ibuism, by contrast, allows
   women to play an active role in the public sphere, including in
   elections, but in ways that still emphasise women's roles within the
   family. The wives of regional government heads who won legislative
   victories in West Sumatra not only relied on their husbands' political
   resources to achieve victories, they also used a range of political
   networks to reach out to voters, in ways that stressed both traditional
   gender roles and their own political agency.},

Abstract = {This study examines citizen's use of social media during the political
   crisis triggered by the Catalan Referendum. More specifically, we seek
   to shed more light on Catalan citizens' (dis)engagement on social media,
   examining what citizens did and did not do on social media, who they
   avoided and/or unfriended, and the implications of such behaviours for
   democratic citizenship in Spain. Our findings, based on 50 interviews
   with Catalan citizens, show that despite strong political partisanship,
   Catalans show little inclination to discuss political issues online and
   consequently develop what we term a teflonic social media behaviour
   (TSMB). By implementing these avoidance tactics, they refrain from
   commenting and sharing political information about the Catalan conflict
   on social media. Furthermore, when they happen, political discussions
   are mainly triggered by blatant lies or fabricated content that citizens
   from both sides of the political spectrum want to confront based on
   their own real-world experiences. We find that despite the fact that the
   independence movement has undeniably fuelled social and political
   conflict, the unfriend button on social media was only used when
   specific norms of uncivility were breached rather than as a reaction to
   the mere exposure to dissonant views and opinions.},

Abstract = {Some argue that national identity is constructed from the shared myths
   and `collective memories' of a nation, where heroes from a `golden age'
   and legendary figures embody national identity. However, when a national
   sample of British adults were asked to name the most important Britons,
   living or dead, they did not hark back to legendary figures, military
   leaders or sporting heroes, but identified their monarch, political
   leaders, and to a lesser extent, `household heroes' within their own
   family. `Banal', quotidian political leaders and Queen Elizabeth II
   symbolise national identity in Britain, although they sit alongside
   `hot' signifiers of nationalism personified, such as football hero David
   Beckham. This research suggests that studies of national identity should
   not be limited to examining essentialist claims of ethnonationalism, or
   civic attachments to laws and institutions, but also explore those whom
   the citizens of a given country identify as embodying their national
   identity.},

Abstract = {To what extent do China's linkages to the global economy translate into
   political influence in other countries? This topic is the focus of
   copious amounts of policy and scholarly attention in the USA and around
   the world. Yet without thoughtful conceptualization of key assumptions
   and creation of research designs that allow identification of mechanisms
   of potential influence, we cannot gain an accurate understanding of
   Chinese influence. How can we assess Beijing's intentions? Through what
   mechanisms-both intended and unintended-might influence arise, and under
   what conditions is influence most likely to occur? To what degree are
   Chinese companies agents of the state and therefore tools of economic
   statecraft? What factors condition how host countries react to economic
   ties with China? In this article, we explore existing scholarship on
   these questions, and assess promising directions for future research.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the national environmental agenda of Arab countries
   in the Middle East and Africa in an attempt to determine coherence of
   local efforts with the international environmental commitments these
   countries have made by signing and ratifying the Paris Agreement under
   the United Nations Framework and Convention on Climate Change. The paper
   succinctly summarizes the impacts of climate change on the countries of
   the region and the responses of individual countries to the eminent
   environmental threats. Using country specific data, the paper identifies
   the mitigation and adaptation measures that individual governments
   communicated in their initial Nationally Determined Contributions to
   combat climate change and support concomitantly the realization of the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals pertinent to climate
   impacts. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the overall environmental
   commitment and performance of the Arab countries and compares them to
   the average global performance. The findings indicate that most of the
   Arab countries are heading toward severe water shortages due to
   deteriorating water supply and growing water demand. The paper concludes
   that the Arab countries, individually and collectively embrace the Paris
   Agreement and engage in necessary measures to combat and/or adapt to
   climate change. Furthermore, the paper presents supporting evidence to
   show that the Arab countries are at par with the rest of the world when
   dealing with climate change issues.},

Abstract = {The political preferences of those with high and low incomes are highly
   correlated, and both groups become less supportive of redistributive
   spending as economic inequality increases. This article looks for a
   source of these interincome group correlations by examining trends in
   media coverage. We find that during periods of higher inequality, media
   coverage is more likely to focus on the personal characteristics of
   welfare recipients rather than the social consequences and causes of
   poverty. Observational and experimental data indicate that this shift in
   media frames can predict declining support for welfare spending, even
   for those with lower incomes who might benefit from redistribution.
   These findings help explain the reactions of the American public to
   rising inequality.},

Abstract = {Issues associated with collecting data on sensitive topics are widely
   studied in survey research. Respondents' reactions to sensitive
   questions have rarely been addressed from a longitudinal perspective,
   however, despite panel surveys representing a fundamental data source
   for social research. This article evaluates whether respondents'
   acceptance of sensitive questions increases with repeated interviewing
   in a panel survey. Drawing on data from the German Family Panel
   (pairfam), we apply fixed-effects regression models to assess
   within-respondent changes in refusal to items on sexuality and
   fertility. The analysis reveals that refusal attenuates for some, but
   not all questions under study and increases for other items over time,
   with patterns varying across age groups. We conclude that a general
   beneficial effect of panel experience on the refusal to answer questions
   regarding sexuality and fertility does not exist. Rather, refusal
   patterns appear to stem from aging processes and specific life
   situations.},

Abstract = {Making use of Carl Schmitt's theoretical tool kit, in this article, we
   intend to offer an insight into the liberal depoliticisation presupposed
   and sustained by the process of European integration. We argue that the
   comprehension of the current deficit of legitimacy of the EU -
   materialised in a formal self-constitution (which dismisses completely
   the question of the European demos) and a technocratic governance whose
   liberal-authoritarian traits produces an essential insulation of the
   decision-making processes - must pass through an engagement with the
   epochal and ideological conditions upon which it has been thought; that
   is the necessity to find a solution to the endless European civil war,
   on the ground of a widespread liberal forms of depoliticisation. In the
   exaltation of the law as a supreme/exclusive means of an indefinite
   process of integration, the political soul of integration has become
   lost, caged in formalist procedures deliberately intended to
   depoliticize the decision-making process. Leaning on Schmitt's concept
   of `neutralisation' and `depoliticisation' is functional to the
   comprehension of how the process of European integration has used the
   law, a liberal ethos and market economy and as strategies to thwart the
   political.},

Abstract = {Since the National Agency for Education added ``Digital competence{''}
   as a keyword and directive to the Swedish K12 Curricula (lgr11) in 2016,
   it has been the word on the lips of those involved in the business of
   educating children as a future workforce, and as both citizens and human
   beings (cf. Biesta). My approach to is less optimistic. Instead, it is
   more in line with Selwyn and Facer's (2013, p. 6) notion of ``critical
   studies of educational technology,{''} where the goal is to ``open the
   black box of technology{''} (p. 10), to expose underlying political and
   economic logics and dominating narratives where digital technology is
   used as a ``proxy signifier{''} for ``the future{''} (p. 11). I carry
   out a conceptual analysis of digital competence along with its
   ideological and temporal inclinations. This analysis is influenced by a
   foucauldian discussion of governance as well as the German historian
   Reinhart Koselleck's notion of ``conceptual hermeneutics{''} and
   temporal phenomenology, the aim being to decode how the agency of
   teachers is constructed through a policy-driven and individualistic
   futurology, based on the neoliberal assumption that educational
   technology is the solution to current problems in schools (Selwyn,
   2016).},

   communications which is potentially applicable to different languages,
   cultures and political structures. Political communications are defined
   not in relation to culturally pre-determined categories of relationships
   (allies, clients, friends, etc.), but as individual interactions or
   transactions between actors which have specific functions at specific
   times. The concept of `communicative function' is proposed as the basis
   for the profiling of relationships, which is in turn the basis for a
   culturally neutral comparative analysis of political communications.
   Examples are given of the application of this methodology to a number of
   Western medieval letter collections, an important source of evidence for
   political communications and networks, along with suggestions for future
   directions of research.},

Abstract = {There is much concern today about the spread of fake news and the
   misinformation it can produce among the public. In this article, we
   investigate how the American public interprets accurate and inaccurate
   statements from the news. Moving beyond partisanship, we theorize that
   ideological and ethnoracial identities also shape individuals'
   interpretations of the news. We argue that people have incentives to
   interpret information they encounter in ways that favor their
   ideological and ethnoracial ingroups and that these incentives are
   particularly strong when ideological and ethnoracial identities align.
   Using a survey that asks respondents to classify statements from news
   stories as facts or opinions, we find support for these hypotheses.
   Liberals and conservatives, and white, Black, and Hispanic respondents,
   more often classify as factual statements that favor their ingroup's
   interests while classifying information opposing their ingroup's
   interests as opinions. Holding cross-cutting ethnoracial and ideological
   identities diminishes these effects, while identities that align produce
   stronger ingroup biases in information processing, particularly among
   whites. Our study reveals that it is not only partisanship but also
   ideological and ethnoracial identities that shape how Americans
   interpret the news, and therefore how informed, or misinformed, they
   are.},

Abstract = {This article maps out how domestic scope conditions in Moldova have
   influenced and shaped the emergence of resilience in EU-Moldova
   relations and the implementation of EU resilience-building during the
   period 2014-2020. Drawing on scholarly works addressing the `resilience
   turn' in the study of European foreign policy, this article argues that
   EU external action towards Moldova post-2014 is marked by (i) a narrow
   and minimalist conception of resilience-building in so far as it
   revolved almost exclusively around EU demands for anti-corruption
   measures and the de-politicisation of the Moldovan judiciary, (ii) the
   responsibilization of local elites to pursue corresponding reforms, and
   (iii) the absence of a clear-cut resilience-building strategy for
   Moldova. It is suggested that the EU pursued a wavering course, made
   itself dependent on ruling elites, committed several U-turns and
   neglected the empowerment of local, non-governmental actors in making
   Moldova more resilient and free of corruption and oligarchic interests.
   The article demonstrates that EU resilience-building attempts in Moldova
   between 2014 and 2020 were a function of domestic scope conditions and
   the extent to which governing elites' reform rhetoric was perceived as
   credible by EU stakeholders.},

Abstract = {We introduce and assess the use of supervised learning in cross-domain
   topic classification. In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify
   topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an
   unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing
   training data makes this method significantly more efficient than
   within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over
   unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted
   to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate
   and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party
   platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target
   corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we
   further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of
   target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns
   topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies
   substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain
   classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present
   two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of
   parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.},

Abstract = {Tis paper aims to discover whether the rate of unemployment in the first
   two decades of the 21(st) century influenced electoral support for the
   radical left parties (RLPs). The election results for 37 RLPs were
   analysed at the level of the NUTS 2 regions. The impact of unemployment
   was examined using four indicators - general, youth, long-term and male
   unemployment rates. The aim was achieved through a multilevel regression
   analysis conducted for parliamentary elections between 2002 and 2019.
   The results suggest that RLPs are more successful in regions with a
   higher unemployment rate (general, long-term, male) across the years
   under review. A 1\% rise in the long-term unemployment rate led to an
   increase in support for RLPs of 0.2\% to 1.9\% in most NUTS 2 regions
   (179 out of 198). This effect is most pronounced in the regions where
   the centre-periphery cleavage associated with historically strong
   leftist tendencies can be observed, particularly in the case of German,
   Greek, Portuguese and Spanish regions. The main thrust of the paper is
   in the analysis of electoral support in parliamentary elections at the
   regional level, which is less represented in the thematic literature
   compared with the individual or national level.},

Abstract = {A significant number of studies have assessed the impact of medical
   tourism from economic, technological and social perspectives. Few
   studies, however, have explored the development of the medical tourism
   sector from a sustainability perspective. This research brings a
   sustainability lens to medical tourism by extending Hart and Milstein's
   framework (2003) for creating sustainable business value to advance the
   development of sustainable medical tourism facilities. To inform the
   analysis, the study conducted nine semi-structured interviews with
   members of the Jordan Medical Tourism Network (JMTN). Interview results
   confirmed the primary factors that motivate medical tourists, and
   characteristics of a sustainable medical tourism facility. The research
   provides insights on how sustainability is a driver of medical tourists'
   decisions and a core aspect to be managed. The study also provides
   direction to advance sustainable medical tourism facilities in Jordan
   with replicability in other jurisdictions. The research proposes a path
   for medical tourism facilities to play further roles in their
   contribution to sustainable development by introducing a framework that
   aims to integrate four business strategies for establishing sustainable
   value through the integration of stakeholders' interests and
   environmental practices.},

Abstract = {Although it is acknowledged that NGOs play an important role in the EU's
   policymaking, their role in external action is less studied due to the
   often closed-off character of foreign policymaking. This study helps to
   fill this gap by analysing the role of NGOs in the EU's external human
   rights policy towards China regarding the Xinjiang crisis. It is based
   on a content analysis of EU and NGO documents, as well as interviews
   with EU and NGO representatives. We find that NGOs act not just as
   policy entrepreneurs, but as moral policy entrepreneurs: they combine
   expertise with moral arguments about the EU's responsibility as a human
   rights leader to push the Xinjiang crisis higher on the EU's agenda and
   guide its response.},

Abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of independent candidates (calon
   perseorangan) in Indonesia's regional executive elections (Pilkada) to
   better understand why candidates run as independents and whether
   independent candidacy has reduced political inequality in the electoral
   system. In this study, we compiled candidate information using
   Indonesia's General Election Commission's (Komisi Pemilihan Umum, KPU)
   database as well as structured open-source searches to develop a data
   set and profiles of independents over three election cycles. Using this
   data set, we distinguished three categories of independents - partisan,
   non-partisan, and underdog independents - by analysing differences in
   power resources and motivations among the candidates. We found that
   contrary to public perceptions in Indonesia, independent candidacy has
   not helped to alleviate unequal access to political office. Successful
   independents are predominantly political insiders and local notables.
   This finding has important implications for democracy in Indonesia - we
   show how the inability for political outsiders to win political office
   harms democratic representation.},

Title = {Contradictory migration management? Differentiated security approaches
   to visa overstay and irregular border crossings in the European Union},

Abstract = {While the construction of migration as a security threat in Europe has
   been thoroughly examined, how different groups of migrants become
   targets of security concerns has not received similar attention. In its
   fight against irregular immigration, the European Union uses visa
   liberalisation agreements with neighbouring states as an incentive for
   cooperation on migration control. At a first glance, this strategy
   appears somewhat contradictory, as visa liberalisation potentially
   increases the share of visa overstayers among irregular migrants.
   Through analysis of the annual ``Risk Analysis{''} reports between 2015
   and 2020 published by EU's border and migration management agency,
   FRONTEX, this article shows that visa overstay is routinely left out of
   the agency's security concerns of irregular migration, thus rendering
   risk assessments asymmetrically occupied with irregular migration by
   means of ``illegal entry{''}. Although visa overstayers are not
   conceptualised as threats to security in discourse on par with other
   categories of irregular migrants, we find that they are increasingly
   subjected to a rationale of surveillance and risk.},

Abstract = {Multinomial logit (MNL) differs from many other econometric methods
   because it estimates the effects of variables upon nominal, not ordered
   outcomes. One consequence of this is that the estimated coefficients
   vary depending upon a researcher's decision about the choice of a
   reference, or ``baseline,{''} outcome. Most researchers realize this in
   principle, but many focus upon the statistical significance of MNL
   coefficients for inference in the same way that they use the
   coefficients from models with ordered dependent variables. In some
   instances, this leads researchers to report statistics that do not
   reflect the correct quantities of interest and reach flawed conclusions.
   In this note, I argue that researchers need to orient their approach to
   analyzing both the substantive and statistical significance of predicted
   probabilities of interest that match their research questions.},

Abstract = {After the 2016 Brexit referendum, European populist radical right (PRR)
   parties shifted towards what I call an alt-European policy programme.
   Alt-Europe is a conservative, xenophobic intergovernmental vision of a
   European `community of sovereign states', `strong nations' or
   `fatherlands', that abhors the EU's `centralised' United States of
   Europe. Whereas most work on the PRR examines its national impact and
   plots party programmes on a spectrum from soft to hard Euroscepticism,
   this article instead contributes to cutting edge transnational research
   on PRR narratives. I use qualitative content analysis to identify
   narratives that support or undermine alt-Europe, and tropes that refer
   to them, in the thirteen parliamentary, presidential and European
   election manifestoes since 2012 of four major PRR parties, AfD
   (Germany), PiS (Poland), Lega (Italy) and FN (France). Contesting the
   hard-soft dichotomy in Euroscepticism studies, the article identifies
   enduring alt-European master narratives across Europe. These stories of
   geopolitics, democracy, money and especially ethnic understandings of
   Christian civilisational identity offer important shared narrative
   resources for programmes of both reforming and replacing the EU. Common
   narratives also support the PRR unity needed to implement an
   alt-European programme. However, PRR parties' extreme nationalism and
   different interpretations of these narratives strongly impede this
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {According to conventional wisdom, closed-list proportional
   representation (CLPR) electoral systems create incentives for
   legislators to favor the party line over their voters' positions.
   However, electoral incentives may induce party leaders to tolerate
   ``shirking{''} by some legislators, even under CLPR. This study argues
   that in considering whose deviations from the party line should be
   tolerated, party leaders exploit differences in voters' relative
   electoral influence resulting from malapportionment. We expect
   defections in roll call votes to be more likely among legislators
   elected from overrepresented districts than among those from other
   districts. We empirically test this claim using data on Argentine
   legislators' voting records and a unique dataset of estimates of voters'
   and legislators' placements in a common ideological space. Our findings
   suggest that even under electoral rules known for promoting unified
   parties, we should expect strategic defections to please voters, which
   can be advantageous for the party's electoral fortunes.},

Abstract = {Conceptual innovations are a central feature of global environmental
   governance. Confronting degradation and unsustainability, scholars and
   practitioners turn to new concepts to identify, make sense of, and chart
   new directions towards meaningful governance solutions. But why do some
   concepts create lasting changes to governance institutions and
   governance practices, while others do not? Ideational theories of
   international relations highlight the importance of normative fit. In
   this paper we analysis the concept of ecosystem services to show that
   normative fit is just one dimension of governance fitness, which also
   includes practical fitness. Ecologists and economists coined the concept
   of ecosystem services to make biodiversity conservation intelligible to
   decision-makers versed in economic thinking. It has gained rhetorical
   traction, but ultimately failed to change how we treat nature because it
   lacks practical fitness. We interviewed fifty-six individuals working in
   twelve international organizations that have sought to translate the
   concept of ecosystem services into practice. Our analysis reveals forces
   limiting practical fit and constraining institutional uptake at three
   levels of analysis: structural, organizational, and agent. We present a
   cautionary tale that pushes scholars to carefully consider practical fit
   alongside normative fit when suggesting new concepts as organizing
   frames for how we govern global environmental challenges.},

Abstract = {Data has become one of the most valuable assets for governments and
   firms. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how data reshapes
   international economic relations. This paper explores various aspects of
   data politics through the lens of China's digital rise and the country's
   global engagement. I start with the theoretical premise that data
   differs from traditional strategic assets (e.g., land, oil, and labor),
   in that it is nonrival and partially excludable. These characteristics
   have generated externality, commitment, and valuation problems,
   triggering three fundamental changes in China's external economic
   relations. First, data's externality problem makes it necessary for
   states to regulate data or even to pursue data sovereignty. However,
   clashes over data sovereignty can ignite conflicts between China and
   other countries. Second, the commitment problem in data use raises
   global concerns about foreign government surveillance. As data is easier
   to transfer across borders than physical commodities, Chinese tech
   companies' investments abroad are vulnerable to national security
   investigations by foreign regulators. Chinese tech companies, therefore,
   confront a ``deep versus broad{''} dilemma: deep ties with the Chinese
   government help promote their domestic business but jeopardize their
   international expansion. Lastly, data's valuation problem makes
   traditional measures (e.g., GDP) ill-suited to measure the relative
   strengths of the world's economies, which may distort perceptions of
   China and other states.},

Abstract = {President Biden faces tremendous challenges to overcome political
   polarisation as he re-commits the United States to the Paris Agreement
   on Climate Change and promises decarbonisation of the US economy over
   the next three decades. To achieve deep decarbonisation, recent
   scholarship identifies the crucial role of broad policy mixes that
   create reinforcing effects between climate and energy policies to
   trigger technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote
   green growth, and ensure just energy transitions. Drawing on this
   literature, the article explores the conditions for developing such
   policy mixes in the US context in three policy phases. How and why have
   key policy conditions developed differently in the climate- and energy
   policy fields, and to what effect for decarbonisation policies? The
   analysis shows that growing political polarisation blocked bipartisan
   agreement, produced negative policy feedback, and caused instability in
   the climate policy field, whereas these mechanisms did not dominate the
   energy policy field. A more bipartisan approach to renewable energy
   policy allowed long-term experience and positive feedback in
   energy-policy programmes that helped to trigger technology innovation
   and subsequent GHG emissions cuts. Different policy conditions within
   these policy fields discouraged a coupling between them that could have
   facilitated green-growth policies. The economic shock caused by the
   coronavirus pandemic may potentially change policy conditions and build
   a path to deep US decarbonisation in the future, but only if political
   polarisation on climate change can be overcome.},

Abstract = {Do communities struck by disaster build back better, or not? Recent
   small- and medium-N studies have shown mixed effects. This mixed-methods
   study tests the effect of disasters on the adoption of solar power as a
   key form of building back better and adapting to climate change. To test
   this effect, we applied a large-N longitudinal matching experiment on
   cities affected and unaffected by disaster paired with qualitative case
   studies, focusing on the 2011 triple disaster in Japan and Hurricane
   Sandy in 2012 in the United States. We find that disaster-hit cities
   adopt more solar farms and rooftop solar than cities unaffected by
   crisis and that the social capital of these disaster-hit communities
   shapes their adoption patterns. By clarifying the effects of disasters
   on the build-back-better phenomenon in comparative cases, this article
   aims to guide recovery priorities after large-scale shocks.},

Abstract = {This article discusses how shadow politics is enacted in Georgia with
   shadow actors setting the agenda from the political backstage. It
   conceptualizes acting ``along with the state{''} as a novel form of
   informality, to describe a situation when state regulations are in place
   and shadow actors try to ``correspond{''} to such regulations not
   through adapting their actions but making the state adapt to their needs
   via modifying formal rules. Such an enactment of shadow politics is
   demonstrated based on two recent environmental cases. The paper
   describes how, on the one hand, a shadow actor strategically uses his
   both visible and invisible power for informal land appropriation and
   construction, as well as the purchase and transportation of century-old
   trees, while on the other hand, authorities challenge environmental NGOs
   and activists resisting his ``hobby{''} by politicizing their protest
   actions.},

Abstract = {Democracy promotion is a value-based foreign policy that nonetheless has
   geostrategic ramifications. This chapter explores the theoretical
   motivations for democratic states to integrate the agenda in their
   foreign policies and it also looks at the historical origins of the
   policy. It first discusses from a constructivist perspective how
   democracy promotion is related to the respective state's democratic
   identity and how it strengthens this identity. The chapter further notes
   how the Visegrad states integrated their democracy assistance agendas in
   their foreign policies as part of their socialization within the
   European Union and how in general the policies contributed to
   heightening their status among ``Western{''} states. Next, it touches on
   the issue of the geo-strategic and geo-economic implications of
   democracy promotion for donor countries and last, it looks at the role
   played by epistemic communities and former dissidents in laying the
   grounds for democracy promotion done by the Visegrad states.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the external and internal
   factors contributing to the state, status and thematic focuses of
   democracy assistance in the four Visegrad states. It looks at how the
   Visegrad states on the one hand ``download{''} various aspects of their
   democracy assistance policies from the EU level, but also how on the
   other hand they have attempted to ``upload{''} certain facets of their
   own know-how in this realm onto the EU level. As a particular case in
   point the chapter explores the role of gender mainstreaming and female
   empowerment in the democracy assistance agendas of the four states. In
   order to understand the contemporary dynamics and discussions of the
   future of democracy assistance in the foreign policies of the Visegrad
   states, the chapter reviews the internal domestic debates in the
   countries related to the export of democracy.},

   {[}Anonymous], Due to the difference in scales, statistical methods, and the choice of ecosystem traits or processes (Kannenberg et al., 2020), it is difficult to compare our recovery time directly with findings of other large-scale studies such as the work of Schwalm et al. (2012) and Yu et al. (2017). These two studies have yielded differing conclusions about the length and spatial pattern of recovery time at a global scale, as a result of their difference in the selection of drought indicator (drought severity index (DSI) versus standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)) and recovery level (non-drought versus pre-drought level) (Liu, L. et al., 2019). In regards to the present study, our quantification of recovery time should be unbiased through exclusion of drought events with no impact and by defining ecosystem recovery level at normal water balance as suggested by Liu et al. (2019). In addition, our metric of drought impact (fraction of departure from normal status) demonstrated good agreement with Saatchis metric in identifying the status of recovery post drought, with 84\%\~{}87\% of all complete drought events showing agreement with regards to recovery status (Table S3). Regarding methods for regression trees, we note that instead of using the traditional metric known as the Gini-based importance, our analysis adopted an alternative metric-variables. This is because the Gini-based importance was shown to be most strongly biased towards continuous variables or variables with more categories among available importance metrics (Strobl et al., 2007). Comparison of the two metrics in this study (Figure S6a) found the same issue, showing a bias with categorical variables such as dominant biome type lacking significant importance score while continuous variables such as post-drought hydrological condition had a significantly high importance score. Although importance scores differs in their significance level between the two metrics, they had similar ranks of explanatory variables (Figure S6a, b), both of which had drought return interval and post-drought hydrological condition as top two most important variables. This study could help to improve the modeling of vegetation dynamics by its identification of the factors that are most important for determining full recovery and approximating related thresholds of response. However, large-scale datasets at coarse resolutions, like 0.25 degree, make it difficult to uncover more nuanced drivers of variance in drought recovery (Kannenberg et al., 2020). In addition, how the legacy effects on canopy density affect carbon cycling, ecosystem species composition, age-structure of canopies, and more remain unclear. A cross-scale approach that pairs remote sensing observations with in situ ground based observations (i.e. species composition, flux tower data) would help bridge these issues of scale and of process-level understanding. Moreover, as we focused on analysis over fire-free areas of Australia, we are unable to inform vegetation dynamics in response to the combined effects of drought and wildfires, which have been shown to exacerbate the transition risk of ecosystems to alternative stable states (Brando, Paulo Monteiro et al., 2014). While many of Australias ecosystems exhibited FPAR and canopy density recovery following drought events of the MD, the potential of persistent canopy decline should not be underestimated, especially when drought events occur in rapid succession, or when the post-drought hydrological condition is average to moderately dry. Our study quantitatively supports the notion that ecosystems exposed to frequent droughts or a.

Abstract = {Quantitative research demonstrates that fighting clusters in space
   during civil wars, and that communities will be more likely to take up
   arms if they are located close to one or more other communities that are
   already engaged in combat. Yet the proposed explanations for such
   spatial clustering remain inadequate. Existing studies posit the
   importance of the dispersion of government resources, logistical
   connections among combatants, asymmetries of information and an
   assortment of negative externalities. Developments in the Syrian civil
   war indicate that only the second and fourth of these arguments look
   promising, and that threats to community security seem much more
   pertinent.},

Abstract = {Since the middle of the 2000s, the German 10-year government bond has
   been generally accepted financial benchmark of the Eurozone. The article
   analyzes the institutional structures that have contributed to German
   10-year bonds becoming the unquestioned Eurozone benchmark and the
   institutional privileges with which this central position on the
   financial markets is attended. The aim of this article is to understand
   why German bonds became the benchmark of the Eurozone and how it affects
   the structure of the financial markets today. By doing so, this article
   seeks to develop an institutional understanding of the power structure
   on the financial markets. It will be shown that that Germany's benchmark
   status is not the result of economic factors, but of ongoing cognitive
   and normative discourses. The article complements the economic approach
   with an institutional perspective. It also complements the political
   science debate, which has thus far primarily concentrated on the
   economic and political consequences of a high spread.},

Title = {Dual Elite Recruitment Logic and Political Manipulation under Xi Jinping},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {04},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Under Xi Jinping, the cadre recruitment policy of the Chinese Communist
   Party (CCP) has been adapted. What are the political implications of
   these adaptations? This paper argues that Xi has sought to consolidate
   his power among the political elite and strengthen grassroots governance
   by introducing a new cadre recruitment policy. We propose the concept of
   ``dual elite recruitment logic{''} as an aid to interpreting the cadre
   recruitment strategy in the Xi era: the CCP's system for appointing and
   promoting cadres at the full provincial/ministerial level
   ((sic)(sic)(sic) zhengbuji) and the grassroots follows' criteria that
   are different from those formulated under the previous ``rejuvenation of
   cadres{''} principle. While China under Xi may be able to maintain
   political stability and promote socio-economic development in the short
   term, the lack of a new succession mechanism is the biggest obstacle to
   China's future political development.},

Abstract = {Using composite indices that quantify the quality of institutions and
   democratic functioning, the paper argues that Turkey has always deviated
   in terms of liberal democracy and civil liberties from the average EU
   norms. Due to the democratic backsliding of recent years this gap is
   rapidly widening. These differences constitute one of the two
   insurmountable fundamental barriers that have always prevented full
   membership irrespective of all other impediments. The democratic gap
   barrier is compounded by the sheer size of the economy and the
   population. Both present an unprecedented challenge to EU's integration
   capacity with important political repercussions for the Union's
   institutional functioning. Full membership was never a reasonably
   realistic and pragmatic goal. Both the EU and Turkey have benefits to
   reap from maintaining a strong and close relationship founded on a more
   pragmatic partnership target.},

Abstract = {Race and racial attitudes are central to American politics. To
   understand these relationships, scholars often use measures developed in
   earlier social and political contexts. A key issue is thus whether such
   measures consistently capture the same construct across varied contexts.
   Changes in the social and political context may result in generational
   differences in how people interpret certain racial attitude items given
   different socialization experiences. Such differences make generational
   comparisons on these items invalid because the items capture different
   considerations. I build on recent work investigating this possibility
   and test the racial resentment measure's equivalence between Millennial
   and older Whites. Despite potential generational differences, I find
   that the racial resentment measure operates equivalently across
   generations using two different analytical approaches (retrospective
   thought-listing and multi-group confirmatory factor analysis). The
   racial resentment measure offers valid insights into racial attitudes
   across generational cohorts. I conclude by discussing what this finding
   implies for emerging work on the manifestations of prejudiced attitudes
   among Millennial Whites and also suggest potential points of improvement
   for the measure.},

Abstract = {In this research note, we argue that a segment of Trump voters may be
   motivated to demonstrate that they are not racially insensitive by
   saying they voted for Obama in 2012. As a result, what may appear as a
   substantial group of swing voters may be-in part-partisan voters who
   want to avoid perceptions of racial bias. Using data from a survey of a
   nationally representative nonprobability sample from YouGov, polling
   data from the 2016 election, and a survey experiment conducted with a
   convenience sample of American adults, we find that Obama-Trump voters
   score significantly higher on a social monitoring scale than others and
   that respondents are significantly more supportive of Trump when they
   are given the opportunity to mention who they voted for in 2012. The
   combination of results suggests that the number of Obama-Trump voters
   may be overestimated due to self-monitoring.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Transparency is now a core principle in environmental and resource
   governance. Responding to calls for a clearer identification of pathways
   from transparency to effective change, this article identifies three
   ``Theories of Change{''} for governance-by-disclosure and applies them
   to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Among the
   best known global transparency initiatives, the EITI has used an
   inclusive multistakeholder governance model and elaborate compliance
   standards, disclosing trillions of dollars in natural resource revenues.
   Yet, after two decades, the EITI is still largely without an explicit
   and proven theory. This study finds that a Theory of Change for the EITI
   is possible, valuable, and even necessary as the EITI risks becoming
   obsolete in some participating countries. The proposed Theories of
   Change provide valuable templates for environmental and resource
   governance, yet such models need to reflect national contexts, needs,
   challenges, and objectives to ensure fit and effective implementation,
   including measures enforcing accountability.},

Abstract = {While we know a lot about the typical type of radical right-wing (RRWP)
   voter, individual religiosity in explaining support for RRWPs has eluded
   consistent scholarly attention. The mixed results available from the
   scarce literature find both positive and negative associations between
   religiosity and RRWPs vote. The variation in these relationships is
   puzzling, especially if we consider how RRWPs often present themselves
   as guardians of native ethnic and religious identity. In this paper we
   argue that religiosity increases the chance of voting for RRWPs when
   ethnic relations are a salient issue in the political system. We test
   our theory using multilevel regression modeling on the European Social
   Survey, specifically Rounds 7, 8 and 9 and replicate our results based
   on the European Values Study from 2017. We find that religiosity is a
   significant predictor of the RRWP vote when there are salient ethnic
   relations in the political system, proxied by the presence of an ethnic
   minority party. On the other hand, in countries without minority
   parties, non-religious individuals are more likely to vote for RRWPs.},

Abstract = {The article examines the role of NGOs in the politicisation of EU
   security. The focus of the empirical analysis lies on the field of EU
   counter-terrorism. The cases selected are two different types of legal
   acts, adopted in the aftermath of serious terrorist attacks in EU member
   states: The EU data retention directive and the EU passenger name record
   (PNR) directive. These policies present intrusiveness and relevance for
   Brussels-based and national civil rights NGOs since they both aim to
   touch upon individual liberties, like privacy rights or the right to
   protect personal data. The article goes further by opening up the black
   box of politicisation. It does so by assuming that politicisation is
   characterised by a certain level of salience, actor range and
   polarisation. The paper links politicisation literature to research on
   the influence of interest groups that are discussing, for example,
   voice, access or litigation as strategies. Therewith, the paper
   contributes to the scientific debate on politicisation in two ways:
   First, it sheds light on the so far disregarded role of NGOs in
   politicisation. Second, it builds a bridge to interest group literature
   by examining repertoires of NGOs in politicisation.},

Title = {China's policy and finding ways to prevent collapse in WEEE processing
   in the context of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary
   Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal},

Abstract = {Based on the generally accepted view that the issues of climate change
   and the consequences of environmental pollution have no boundaries, the
   question of how countries are able to negotiate is of particular
   importance. After China's refusal to import e-waste, the environmental
   agenda of importing countries increasingly shares an opinion about the
   need to find alternatives for the disposal of this kind of waste.
   However, the question of how quickly such alternative solutions can be
   implemented, and whether such a delay contributes to the excess
   accumulation of waste remains open. In this regard, the research
   question is defined as follows: what challenges does the existing policy
   of China create for exporting countries and China itself with regard to
   WEEE exports and whether the scenario of returning to the previous model
   of import-export interaction between China and exporter-states is
   acceptable? To study these issues, the work uses the method of political
   and legal analysis, as well as the method of case study. The article
   suggests that today the role of China is uncontested, since today the
   level of production of electronic and electrical equipment significantly
   exceeds the volume of WEEE. At the same time, the number of existing
   facilities and personnel of companies involved in the processing of WEEE
   is critically out of proportion to the growing volume of waste. In the
   context of the applicability of the Basel Convention on the Control of
   Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, the
   study examines the reasons for China's refusal to import WEEE, as well
   as perspective areas of legislative regulation of China in the field of
   handling WEEE. The study and assessment of the prospects for legal
   regulation in this area in China against the background of global
   initiatives determines the purpose of this study.},

Abstract = {The Kosovo myth is often seen as a critical supporting case for
   ethnosymbolist theory. Many theorists of nationalism and area scholars
   see this myth as either the direct continuation or creative
   reinterpretation of a long-standing epic and liturgical tradition among
   the Slavic Orthodox population in the Balkans. Using primary and
   secondary sources, this article traces how pre-modern cultural and
   communicative memories of Kosovo were transformed into a modern
   nationalist myth of the Serbs and, then, the Yugoslavs. It argues that
   cultural rupture and change rather than continuity or recurrence
   characterise the history of these scattered and ambivalent pre-modern
   legacies. The evidence shows that the medieval monastic texts and epics
   referring to the Kosovo battle cannot be considered as the `widespread
   ethnic memories' necessary in ethnosymbolist theory. However,
   ethnosymbolist theory is multifaceted. The article's findings about the
   Kosovo myth suggest that scholars can adopt only a weak minimalist
   version of ethnosymbolism, which views this approach as a research
   programme or a focus of study rather than an explanatory theory. This
   version does not contradict modernist constructivism but aligns with the
   neo-Weberian tradition of longue duree research within it.},

Abstract = {Can EU comprehensive trade agreements effectively promote international
   labour standards, despite their soft enforcement rules? And if so, under
   what conditions? This paper addresses these questions by focusing on a
   hard case study, namely Vietnam's ratification in 2019 of the ILO
   Convention 98 on the right to organize and collective bargaining. Such a
   ratification is an epochal change for a mono-party regime lacking
   recognition of independent trade unions. This paper shows that the EU
   has emerged as a key partner of ILO in promoting international law in
   Vietnam and explains such a result from a political economy perspective.
   This case study provides insights into the extent to which a trade
   partner is dependent upon international trade increases the leverage of
   the EU, and especially the European Parliament, and ultimately affects
   the ability of the EU to emerge as a normative power through trade.},

Title = {Post-Democracy and Historicism: The Hidden Origin of the Korea-Japan
   Trade War},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Since Japan's imposition of export controls against Korea in July 2019
   and its following countermoves, including the termination of the General
   Security of Military Information Agreement, the governments of both
   countries have presented their own narratives of the origin of this
   trade war, both of which mirror theories of international politics.
   Nonetheless, these narratives mask several domestic origins. Most
   importantly, this paper demonstrates that behind the trade war, there
   has been a preoccupation of the two governments with mutually
   irreconcilable version forms of historicism. One is Korea's
   pro-naturalist historicism, seeing Korean history as being preordained
   by the universal laws of human progress and defining Japan as a
   historical reactionary. The other is Japan's anti-naturalist
   historicism, upholding internationalism as a new driving force of
   history that will transform Japan from a war criminal state into a
   proper subject in international society while criticizing Korea as being
   a drag on this transformation. This paper argues that, resulting from
   decades-long neoliberal politics that have disturbed the state-society
   balance, the national structure of post-democracy has encouraged each
   government to push historicism to its limit as an alternative source of
   political legitimacy in lieu of democratic accountability. Concretely,
   it shows that post-democracy has determined (1) the historicist framing
   of emerging conflicts, (2) the government's legislative struggles to
   realize historicist policies, and (3) the incontestability of
   historicist hostility by other ideas in each country.},

Abstract = {Long-standing meteorological research has established that anthropogenic
   climate change increases the risk and intensity of extreme weather
   events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, and forest fires. However,
   comparatively little is known about the impact of such events on policy
   ambition. Studies on the topic emerged only recently and tend to focus
   on individual country cases. A comprehensive cross-country perspective
   is still missing. This article addresses the gap in the literature using
   large-scale analyses on the basis of country-level data from 2008 to
   2017. The findings indicate that extreme weather events propel only
   highly functioning democracies to tackle climate change. Effects among
   remaining country cases are insignificant. This variation in the data
   can be attributed to democracies' concern for the common good and the
   perspectives of those most affected by climate-related disasters.},

Abstract = {Bilateral and multilateral development agencies spend a great deal of
   time, money, and effort trying to shape the reform priorities and
   processes of their counterpart countries. However, the means by which
   development agencies can achieve these ends are poorly understood. This
   article draws upon the first-hand experiences and observations of more
   than 1000 public sector officials from 70 low- and middle-income
   countries to better understand which external sources of reform advice
   and assistance are most and least useful to public sector
   decision-makers-and why. We find that donors more effectively shape
   reform priorities when they choose to deliver their funding through the
   public financial management systems of counterpart countries, rather
   than using channels of aid delivery-in particular, technical assistance
   programs-that bypass host governments and signal a lack of trust in the
   motivations and capabilities of the local authorities. This finding
   holds true even after controlling for institutional quality, or the
   trustworthiness of public sector institutions, in aid-receiving
   countries. As such, our results call attention to the fact that
   development agencies can amplify their policy influence by entrusting
   their counterpart governments with aid management responsibilities.},

   audience of securitising discourse. Taking the Hungarian case of border
   control, it looks into how the police accept and buy into anti-immigrant

   legitimation in shaping officers' understanding of mass migration. It
   describes the ways in which attitudes and hence, arguably, practice can
   be conditioned by securitising discourse. The overall aim of the article
   is to advance the understanding of the narrative dimension of power
   struggles between police and the political elite, and how that
   structures the field of border security. Critical security scholars have
   pointed out that police filter securitising discourse based on their
   professional dispositions and preferences. However, the Hungarian case
   seems to suggest that discourse may, in fact, influence dispositions
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Political candidates must possess not only a desire for a position in
   government, but also a tolerance for the electoral process typically
   required to attain it. Recent works suggest that this latter requirement
   may keep certain types of people out of the potential candidate pool. We
   contend that individuals high in empathic concern are one such type.
   While compassion for others may make certain aspects of public service
   attractive, it should also make some of the more negative features of
   political campaigns repellant. We find support for this theory among two
   national samples. Those higher in empathic concern were more likely to
   express nascent ambition when considering a political position that was
   appointed rather than elected. This work further illustrates how
   exploring the interaction of psychological dispositions and political
   institutions can contribute to our understanding of the behavior of
   politicians and the quality of representation.},

Title = {BRINGING SOCIAL CONTEXT BACK IN ENRICHING POLITICAL PARTICIPATION
   SURVEYS WITH MEASURES OF SOCIAL INTERACTION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT
   DATA},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {264-288},
Abstract = {This article demonstrates the utility of combining individual survey
   data with social media content data in order to analyze how social
   context predicts individual behavior. The lack of valid and reliable
   measures of the contexts of social interaction in which individuals are
   embedded has remained an Achilles heel of the survey method. The reason
   is that the collection of direct observation of social interaction
   requires qualitative analysis of the context, which, hitherto, has been
   too costly to collect on a large scale. Instead, researchers have
   resorted to indirect measures such as aggregate group composition,
   respondent reports of social context, and institutional accounts.
   However, with the recent advent of social media data, contemporary
   social scientists now have social interaction data on an unprecedented
   scale. To utilize these data for quantitative analysis, researchers have
   to transform text prose into good measurement. We combine qualitative
   content analysis and supervised machine learning in order to ensure both
   semantic validity and accuracy in our measure of social interaction in
   Facebook groups. To test the substantive performance of the direct
   measures of social interaction, we use it to predict individual
   participation in refugee solidarity activism in Denmark. Additional
   testing indicates that the direct measure cannot easily be replaced by
   indirect measures of social interaction derived from group composition
   and institutional accounts. We also show how contexts and individual
   respondents can be effectively sampled using Facebook groups. Finally,
   the article discusses the limitations of social media data and points to
   alternate settings where our design is applicable.},

Abstract = {The article deals with constructing and/or reproducing sites of national
   memory and cultural heritage among Georgian immigrant communities in the
   USA (New York City) and Germany (Berlin and Regensburg). Georgian
   immigrant communities in the USA and Germany consist of ``old{''} and
   ``new{''} arrivals, with people of various ages as well as different
   professional and employment backgrounds. We try to address the
   questions: how do socio-economic challenges, legal immigration status,
   job opportunities and living conditions influence immigrants' attitudes
   toward national identity and culture? How do plans to stay and integrate
   into host societies define the ways immigrants ``practice{''}
   nationalism? The symbolic realm of Georgian immigrant communities in the
   USA and Germany consists of both tangible and intangible sites of
   national identity and memory, as well as cultural heritage. We reflect
   on how national identity is ``crystalized{''} and represented in
   material and physical settings (churches, and icon corners at home, for
   instance) and in certain national, cultural, and religious practices.
   These practices as cultural expressions manifest in preserving the
   native language, adhering to the Christian faith, celebrating Orthodox
   Christian holidays, learning national songs and dances, maintaining
   traditional cuisine, and eating habits, and more.},

Abstract = {We develop a new measure of party position based on a scaling of
   ideology tags supplied in infoboxes on political parties' Wikipedia
   pages. Assuming a simple model of tag assignment, we estimate the
   locations of parties and ideologies in a common space. We find that the
   recovered scale can be interpreted in familiar terms of ``left versus
   right.{''} Estimated party positions correlate well with ratings of
   parties' positions from extant large-scale expert surveys, most strongly
   with ratings of general left-right ideology. Party position estimates
   also show high stability in a test-retest scenario. Our results
   demonstrate that a Wikipedia-based approach yields valid and reliable
   left-right scores comparable to scores obtained via conventional expert
   coding methods. It thus provides a measure with potentially unlimited
   party coverage. Our measurement strategy is also applicable beyond
   Wikipedia.},

Abstract = {Italy is depicted as a populist promised land. Especially within Western
   Europe, Italy is an outlier in terms of support for and varieties of
   populist parties. Yet, common explanations of populism do not fully
   account for the Italian exceptionality, while single-country studies
   often present time-wise limited focus or anecdotical evidence. This
   article contributes by providing a novel interpretation of Italian
   populism since 1945 through a three-step process. First, the Italian
   populist success is theoretically linked to societal
   anti-parliamentarism and anti-elitism, whose roots date back to the
   formation of the unitary state and its institutional weakness. Second,
   it is argued that traditional intra-country differences in terms of
   voting behavior still matter when it comes to providing the opportunity
   structure for populist parties. Finally, a preliminary empirical
   analysis shows that - in line with expectations - different political
   traditions across the national territory are likely to determine the
   success of specific types of populism. The findings are relevant for the
   generation of new hypotheses about the societal origins of contemporary
   populist parties.},

Abstract = {What explains the electoral dominance of a single party over a prolonged
   period of time in a democracy? Focusing on the case of India's former
   dominant party, the Indian National Congress, this article argues that
   authoritarian-era politics can influence the likelihood of single-party
   dominance after democratization. More specifically, the axes of
   political contestation in the authoritarian era interact with the
   process of democratization to shape democratic-era party systems. When
   the authoritarian era's primary socio-political division becomes
   irrelevant because the democratization process roundly discredits one
   side of the division, the resulting party system in the democratic
   period is likely to feature a single major party and a host of small,
   disorganized, and inexperienced parties. Such asymmetric party
   competition is particularly likely to produce a dominant party. This
   explanation not only accounts for the fragmented nature of the
   opposition in early post-independence India, which was central to
   sustaining single-party dominance, but it can also potentially shed
   light on single-party dominance (or its absence) elsewhere in the world.},

   powerful at inducing the subjects to converge on a sustainable

   agreement still remains an open issue, because even small incentives to
   defect can undermine the compliance stability, and therefore break the

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting public health measures necessitated
   many workplaces to permit workers to work from home. The question is now
   asked can the temporary transition to enable workers to work from home
   become more permanent and how will this shape the spatial distribution
   of employment opportunities and, in turn, workforces. This paper focuses
   on the potential for ICT-supported working from home arrangements to
   reshape employment opportunities in rural settings. With limited local
   employment opportunities being a major driver of rural out-migration,
   enabling rural residents to access a broader range of employment through
   ICT may result in a longer term disruption to rural out-migration
   patterns. Despite the potential of ICT to support remote working, uptake
   in rural areas has been relatively low. This paper argues that the
   recent increase in use of ITC-supported working from home arrangements
   promoted by COVID-19 public health measures may erode of two of the
   major barriers to participation in remote working-these being negative
   perceptions by the employer and employer about working from home and
   limited knowledge within workplaces about how to manage a partly or
   fully remote workforce. For rural populations it is plausible that the
   rapid transition to ICT-supported working from home arrangements will
   open up more diverse employment opportunities. However, it remains that
   for some rural areas and populations the urban-rural digital divide
   persists as a barrier to participation in ICT-supported remote working.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, there has been a noticeable increase in the use of
   quantitative techniques in the study of ethnicity and nationalism,
   without, however, a sufficient amount of reflection on how these
   techniques have contributed to our understanding of ethnic and national
   identities. As such, in this exchange three sets of authors answer
   questions about the degree to which it is possible to use quantitative
   data to measure ethnic and national identities, which types of methods
   are most suitable in measuring these identities and what the major
   research findings of this quantitative research are that were not
   possible using qualitative approaches.},

Abstract = {This Forum article explains how many of today's calamities-specifically,
   climate change, biodiversity loss, and COVID-19-are the result of
   humanity's ongoing relationship to wildness. For millennia, humans have
   pushed unpredictability and discomfort out of their immediate
   surroundings in search of security and convenience. They have been
   remarkably successful. Today, many people, but especially the affluent,
   rarely encounter wild animals, suffer exposure to the elements, or even
   have to tolerate the capriciousness of other people. But wildness is
   akin to energy: it cannot be created or destroyed. As people craft
   havens of stability, they do not eradicate wildness but shove it into
   the lives of the less fortunate and onto the global level. These days,
   marginalized people face profound vulnerability, and key biophysical and
   social systems on Earth are spiraling out of control. This article
   demonstrates the dynamics of global wildness. It shows how trying to
   banish wildness from one's surroundings leads directly to climate
   change, mass extinction, and COVID-19. It ends by advancing a strategy
   of rewilding as a way to address these challenges. It suggests that
   opening to greater uncertainty and a modicum of discomfort-both
   individually and collectively-can relieve some of the pressure
   generating global wildness and offer an ethically appropriate
   orientation for this moment of planetary intensification.},

Abstract = {A comparative history of the social and stylistic characteristics of
   letter-writing in the Western Latin world and in China has yet to be
   written. Among other difficulties, the historical study of
   letter-writing in China has only recently attracted scholarly attention,
   and the social and intellectual contexts of epistolary culture in China
   and the Latin West were in many respects strikingly different. This
   chapter compares, in a longue duree perspective, the differing
   assumptions that conditioned the development of epistolary genres in
   China and Europe, with a particular focus on the Song period (the period
   of ars dictaminis in Western letter-writing culture). It concludes by
   proposing a variety of potential methodological frames that could be
   fruitful in future comparative research.},

Abstract = {In creating four General commands (zonglingsuo) between 1141 and 1145,
   at the end of the first Song-Jin war, the central government of the Song
   Empire hoped to marshal resources from the four areas along the new
   border while also controlling the military officials in charge of the
   armies. With the fragmentation of the monetary system, this financial
   organization resulted in a real autonomy of these strategic areas.
   Eventually, this reform induced the fragmentation of the fiscal and
   financial authority and, as accounting procedures became more complex,
   generated a new kind of technical communication between the regional and
   the central administrations. Lastly, it allowed high-ranking civil
   servants involved in this process to reinforce their institutional
   positions.},

Abstract = {Digital media has ushered in a new era of awareness and advocacy on the
   rights of people with disabilities. In the absence of personal
   experience and contact, digital media plays a considerable role in
   shaping knowledge and attitudes towards disability, especially since
   traditional media has long neglected to represent the realities of
   disabled populations. Where there is a space for disability issues, it
   is often centered in models of charity and ableism. Mainstream media has
   failed to properly encourage critical literacy within the larger
   population, literacy required in order to cultivate citizen
   participation. In developing nations, these issues are compounded in
   minority populations, which results in very little control over the
   shaping of democratic processes for citizens with a disability. However,
   the development of Web 2.0 has offered a platform for disability
   activists to engage in new and surprising ways. Activists may package
   information and content without censorship and editing. Thus, they are
   able to communicate authentic emotions and frustrations in their own
   words. Utilizing a wide variety of digital platforms, people with
   disabilities are able to disseminate democratic educational resources
   from around the globe. Trans-border disability activists have made a
   tremendous impact on the world as a whole. Social tagging also provides
   a direct line of communication between activists and political parties,
   politicians, and other stakeholders. This chapter will discuss the ways
   in which disability activists in Zimbabwe have used digital platforms to
   educate their communities on disability rights and to expand resources
   for civic engagement for people with disabilities.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the evolution of Syrian nationalism, showing how
   the early pan-Arabist ideals of the Baathist founders morphed into a
   cult of personality focused narrowly on emotional attachments to the
   regime. Current Syrian state nationalism is a ``constructed
   primordialism{''} consisting of vague and sentimental concepts of the
   Syrian people and their history, despite the fact that the Syrian state
   in its current territorial identity has only existed for a few decades
   and incorporates a diverse mosaic of ethnic, cultural, religious and
   national backgrounds. In the absence of a cohesive pre-existing
   community to form the basis of Syrian national identity, the regime
   tempered its nominal commitment to Arabism with heavily Romanticized
   rhetoric emphasizing familial bonds of love and devotion between the
   people and the leader. This primordialist construct has thwarted the
   emergence of a civic-oriented national identity in Syria and contributed
   to tensions underlying the current civil war.},

Abstract = {Over the years, literature studying stateless diaspora formation through
   a transborder social movement studies approach is growing. The recent
   rise of Hong Kong diaspora provides an emerging case of stateless
   diaspora that introduces new empirical insights into the scholarly
   literature. Using a mixed-method research strategy, this study
   empirically investigates the formation of the Hong Kong diaspora as a
   `historically contingent process', through which overseas Hongkongers
   were mobilised during the 2019-20 Anti-Extradition Bill Movement
   (critical event) to join global protests (mobilising practices) by
   diaspora groups and activists (mobilising agents). Achieved transborder
   outreach across the Global North by mobilising their strong moral and
   cultural resources, it remains to be seen whether the emerging Hong Kong
   diaspora will move towards a full-fledged, sustained identity-based
   movement. The case study of Hong Kong diaspora offers new comparative
   insights and establishes a mixed-method analytical framework for
   comparing stateless diaspora worldwide.},
