Title = {STRATEGIES FOR DETECTING INSINCERE RESPONDENTS IN ONLINE POLLING},

Abstract = {While the migration of public opinion surveys to online platforms has
   often lowered costs and enhanced timeliness, it has also created new
   vulnerabilities. Respondents completing the same survey multiple times
   from different IP addresses, overseas workers posing as Americans, and
   algorithms designed to complete surveys are among the threats that have
   emerged in this new era. This paper is an attempt to measure the
   prevalence of such respondents and their impact on survey data quality,
   while demonstrating methodological approaches for doing so. Prior
   studies typically examine just one platform and rely on closed-ended
   questions and/or paradata (e.g., IP addresses) to identify untrustworthy
   interviews. This is problematic because such data are relatively easy
   for bad actors to fake. We carried out a large-scale study with an eye
   toward overcoming these limitations. This study examines the threat of
   insincere respondents using large samples from six online platforms:
   three opt-in survey panels, two address-recruited survey panels, and a
   crowdsourced sample. Rather than relying solely on closed-ended
   responses, we incorporated an analysis of 375,834 open-ended answers. By
   their very nature, open-ended questions offer a more sensitive indicator
   of whether a respondent is genuine or not. The study found that the
   incidence of insincere respondents varied significantly by the type of
   online sample. Critically, insincere respondents did not just answer at
   random, but rather they tended to select positive answer choices,
   introducing a small, systematic bias into estimates like presidential
   approval. Two common data-quality checks failed to detect most insincere
   respondents.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the internal impact of the Minority Treaty of
   Versailles, regulating minority rights and protection in the emerging
   interwar Polish state. The parliamentary debate on the Treaty was a
   critical juncture structuring the political sphere and arguably fostered
   the birth of `ethnic democracy' in Poland. Performing a sequential
   analysis of the debate, I study the reconfiguration of political
   positions which locked the actors into their strategic entrenchments.
   Unexpectedly, the nationalist right defended the treaty because of their
   involvement in the Versailles negotiations. The left tried to
   delegitimize the treaty and simultaneously tip the scales of the
   domestic politics in favour of the minorities. This shifted the levers
   of implicit assumptions about the political community and effectively
   blocked the political efficacy of the treaty on the domestic level. Such
   refraction effects must be considered when one is studying convergence,
   diffusion and the role of international agreements and pressures.},

Abstract = {Territorial integrity is one of the central tropes in contemporary
   Georgian cultural memory and historical imaginaries. The article traces
   when, how, and why the narrative of the ``miraculous victory{''} of
   medieval Georgian King David IV the Builder over Seljuk Turks in the
   Battle of Didgori in August 1121 and his seizing of Tbilisi entered the
   Georgian ``realms of memory{''}. This complex and often contradictory
   mnemonic legacy, shaped by medieval, imperial (Tsarist and Soviet), and
   nation-state (the First Republic and post-Soviet Georgia) conjunctures,
   feeds the current representations of this military success as a symbol
   of the unification of the Georgian state. In the Soviet and post-Soviet
   ``regimes of memory{''}, the story of Didgori and reconquering Tbilisi
   became intertwined with territorial nationalism. In the unilinear Soviet
   Georgian narrative, these victories appear as ``progressive{''} and
   unifying occurrences. In the post-Soviet period, ethnoreligious
   nationalism and re-sacralization of David's image and the challenges to
   the country's territorial integrity motivated Georgians to zoom in and
   magnify selected images of the glorious past. These historical events
   represent a fateful and luminous episode in the nation's history that
   fed hope for an analogous victory and restoration of the country's
   territorial integrity.},

Abstract = {The early monumental statues of Ataturk in Turkey have so far been
   studied from the perspective of the state and its ambition to
   disseminate a national consciousness. While this state-centric approach
   has been helpful to understand the role of symbolism in nation-building,
   it ends up reducing people to a passive recipient of symbolic
   indoctrination. We, in contrast, approach public perception as an active
   component in the discursive construction of these monuments over time.
   We first analyse the period until the death of Ataturk in 1938 during
   which the democratic possibility of conflicting with the official
   narrative remained quite minimal. We then look at the aftermath of
   Ataturk's death, which coincides with the introduction of the multiparty
   democracy in Turkey where there were more critical engagements with
   these monuments, particularly by the right-wing constituents and
   politicians. We conclude that such resistance was still discursively
   bound by the nationalist context within which it operated. Our analysis
   of the politics of symbolism in Turkey taps into the theoretical works
   of Hanna Pitkin and Warren Breckman.},

Abstract = {Since the 2016 US presidential campaign and the rise of the \#MeToo
   movement, issues of sexual assault and harassment have risen to
   prominence. At the same time, these issues have also been understood and
   evaluated through the lens of partisanship. The US Supreme Court
   confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh exemplified these dynamics by
   providing clear partisan and emotion-laden cues to citizens. Given these
   events' temporal proximity to the midterms, we argue that the
   confirmation hearings not only amplified an ongoing conversation, but
   also heightened the effect of sexist predispositions on turnout. Using a
   unique online survey with validated voter turnout in the 2018 midterms,
   we find that higher levels of modern sexism increased turnout among
   Republicans while lower levels of modern sexism increased turnout among
   Democrats. In 2018, sexist predispositions triggered turnout in opposing
   ways across the aisle.},

Abstract = {The recent growth of the secular population in the United States has
   implications for American politics. However, our understanding of these
   implications has been hindered by oversimplified concepts and measures
   that equate secularism with non-religion. We separate the two concepts,
   distinguishing ``non-religiosity,{''} or the absence of religion, from
   ``secularism,{''} or a positive embrace of secular beliefs and
   identities. Using original national-sample cross-sectional and panel
   surveys, we introduce new measures of secularism, evaluate their
   properties, and assess their connection to political attitudes and
   behavior. We find a clear distinction between secularism and
   non-religiosity in the American public and show that secularism is more
   closely related than non-religiosity to political attitudes,
   identifications, and engagement. In fact, while secularism is related to
   changes over time in political orientations, non-religiosity is not.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen the rapid passage and modification of family
   leave policies in Latin America, a surprising trend, given the region's
   historically conservative gender norms. This article argues that the
   rise of new paternity leave policies-as well as the modifications to
   longer-standing maternity leave policies-reflects contending visions of
   gender and the family, mediated by the institutions and actors that
   populate the region's political landscape. Using an original dataset of
   family policy measures, this article finds that the factors facilitating
   the adoption of new, vanguard policies, such as paternity leave,
   function in ways different from those that shape the expansion of
   longer-standing policies, including maternity leave.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {The marine plastics crisis sparked a wave of corporate interest in the
   circular economy, a sustainable business model that aims to eliminate
   waste in industrial systems through recycling, reduction, reuse, and
   recovery. Drawing on debates about the role of corporations in global
   environmental governance, this article examines the rise of the circular
   economy as a dominant corporate sustainability concept, focusing on the
   flagship example of the circular economy for plastics. It argues that
   corporations across the plastics value chain have coordinated their
   efforts to contain the circular economy policy agenda, while extending
   their markets through developing risky circular economy technologies.
   These corporate strategies of containment and proliferation represent
   attempts to ``future-proof{''} capitalism against existential threats to
   public legitimacy, masking the implications for environmental justice.
   The paradox of the circular economy is that it seems to offer radical
   challenges to linear ``take-make-waste{''} models of industrial
   capitalism, backed by international legislation, but it does not
   actually give up on unsustainable growth. We need to tackle the plastics
   crisis at its root, dramatically reducing the global production of toxic
   and wasteful plastics.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue demonstrates the scope and breadth of the response by
   political scientists to the 2011 Arab uprisings. The contributions show
   the significant, rigorous development of understanding key mechanisms
   and issues such as protest mobilization, repression, sectarianism and
   international alliances. They also demonstrate the enduring relevance of
   the Area Studies Controversy, the value of building and exploiting new
   data sources, and the importance of close attention to cases. At the
   same time, they reveal growing problems with access to Middle Eastern
   countries for political science research. The articles reveal intriguing
   similarities and differences between the European and American fields,
   and the potential for productive dialogue.},

Title = {The Middle East in global modernity: Analytic polycentrism, historic
   entanglements and a rejuvenated area studies debate},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5, SI},

Abstract = {I argue that theories of global modernity/world society offer a
   promising inter-disciplinary approach for theorizing the Middle East.
   They provide a conceptual umbrella for a rejuvenated Area Studies
   debate. I turn first to earlier (inter-disciplinary) debates of that
   kind and then discuss how a rejuvenated debate can reach for new shores:
   I address the Middle East Area Studies Controversy, and then Fred
   Halliday's distinction between `analytic universalism' and `historic
   particularism'. Focusing on the interstices between Area Studies and
   International Relations (IR), I suggest that scholarship on the Arab
   uprisings offers insights on how to transcend this distinction by
   shifting to `analytic polycentrism' and `historic entanglements'. I
   identify the unpredictability of power relations and local/global
   horizons as central, and often marginalized perspectives brought to the
   fore in post-Arab uprising scholarship. I then discuss how these
   insights can be linked to innovative (inter-disciplinary) debates in IR
   that draw from historical-sociological theories of global modernity and
   world society, especially how the concepts of emergence and evolution as
   well as differentiation and subjectivity - central pillars of world
   society theories - can be made of use for the study of the Middle East's
   place in global modernity and global IR generally speaking.},

Abstract = {Cognitive complexity is a concept that allows scholars to distinguish
   unidimensional thinking from multidimensional thinking, which allows
   citizens to identify and integrate various perspectives of a topic.
   Especially in times of fake news, fact-free politics, and affective
   polarization, the news media would ideally foster such complex political
   understanding. The current paper introduces the method of cognitive
   mapping to measure cognitive complexity regarding citizens'
   understanding of the financial crisis, one of the most pressing
   political issues of the past decades. Linking content-analytic data to
   panel-survey data, we examine how exposure to news about the crisis
   relates to cognitive complexity. A wide variety of news sources (print,
   television, and online) were analyzed to take the high-choice media
   environment into account. Results show that news consumption generally
   is related to a less cognitively complex understanding of the financial
   crisis. However, actual exposure to news about the crisis (combined
   measurement of content analysis and survey data) is positively related
   to cognitive complexity, particularly among less-educated citizens. In
   addition, the most prominent topics in news coverage were more
   frequently associated with the financial crisis, as reflected in the
   cognitive maps of less-educated citizens exposed to more crisis news.
   These findings demonstrate the potential of news media to increase
   citizens' complexity of understanding, especially among the less
   educated.},

Abstract = {Climate change policy is an important test case for how political agents
   use narratives to address complex policy issues and define its scope and
   impacts in a multi-level context. Harnessing a theoretical approach
   based on framing analysis and the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), the
   article asks to what degree agents at the level of domestic
   parliamentary discourse expand narrative stories of climate action to
   agents and institutions at the European level. Empirically, the present
   study investigates deliberations during the current elective period of
   the German Bundestag (2017-) on climate change and general EU debates to
   identify and compare narrative accounts of three groups of agents with
   opposed ideological views and institutional roles: namely, delegates of
   Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Alliance90/Greens (B90), as well as
   representatives of the Federal Government. Testing hypotheses addressing
   the form, strategy and scope of climate policy narratives articulated by
   these three groups, we find some but not all classical expectations of
   research based on the NPF confirmed: While narratives of the Greens and
   AfD differ strongly concerning their underlying beliefs and forms of
   narrative vilification and dramatization, no evidence is found for the
   assumption that climate-sceptical discourse has a stronger European
   narrative dimension.},

Abstract = {Chapter 7 examines which of the five competing hypotheses as detailed in
   Chapters 2 and 3 best explains China's puzzling sanctions behaviour. It
   finds that China's longstanding rhetoric against the use of unilateral
   sanctions had resulted in China not being able to openly threaten or
   admit to the use of such economic tools in its pursuit of political
   goals. China's use of unilateral sanctions under the period of
   examination (if at all present) was therefore ambiguous and unofficial,
   targeted at narrowly specific sectors, and limited in scope.
   Furthermore, China found itself having to withdraw or further reduce the
   extent of sanctions when other parties used rhetorical action such as
   shaming or flattery to draw international attention to China's
   behaviour.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Espoo Convention and its role in construction industry as an

Abstract = {In the construction industry, there are many risk management models, the
   purpose of which is to bring the project to full implementation, namely
   to minimize possible violations of project deadlines, deviations from
   the quality of work, reduce financial costs and so on. However,
   contractors and subcontractors are faced with a high level of risk when
   implementing a construction project. The problem is that contractors
   have formed problem-solving systems that are purely local, which means
   they are intuitive and unsystematic and cannot extend beyond local
   initiatives and construction solutions. Besides that, the construction
   industry forms a whole list of environmental problems, such as excessive
   consumption of energy resources, changing landscapes and an increase in
   household and industrial waste. Construction can have a significant
   impact on the local environment and the energy intensity of the built-up
   environment could increase significantly over the next decade. The
   concept of environmental impact assessment, introduced by the Espoo
   Convention, is directly related to the concept of risk management, since
   it involves minimizing them at the initial stages of the implementation
   of construction projects. According to the Convention, the assessment
   procedure should be carried out at an early stage of planning (Paragraph
   3 Article 2 of the Convention). The purpose of the study implies to
   consider environmental impact assessment as a successful construction
   risk management tool. This study is designed to analyze the
   effectiveness of the Convention's mechanisms in practice in risk
   management and create a reliable legal background for developing an
   innovative integrated and systematic method of assessing risks in the
   implementation of a construction projects. The implementation of such an
   integrated approach is primarily aimed at preventing the causes of the
   risk and not at eliminating the consequences of existing risks in
   current and potential infrastructure projects, the activities of which
   fall under the scope of the above-mentioned Convention.},

Abstract = {The most powerful European Union (EU) member states have suffered
   devastating terrorist attacks in the past decades and identify Islamist
   terrorism as one of the most pressing threats to their national
   security. They recognize that instability in the southern neighbourhood
   has exacerbated the threat Islamist terrorism poses to their national
   security. Adopting an intergovernmental approach, I argue that member
   states' southern strategies are a product of threat perceptions and
   policy response preferences. This article creates a typology of security
   strategies through using content analysis to categorize EU member
   states' threat perceptions and policy response preferences as indicated
   in national security strategies produced in 2009-2018 period. Based on
   my analysis of member states' threat perceptions and policy response
   preferences to threats emanating in the southern neighbourhood, I
   conceptualize three southern security strategies: restraint,
   preventative engagement, and selective intervention. Based on this
   typology, I identify the EU member states' southern security strategy.
   Focusing particularly on the most powerful EU member states, namely the
   EU-5 , I then apply this typology to make some tentative predictions on
   the shifts in the EU's southern strategy post-Brexit. I expect the EU's
   southern security strategy to shift towards one of selective
   intervention in the post-Brexit period.},

Abstract = {Education on recycling must be provided during the first school years
   because environmentally aware students are more likely to become
   environmentally aware citizens. The aim of the present study is to
   investigate the factors affecting the recycling behavior of students
   attending the last grade of primary school in the regional unit of Evros
   in Greece. To select the sample, multistage sampling was used, and to
   collect the research data, a questionnaire with closed-ended items was
   designed. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics,
   the non-parametric Friedman test, and categorical regression. Our
   results showed that the students had positive views, attitudes, and
   behaviors in relation to recycling and were actively involved in it.
   Categorical regression analysis indicated that the other family members
   affected students' recycling behavior to a high degree, whereas
   students' parents' occupation and students' participation in
   environmental education programs at school exerted a lower influence on
   their recycling behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite the paramount role of drylands in supporting people's
   livelihoods and rendering ecosystem services, legislation on
   Environmental Impact Assessment has been introduced belatedly after
   several decades. By exemplifying Iran, the author proposes two main
   reasons for such a delayed action. First, drylands are misleadingly
   considered as barren lands where biodiversity is relatively low. In one
   classification, deserts are even categorized along with rocks. Second,
   the author emphasizes that drylands have been subjected to unprecedented
   changes due to the expansion of infrastructure and urbanization that
   started in the 1970s. These growing pressures have been beyond the
   ecological resilience of drylands and have not been monitored, assessed,
   and modified correctly. Further scrutiny regarding EIA undertakings in
   drylands and the way they can be improved is now needed.},

Abstract = {For decades now and particularly during the 2020 presidential campaign,
   American conservatives have stressed the need to protect ``religious
   freedom.{''} Building on research documenting a connection between
   Trump-support, a desire to privilege conservative Christianity, and
   perceptions that conservative Christianity is persecuted due to its
   anti-LGT (lesbian, gay, or transgender) views, we theorise such factors
   were the ideological driving force behind prioritising ``religious
   freedom{''} in the 2020 presidential election. Drawing on national
   survey data from just after the November election, we find Christian
   nationalism and perceptions of anti-Christian discrimination are strong
   predictors that (1) Americans feel ``religious freedom{''} was an
   important factor influencing their vote and (2) that they ranked it the
   single greatest factor influencing their vote. In contrast, the
   perception that LGT persons are not discriminated against also predicts
   viewing religious freedom as important, as does a perception of
   anti-Semitism, but never perceptions of anti-atheist or anti-Muslim
   discrimination. Findings suggest conservative Christian supremacism,
   fear of (Judeo-)Christian persecution and belief that LGT persons are
   privileged are ideological antecedents of votes for ``religious
   freedom.{''}},

Abstract = {Among a wide range of challenges, EU member states have been facing a
   growing threat from terrorism in the recent years. The primary
   responsibility for combating terrorism lies with each individual member
   state, although the threat is becoming increasingly cross-border and
   diverse. Regardless of whether terrorism poses a real or perceived
   threat to the states' and citizens' security, public opinion is one
   important force behind the extensive counterterrorism efforts undertaken
   in Europe. In this article, we explore the influence of public opinion
   on EU policy within the security domain in the period 2005-19. We
   investigate the relationship between the number of attacks carried out
   on EU territory and citizens' increased concern for terrorist attacks,
   as well as the attention given to this topic by EU decision-makers.
   Based on data from Eurobarometer, the Global Terrorism Database, and
   evidence from official documents, we perform an analysis of the
   connection between public perception and anti-terrorism policy
   coordination in the EU. The results of this investigation point to
   increasing levels of collective securitization and an ever-stronger
   focus on security and counterterrorism in the European Union. Our
   findings are related to policy formation in the EU.},

Abstract = {As the urgency for green transformation grows, the question of whether
   finance capital can be harnessed to promote green transformation has
   been raised. Public pension funds are of particular interest since they
   are publicly governed, have long-term interest, and are growing in
   proportion to the global investment capital. However, transformative
   change demands a reprioritization of fundamental values in terms of
   trade-offs among economic, environmental, and social ends. This article
   identifies shifts in value judgments in public pension fund investments
   and particularly focuses on the institutional constraints by which value
   (re)priorities are resisted by investigating Swedish public pension
   funds. While there are signs of environmental embedding of the economy,
   I also note neutralization of the role and investment strategies of the
   funds, which has a stabilizing rather than a transformative function.
   The neutralization constrains deep green transformation, which demands
   politicization of the role of institutional investors.},

Abstract = {Both populism and nationalism are rooted in the idea of popular
   sovereignty. They look alike when populism gravitates towards the right,
   identifying ``the people{''} with an ethnic or racial majority, and when
   nationalism turns against the minorities. But populism can also go
   towards the left, embracing the low-income citizenry as the nation's
   ``true people,{''} just as nationalism can include ethnic and racial
   diversity under its umbrella. Some other key differences are also
   noteworthy. Populism is inevitably defined as an anti-elitist doctrine,
   whereas nationalism is often led by the elites. Moreover, embedded as it
   normally is in state institutions, laws, school textbooks, museums and
   maps, nationalism can be a state ideology, taking routinized forms. In
   contrast, populist politics thrives on a virtually relentless
   mobilization of popular energy. Nationalism acquires this fervent form
   mainly under two conditions: when it is secessionary, trying to break
   states up, or when it becomes majoritarian, attacking internal
   minorities. Otherwise, nationalism can easily exist in a quieter
   register.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present findings of a research project focusing on the
   tensions between the idea of `Europe' and that of the `nation' as well
   as on perceptions of national and popular sovereignty in times of
   crisis. We start from the assumption that in the context of the recent
   crisis, EU politics have become `normal politics,' generating political
   passions, polarization, and a deeper Eurosceptic mood. Working on the
   emblematic case of Greece, we focus on two critical moments (referendum
   2015 and Prespa Agreement 2018) so as to address the question of how the
   idea of `Europe' was politicized and reconceptualized in its competitive
   symbiosis with perception(s) of the `nation'. Drawing on discourse
   analysis and ethnographic research, we maintain that European identity,
   in this critical juncture, was not deconstructed but rather remodelled
   in constant tension with national identity.},

Abstract = {High levels of crime are a key driver of emigration from Latin America
   and the Caribbean. But can emigration change public opinion about how
   best to respond to crime? Focusing on the political economy of
   remittances-the money migrants send to their families and
   communities-this study argues that emigration can increase support for
   violent responses to crime. Migrants' families often spend remittances
   on investment goods, which makes them more vulnerable to crime and more
   supportive of violence to protect themselves. An analysis of
   AmericasBarometer data finds that remittance recipients are more likely
   both to fear crime and to be victims of crime than nonrecipients. They
   are also more approving of vigilantism, more tolerant of police bending
   the law to apprehend criminals, and more supportive of deploying the
   military in crime fighting. These findings contribute to our knowledge
   of the consequences of international migration for political development
   in migrant-sending countries.},

Abstract = {Turkey has experienced a heterogeneous collection of social movements
   and protests. While scholars have given substantial attention to coups
   in this context, it remains unclear if the Turkish Armed Forces have
   ever defected in favour of civilian mobilization during periods of
   political instability. In large-N databases on defection, cases in
   Turkey are either disproportionately skewed towards coups or are fully
   absent of observations on defection during resistance campaigns. In this
   study, we analyse cases spanning 1959-2017 to trace patterns of
   defection. Through triangulating qualitative evidence from memoirs of
   former military officers, media reports, and interviews carried out with
   multi-generational political actors, our analysis reveals that three
   instances of defection occurred in times of mass mobilization, two of
   which were vertical and one horizontal. Alongside three other instances
   of defection that occurred during coup attempts, these results
   illustrate the highly dynamic nature of defection in the Turkish context
   through interrelated processes of mobilization, defection, and coups.},

Abstract = {We present a polling strategy to predict and analyze runoff elections
   using the 2017 French presidential race as an empirical case. This
   strategy employs rejective probability sampling to identify a small
   sample of polling stations that is balanced with respect to past
   election results. We then survey the voters' candidate evaluations in
   first-round exit polls. We poststratify the voter sample to first-round
   election returns to account for nonresponse and coverage issues, and
   impute missing candidate evaluations to emulate campaign learning. Next,
   the votes for eliminated competitors are redistributed according to
   their supporters' lower-order preferences. Finally, the predictions are
   validated against official results and other polls. We end with a
   discussion of the advantages and limitations of this approach.},

Title = {Tri-Marium as the `emancipation' of Last-Central Europe:
   framing European counter-narratives in Poland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-114},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The historical notion of inter-Marium captured Poland's centuries-old
   concept of integrating, in a form of confederation, the new states that
   appeared on the map between the Baltic and Black Seas after 1918.
   Reincarnated as the contemporary narrative of Tri-Marium, this notion is
   gaining new momentum and has been most visible in Poland, the largest
   state of the European Union's Eastern semi-periphery. This article
   examines Inter-Marium as one of the most clearly articulated
   counter-narratives to the mainstream European integration project.
   Drawing on original research rooted primarily in critical discourse
   analysis, the article uses framing as an interpretative tool. It
   analyses the narrative entrepreneurs who are constructing the political
   message, as well as the resulting narrative itself and how it is
   employed in contemporary discourse. Unpacking this emancipatory framing,
   the paper makes three inter-connected arguments. First, it shows that
   the Inter-Marium concept narratively challenges Western domination
   (framed as post-colonial constellation) and re-constructs the connected
   emancipation narratives. Second, the article highlights that the
   Inter-Marium concept acts as acounter-narrative to the mainstream
   European integration. Third, it explores the ways in which the
   Inter-Marium narrative serves the ambitions of the Polish ruling party
   which aims to regain Poland's historical status as aregional power.},

   Case Study in Iran},

Abstract = {The walkability of urban areas is an important criterion related to the
   level of physical activity and public health of citizens. This research
   aims to measure this parameter in Golsar town located in Rasht, Iran.
   Two methods were used in this research: Street connectivity and
   International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The principal
   variables of street connectivity were measured in four districts of
   Golsar by Geographic Information System (GIS) to rank each one. Then,
   the acquired results were compared by the average walking time of the
   respondents of the questionnaire. The comparison explicitly indicated
   that there is a strong positive correlation between the measures of
   street connectivity and people's tendency to walk. As well, District 1
   had the highest value of connectivity and the highest average time for
   walking amongst the four districts. This supports the contention that
   walkability and the level of outdoor physical activities of people in
   each district are undoubtedly under the influence of the variables of
   street connectivity. Nevertheless, the evaluation of other indexes such
   as proximity, land use mix, safety, and density in Golsar, in future
   research. can expand our perception of the walkability of this region.},

Abstract = {Since the last review of public opinion on European defense policy and
   NATO concluded that Europeans wanted both European defense integration
   and a continuing commitment to NATO, the EU has almost doubled in size
   and new initiatives have been launched to develop a Common Security and
   Defense Policy (CSDP). We reexamine these issues and trace public
   opinion trends in all 28 EU member states from 2000 to 2019. With little
   variation across countries, general support for CSDP and NATO remains
   substantial. While Europeans, especially in continental Western Europe,
   believe that the EU should take a more independent approach from the
   United States in security and diplomatic affairs, large segments of the
   publics show no clear opinion on whether European defense should mean a
   transfer of decision-making power from the state to the EU level and the
   end of NATO. Cross-country differences are more pronounced when it comes
   to the creation of an EU army and its deployment.},

Title = {Impact assessment of a mandatory operational goal-based short-term
   measure to reduce GHG emissions from ships: the LDC/SIDS case study},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the impact assessment of a
   mandatory operational goal-based short-term measure to reduce green
   house gas (GHG) emissions from ships. The specific measure has been
   proposed by Denmark and other co-sponsors in the context of the relevant
   discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and in
   particular the so-called Initial IMO Strategy. The IMO is a specialized
   United Nations agency that regulates shipping. The Initial IMO Strategy,
   adopted in 2018, has been the most recent major international
   environmental agreement on how to reduce GHG emissions from ships at a
   global level. The central research question in this paper is to
   ascertain the potential impacts of the aforementioned measure to least
   developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS).
   There are concerns that such states may be negatively impacted, or even
   disproportionately negatively impacted, by whatever measure is decided
   by the IMO. After gaps in the literature and data are identified, our
   methodology develops a list of potential negative impacts, and looks at
   a set of factors that may influence these impacts. Then, we discuss how
   the goal-based measure may impact LDCs/SIDs as regards each of the
   identified negative impacts. The analysis argues that for LDCs and SIDS
   a risk for negative and disproportionately negative impacts exists. The
   only negative impact of which both the probability and the consequence
   are considered high is the difficulty to finance retrofitting of old
   ships or investment in new ships. As such, this is likely a
   disproportionally negative impact. At the same time, the degree of share
   (or responsibility) of the goal-based measure with respect to such
   potential negative impacts, vis-a-vis the share of other factors
   contributing to these impacts, cannot be precisely ascertained, even
   though we conjecture this share to be low.},

Abstract = {Teaching children philosophy enhances critical thinking skills that are
   sorely needed in today's technological society. When it comes to mass
   art and social media, we need to discern between reliable sources of
   information, misinformation, hoaxes and dross. I claim that the
   Community of Inquiry (CoI) pedagogy as practiced by proponents of
   Philosophy for Children (P4C) can assist in training students to
   challenge their own assumptions as well as those of others, work
   collaboratively in search of truth, and engage both critically and
   compassionately with diverse perspectives; whether they be face-to-face
   or online. Such multiliteracies are sorely needed in an age of Web 2.0,
   Democracy 2.0 and the neoliberal agenda. In this chapter I will defend
   the role philosophy can play in teaching students to be critically
   reflective, ethically engaged, democratically participatory and creative
   in their use of Web 2.0 technologies.},

Abstract = {Efforts to combat the COVID-19 crisis were characterized by a difficult
   trade-off: the stringency of the lockdowns decreased the spread of the
   virus, but amplified the damage to the economy. In this study, we
   analyze public attitude toward this trade-off using a survey-embedded
   experiment conducted with a quota sample of more than 7,000 respondents
   from Southeast Europe, collected in April and May 2020. The results show
   that public opinion generally favored saving lives even at a steep
   economic cost. However, the willingness to trade lives for the economy
   was greater when the heterogeneous health and economic consequences of
   lockdown policies for the young and the elderly were emphasized.
   Free-market views also make people more accepting of higher casualties,
   as do fears that the instituted measures will lead to a permanent
   expansion of government control over society.},

Title = {National identity and democracy: Effects of non-voluntarism on formal
   democracy},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore whether, and if so how, national identity
   affects the level of formal democracy in a country. I theorize and then
   investigate four assumptions: (i) classical nationalist stances hold
   that national membership depends on the accident of origin and cultural
   markers learned by early socialization. This non-voluntary identity
   gives human beings a natural sense of belonging in society and fosters
   solidarity and trust that lead to better democracy; (ii) drawing on
   ideas about core values of ideal democracy the non-voluntarist national
   identity exhibits an inherent contradiction between in-group bias and
   intrinsic equality, which leads to lower levels of democracy; (iii)
   homogeneity in belief about what constitutes national belonging eases
   the dynamics between majority and minority, which benefits democracy;
   (iv) the presence of an in-group identity, understood as a shared
   fellow-feeling, boosts trust and solidarity and thereby benefits
   democracy. Individual-level data about national identity comes from
   International Social Survey Programme (ISSP, 2013). Data about democracy
   comes from Varieties of Democracy (Coppedge et al., 2021; Pemstein et
   al., 2021). Results indicate that higher levels of non-voluntarist
   features of national identity are strongly negatively correlated with
   levels of democracy and heterogeneity in beliefs about what constitutes
   national belonging relating to a higher level of liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {Political districts may be drawn to favor one group or political party
   over another, or gerrymandered. A number of measurements have been
   suggested as ways to detect and prevent such behavior. These measures
   give concrete axes along which districts and districting plans can be
   compared. However, measurement values are affected by both noise and the
   compounding effects of seemingly innocuous implementation decisions.
   Such issues will arise for any measure. As a case study demonstrating
   the effect, we show that commonly used measures of geometric compactness
   for district boundaries are affected by several factors irrelevant to
   fairness or compliance with civil rights law. We further show that an
   adversary could manipulate measurements to affect the assessment of a
   given plan. This instability complicates using these measurements as
   legislative or judicial standards to counteract unfair redistricting
   practices. This paper accompanies the release of packages in C++,
   Python, and R that correctly, efficiently, and reproducibly calculate a
   variety of compactness scores.},

Abstract = {Aiming to protect energy security, the European Union (EU) has sought to
   persuade third states to accept its energy acquis, relying on a formed
   strategic narrative. However, the coherency of this strategic narrative,
   as the prerequisite for being well-received, has not been studied
   before. Considering the strategic narrative theory and applying the
   content analysis method, our research has indicated that the EU's
   narrative consists of five storylines, including geopolitics, the single
   energy market, and climate change, the last two of which have become
   increasingly accentuated over time. However, this strategic narrative
   suffers from two significant incoherencies, which lie between its
   storylines and also within the storyline. The results of our analyses
   indicate that both incoherencies originate from the securitisation of
   energy in the Union. This means that the effectiveness of the narrative
   formulated has been diminished, which is detrimental even to the EU's
   climate policy. This could suggest that de-politicisation of energy is
   required to reinforce the narrative and enable the EU to address the
   world with one voice.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of populism on environmental politics,
   focusing on countries' outcome-level performance. I develop the argument
   that populist leadership likely undermines environmental quality. First,
   populist leaders tend to reject and refrain from implementing
   ``green{''} policies, as these are usually promoted by ``corrupt
   elites.{''} Second, populism erodes democratic institutions, thus
   offsetting a series of mechanisms that are related to better
   environmental outcomes. Empirically, I combine data from the Global
   Populism Database covering sixty-six countries and more than two hundred
   executive leaders with information on environmental performance at the
   outcome level. The findings suggest that populist leadership is strongly
   linked to lower environmental performance-also when controlling for a
   series of alternative influences and distinguishing between left- and
   right-wing populism. This research greatly adds to our understanding of
   the determinants of environmental policies, the role of regime type and
   ideology, and the literature on populism.},

Abstract = {In parallel with the crackdown on independent civil society, Cambodia's
   shift to hegemonic authoritarianism has been accompanied by the
   increased prominence of youth- focused mass organizations. These
   organizations are formally non-governmental organizations but have close
   links with the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP). Engaging with
   recent literature on how expanding political participation may serve to
   constrain contestation, this article analyses how these youth
   initiatives contribute to authoritarian resilience and innovation in
   Cambodia. The article examines the different opportunities that these
   organizations offer different segments of the Cambodian population, and
   the benefits that the governing elite accrue from their participation.
   Processes of elite formation, including to what extent these
   organizations enable elite reproduction versus the injection of new
   blood into the elite, are evaluated. From this perspective, evolving
   relations between civil society, the government and the CPP are
   assessed. The article aims to add to our knowledge of the changing
   architecture of civil society, youth politics, elite circulation and
   integration, and the loci and transitions of power in connection with
   Cambodia's authoritarian turn.},

Abstract = {Do environmental implications of international trade influence public
   support for economic globalization? And under what conditions do
   environmental considerations shape individuals' trade attitudes and
   policy preferences? In this study, we examine the microfoundations of
   the trade-environment nexus based on survey-embedded experiments in six
   OECD countries. Our empirical findings demonstrate that environmental
   implications have a substantial causal effect on public opinion about
   international trade. Furthermore, our results indicate that citizens are
   similarly sensitive to both domestic and international environmental
   implications of trade. These findings suggest that there is probably
   sufficient public support for green economy policies that take into
   account the global rather than only national environmental impacts from
   trade when designing trade policies.},

Abstract = {The two-way linear fixed effects regression (2FE) has become a default
   method for estimating causal effects from panel data. Many applied
   researchers use the 2FE estimator to adjust for unobserved unit-specific
   and time-specific confounders at the same time. Unfortunately, we
   demonstrate that the ability of the 2FE model to simultaneously adjust
   for these two types of unobserved confounders critically relies upon the
   assumption of linear additive effects. Another common justification for
   the use of the 2FE estimator is based on its equivalence to the
   difference-in-differences estimator under the simplest setting with two
   groups and two time periods. We show that this equivalence does not hold
   under more general settings commonly encountered in applied research.
   Instead, we prove that the multi-period difference-in-differences
   estimator is equivalent to the weighted 2FE estimator with some
   observations having negative weights. These analytical results imply
   that in contrast to the popular belief, the 2FE estimator does not
   represent a design-based, nonparametric estimation strategy for causal
   inference. Instead, its validity fundamentally rests on the modeling
   assumptions.},

Abstract = {Exogenous shocks such as pandemics have a profound influence on how
   citizens think about their country. We explore how the successful
   handling of COVID-19 shaped South Korean citizens' perception of their
   country. Empirically, we compare data from surveys conducted in August
   2019 and April 2020. Using regression on matched samples, we find a
   significant increase in general national pride. More importantly, we
   find an increase in positive assessments of their country in domains
   directly related to the COVID-19 response (civic awareness and
   international leadership) but not in domains less directly related to
   the pandemic. We also find that while Koreans take pride in their
   collective response to the crisis, their disenchantment with the
   political class has grown. The implication is that citizens offer a
   remarkably nuanced understanding of how the COVID-19 response reflected
   the strengths of the Korean society, as opposed to the Korean political
   system.},

Abstract = {Despite its tangible role in shaping the European Union's response to
   the global pandemic, observers seem to have systematically disregarded
   the role of the European Parliament (EP) in the crisis, by primarily
   focusing their attention on the European capitals, the
   inter-governmental institutions, and the coordinating role of the
   European Commission. The contribution of the EP cannot be ignored also
   given its unique representative role, its direct democratic legitimacy,
   and its increasingly relevant role in the Union's decision-making
   process. This article has the ambition to identify the key determinants
   behind the legislators' voting behaviour and coalition patterns in the
   EP in the context of the first response to the COVID-19 crisis, by
   capturing the tension between partisanship and nationality. To do so, it
   proposes a set of hypotheses addressing legislators' voting dynamics and
   patterns of cooperation and conflict in the EP. The analysis is based on
   votes held on 80 amendments to the April 2020 Joint motion for a
   resolution on `EU coordinated action to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and
   its consequences'. The analysis confirms patterns in lines with the
   expectations of the study.},

Abstract = {The private sector in North Korea is virtually non-existent, and typical
   forms of grass-root Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) required for
   forestry carbon trading are not recognized. The state regulates the
   local forest communities and labor market through central planning and
   control. Previous researches tend to target grass-root NGOs that were
   established voluntarily after democratization, while implicitly
   excluding a state-supervised organization in which residents are
   members. This paper demonstrates that the carbon benefits secured by
   forestry projects could be negotiated by a non-voluntary
   state-supervised organization initially established as a resident
   watch-dog. Since state-supervised organizations in recipient countries
   can play a key role in educating grassroots citizens on the true role of
   NGOs, originated from democratized western countries, this paper will be
   a valuable reference for accommodating beneficiary obligations specified
   in multilateral funding. Although North Korea has been selected as a
   case study for this paper, this kind of peaceful intervention is
   relevant to other countries that face similar state-supervised resident
   organizations in implementing multilateral funding projects.},

Abstract = {Closed borders have enormously detrimental effects on landlocked
   economies which already face challenging constraints to connectivity.
   Due to the closed border with Turkey, Armenia has limited potential to
   develop favourable transit routes and to expand market access. This
   article presents a legal and political outline of the Turkish closure of
   the border. It examines the closure's impact on the Turkish-Armenian
   presence in regional integration frameworks, and illustrates the

Abstract = {Residents of poor, rural settings have several potential sources of
   informal support: political patrons, non-political patrons, family, and
   the community. This study explores how preferred channels of informal
   support change in the aftermath of crisis. Following a logic of ``safety
   first,{''} I argue that individuals exposed to crisis invest in family
   and community as complementary forms of insurance against future
   setbacks, alongside their appeals to patrons. Using survey data from
   respondents living in two localities that happened to face atypical
   flooding in northern Ghana, and comparing those respondents to residents
   of two otherwise similar localities that did not face flooding, I show
   that residents do not instinctively increase their reliance on patrons.
   Instead, three months after a crisis, they tend to place greater
   relative emphasis on family networks and stronger community ties.
   Networks in which the clients themselves have greater control constitute
   lower-risk priorities in the event of future crises, whereas calamity
   can highlight the risks of relying solely on patron-client relationships
   to address critical needs.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are paying increasing attention to understanding
   the role of sexist attitudes on predicting vote choices and opinions on
   issues. However, the research in this area measures sexist attitudes
   with a variety of different items and scales. In this paper, I evaluate
   some of the most prominent contemporary measures of sexism and develop
   an approach for identifying optimal items based on (1) convergent
   validity, (2) predictive validity, and (3) distance from politics. I
   find that a subset of items from the hostile sexism scale exhibit the
   most desirable measurement properties and I conclude by recommending a
   simple two- to five-item reduced hostile sexism battery that will allow
   scholars to efficiently, validly, and consistently measure sexism.},

Title = {Ethnic return migration, exclusion and the role of ethnic options:
   `Soviet Greek' migrants in their ethnic homeland and the Pontic identity},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {497-512},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research, this paper explores the reasons why
   and the processes through which the Greeks from the former Soviet Union
   altered their self-identification after migration to their ethnic
   homeland. Responding to their labelling by the native Greeks and the
   doubts expressed about their Greekness, most introduce themselves as
   Pontians, even though the area of Pontos was not a marker of
   identification for them in the Soviet Union. They do so to express their
   felt experience of otherness in Greece and to claim their belongingness
   in the Greek nation. Exploring this case of ethnic return migration, the
   paper shows how migrants select among available ethnic options and
   redefine them, to assert their desired identities and strive for
   inclusion. In so doing it highlights the situational and processual
   character of ethnic identification, which should not be treated as a
   direct function of one's descent and culture. At the same time, it shows
   the constraining role of available ethnic options delimiting this
   process. Ethnic labels are not empty vessels. They carry particular
   significations that make them appealing or foreign to different migrant
   categories and also define the discursive and performative limitations
   in their ability to claim them and gain national acceptance.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article investigates practices through which consensus is reached
   on policy-relevant scientific conclusions in intergovernmental
   assessment bodies. Using the case of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change and the production of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
   of the Synthesis Report published in 2014, it sheds light on the
   procedural, visual, and rhetorical arrangements in the weaving of an
   intergovernmental expert consensus. Drawing on ethnographic methods, the
   main point of the article is that the consensus emerging from the
   approval of the SPM is best understood as an accumulation and
   juxtaposition of scientific/diplomatic consensuses. It shows that these
   consensuses result from a layering of compromises negotiated at various
   stages in the assessment process and contingent on the issues at stake
   and the strategies of actors. In this context, consensus is not reached
   on individual statements but on the document as a whole, as both authors
   and governments seek to have their perspectives reflected. Finally, the
   article draws attention to the entanglement between the scientific and
   diplomatic rhetoric in the fabric of the SPM, which tends to construct
   climate change as a decontextualized and nonpolitical problem.},

Abstract = {Environmental systems are complex and often difficult to predict. The
   interrelationships within such systems can create abrupt changes with
   lasting impacts, yet they are often overlooked until disasters occur.
   Mounting environmental and social crises demand the need to better
   understand both the role and consequences of emerging risks in global
   environmental politics (GEP). In this research note, we discuss
   scenarios and simulations as innovative tools that may help GEP scholars
   identify, assess, and communicate solutions to complex problems and
   systemic risks. We argue that scenarios and simulations are effective at
   providing context for interpreting ``weak signals.{''} Applying
   simulations to research of complex risks also offers opportunities to
   address otherwise overwhelming uncertainty.},

Abstract = {As evidenced by the radical changes to state organisation, legitimacy
   and the international order in the past couple of centuries with the
   development of nationalist ideology, nationalism inherently carries a
   spatial dimension that translates into an assertion for control of land.
   This way, it transforms the land to an ancestral national homeland
   rightfully belonging to `the nation'. But what if that land was lost to
   another nation? Embarking from Anthony Smith's ethno-symbolist approach
   on the construction of national homelands, this article will attempt a
   theoretical approach on the construction of the lost national homelands.
   These are usually cases where military defeats led to mass expulsions of
   populations from their ancestral lands, while nationalist ideologies
   appropriated them as lost national homelands. The main argument is that
   the idea of the lost homelands has turned into a symbol of these
   nationalist ideologies and a constituent element of the respective
   national identities. Drawing from Greek perceptions of their lost
   homelands, this article will explore the mechanisms of the
   nationalisation of space process that elaborated the nationalisation of
   those homelands even after they became `lost' for the Greek nation. This
   article contributes to the studies of the spatial dimensions of national
   identities, the effects of forced population transfers in identity
   politics and the creation of national myths and symbols.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms (SMPs) have emerged as a powerful means for
   connecting individuals while simultaneously allowing for commercial
   gain, mass surveillance, data mining, opinion influencing, and political
   manipulation. The remarkable success of SMPs stems from their ability to
   both adapt to and exploit a fundamental human need for belonging as well
   as a desire for social status (McArthy-Jones, 2017). As such, they
   become contested spaces for marketers, political operatives, and unknown
   actors who wish to influence and sway public opinion. However, when they
   act as democratic vehicles for social and political engagement, through
   the spread of information, SMPs can also be used as a medium for social
   change.
   Furthering and ensuring this requires critical social media literacy
   (CSML) which will elucidate how users process the other, themselves, and
   information, as well as exposing how SMP algorithms intervene in
   perception while exploiting economic or politically-motivated
   data-mining.
   In this chapter, I use Facebook and Snapchat to discuss why people
   become attached to particular SMPs, how the designs of SMPs encourages
   and exploits these attachments, and how SMP algorithms are created to
   serve social and economic interests that are contrary to the pursuit of
   justice. I shall also examine factors relating to SMPs that deter
   democratic social participation. In conclusion, I discuss how this
   knowledge can be used as a part of overall CSML skills, which can also
   serve to counteract the negative aspects of the cultures on SMPs and
   buttress the potential for the medium to to increase democratic
   participation, subverting whatever nefarious purposes may exist in order
   to create participatory democracies.},

Abstract = {As the British imperialists had kept intact hundreds of feudal ties in
   order to ensure their own survival and decided the model of production
   in India to serve their own country's industrial needs, some regions
   were developed while some other regions remained backwards.... As
   Andhra, Telangana regions were living as separate units for centuries,
   there is a vast difference in development in the economic, political and
   social spheres of these two regions. Andhra region is more advanced in
   these spheres.... The important factors which had facilitated the
   development are: the people's struggles against the Zamindari system in
   Madras Presidency and Andhra regions, the Ryotwari system introduced by
   the British, irrigation facilities.

Volume = {63},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In some countries, bicameral discrepancies are solved by the formation
   of a conference committee. In Chile, conference committees are
   exclusively and automatically formed when the second chamber rejects a
   bill passed in the first chamber or when the first chamber rejects the
   modifications to its original bill made by the second chamber. This
   article postulates 4 hypotheses for the determinants of conference
   committee formation. It tests them for the case of Chile's sequential
   legislative process (1990-2018) using 2,183 bills that reached the stage
   where a conference committee could be formed. The 482 conference
   committees that resulted were more likely to be formed when chambers
   were controlled by different majorities, when passage required special
   voting thresholds, when bills were more important for the president, and
   when the bills had more approved amendments, but they were not more
   likely if the bill was introduced by legislators rather than the
   executive.},

   analysing EU political elites' images of Georgia from 1991 to 2020},

Abstract = {This article explores EU political elites' images of Georgia and its
   evolution from 1991 to 2020. The analysis relies on the author's 25
   original interviews with EU political elites, including presidents,
   prime ministers and ministers of EU member states and EU commissioners,
   alongside primary documents. By triangulating between novel interview
   data, document analysis and statements by EU officials, this article
   unpacks EU perceptions of Georgia's intentions, capabilities, threats
   and cultural status over a 30-year historical period. The study shows
   that three main images of Georgia have emerged over time in the eyes of
   EU and EU member states leaders: first, Georgia as a willing partner to
   the EU; second, Georgia as a political partner to the EU and third,
   Georgia as a close political and economic partner to the EU. This
   article, by studying the EU political elites' images of Georgia, adds
   knowledge to the EU's perceptions of external actors, which is an
   under-researched topic in the scholarship of images and perceptions in
   EU external relations. Moreover, it extends the literature on EU-Georgia
   relations, and helps to understand some of their peculiarities.},

Abstract = {Debate on the use of lagged dependent variables has a long history in
   political science. The latest contribution to this discussion is Wilkins
   (2018, Political Science Research and Methods, 6, 393-411), which
   advocates the use of an ADL(2,1) model when there is serial dependence
   in the outcome and disturbance. While this specification does offer some
   insurance against serially correlated disturbances, this is never the
   best (linear unbiased estimator) approach and should not be pursued as a
   general strategy. First, this strategy is only appropriate when the
   data-generating process (DGP) actually implies a more parsimonious
   model. Second, when this is not the DGP-e.g., lags of the predictors
   have independent effects-this strategy mischaracterizes the dynamic
   process. We clarify this issue and detail a Wald test that can be used
   to evaluate the appropriateness of the Wilkins approach. In general, we
   argue that researchers need to always: (i) ensure models are dynamically
   complete and (ii) test whether more restrictive models are appropriate.},

   Belgium became one of the smallest federal entities in the world},

Abstract = {In last 50 years, Belgium has evolved from a central to a federal state.
   Although this process was driven by the Flemish and Francophone
   communities (and influenced by the Brussels-Capital Region), a fourth
   much smaller entity known today as `German-speaking Community' was also
   integrated into the federal arrangement. This article reviews the
   latter's political history to go beyond the common explanation that its
   statute was a mere consequence of the Belgian federalization dynamic. By
   using historical scholarship and testimonial interviews, it shows that
   neither the demand nor the conferral of autonomy was automatic and that
   regionalist party pressures on the regional-level and intra-party
   multilevel negotiations were equally necessary for the communities'
   recognition as federal entity. With lessons from what it presents as a
   least likely case of federal entities whose autonomy dynamics followed
   that of larger communities with strong regionalist pressures, the
   article develops the concept of `federalization in the slipstream'.},

Abstract = {The most familiar approach to handling respondent uncertainty about
   survey questions, the ``don't know{''} (DK) response, has an
   inconvenient feature: it records no direct information about
   respondents' confidence in their answers. This article shows that DK
   responses contain more information than meets the eye. Using 161 survey
   questions from 11 surveys conducted between 1993 and 2019, the analysis
   demonstrates that the percentage of respondents saying DK can explain
   about half the variation in average confidence among respondents who
   provided an answer (i.e., those who did not say DK). This ``we don't
   know{''} means ``they're not sure{''} heuristic is especially reliable
   for relative comparisons between similar questions. For example, in a
   battery of favorability questions featuring two recent presidents and 10
   contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the
   percentage DK explains more than 90 percent of the variation in average
   confidence among those who offered an opinion. To provide a deeper
   intuition, the article draws upon a threshold model of DK responding,
   which is consistent with a range of existing research on the properties
   of DK responses.},

Title = {A TOTAL ERROR FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITAL TRACES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR ON ONLINE
   PLATFORMS},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {399-422},
Abstract = {People's activities and opinions recorded as digital traces online,
   especially on social media and other web-based platforms, offer
   increasingly informative pictures of the public. They promise to allow
   inferences about populations beyond the users of the platforms on which
   the traces are recorded, representing real potential for the social
   sciences and a complement to survey-based research. But the use of
   digital traces brings its own complexities and new error sources to the
   research enterprise. Recently, researchers have begun to discuss the
   errors that can occur when digital traces are used to learn about humans
   and social phenomena. This article synthesizes this discussion and
   proposes a systematic way to categorize potential errors, inspired by
   the Total Survey Error (TSE) framework developed for survey methodology.
   We introduce a conceptual framework to diagnose, understand, and
   document errors that may occur in studies based on such digital traces.
   While there are clear parallels to the well-known error sources in the
   TSE framework, the new ``Total Error Framework for Digital Traces of
   Human Behavior on Online Platforms{''} (TED-On) identifies several types
   of error that are specific to the use of digital traces. By providing a
   standard vocabulary to describe these errors, the proposed framework is
   intended to advance communication and research about using digital
   traces in scientific social research.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has increasingly recognised the crucial role of
   political narratives in and for European integration. Since its earliest
   days, supporters have justified integration by telling stories about its
   beneficial contribution to peace, prosperity, and democracy. In this
   article and the special issue, we contribute to the burgeoning
   literature on (counter)narratives to European `union' (any integration
   beyond intergovernmental cooperation), and to work on Euroscepticism.
   The special issue is also at the cutting edge of narratives research in
   its conceptual innovation and its focus on the narrating actors and
   concrete instances of narration. We demonstrate that in a narrative
   ju-jitsu, opponents of European union take up the themes of key
   pro-integration narratives and return their force against the EU. As
   well as examining nationalist Euroscepticism in specific countries, we
   study how cooperation among nationalists across Europe and beyond
   encourages convergence of their counter-narratives. These
   counter-narratives do not merely reject European union but increasingly
   argue for an alternative kind of `Europe'. They therefore interact with
   the increasing competition among proliferating pro-integration
   narratives, which have formed as old stories such as that of Europe as
   peace-bringer seem to have become less convincing.},

Title = {An Arctic security dilemma: assessing and mitigating the risk of
   unintended armed conflict in the High North},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {649-666},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {After the Cold War, international relations in the Arctic were
   characterised by cooperation and diplomacy. However, since Russia's
   annexation of Crimea in 2014, largely peaceful relations in the High
   North have been endangered by growing military competition between
   Russia and Western Arctic powers. The lack of military to military
   dialogue between Russia and the West has exacerbated the situation.
   Consequently, an Arctic security dilemma has arisen, which threatens
   stability and increases the danger of unintended armed conflict
   resulting from accidents or misunderstandings. Security dilemmas are as
   old as international politics. They occur when states feel threatened by
   the expanding military capabilities of their neighbours even if there is
   no deliberate hostile intent. This article will examine the developing
   Arctic security dilemma and the chances of its mitigation. Two recent
   developments provide potential grounds for optimism. The new United
   States' administration has pledged to return America to global
   engagement and multilateralism. In 2021, the Russian Federation is
   scheduled to become chair of the Arctic Council and the Arctic
   Coastguard Forum, the main intergovernmental institutions in the region.
   These events provide an opportunity to rebuild greater trust and
   confidence in relations between Russia and its Arctic neighbours and
   alleviate dangerous tensions.},

Abstract = {National identity in Africa is routinely viewed as underdeveloped
   relative to ethnic identity because most states did not follow classic
   forms of nation-building, such as mass schooling with nationalist
   content. Yet recent survey data show that national identity across the
   continent is more robust than most scholars predicted. What is driving
   national identification in Africa? What unifies Africans around common
   national identity? Existing theories are not well suited to explaining
   this question, because factors that they see as essential, such as
   higher levels of development and cultural cohesion, often do not exist.
   In this article, I suggest a new understanding of the strength of
   national identity, based on the impact of political events, such as
   peace, political stability and conduct of elections. Drawing on over 200
   original interviews with Ghanaian respondents, I demonstrate how
   political stability in Ghana, contrasted with political turmoil in
   neighbouring countries, produces narratives about national identity.},

Abstract = {This article argues that while the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) has made significant strides in monitoring its progress
   towards the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, it still lacks a robust
   monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) regime that can properly measure and
   assess the contributions made by regional development cooperation
   initiatives to the attainment of that vision. To answer the questions of
   why and how ASEAN should enhance its monitoring of regional development
   cooperation, this article first discusses how ASEAN's governance
   framework has evolved to meet its regional integration agenda before
   examining development cooperation in ASEAN and the important role that
   monitoring can play in ensuring that such initiatives are in congruence
   with the notion of ASEAN Centrality. The article then analyses ASEAN's
   current M\&E systems in greater depth in order to explain how the
   organization's monitoring and evaluation capacity of development
   cooperation is hampered by weaknesses in defining the parameters of
   success, linking implementation monitoring to results monitoring and
   engendering institutional learning opportunities. It then offers six
   concrete steps that can be adopted to address these shortcomings,
   primarily involving improvements to the collection, classification and
   dissemination of data.},

Abstract = {This study looks at public reaction to 2016 reforms made by Ennahdha,
   Tunisia's most prominent Islamist party, to formally separate from its
   religious wing. Interviews with Ennahdha's electoral strategists suggest
   they expected resurgent support from both secular Tunisians and
   beneficiaries from the party's social programmes. Nevertheless,
   Ennahdha's vote share declined in 2019's parliamentary elections. A
   survey experiment conducted in 2017 randomly primed Tunisians with news
   of Ennahdha's reforms. While the reforms themselves were viewed
   favourably by secular and educated Tunisians, the party did not gain in
   aggregate favourability and lost support among less-educated and
   non-secular Tunisians.},

Abstract = {To what extent is the EU projecting democratic norms in the area of
   gender? Gender equality and women's empowerment have been at the heart
   of the EU's external action since the Arab uprisings. This article is an
   in-depth study of how the EU interacts with non-state actors in
   practice, and beyond the recipient-donor relationship, in the format of
   tripartite dialogue whereby the EU, civil society and the Tunisian
   government consult each other before any major EU meeting. First, this
   article reviews what EU democracy projection involves in the field of
   gender equality. Then it offers a mapping of the local, active
   participants on feminism and gender equality. Third, the article focuses
   on an innovative practice of trust-building, that of the gender
   sub-group of the tripartite dialogue. The main argument is that the
   dialogue has provided a new venue to project trust-building practices
   that are central to the consolidation of democracy. Yet this practice is
   weakened by the lack of considerations of major divides around gender in
   Tunisian society. Interaction on democratic norms thus remains secluded
   to a very selective venue. Democracy projection is, however, not fully
   `transversal' as the Islamist-secularist cleavage, socioeconomic
   inequalities and divides of the rural peripheries constrain the impact
   of the tripartite dialogue and subsequent democracy projection.},

Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {On March 15, 2019, the National People's Congress passed a
   long-anticipated Foreign Investment Law (FIL) after a short deliberation
   period of only three months. This expedited legislative process seems
   unusual, considering that the original draft of the FIL proposed by the
   Ministry of Commerce in January 2015 was tabled indefinitely after a
   brief period of public consultation. How can we explain this stark
   difference? Comparing the legislative processes and contents of the two
   laws, this paper shows that, as with many previous laws, bureaucratic
   politics likely contributed to an impasse in the 2015 draft, whereas
   external shocks-in this case, the escalating trade war between China and
   the United States-helped accelerate the deliberation process and the
   passage of the new FIL. These two cases demonstrate the durability of
   lawmaking institutions and procedures under Xi Jinping despite the
   recentralization of power in the executive after changes to the
   constitution.},

Abstract = {This article examines two important conditions for achieving the Paris
   Agreement's (PA) ambitious goals. The first is the actions of the
   largest emitters-China, the European Union (EU) and the USA whose
   combined share of global emissions is near 50\%. The second condition is
   the bottom-up design of the PA itself. Drawing on the policy mix
   literature and comparison of the three major emitters examined in this
   special feature (see Bang, Heggelund and Skj AE rseth), we first
   conclude that the EU has the most ambitious climate targets and policy
   mixes needed for achieving net zero emissions. Second, the PA has
   contributed to more ambitious targets and policy mixes mainly in the EU
   but also in China. Ambitious EU actors have actively invoked the PA
   goals to further their interests and legalize the Agreement's dynamic
   five-year cycles. With Biden as president the USA will again be a party
   to the PA and is set to join the EU and China in upgrading ambitions.
   Looking towards the future, the USA and particularly China will have to,
   in one way or another, to follow the EU if net zero emissions are to be
   achieved. This may necessitate actual EU leadership by example.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the ways in which LGBT+ flag raising in a
   university at the Republic of Cyprus was debated in a social media
   environment. It aims to examine the ways in which discourses around
   sexuality intersect with discourses around the nation in a postcolonial,
   ethnically divided, European context. One hundred four comments posted
   on the university Facebook page were analysed through Thematic and
   Rhetorical analysis. Analysis revealed three main ways of accounting for
   the flag incident in which sexuality and LGBT+ issues are represented as
   (a) inferior to national issues, (b) symbolic and/or tangible threat to
   the nation and (c) personal (instead of collective) identity that should
   not be waved in public. The discussion focuses on the ways in which the
   findings differentiate from literature on homonationalism and on their
   implications for constructing collectiveness and understanding
   citizenship.},

   late Song Dynasty literatus Yao Mian (1216-1262). Yao was a brilliant
   prose master who was desperate for political recognition. Over the
   course of his volatile career, he used letters as a means of social
   interaction, to establish and cultivate relations of patronage, and to
   convey political information or demands. The chapter explores the subtle
   differences in tone that reflected Yao Mian's relationships with
   inferiors and superiors, and reveals how movement up and down the
   political ladder influenced his letter-writing. This case study of a
   single man's correspondence demonstrates the varied roles of epistolary
   communication in Song social and political life.},

Abstract = {This research note scrutinizes official vote counts from the 2018
   Egyptian presidential election. Drawing on data for 13,807 polling
   stations published by the Egyptian Electoral Authority, it uses the
   Election Forensics Toolkit to estimate a series of digit and
   distribution tests. The results point to statistical anomalies in voter
   turnout for polling stations located in Egypt's major population
   centres. The findings align with journalistic accounts of very low
   turnout in those areas and demonstrate how tools from electoral
   forensics can be applied to the study of elections in the Middle East
   and North Africa.},

Abstract = {Producing parallel narratives of the fall of Kaifeng in 1127 and the
   sack of Constantinople in 1204, Ye Mengde (sic)7-1148) and Niketas
   Choniates (c.1155-1217) chronicled the collapse of these imperial
   centres in an effort to reconstruct post-conquest political communities
   in exile. While Ye and Niketas were deploying different conceptual
   frameworks of political authority and literary blueprints for memoirs,
   their writings documented personal displacement as well as cultural and
   political trauma writ large. By recording and commemorating the chain of
   events that culminated in the collapse of the Northern Song and
   Byzantine Empires, both authors were converting oral anecdotes into
   cultural memory. Ye and Niketas devised ex post facto explanations for
   the fall of Kaifeng and Constantinople as the consequence of the actions
   of failed monarchs and corrupt courtiers - and, to a lesser extent - the
   forces of divine punishment.},

Abstract = {Municipal size affects local democracy through two mechanisms -
   participation and contestation. By drawing on national-level theories of
   democracy, this article identifies a necessary tradeoff: decreasing
   municipal size maximises the participatory dimension of local democracy
   but reduces the level of contestation, which is similarly crucial for a
   healthy democracy. Employing multilevel models that simultaneously
   account for national-level and local-level influences, this proposition
   is tested using a large dataset of over 9,000 municipalities in 15 Latin
   American countries with competitive local elections. The evidence
   supports the operation of such a tradeoff in a regional comparison, and
   single-country analyses suggest that it is present with varying force in
   most countries of the region.},

Abstract = {The article offers a detailed analysis of the debates at the All-Russian
   Democratic Conference and in the Provisional Council of the Russian
   Republic (the Pre-Parliament), which followed the proclamation of the
   republic on September 1, 1917, and predated the Bolshevik-led insurgency
   on October 25. The two assemblies were supposed to help resolve the
   multilayered political, economic, and military crises of the First World
   War and the Revolution by consolidating a Russian postimperial political
   community and establishing a solid government. The debates demonstrated
   that grievances and antagonism, which were articulated in terms of class
   and nationality, made the idea of a broad nationalist coalition
   unpopular, since it would halt agrarian and other reforms and continue
   the negligence of non-Russian groups. Furthermore, those who still
   called for all-Russian national or civic unity split on the issue of
   community-building. The top-down, homogenizing and bottom-up, composite
   approaches proved irreconcilable and precluded a compromise between
   non-socialist and moderate socialist groups. The two assemblies hence
   failed to ensure a peaceful continuation of the postimperial
   transformation and did not lead to a broad coalition against right and
   left radicalism. The divisions, which were articulated in the two
   assemblies, translated into the main rifts of the Russian Civil War.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the violent Revolution of Dignity (2013/2014) and
   the subsequent war in Donbas (2014-), a heroic story about the new
   beginning of a ``united, Ukrainian nation{''} began to emerge. Shaping
   this new narrative are new museum projects devoted to Ukraine's
   developing history. This article examines the process of these new
   institutions' formation, the content of created exhibitions, and the
   activities conducted therein. It focuses on the role of the museums in
   activating, unifying, and integrating both the Ukrainian national
   community and civil society. This article is based on a qualitative
   analysis of materials collected during seven research stays in Ukraine,
   from June 2017 to August 2019, and focuses on four cases-Ukraine's First
   ATO Museum in Dnipro; the Museum of the Heavenly Hundred in
   Ivano-Frankivsk; the Ukrainian East exhibition in the National Museum of
   the History of Ukraine in the Second World War in Kyiv; and a project of
   the Museum of the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv. The examined
   institutions are presented not only as places for gathering artifacts
   but also as laboratories of civic activism, participation, and dialogue.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the relationship between Alevis and the Turkish
   and German states. It does so by examining the Turkish Alevi Opening
   (2009-2010) and the German Islam Conference (2006-present), two
   unprecedented official platforms aimed at improving Alevis' political
   participation. The study asks why such state-sponsored initiatives came
   into existence in Turkey and Germany, and why the German Islam
   Conference has proven more successful from the perspective of Alevis. It
   argues that even though the diffusion of EU norms and pressure from
   transnational advocacy networks have increased awareness regarding the
   Alevi issue, domestic factors have been more salient in the emergence
   and outcome of these initiatives in both countries.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to violence that took place in the
   Polish-Lithuanian borderland after the Great War. Using the theoretical
   insights of Stathis Kalyvas (2006), the author explores violent actors,
   types, and the dynamics of violence in the conflict over the neutral
   zone between Poland and Lithuania between 1920 and 1923. The focus is on
   the experiences of civilians and the social impact of violence on the
   formation of their national identities. The author suggests that violent
   ways of nation making forced the local populace to adopt national
   identities to ensure their security, but the process of forced
   nationalization was limited and may have resulted in the emergence of
   indifference among certain groups of the population.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the prevalent nationalist
   interpretation of historical images featuring textiles from rural
   regions. In an effort to disentangle the threads of folk costumes, it
   proposes a conscious unlearning of the way we read images of rural
   material culture from the late 19th century. This period has entered
   historiography as a period of intensifying national movements and
   political use of rural culture, in particular in Central and Eastern
   Europe. So-called folk costumes have been viewed as a symbolic
   representation of the nation, whereas their broader social and economic
   role in the history of industrial society has been overshadowed. By
   bringing together the production, collection, and exhibition of rural
   material culture, this article reveals processes in industrial society
   that shaped the modern history of folk costumes. It draws on
   late-19th-century source material stemming from a network centered in
   Prague that promoted textiles from rural Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, and
   Galicia as ethno-commodities. Textiles were integrated into women's
   industrial education and presented at events promoting national economy
   and the latest technological innovations. Thus, this article contributes
   to nationalism studies by discussing capitalism and industrialism and
   seeks to further scrutinize the history of nationalism in Central and
   Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {This article assesses Russian strategic narratives towards its
   interventions in Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014-16) based on a new
   database of 50 statements posted on the websites of the Russian Mission
   to the United Nations and the President of Russia homepage. By looking
   more broadly at Russian strategic narratives aimed at persuading other
   global actors and publics abroad and at home, this article identifies
   how Russia attempted to develop a story that could win global
   acceptance. This analysis shows that contrary to traditional Russian
   emphasis on sovereign responsibility and non-intervention, Russia
   supported claims for self-determination by separatist groups in Georgia
   and Ukraine. Russia used deception and disinformation in its strategic
   narratives as it mis-characterized these conflicts using Responsibility
   to Protect (R2P) language, yet mostly justified its own interventions
   through references to other sources of international law. Russian
   strategic narratives focused on delegitimizing the perceived opponents,
   making the case for the appropriateness of its own actions, and
   projecting what it proposed as the proper solution to the conflicts. It
   largely avoided making any references to its own involvement in the
   Donbas at all. Additionally, Russia's focus on the protection of
   co-ethnics and Russian-speakers is reminiscent of interventions in the
   pre-R2P era.},

Abstract = {In recent years, one observes a surge in the number of city networks
   formed to address the welcoming and integration of immigrant
   populations. Drawing on a database of over sixty networks, the paper
   provides a global overview of their different types, scales and
   activities. Exploring the underlying factors explaining this worldwide
   expansion, it highlights two sets of congruent dynamics. This phenomenon
   has been elicited by the longue duree devolution to local authorities of
   powers and responsibilities pertaining to the management of immigrant
   populations on the one hand and the recent events of the 2015-2016
   `migration crisis' on the other. It is also the outcome of the top-down
   influence of international organisations (including the European Union)
   and the bottom-up mobilisations of municipalities facing the growing
   contradictions between their welcoming responsibilities and
   security-oriented migration management. In the concluding section, the
   paper points to the challenges faced by international actors for the
   building of a `glocal' migration governance.},

Abstract = {Women joining illicit fighting groups is not a new topic. However, since
   the emergence of the Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Syria
   and Iraq, various individuals, including women, went to the combat zones
   and joined these groups in unprecedented numbers. While the number of
   men certainly exceeds the number of women, the pattern of radicalization
   and recruitment of women to the conflict zones remains a puzzle, given
   the diversity of cases and the countries the women come from. This
   article focuses on the cases of women from Central Asia who went to the
   conflict zones in Syria and Iraq since 2011. Included are examples of
   not only women who voluntarily chose to go to these conflict zones but
   also the much larger group of women who were taken, involuntarily, to
   the combat zones by their husbands. Many of these women have been
   encouraged or coerced by their husbands to go to these conflict zones.
   Family dynamics and the subservient role of wives in Central Asia may be
   influential, the decision to travel to conflict zones is to a greater
   extent about dependency and to a lesser extent about agency. In general,
   both findings demonstrate the complexity of the recruitment and
   mobilization processes.},

Abstract = {This paper brings an empirical assessment of economies of scale in local
   government units in Croatia. Using cross-section OLS models, we found
   statistically significant U-shaped relationship between local per capita
   expenditures and population size, while controlling for various
   demographic, socio-economic and institutional factors. The choice of
   control variables in the paper is based on the existing empirical
   literature but also includes factors capturing the specificities of
   Croatian economy and local government institutional setup. Using
   estimated regression coefficients we calculated the optimal size of
   local units and showed that population size is below optimal in 72\% of
   cities and 76\% of municipalities (based on median results).},

Abstract = {Focusing on process tracing and using the example of fieldwork in
   Donbas, I develop an argument on what theoretically grounded and
   empirically detailed methodological solutions can be considered to
   mitigate the challenges of research on conflict zones and assure the
   robustness of any causal claims made. I first outline my assumptions
   about process tracing as the central case study method and its
   application to research on conflict zones, and then discuss in more
   detail data requirements, data collection, and data analysis. Using two
   examples of case studies on the war in and over Donbas, I illustrate how
   three standards of best-practice in process tracing-the need for a
   theory-guided inquiry, the necessity to enhance causal inference by
   paying attention to (and ruling out) rival explanations, and the
   importance of transparency in the design and execution of research-can
   be applied in the challenging circumstances of fieldwork-based case
   studies of conflict zones. I conclude by suggesting that as a minimum
   threshold for reliance upon causal inferences, these three standards
   also should align with a standard of evidence that requires both the
   theoretical and empirical plausibility of any conclusions drawn.},

Abstract = {The coordination of inter-organisational networks is key to their
   success and yet partnership management in the context of regional
   economic development remains a complex and ambiguous process. To address
   this lack of understanding, this article reviews the extant literature
   on brokerage and network coordination and presents a theoretical
   framework comprising three propositions on the benefits of a private
   sector influence over the management and coordination of
   multi-organisational economic development partnerships. The propositions
   are then explored through a qualitative study of those tasked with the
   role of leading the management of Local Enterprise Partnerships in
   England. The findings conversely reveal a reliance on the public sector
   to lead the framing and mobilisation of these networks and questions
   whether the policy shift has resulted in truly collaborative governance.},

Abstract = {Inter-municipal cooperation (IMC) has increasingly become an important
   tool for local governments. This study aims to understand the role of
   IMC from the perspective of network management. We argue that IMCs
   create networks of horizontal interactions among local governments,
   facilitating collaboration and information exchange among them. By so
   doing, IMCs can promote local government performance even outside their
   main service domains. To evaluate the performance enhancing role of IMC
   networks, we analyze the case of municipal associations in El Salvador.
   Based on original surveys of Salvadorian mayors, we find that networks
   built on municipal associations positively correlate with electricity
   provision. By contrast, no effect exists on running water provision,
   perhaps because it requires no collaboration among municipalities. Our
   findings suggest that managerial networks built on IMCs can play an
   important role in local government performance in developing settings,
   but their effect seems contingent on the type of performance outcome.},

Abstract = {Regardless of the sizable number of terrorist attacks in the last decade
   in Jordan, Jordanians' fear of the terrorists or risk of dying in a
   terrorist attack in Jordan is almost non-existent. What drives the young
   educated student to sympathize and support terrorist groups like ISIS?
   Sympathy and support for terrorist groups like ISIS among youths in
   Jordan can be understood by tracing its roots of the micro (personal
   factors), meso (institutional factors), and macro-level (social,
   cultural factors). Youths' sympathy and support for ISIS are based on
   religious beliefs, social taboos, kinship, and social ties. The current
   study aims at examining radical, conservative, and extremist thoughts,
   fear about, and behavioral and material support for ISIS among college
   students in Jordan. Findings showed that, on average, 59\% of students
   expressed radical thoughts, concentrated on areas of social and
   religiously conservative and extremist beliefs. Moreover, results showed
   that 66\% of students carried extreme ideas, with 90.7\% accepting the
   use of violence. More than half (61\%) of the sample expressed
   conservative thoughts ranged from stoning adultery cases (82.4\%) to
   segregation of women in the workplace (59.4.\%). Findings showed less
   than half of the sample, 43.4\% feared that they might become victims of
   ISIS one day, and 69.4\% of students worried about the emergence of
   radical groups in Jordan. Also, findings showed that about 10\% of
   students expressed behavioral or/and material support for ISIS ranging
   from money donation (11.7\%) to providing personal and operational
   assistance (8\%). Students' overall average justification for ISIS's
   support was 14\%, and 15.6\% of students justified their behavioral and
   material support for ISIS due to foreign assistance for Muslim
   authoritarian regimes. The lowest justification was for seeing ISIS as a
   defender of Islam. Finally, there was a significant relationship between
   radical thoughts and each of the support justifications (r =.254),
   strain (0.32), fear (0.46), religiosity (0.78), and ISIS support (r
   =.297). Additionally, there is a significant relationship between ISIS's
   support and ISIS's support justification (r =.72). Radical thoughts,
   violent extremism beliefs, conservative beliefs, stress, victimization,
   and justification explained 56\% of the variance on behavioral and
   material support for ISIS and had an overall significant effect on
   behavioral and material support for ISIS (F = 85.936, alpha =.000).},

Abstract = {In the context of the global pandemic, the article aims, proposes, to
   investigate the problem of uncertainty and complexity in the field of
   education. This is a problem that frames and is part of a broader
   diagnosis that involves the whole of contemporary society. The
   expressions that give an account for this generalized or widespread
   uncertainty, tell us about the crisis of the institutions, the end of
   ideologies, the relative nature of truth, the flexible and liquid indole
   or nature of the time, among others. The pandemic has accentuated,
   emphasized the uncertainty and, at the same time, has allowed, made it
   possible to visualize more clearly and sharpness the complexity, the
   interdependence of the processes that shape the state of the situation
   in which we are immersed. The common thread or theme of this inquiry or
   research is provided by the philosophy of Alain Badiou - and Lacanian
   psychoanalysis. In this way, thus, the deployment of the argumentation
   is sustained or holds in the formulation of the logic of being and the
   logic of the event. We find or locate the knotting of these logics in
   the tension between the ``educational system{''} and the ``educational
   act{''}. In other words, in the tension between complex thinking,
   though, that organizes the paths of knowledge regulated by
   psychopedagogy, and axiomatic thinking that guides, allows itself to be
   directed by the encounter with truths. In the development of this
   problem, we will show how, in theoretical and practical terms, the idea
   of complexity dissolves this tension, and with it, the egalitarian and
   emancipatory potential of education.},

   monitoring by responsible institutions. The intensity of aging and the
   proportion of age groups among various communities differ due to
   different socio-economic conditions and characteristics. This article
   researches the impact of the war in Croatia 1991-1995 and postwar living
   conditions on the divergence of population aging in the ethnically
   heterogeneous Banija region. The first postwar census in 2001 recorded a
   population decline of 44.9\% compared to the 1991 census. We analyze the
   effects of the war on changes in ethnic and age structure, as well as
   their interrelations. The quantitative and qualitative magnitude of
   these demographic changes in the inter-census period had a decisive
   influence on the correlation of age and ethnic structure. The article
   examines whether the relative share of Serbs or Croats in the total
   population of a settlement affects the average age of the settlement.
   The results confirmed that the Serbs are older than the Croats, and are
   in the phase of the most advanced demographic age. These changes raise
   the question of the demographic future and the biological viability of
   the Serbs, who were the majority in the region before the war.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the French region of Brittany on the basis of
   sustained empirical research over a 25-year period. It identifies the
   twin use of influence and identity as forming a key part of an accepted
   and largely diffused territorial repertoire, based on affirming
   distinctiveness for reasons of vertical linkage, as well as horizontal
   capacity building. This article explores the different facets of this
   model of territorial influence. The two twin dimensions concern: first,
   a well-versed mechanism of lobbying central institutions and actors to
   defend the Breton interest; second, the use of territorial identity
   markers to forward the regional cause, relying on social movements and a
   broad capacity for regional mobilization. Within this overarching
   context, the Breton case demonstrates an intelligent instrumental use of
   identity and identity markers, but mainstream Breton forces recognize
   that this only makes sense in the light of the national level of
   regulation and structure of opportunities. The logic of this position is
   to integrate the Brittany region into a national model of territorial
   integration, while playing up identity markers to secure the maximum
   benefit for the region.},

Abstract = {Using data for Dutch municipal elections between 1998 and 2018, this
   paper finds two dominant trends: more political fragmentation and
   increasing electoral success of independent local parties. The relative
   size of local parties in the council rises from 25\% in 1998 to 37\% in
   2018 and the relative share of their aldermen from 21\% to 32\%. When
   understanding the increasing share of local parties, the number of
   inhabitants, regional diversity, the share of elderly people and the
   election year dummies are important explanations. Looking at the changes
   after large decentralisations, also indications for a welfare hypothesis
   were found, if fixed effects are included. Following an empirical
   approach for AfD in local elections in German state of Lower Saxony, the
   impact of the anti-establishment Freedom Party on contesting local
   parties was analysed and this influence turned out to be small. This
   also gives an indication that Dutch local parties are becoming more
   established.},

Abstract = {Our special issue discusses different perspectives on the important
   changes that took place in the transition from empire to nation-state at
   the end of the First World War, focusing especially on transnational
   connections, structural and historical continuities, and marginal voices
   that have been fully or partially concealed by the emphasis on a radical
   national awakening in 1918. Specific articles broach topics such as the
   implications of 1918 on notions of gender and ethnicity, 1918 and the
   violence of the ``Greater War,{''} and the legacies and memories of 1918
   across the 20th century. Our approach treats the ``New Europe{''} of
   1918 as a largely coherent geopolitical and cultural space, one which
   can be studied in an interdisciplinary fashion. We contend that 1918 is
   not simply a clean break in which one epoch cleanly makes way for
   another, but rather it is an ambiguous and contradictory pivot, one
   which created an ``Old-New Europe{''} caught between the forces of the
   imperial past and those of the national future. Our intention is not to
   dismiss entirely the importance of the transformations of 1918 but
   rather to show how there exists a tension between those changes and the
   many continuities and legacies that cut across the traditional
   chronology.},

Abstract = {Since 1990 Lithuania has been claiming that what happened there during
   Soviet occupation is genocide, as per the 1948 Genocide Convention,
   which embodies universal justice for suppressed nations and other
   groups. Due to Soviet actions in Lithuania throughout the periods of
   1940-1941 and 1944-1990, the country lost almost one fifth of its
   population. The application of Lithuanian national legal regulations
   regarding this issue has been recently discussed in the framework of
   another postwar international legal instrument - the European Convention
   of Human Rights (1950). The goal of this article is to examine the main
   debates, which were revealed by the European Court of Human Rights in
   the cases of Vasiliauskas v. Lithuania (2015) and Drelingas v. Lithuania
   (2019), regarding the killings of Lithuanian partisans, including the
   recognition of the significance of partisans for the Lithuanian nation,
   the foreseeability of genocide ``in part,{''} as well as the punishment
   for complicity in killing Lithuanian partisans.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how the transnational city network Eurocities
   engages in EU policies on migration and integration. Eurocities stands
   out from other cases through its autonomy and its clear objective to
   influence EU policies. To understand how the network operates as a
   policy entrepreneur, we analyse how cities and the Brussels-based
   secretariat collaborated in shaping the network's positions on migration
   and asylum - from the launch of the work on this dossier in 2001 to the
   `Solidarity Cities' campaign in 2016. During this period, Eurocities'
   agenda developed, to some extent opportunistically, driven by
   institutional and thematic interests. We find that it had the highest
   impact during the refugee reception crisis, when the secretariat's
   facilitation work, technical exchanges between city representatives and
   the activism of local politicians converged creating a common narrative
   on how to tackle the crisis from a city-centred angle.},

Abstract = {This article addresses women's cross-border internationalist connections
   within the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), focusing on the exchanges between
   women's organizations in socialist Yugoslavia and the Global South
   during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as during the UN Decade for Women
   (1975-1985). As a result of the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Yugoslavia was
   expelled from the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF),
   the main organization federating antifascist, communist, and socialist
   women, in 1949. To overcome international isolation, Yugoslav
   representatives established their own bilateral connections with women's
   organizations internationally, particularly in the Global South.
   Throughout the Cold War, the main figure behind women's internationalism
   in Yugoslavia was Vida Tomi (1913-1998), a former partisan and leading
   politician, trained as a lawyer, who had a fundamental role both in
   nonaligned and UN settings. In this article, I further analyze Vida
   Tomi's visits to India, and examine her correspondence with Indian
   scholar and Women's Studies pioneer Vina Mazumdar (1927-2013). The
   exchanges between Vina and Vida, as they amicably addressed each other,
   exemplify the significance of the alliance between activists from
   socialist countries and activists from the Global South during the UN
   Decade for Women.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on quality of democracy is case study-oriented
   and focused on nation states. Theoretical work and, in particular,
   comparative empirical research on the quality of local democracy are
   less advanced. This paper contributes to our understanding of how
   democracy works from below. It develops a conceptual framing and employs
   a multidimensional index of the quality of democracy across all 278
   municipalities in mainland Portugal by focusing on procedural dimensions
   of democratic performance at three levels of legitimacy: input,
   throughput, and output. Regression analysis is then used as a
   preliminary test of the usefulness of these measures of quality of local
   democracy and to uncover associations between them and a range of
   political and socioeconomic factors. The results suggest that
   municipalities led by independent mayors, with larger populations and
   higher levels of multiculturalism are likelier to be associated with
   `better' local democracy.},

Abstract = {Talking is cheap, at least in the short term; elected officials may
   profess their preferences for IMC and yet deny IMA organisations the
   necessary resources to fulfil their missions. Driven by a focus on
   revealed preferences for inter-municipal cooperation, the article aims
   to answer two questions: Why do some IMA exhibit a high level of
   commitment on the part of their local government members whereas others
   remain underutilised, reflecting a choice by local governments to retain
   these responsibilities themselves? How does this commitment to IMAs vary
   over time? We use data from 25 IMAs over a 10-year period (2008-2018) in
   Portugal to assess the intensity of cooperation among Portuguese local
   governments through stand-alone organisations. The panel analysis
   regression supports the hypotheses that a larger number of local
   governments involved in IMAs and higher levels of heterogeneity among
   them make cooperation more difficult. In contrast, longer interaction in
   IMAs reinforces the intensity of cooperation.},

Abstract = {John Stuart Mill claims that free institutions are next to impossible in
   a multinational state. According to Will Kymlicka, this leads him to
   embrace policies kindred to those of Friedrich Engels, aimed at
   promoting mononational states in Europe through coercive assimilation.
   Given Mill's harm principle, such coercive assimilation would have to be
   justified either paternalistically, in terms of its civilizing effects
   upon the would-be assimilated, or non-paternalistically, with reference
   to the danger that their non-assimilation would pose to others. However,
   neither possible interpretation is plausible; Mill takes Europe's
   civilized status to shield Europeans from paternalistic coercion, and he
   opposes coercive assimilation where it could conceivably be justified in
   the name of defense. Although this much suggests that Kymlicka
   misinterprets Mill by ignoring his definition of nationality, it leaves
   scope for Kymlicka to argue that Mill favors policies that promote
   mononationality through neglecting the languages and cultures of
   national minorities.},

Abstract = {Scholars of nationalism knew about the role of memory and forgetting in
   nation building long before the contemporary boom of memory studies.
   Still, they can learn a lot from this relatively new research field.
   This article offers an overview of the literature on the politics of
   memory, focusing on different patterns of dealing with a dark past of
   genocides, civil wars, and political repressions, on the one hand, and
   on the observations derived from the recent so-called ``memory wars{''}
   in Europe, on the other. Both issues elucidate a persistent role of
   nationalism in the contemporary world.},

Abstract = {August 9, 2020, presidential elections were held in Belarus. Despite
   blatant electoral fraud and procedural violations, the official results
   declared Aleksandr Lukashenka reelected for a sixth term. While in the
   past, even the most obviously fraudulent election results have been
   followed by an atmosphere of resigned acceptance, this time countless
   Belarusians took to the streets to contest the results. What made this
   election different? This analysis of current affairs looks at the 2020
   events through the lens of authoritarian consolidation theory,
   suggesting the unprecedented political mobilization was enabled by
   erosion in the three pillars of authoritarian stability: repression,
   cooptation, and legitimation. A majority of the population had been
   accepting the political status quo out of fear, for social and monetary
   security provided in exchange for loyalty, or a general understanding
   that there were no alternatives. Lukashenka did not realize this had
   largely changed. Nine months later, the foundation of the authoritarian
   regime is in an even worse shape. The regime's reliance on repression
   further counteracts the legitimacy of the system. As a result, it seems
   it will be difficult for the authorities to re-consolidate
   authoritarianism, at least in the near future, no matter how the
   `revolution' unfolds.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the determinants of individual support for
   independence in Montenegro. We outline five theoretically distinct
   groups of factors covered by the literature and evaluate their impact on
   individual preference for independence. Using observational data
   obtained from a nationally representative survey conducted in Montenegro
   in 2003-2004, we find support for several hypotheses, showing that
   identity, income, and partisanship significantly impact individual
   opinion about independence. We also investigate and discuss the relative
   effect size of different factors associated with preference for
   independence. Additionally, we test variables with hitherto unexplored
   implications for opinions on independence, including the impact of
   support for EU membership, as well as support for democratic principles.
   Our logistic regression analyses reveal that attitudes towards EU
   integration and minority rights are strongly associated with support for
   independence. By systematically analyzing existing and new hypotheses
   with data from an understudied case, our findings contribute to the
   nascent literature on individual preferences for independence.},

Abstract = {This paper tests to what extent the dimensionof the CLEAR model can be
   used as reliable predictors of an individual's decision to pursue
   council membership. By using the CLEAR framework as an extension of
   known frameworks such as self-determination theory and public service
   motivation that only focus on motivation, we develop a more
   comprehensive view of an individual's decision to run for candidacy. Our
   research shows that people do not distinguish between the `can do' and
   `like to' dimensions. Rather, these two dimensions must be considered as
   three sub-dimensions in our research coined as amotivation, intrinsic
   motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Furthermore, in explaining why
   people tend to decide to run for council membership, only amotivation,
   intrinsic motivation and social support (enabled dimension) appeared to
   be reliable predictors. To further our analysis, we have analysed how
   these different dimensions differ across different societal groups.},

Abstract = {This article is aimed at analysing local and intergovernmental responses
   to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany during the `first wave' of the
   pandemic. It will answer the question of how the intergovernmental
   system in Germany responded to the crisis and to what extent the
   pandemic has changed patterns of multi-level governance (MLG). The
   article argues that the coordination of pandemic management in Germany
   shifted between two ideal types of multi-level governance. While in the
   first phase of the pandemic the territorially defined multi-level system
   with the sub-national and local authorities as key actors of crisis
   management was predominant, in the second phase a more functional
   orientation with increased vertical coordination gained in importance.
   Later on, more reliance was given again on local decision-making. Based
   on this analysis, we will draw some preliminary conclusions on how
   effective MLG in Germany has been for coordinating pandemic management
   and point out the shortcomings.},

   eight lessons for strengthening the navigation capacities of

Abstract = {The content of this chapter describes the processes by which individuals
   become radicalized toward militant jihadi terrorism and ultimately join
   terrorist groups using ISIS recruitment and radicalization within ISIS
   as the focus of doing so. In doing so, it identifies steps that
   practitioners and policy makers can use to prevent and counter violent
   jihadist extremism by taking a nuanced approach that considers
   psychosocial vulnerabilities and environmental factors that contribute
   to radicalization. The case studies presented to illustrate these points
   are gleaned from the 240 interviews {[}1] with ISIS defectors,
   returnees, and imprisoned cadres interviewed by the first author, a
   research psychologist, in her role as director of the International
   Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE) and well as hundreds
   of terrorists from other groups. In the case of the ISIS interviews,
   with the interviewees' consent, the interviews were video-recorded and
   cut to create short counter narrative clips that can be used as a
   powerful tool for challenging the beliefs that individuals who have been
   exposed to ISIS propaganda may hold. This chapter also focuses on the
   Internet campaigns that ICSVE has used to test various aspects of the
   counter narrative videos, revealing the best ways to utilize the counter
   narratives and to maximize their impact online. Given that ISIS has
   become notorious for its skill at Internet recruitment and creating
   high-quality propaganda videos, it is imperative that counter terrorism
   professionals are able to parallel their efforts in order to continue
   fighting them even after the territorial defeat of the Caliphate.},

Abstract = {Cross-platform government social network studies have focused on the
   messages that are being sent, and less on community responses the
   content generates. Moreover, little attention has been paid to possible
   contextual drivers of online citizen engagement. This article assesses
   505 social media posts made by a sample of Dutch municipalities across
   four different platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram), their
   policy area, and the level of engagement they have fostered. The
   findings support the proposition of policy discretion as contextual
   driver of online citizen engagement: when municipalities can exert more
   discretionary power in a policy area, citizens could feel empowered to
   engage, as they could personally persuade decision makers. Moreover,
   although Facebook fostered the highest levels of engagement, the
   platforms show a multifaceted picture with respect to engagement levels
   and policy area. This suggests that local governments should treat
   platforms as distinctive realms, requiring a holistic approach to online
   citizen engagement.},

Abstract = {Inter-municipal cooperation in metropolitan areas has been previously
   shown to save costs, but can it also improve environmental outcomes? The
   existing empirical evidence is largely based on single case studies and
   does not allow to ascertain the net effect of cooperation. We develop a
   three-level mixed-effects linear model to conduct a systematic large-n
   study testing the impact of cooperation in transportation on CO2
   transport emissions. We use a novel dataset covering over 200
   metropolitan areas in 16 OECD countries. The findings demonstrate that
   both fragmented and consolidated metropolitan governance structures are
   equally inefficient in delivering a reduction in CO2 transport
   emissions. Further, without functional enforcement mechanisms,
   mitigation policies fail to have a positive effect on environmental
   outcomes. Inter-municipal cooperation in metropolitan areas facilitates
   coherence and widespread enforcement and emerges as a crucial factor
   explaining the reduction of CO2 transport emissions. Effects of
   metropolitan cooperation on transportation are magnified by the presence
   of national environmental mitigation policies.},

Abstract = {A new wave of scholarship has made major advances in how we understand
   the politics of civilizational identity by drawing powerfully from
   conceptual tools developed over the years to study other forms of
   identity. What unites this wave is treating civilizations not as
   distinctive ``things{''} that might ``clash{''} but as meaningful social
   imaginings. This growing body of work is far from monolithic, generating
   alternative theories that should structure scholarly debate going
   forward. Central issues include whether civilizational identity is
   primarily elite led or mass driven, whether it inherently involves
   conflictual human impulses, what the role of religion and values are in
   driving it, what its relationship is to nationalism, and how similarly
   we can expect the countries and people who share civilizational identity
   to behave. We also find emerging debates on what this newly
   conceptualized civilizational identity explains in contemporary world
   politics. Social scientists are now only beginning to apply important
   tools of social science to this question, with even public opinion
   research in its infancy. Early findings suggest civilizational identity
   may be shaping not only elite foreign policy making but also patterns of
   domestic politics, including the recent rise of populism and levels of
   democracy and authoritarianism more generally.},

Abstract = {Local governments and transnational city networks ('TCNs') have been
   increasingly engaging with norm-generation in the traditionally
   state-centric international law and migration governance. We identified
   two modes of this engagement: participation in mainstream state-centric
   processes, and norm-generation within their own networks. Through four
   examples, his article identifies four functions of this jurisgenerative
   activity. Theexternal function is bringing local interests and expertise
   to influence international normative developments. The internal function
   is regulating local governments' behaviour towards their own citizens,
   creating and upholding standards. Through a horizontal function, local
   governments recruit peers and rally around normative documents that
   offer a compact, crystallised expression of their interests. The
   integrating function enables local governments to combine fragmented
   issues of international law in unified, practical toolkits for their own
   use. All throughout, TCNs challenge state-centric international law and
   their traditional exclusion from it by demonstrating competence and
   fluency in international norm-generation relating to migration.},

Abstract = {In recent years, local government administrations in Spain have
   strengthened their commitment to putting into effect policies that
   favour the well-being of LGBTQ+ people. This has happened not only in
   large cities, but in small rural municipalities as well. Based on the
   discourses, representations and practices of professionals in health and
   social services, this article is organised around two interrelated axes
   of analysis. First, we assess the extent of knowledge regarding public
   policies among professionals and LGBTQ+ people. And second, we examine
   the rural area as a specific setting for the application of LGBTQ+
   policies. This leads us to the conclusion that such legal changes are
   important but not sufficient in themselves to ensure the well-being of
   LGBTQ+ people. Moreover, LGBTQ+ policies need to consider local contexts
   and avoid transferring the rationale of the big city into rural
   environments.},

Abstract = {One third of Estonian residents identify Russian as their mother tongue,
   and despite having lived in Estonia for decades, many of them are not
   fluent in the Estonian language and choose to remain stateless rather
   than obtain Estonian citizenship by passing the state language exam.
   Ethnic segregation in Estonia continues to be a matter of bitter
   political debate, not least in the context of tensions with neighboring
   Russia and pressure from the EU to solve the problem. While a lot of
   state resources are being spent on what the Estonian-speaking public
   often perceives as vain attempts at integration of Russophones, several
   civil society initiatives have recently emerged to provide platforms for
   informal language socialization. In this article, I focus on the case
   study of the Keelegrupp (Language Group) which provides a venue for
   interaction between Estonian and Russian speakers, to analyze what makes
   this informal organization more successful at responding to the
   challenges of language-based segregation than professional, state-funded
   initiatives. Ethnographic documentation and analysis of this initiative
   is essential given that its experience and structure are highly
   applicable for and transferrable to many other states with similar
   situations of ethnic segregation, not the least the neighboring Baltic
   countries.},

Abstract = {Migrants are an easy, visible Other, seeming to fall neatly into the
   us-versus-them framework of nationalism. Nevertheless, much of the
   scholarly approach to migrant identity, with the partial exception of a
   largely separate literature on citizenship, has eschewed overt ties to
   nationalism studies. When us- versus-them language is used in relation
   to nationalism, the focus or nodal point is the identity of the
   seemingly homogenous ``us{''} of the nation. However, when migrants are
   othered, the focus is not always the nation, and while othering migrants
   always creates exclusion, it is not always exclusion from a nation or
   identity group. This state of the field article analyzes the literature
   on populism, securitization, biopolitics, and other critical scholarship
   related to the issue of othering migrants. In each of these bodies of
   work, different sets of ``us{''} are set against migrants, some of which
   evoke identity and others of which do not, elucidating the links (or the
   lack thereof) of each approach to the study of nationalism. In each of
   these frameworks, the migrant Other comes up against a different frame
   of reference, leaving migrants themselves (or any sense of migrant
   identity) somewhat lost amid the analytical frameworks, at continual
   risk of being re-othered as victims of circumstance without agency.},

Abstract = {Due to the political corruption and state capture of the ruling elite,
   as well as U.S. policies in the early years of occupation, post-Saddam
   political order has failed to produce a polity based on social justice,
   citizenship and a functioning democracy. The youth-led October uprising
   of 2019 has shaken the system to its core but is facing daunting
   challenges in committing the elites to real reforms or changing the
   regime. The system is decaying but the kleptocracy is resilient. Should
   the ruling elite refuse to redistribute wealth and power, the political
   order will collapse completely.},

Abstract = {This study examines the practice of ethnic communities in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina flying a state, entity, religious, or foreign flag at
   wedding ceremonies in public spaces. The wedding custom is analyzed
   through the lens of Hannah Arendt's discussion of the way nationalism in
   the modern era links family and state. After a tragic war, flag power in
   this context appears to exacerbate nationalism and ethnic tensions in a
   polyethnic society trapped in a dysfunctional state structure created by
   the Dayton Accords. The empirical study finds that flag power does not,
   in fact, privilege ethnic solidarity over national solidarity to the
   degree that social and political theory would have us imagine. The
   national identity of being Bosnian is more likely to be exemplified. A
   clustered, stratified, random sample of 2,500 subjects over the age of
   eighteen was drawn from the country's population, including the two
   entities, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska and
   Brcko District. Survey questions involving face-to-face structured
   questions asked participants whether flags were flown at their weddings,
   which flags were flown, and attitudes toward the wedding custom.
   Variations by age, religiosity, education, ethnicity, type of flag
   flown, and political party affiliation are reported and interpreted.},

Abstract = {Local turnout has declined in many European countries, posing challenges
   to the inclusiveness and representativeness of elections. One response
   proposed to address this challenge are franchise extensions to new
   groups of voters. Distinguishing between horizontal extensions to
   non-national EU-citizens and vertical extension to 16- to 18-year-olds,
   we analyse their effects on voter turnout in the context of German local
   council elections. The country's federal system enables us to analyse
   the effects on voter turnout in 13 states from 1978 until 2019. We find
   that the horizontal franchise extension is associated with a subsequent
   drop in overall turnout at German local council elections. By contrast,
   vertical franchise extensions do not affect turnout. The findings temper
   expectations concerning the ability of local franchise extensions to
   boost democratic legitimacy via increased participation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the social and political effects produced by the
   most recent wave of emigration in postwar Bosnia, widely understood to
   be the result of continued political instability and economic decline
   that followed the 1992-95 war. Drawing on ethnographic research in a
   deindustrialized Bosnian town and analysis of popular discourses seeking
   to make sense of this new wave of departures, I show how the phenomenon
   of postwar exit impacts those staying behind and inspires new forms of
   reflection that link past histories of violence to more recent forms of
   dispossession. The emergence of such forms of historical consciousness
   reveals that postwar migration is haunted both by the memory of wartime
   expulsions and ethnic cleansing, as well as by the often-unacknowledged
   violence of postwar economic restructuring glossed as the postsocialist
   transition. In asking what happens to nationalist regimes, as well as
   scholarship on nationalist politics, when the ``people{''} leave, I
   demonstrate the need to analyze the ongoing outmigration both in terms
   of Bosnia's historical specificity and global political-economic
   dynamics. In so doing, I show how absences created by these departures
   create new vantage points that bring to light and expose unsettling
   political configurations left behind by the Bosnian war.},

Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JUN 4},
Abstract = {Deploying a transnational approach, the article follows the explanatory
   framework of diffusion theories in aiming to provide a new perspective
   on the rise of national-populist actors across different sociopolitical
   and national-historical settings, in the context of ever-increasing
   interdependence and transfers of ideas. Thus, it focuses on reconceiving
   national-populist units not as evolving detached from one another, but
   rather influencing and providing discursive frames for each other, even
   in the context of non-institutionalized, indirect connections. For
   demonstrating the theoretical claims about diffusing ideas and
   transnational modes of borrowing in the European context, the article
   discusses the evolution of national-populist discourses in
   post-communist Georgia through an example of the emergence and
   exclusionary agenda of a social movement, ``Georgian March.{''} Locating
   the case within diffusion models, the analysis scrutinizes discursive
   strategies and incorporation of ``the West{''} in the movement's
   discourse over the process of its collective identity construction.
   Thus, the article focuses on mediated experiences as providing models
   for certain behaviors; new roles and uses of social media as direct
   political platforms and channels for diffusions and borrowings; the
   factor of mutual references as tools for self-legitimization and mutual
   identification; and the relevance of borrowings and emulation among
   national-populist actors.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to critically explore how citizen dialogues are
   perceived by the municipalities and public servants who implement them.
   The question is answered using a multi-method approach: a content
   analysis of 213 self-reports on citizen dialogues from Swedish
   municipalities and 11 in-depth interviews with public servants working
   with citizen dialogues in a Swedish municipality. The findings show that
   citizen dialogues were thought of along three main narratives:
   information gathering, informing, and inclusion. Together, these
   narratives indicated a will to enhance informed decision-making.
   However, combining informed decision-making is with broad participation
   poses challenges; the authority had to delimit participation, establish
   structures, educate, define citizens and adapt existing working methods
   to external stakeholders. The three narratives address this adaptation.},

Abstract = {Using a sample composed of the 298 Honduran municipalities for the
   period 2006-2014, we evaluate the impact of budgetary, political and
   socioeconomic factors on the probability of mayors' re-election. The
   findings show that mayors who have initiated greater municipal spending
   are more likely to be re-elected (a \$100 increase in real per capita
   expenditure increases re-election chances by 19.01\%). This finding
   partially supports both public choice theory and the theory of political
   budget cycles: voters prefer increased spending. Furthermore, mayors
   with greater transfers from higher levels of government have more chance
   of being re-elected. When it comes to political factors, progressive
   parties and mayors with a majority have more chance of being re-elected.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the topic of cities' trajectories of participation
   in Transnational City Networks on migration-related issues to identify
   factors and mechanisms of mobilisation. We present the results of a
   qualitative study on Turin (Italy) and Saint-Etienne (France). Both
   cities started to mobilise internationally in the 1990s on the
   initiative of entrepreneurial mayors, yet throughout the 2000s took
   opposite paths: in Turin, intense participation until 2014 was followed
   by partial dis-involvement and renewed activism since 2018;
   Saint-Etienne started to distance itself in 2008 and has not actively
   participated since then. We show how in the case of Turin,
   internationalisation has been driven by networks' professionals engaging
   their personal relations in boundary-spanning work, establishing
   connections between public and non-public actors and between the local
   and international spheres. Such dynamics are absent in the case of
   Saint-Etienne, where mobilisation on migration has always been
   mayors-centred.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {728-748},

Abstract = {Extant research explains why municipalities choose certain service
   delivery modes over others, but that research is mostly static and pays
   little attention to the impact of central governmental policy. This
   study aims to overcome these limitations by employing a longitudinal
   multiple-case study design and bringing in new institutional theory.
   This research uncovers and explains delivery modes used for household
   waste collection in nine Flemish municipalities from the 1960s onwards.
   It builds on well-known public choice and transaction cost motives on
   alternative delivery modes, but expands the set by looking at coercive
   isomorphism for additional explanatory power. The analysis reveals that,
   in addition to the importance of fiscal and economic efficiency motives,
   the choices made by the municipalities over time are profoundly
   influenced by (the evolution of) coercive pressures from the central
   government on the service characteristics.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies have transformed our corporality and relationship
   to the world, impacting our subjectivities and installing new problems
   and challenges. Higher Education professors, we have been forced to
   rethink and renew traditional pedagogical methodologies or teaching
   methods. This chapter presents some ideas regarding or around this
   problem contextualised in the COVID-19 global health crisis. Supported
   by notions proposed by the Affective Turn framework, it analyses virtual
   educational experiences in relation to the lockdown from a perspective
   of the body, its interaction (human and non-human) and affects. In turn,
   then we discuss urgencies and pedagogical possibilities for the visual
   arts, a field that, due to its material and sensory dimensions, is based
   on embodied learning. We conclude, by way of clothing and by reflecting
   on the role of devices and propose a materiality of technology in
   education, in relation to the current context of mediated learning
   which, becau se of the pandemic, is installing today with unprecedented
   speed.},

Abstract = {The people of Mesopotamia are an ancient people who have experienced
   prosperity and poverty, authority and subjection, civilization and
   barbarism all together. The British, who won the first World War, were
   responsible for creating a new Iraq with many structural deficiencies.
   This inevitably led to structurally driven political, social and
   economic violence, which still entangles the people of Iraq. Arabs,
   Kurds, and other ethnoreligious minorities could not find a recipe that
   would glue all of Iraq together ever since {[}1]. The aspiration of
   Iraq's ruler was always beyond the boundaries of the country, beyond
   nationalism. Over all previous centuries, it is hard to find a genuine
   nationalist who ruled Iraq with a sole focus on Iraqi's wellbeing. They
   rather had supra-nationalist aspirations such as Arabism, Socialism, and
   currently Shi'ism {[}2]. This chapter tries to pinpoint the structural
   maladies of Iraq. Some have been created by external forces, inasmuch as
   Iraq has been the major arena for the bitter rivalry between the United
   States and Iran. However, this paper argues that main cause of the
   failing of Iraq as a state is manufactured by Iraqis themselves. This
   study uses an inside-out look at Iraq's never-ending cycle of violence
   and distrust between the newly so-called ``rivals{''} and the new
   ``establishment.{''} It ultimately presents a set of recommendations
   pointing the way to alleviate the prolonged instability in the country.},

Abstract = {The teaching of mathematics is a complex phenomenon by nature and one
   that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased. Classes' features or the
   characteristics of classes held in confinement and the curricular
   prioritization carried out by the Ministry of Education, make necessary
   tools that allow evaluating teaching during this time, to improve,
   strengthen the learning of students. Through a review of the dimensions
   that characterize the quality of mathematics teaching, we identified
   four common elements (math used in class, goals, classes, and
   assessment). The description of these elements through questions is an
   input to evaluate the mathematics classes carried out in this very
   particular academic year. We conclude that the characteristics of the
   Chilean educational system make it necessary for the evaluation of
   mathematics classes to also be carried out from the perspective of how
   the educational system itself provided the conditions for teachers to
   carry out the quality teaching.},

Abstract = {Size effects such as economies of scale and economies of scope can be
   utilised to achieve cost savings in local government systems. Numerous
   municipal reform policies in Australia and elsewhere have historically
   been premised on size effects. In this paper, we investigate whether an
   interaction effect exists between scale economies and scope economies in
   New South Wales local government using a 2011 sample of local councils.
   We estimate the effects of scale and specialisation on efficiency by way
   of a multiple regression, using a novel approach to measure
   specialisation. We find empirical evidence that indicates economies of
   scale and economies of scope are both likely to be present across a
   broad range of scales. However, we find no evidence of any interaction
   effect between scale and scope economies.},

Abstract = {The Abkhaz State University (ASU) is internationally isolated, despite
   its cooperation with universities in Russia. Georgia combines its
   refusal to recognize Abkhaz statehood with a policy of nonrecognition of
   its university, which sets the direction for other countries. But the
   Abkhaz policies of nonrecognition are also to be taken into account.
   Abkhazia opposes any form of internationalization of the ASU generating
   closer ties with Georgia. The article examines how the Georgian and
   Abkhaz policies of nonrecognition hamper the internationalization of the
   ASU within the European educational space. It explores a conflict on
   recognition and nonrecognition of status and identity, where status does
   not refer exclusively to statehood. In the field of higher education,
   European integration involves a large number of state and nonstate
   actors in 49 countries and a wide variety of forms of recognition and
   nonrecognition, ranging from the certification of individual
   qualifications and the publication of lists of unrecognized
   universities, to the setting up of joint educational programs. This
   integration process is largely state driven but based on the principle
   of the institutional autonomy of universities. Using the ASU as a case
   study, the way that policies on nonrecognition affect status in the
   field of higher education is examined.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the project Sacred Geography of Kazakhstan,
   launched in 2017 in Kazakhstan as part of the nationwide program Ruqani
   Zhangyru (Modernization of Spirituality). The officially stated goal of
   the project is to cultivate a sense of patriotism in the country's
   residents related to places and geographic sites that are important for
   the historical memory of independent Kazakhstan. The authors assume that
   the real goal of the project is national territorialization, or recoding
   of the semantics of space, by selecting, codifying, and articulating
   some symbols and practices, while leveling and ``forgetting{''} others.
   The analysis, which is based on expert interviews and official
   documents, shows that this postcolonial process fits into the tendency
   toward ethnonationalization of Kazakhstan, in which discourse on the
   civil nation continues to be reproduced at the official level, while
   real activity is more focused on reinforcing the idea of Kazakhstan as
   the state of the Kazakh nation. The institutionalization of organizing
   and recoding the sacred landscape involves a wide variety of groups and
   actors. These factors may explain the success of the project in
   comparison to other projects being implemented under the Ruciani
   Zhangyru program.},

Abstract = {Fiscal transparency is widely promoted as an effective means to achieve
   government accountability. Although scholars have explored various
   drivers of fiscal transparency, the relationship between a government's
   financial condition and fiscal transparency has received less attention.
   This study explores this relationship based on signalling,
   blame-avoidance, and resource hypotheses. Presuming that following the
   best practices in financial reporting leads to a higher degree of fiscal
   transparency, this study examines how a local government's financial
   condition is associated with the probability of having a certification
   that represents the quality of financial reporting. Using a sample of
   municipalities in California from 2003 to 2015, we find that
   municipalities with a higher debt level and a lower fund balance ratio
   are more likely to pursue fiscal transparency in financial reporting.},

Abstract = {Irish Travellers are a traditionally nomadic ethnic minority indigenous
   to Ireland. Although recognized as an ethnic minority in adjacent
   jurisdictions, the Irish state persistently and explicitly denied
   recognizing Travellers' separate ethnicity and pursued assimilationist
   policies designed to eradicate Travellers' differences. However, in the
   late 1980s and 1990s, the state recognized the structural disadvantage
   and social stigma to which Travellers are subjected, naming them as a
   protected group in equality legislation, as well as laws addressing
   incitement to hatred. Through these interventions, the state afforded
   Travellers rights on the basis of their collective identity as
   Travellers, while continuing to deny their ethnicity. After sustained
   campaigning, Traveller ethnicity was recognized by the prime minister of
   Ireland in 2017. This article explores the reasoning behind, and legal
   significance of, that statement of recognition in Ireland.(1) We outline
   the evidence in support of ethnic recognition as a prelude to addressing
   the question of whether recognition is likely to afford the community
   any additional rights. We conclude that this is unlikely given the
   protections afforded to the group prior to ethnic recognition, though we
   argue that recognition may give the community a firmer basis for arguing
   for the activation of these preexisting rights.},

Abstract = {Fear is dangerous because of its tendency to cause our instincts to
   overrule our ability to think; get us to behave against our
   self-interests; make us more easily exploited by politicians,
   terrorists, and others with harmful intentions; create enemies; and feed
   on itself in a vicious downward spiral. The problem is worsened by
   irresponsible media, politicians who exploit fear by distorting facts
   about threats to security, social networks that spread hatred and
   misinformation on the Internet, and cyberattacks. This paper describes
   these forces and argues that the vicious cycle of fear and the
   exploitation of fear can be broken by electing responsible leaders,
   using fear management programs at the national and state levels,
   applying lessons learned from community policing programs to reduce fear
   at the local level, and by instituting stronger sanctions against
   Internet abuse, including defenses against cyberattacks.},

Abstract = {The collapse of the Soviet Union set Russia's ruling elites the
   challenge of nation-building: while ``Russians{''} had to be imagined as
   a political community on behalf of which the newly established Russian
   state was ruled, their national history needed to be narrated. Crucial
   for this enterprise was interpreting the Soviet past. Although the
   latter was used for political purposes by both Boris Yeltsin (who
   attempted to break with it) and Vladimir Putin (who established
   continuity with it), a politically usable interpretation of the Russian
   Revolutions was never found. Such is the consensus that emerged in 2017.
   Challenging this consensus, I argue that a specific interpretation of
   the Revolutions-nested within a narrative that covers Russia's history
   from Kievan Rus to the contemporary Russian Federation-has been
   developed in Russia. Turning Russia's politically problematic past into
   a politically usable one, this interpretation is (re)produced through
   the project Russia-My History. As Russia-My History (initially developed
   within the Russian Orthodox Church) is becoming a part of
   state-sponsored efforts to forge an ``official{''} vision of Russian
   history, the interpretation of the Revolutions (re)produced through it
   is growing in influence in present-day Russia.},

Abstract = {This article studies the difference in the government response to
   COVID-19 in Norway and Sweden drawing upon theories of agenda setting,
   crisis management and multi-level governance. Despite having virtually
   identical systems of government and, initially, facing similar infection
   threats, Sweden opted for far less strict countermeasures than Norway.
   While Norway's government response was similar to that of many European
   countries, Sweden received international attention for choosing
   befuddlingly soft measures, mostly recommendations and guidelines. This
   divergence is discussed vis-a-vis the multiple streams lens of agenda
   setting theory, highlighting differences in institutional and
   organisational legacies (e.g., the autonomy of government agencies) and
   intergovernmental relations (e.g., whether infectious disease expertise
   and authority is located at the local level).},

Abstract = {For more than six years, Ukrainian society has been constantly searching
   for ideas as to how to write a new ``national biography.{''} In a
   society divided by armed conflict, the so-called decommunization process
   is considered to be an idea capable of uniting a nation. This process
   started back in 2015, with the passing of a specific law that required
   not only the deconstruction of Soviet-time monuments in public spaces,
   but also a huge decommunization of place names. The article will explore
   the main practices of place (re-)naming during the different stages of
   the decommunization (but not de-ideologization) of spaces, as well as
   describing the problems that may emerge in society as a result of a
   rapid transition from one narrative to another. Based on a case study of
   spatial identities of internally displaced people, I am going to answer
   the question of how people perceive renamed spaces, and how they reclaim
   and re-appropriate these spaces in the midst of an identity crisis.},

Abstract = {The age structure of asociety has long been ahot topic in public
   administration, including in local government, where such discussion
   should, at the most obvious level, promote policies related to active
   ageing and the protection of the elderly. Ageing is asignificant issue
   in Portugal, putting pressure on local and central governments. Whether
   the population's aging is adeterminant of local government's overall
   performance is aquestion that finds few answers in the literature. Our
   results suggest that there is only atenuous relationship between ageing
   and some dimensions of council performance, particularly socio-economic
   development and financial sustainability. In life as awhole, ageing is
   seen as detrimental to performance; but it explains no more than atenth
   of the variance in councils' performance. Thus, individual councils may
   provide services efficiently regardless of the age structure of their
   communities. There are far more important dimensions for explaining
   performance by local government than ageing.},

Abstract = {On September 12, 2020, the Afghan peace talks begin between the Taliban
   and the Afghan government in Doha-Qatar to end the 19 years of war. This
   significant diplomatic effort was only possible when in February 29,
   2020, the United States and the Taliban reached an ``historic
   agreement{''} in the presence of the international community in
   Doha-Qatar committing all U.S. troops to lave Afghanistan in 14 months
   in return the Taliban will cut ties with al-Qaida and make peace. {[}1,
   p. 1.]It was set to pave the way for intra-Afghan dialogues-a much
   needed move toward peace. Afghanistan has been entrenched in a 40-year
   civil war that has consequently created the conditions for the country
   to be considered a base for terrorist operations, ravaged by war and
   conflict for centuries by empires and militia groups in the name of
   power, religion and ideologies. It has seen foreign invasions, civil
   wars and has been turned into a theatre of conflict where the power
   struggle between hostile foreign countries transpired. It became the
   heart of the Mujahideen, the Taliban and the al-Qaeda's operational
   bases and subsequently the United States intervention after the
   September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and has remained engaged in its
   longest war as part of the ongoing ``War on Terror{''} {[}2, p. 1].
   While the US is pulling troops out and the Afghans are making peace,
   there is a potential threat, the rise of the Islamic State of Khorasan
   IS-K in Afghanistan. It is at this point that overall lessons gained
   from ground and first-hand experience can be applied to addressing the
   security issues that plague Afghanistan. Overall, there is a strong
   drive for peace amongst contemporary Afghans. They believe that
   negotiations and political settlement are in the nation's best
   interests.},

Abstract = {Popular publications produced in Russia on the events in the Balkans in
   1877-78 offer a valuable opportunity to examine how the historical and
   political background of the Russo-Turkish War was conveyed to common
   readers, some of whom were potentially involved in the military action,
   or persuaded to support the cause by other means. The conceptions
   produced and distributed in these booklets were firmly based on
   pan-Slavistic ideas of Russians' duty to help their ``Slavic
   brothers.{''} The publications presented the reader with propagandistic
   images of Turkish enemies, which were compared to Islamic enemies of the

Abstract = {Cities are increasingly important actors in the field of migration and
   integration policy, both in terms of the design and implementation of
   policy and via cities participation in larger international networks. In
   this text I will explore how one such network, the Council of Europe's
   Intercultural Cities programme(ICC), has evolved over its ten year
   history, not only in terms of membership and geographical coverage, but
   also in terms of its attempts to respond to changes in global political
   sensibilities. The analysis presented her attempts to understand how the
   participation of cities in international networks can have an impact on
   local dynamics of governance and on public policy. The analysis of
   city-based inclusion networks makes it possible to see not only the
   shifting dynamics of power between cities and states, but also the
   impact of international networks on cities' abilities to mobilise
   locally or subnationally.},

Abstract = {Chinese governments have already applied pilot innovations widely with
   the aim of resolving various wicked problems efficiently, effectively
   and legitimately. Through an in-depth study on a pilot healthcare
   innovation in Sanming city, we identify a three-stage mechanism
   underlying its upscaling: its success in one setting, its horizontal
   upscaling in other settings, and its political upscaling nationwide.
   Moreover, we identify five conditions combined that are important in
   explaining its political upscaling: the support of central government,
   the knowledge transfer mechanism, the pilot's salience, the involvement
   of a boundary spanner, and consistent institutional frameworks.
   Furthermore, we propose a state-led pilot innovation upscaling model;
   this implies that Chinese central government plays a deterministic role
   in achieving the upscaling of pilot innovations. Our study helps to
   elucidate mechanisms underlying the upscaling of pilot innovations in
   the Chinese governance context.},

Abstract = {This article traces debates and policies of the Russian imperial
   administrators toward the Korean population in the Far Eastern provinces
   of the Russian Empire. Koreans were initially treated as de facto
   members of the peasant estate, and in the 1890s many were granted the
   status of Russian subjects. Yet the rise of settler colonialism and a
   nationalizing empire from the 1880s, and especially after the Russian
   revolution of 1905, complicated the issue of Korean subjecthood and led
   to policies that excluded Koreans from the regulations normally
   applicable to peasants, such as the right to increased land allotments.
   At the same time, the neotraditionalist approach to the management of
   difference in the empire was still present in the 1910s, albeit never
   clearly articulated to compete with the nationalizing idiom.},

Abstract = {The article explores the idea of Ukraine in the imagination of the
   Little Russian politicians during the revolutionary period of 1917-1919.
   It chiefly focuses on figures of the Little Russian movement, such as
   Vasiliy Shulgin (1878-1976), Anatoliy Savenko (1874-1922), Andrey
   Storozhenko (1857-1926), Aleksandr Bilimovich (1876-1963), and others.
   This article explores the ideas of the Little Russians regarding the
   term Ukraine and their views concerning the Ukrainian people and its
   ethnographic and historical boundaries. It argues that Ukraine and
   Ukrainians were perceived as a Little Russia, Southern Russia, Southern
   Rus', and Little Russians accordingly. By their assessment, Ukraine had
   not included the Taurida (the New Russia region) and the Crimea, but had
   included Eastern Galicia and Volhynia.},

Abstract = {The Czech Republic and Slovakia rank among the extremely fragmented
   European countries in terms of their local government structure. In
   addition to local governments, regional governments were established in
   both countries in connection with EU accession, which means that policy
   making is framed at three levels in both countries. If it applies that
   more centralised structures are, generally, easier to coordinate in
   crisis situations, then these two decentralised post-communist countries
   offer a great laboratory for examining how this unexpected pandemic
   crisis that has affected all socio-political and economic levels and
   structures has been handled in a very fragmented environment. We intend
   to examine the behaviour of individual levels of government, measures
   adopted by the governments and their expected and unexpected impacts
   during the first wave of a pandemic crisis with a special focus on
   possible changes in the systems of multi-level governance.},

Abstract = {This article explores collective identity frames and discursive
   strategies employed by social movement actors mobilizing in ethnically
   divided societies, a context where ethnicity constitutes the primary
   collective category of identification. By using Bosnia and Herzegovina
   as a case study, it analyzes movement framing in three waves of social
   protests that occurred in the country in the last decade. Specifically,
   it investigates the diverse ways in which movement leaders tackled
   ethnicity in their discourses. The article shows that movement leaders'
   narratives rested, respectively, on the primacy of human and citizenship
   rights, a common feeling of deprivation, and victimhood. Their approach
   toward ethnicity, however, differed in each wave. Ethnicity was openly
   rejected in 2013, avoided and not openly contested in 2014, and accepted
   and approached as an opportunity to bring further support to the
   movement in 2018. The article highlights that ethnicity can be tackled
   differently by social movement actors mobilizing on nonethnic grounds in
   divided societies, and that it might constitute a vantage point for
   social mobilization rather than a drawback, contributing to raising
   transversal solidarity.},

Abstract = {Yugoslavia's military internationalism was one of the most practical
   expressions of the country's policy of nonalignment. Beginning with
   Algeria in the 1950s until its demise in the 1990s, Yugoslavia was an
   ardent supporter of liberation movements and revolutionary governments
   in Africa and Asia. This article argues that Yugoslav military
   internationalism was at the heart of Yugoslavia's efforts to reshape the
   post-1945 global order and represented an extension of Yugoslav
   revolution abroad. Military aid was an expression of personal
   identification of Yugoslavia's ``greatest generation{''} with
   decolonization struggle. However, Yugoslav military aid to other
   countries went beyond a single foreign policy issue. Yugoslav military
   internationalism touched upon many other issues that included problems
   related to finances, economic development, the acquisition and transfer
   of military technology, relations with the superpowers, national
   security, ideology and politics, and prestige and status in global
   affairs. By the end of the 1970s, with the departure of the World War II
   generation and the looming economic crisis, Yugoslav military
   involvement in the Global South became increasingly driven by economic
   reasons. Former Yugoslav republics, after a short hiatus in the 1990s
   during the wars for Yugoslavia's succession, are still present in the
   arms trade in the Global South.},

Abstract = {Local government in England has experienced significant financial
   volatility in recent years due to cuts in central government funding and
   increased demand for service provision. Using a panel data set of
   English local governments over the period 2005-2016, this study
   investigates the impact of demographic factors on the financial reserves
   held by different types of English local governments. Dissimilar effects
   are traced on local governments' saving capability of different grant
   funding mechanisms and whether local governments are involved in social
   care provision, and how they provide these services. Findings show that
   local governments actively act upon financial uncertainty by expanding
   their reserves through implementing changes in both their income and

Abstract = {This article explains how the Turkish nation's composition has changed
   under Justice and Development Party rule. Turkish nationalism and
   Turkish national identity have dramatically changed since 2010, when the
   Kurdish Opening process was started by former prime minister Recep
   Tayyip Erdogan. The Syrian refugee crisis and the influx of Syrian
   refugees into Turkey created another change in Turkish national
   identity. Increasing religiosity in Turkey and the use of Islam by the
   Justice and Development Party created a flexible nation, where all Sunni
   Muslims can be considered members even though they are not ethnically
   Turkish. The author uses primary sources, such as President Recep Tayyip
   Erdogan's speeches since 2010, to show how his discourse became more
   embracing of non-Turkish Muslim groups and created a dynastic
   understanding of nationalism based on religion rather than the idea of
   an ethnically homogenous, secular Turkish nation.},

Abstract = {This article examines how self-managed faculties in socialist Yugoslavia
   adopted market mechanisms in the 1970s and 1980s to attract
   international students and thus contributed to a commercialization of
   higher education. In the 1950s, Yugoslavia became a destination for
   students from postcolonial states because of its nonaligned politics.
   While Yugoslav officials first emphasized aid to students through
   scholarships, this article argues that projects based on profit seeking
   began to dominate thinking about aid in the late 1960s. Using archival
   records in Croatia and Serbia as well as UNESCO and World Bank reports,
   this article shows how domestic and international factors influenced
   these changes. Domestically, decentralizing political reforms and
   decreased funding for higher education allowed republic policy makers to
   disconnect technical aid from political priorities and to pursue
   self-financing international students. Detached from centralized policy
   making, Yugoslav university and republic leaderships, primarily in SR
   Croatia and SR Serbia, chose the immediate profits of international
   students over long-term investments in scholarship students.
   Internationally, reforms promoted by UNESCO and the World Bank shifted
   aid away from university training abroad to vocational training in situ.
   These new policies complemented an emerging international division of
   labor suited more to the economic interests of OECD states and
   multinational corporations than developing states.},

Abstract = {Previous research has either equated religion- and language-based group
   identities or asserted that their social effects are the same. This
   article proposes a novel differentiation between religious and ethnic
   self-identification that accounts for in-group income inequality and the
   social role of the group. The study argues that ethnicity-based
   identities tend to be associated with economic activities, thereby
   increasing the demand for income equality within such groups. Religious
   identities, on the contrary, are centered around noneconomic activities
   and have the ideological framework for reconciling material
   inequalities. The observable implication of this distinction is that the
   high-, low-, and middle-income categories of the multicultural society
   will display differential association with ethnic and religious
   identities. Ethnic groups will have lower in-group income inequality as
   a result of the exclusion of the poor and the departure of the rich.
   Religious groups, on the contrary, will have higher in-group income
   inequality due to the capacity of religion to accommodate both poor and
   rich. Relevant empirical tests from the ethnically and religiously
   diverse Russian North Caucasus region indicate support for the proposed
   theory.},

Abstract = {Over the last 15 years, the literature on the impact of both the Iraq
   war and the September 11 terror attacks on the behavior of states and
   terrorist organizations has grown immensely. Despite this attention,
   there has been little research on how the invasion of Iraq impacted
   violent non-state actors (VNSAs), and particularly insurgent
   organizations killing of civilians and security personnel.
   Differentiating between the killing of police/military personnel and
   civilians is of key theoretical and policy importance, particularly if
   there are differences between the two in terms of insurgent behavior
   before and during the Iraq war. In this paper, we use the Big Allied and
   Dangerous Insurgency (BAADI) dataset to examine what factors impact the
   killing of police/military personnel and civilians by insurgent
   organizations between 1998 and 2012. We argue that before the invasion
   of Iraq, social and political factors influenced organizational
   lethality. During the Iraq war, however, we argue that this relationship
   changed because the United States and the West changed their policies
   and invested enormously in global resources to fighting non-state
   actors. Given this, the organizational factor that will determine an
   organization's lethality would simply be the organization's
   capability-captured most effectively by its size. Our analysis provides
   support for this argument.},

Abstract = {The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has been unprecedentedly
   effective in recruiting foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). While Turkey
   has been a transit country and a major hub for ISIS's logistical and
   human resources, it also has become a prolific hotbed for its
   recruitment. Based on face-to-face interviews and open-source reports,
   this paper provides an in-depth assessment of ISIS's recruitment
   structure and the challenges that Turkey faces in relation to ISIS's
   activities and FTFs. We conclude with a set of recommendations and a
   roadmap for pursuing effective and sustainable policies against ISIS.
   Overall, Turkey should adopt a paradigm shift on counterterrorism,
   transform the security and intelligence apparatus, and develop
   rehabilitation programs that consider the specificity of individuals'
   radicalization at different levels.},

Abstract = {The last century of the Ottoman state's existence witnessed the
   transformation of the term ``Ottoman{''} from an elite, class-based, and
   exclusive designation to one including and identifying all whose
   allegiances were tied to the state. Despite this semantic shift, the
   verdict is still out on the question of late-Ottoman inclusivity.
   Indeed, exclusivist is a term more frequently coupled with policy and
   law. Though the former can be considered exclusivist in many instances
   from the late 19th century through the dissolution of the empire, the
   designation does not fit the legal framework and terminology that
   articulated belonging. To recognize this, it is imperative to approach
   the 1869 Ottoman Nationality Law from a comparative perspective,
   especially, though not strictly, with reference to Great Power laws,
   since these legalities are the yardstick by which Ottoman rational
   modernity has been measured. This article considers access to actual and
   potential membership in various nationality laws in relation to their
   Ottoman counterpart and concludes that the exclusivist designation is
   questionable. Instead, Ottoman law does not present an anomaly and was
   in many instances both more expansive and more inclusive than
   others-even if it has been subjected to a different vocabulary than
   contemporaneous laws with similar stipulations.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to shed light on the process of
   nation-building and the formation of national identity in post-Soviet
   Azerbaijan. The peculiarity of Azerbaijani nation-building is that the
   debates on how to build a nation and define national identity were
   nourished by two discourses: Azerbaijanism (Azerbaycanciliq) and Turkism
   (Turkuluc). The article focuses firstly on the discourses on national
   identity and nation-building in the pre-independence period while
   elaborating on the roots and premises of the nationalist independence
   movement. Secondly, it highlights the discourses of nation-building in
   the post-independence period while discussing the meanings attributed to
   national identity and nationhood. It shows how these two discourses
   shaped the existing identity formation in Azerbaijan with a particular
   emphasis on citizenship identity, marked by multiculturalism,
   hospitality, tolerance, and patriotism. Yet one can still categorize the
   country as having an incomplete nation-building process, due the
   violation of territorial integrity as a result of the Karabakh conflict.},

Abstract = {The present study sheds light on the under-researched relationship
   between social media content and citizens' engagement, as well as the
   impact of dialogic communication on citizens' engagement. To this end,
   Facebook content of the five largest Greek municipalities was examined.
   A six-dimensional typology of social media content posted by local
   governments on Facebook was proposed. The results suggest that dialogic
   posts and posts that trigger offline participatory activities exerted
   significant influence on all forms of citizens' online engagement. It is
   recommended that social media managers of local governments in Greece,
   as well as other countries with similar public administration styles and
   social media usage patterns, create dialogic loops with their citizenry
   by addressing users' questions and concerns through Facebook posts.
   Moreover, they could publish rich media content on Facebook in the form
   of videos and posts that mobilise citizens to participate in various
   offline activities (e.g., events, council meetings).},
